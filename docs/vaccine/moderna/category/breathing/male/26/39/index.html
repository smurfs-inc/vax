                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

Benadryl did not help and tongue started to swell. Called doctor and he prescribed Pepcid and Medtral dose pack. Throat still not 100 percent at time of report filing, but it is better than it is much better than before.  Vaccine also caused severe nausea and upset stomach.

                                                Received the first dose 12:30pm Thursday(2/11). Around 6pm that same night I notice the first symptom. I had a super strong headache that lasted the next 24 hours or so. Still lingering now but not as bad. Around 3am Friday (2/12) I woke up with chills and the inject spot was extremely tender. All day Friday I had signs of a fever. Chills and felt cold but body was hot to the touch. This lasted all day and it kept Me in bed the whole day.  Around 6pm Friday night, my injection spot was extremely sore , and there was a red circle, about the size of a gold ball around the spot. That?s also when I  noticed I had shortness of breath and was having a little difficulty breathing. Around 8pm I noticed I had really high anxiety that was abnormal. It went away in about 30 mins or so. I thought it was strange as I normally don?t have anxiety that bad. I went to sleep around 10pm and woke up at 5am itchy with a red rash/hives on the upper half of my body, mostly the neck and chest area. Also the red circle around the injection site grew to the size of a baseball. The headache is still there but not as bad . Maybe 2/10 Severeness. I feel better in terms of the fever and breathing today (2/13).  However the rash/hives has gotten worse and seems to be spreading slowly. I plan on taking Benadryl when I grab it from the store in 30 mins or so

I was having trouble controlling my breathing because of my abdomen constricting. I could sort of control my body to move into a laying position then a seated position, but the trembling continued throughout that movement. I remained conscious and the event lasted about 5 minutes.

                                                I received the shot and was told to sit in a chair and wait for 15 minutes. After about 5-10 minutes I began to feel faint/lightheaded/clammy. I do have a history of these from shots I have had in the past. I got the pharmacists attention and told her I was feeling faint and asked for some water. Once she left, breathing in my throat felt significantly constricted. I had a reaction to clear my throat a few times but that didn&#39;t not affect anything. The pharmacist came back with water and an ice pack that she held against my neck. During this episode I was able to drink water still. The severity of the breathing issue leveled off and eventually I was able to breathe normally again. The whole thing lasted 1-2 minutes. It felt longer thinking back on it but I don&#39;t think it lasted as long as my impression of the episode.  After that I felt tingling followed by shakiness in my extremities which was more typical of the fainting side effects ive had in the past. I&#39;ve never experienced breathing issues with other shots I&#39;ve received in the past. The pharmacist kept me there to monitor me for 30-45 minutes. No additional medication was administered

                                                Patient noted on form that he had a severe reaction to peanuts which causes him to have anaphylaxis.  He stated that he does carry an EpiPen and any time anything with peanuts touches his mouth/lips he immediately notices his throat starting to close.  He also is allergic to cats.  Before administering the vaccine, the patient noted that he does not like needles and was not going to look.  I administered the vaccine and the patient and I exited the vaccination room.  I explained that he should sit in the waiting area for about 30 minutes due to his severe allergic reaction in the past.  By the time that I walked back into the pharmacy, the patient&#39;s wife shouted &#34;He&#39;s not breathing!&#34;.  My technicians called 911 while I grabbed an EpiPen and rushed to the patient.  I immediately administered a 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine and observed that the patient had passed out, was not breathing, but had a pulse.  A few seconds later he regained consciousness and his breathing was erratic.  I gave him water and he stated that he felt very lightheaded and dizzy.  I instructed him to remain seated.  He also noted that his vision was blurry and he saw a black dot.  His wife was fanning him to cool him down while I tried to obtain the patient&#39;s blood pressure, but could not get a reading.  The paramedics came and evaluated him thoroughly.  His blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, and blood sugar were all within normal limits.  They determined that the syncope was most likely due to the patient not eating during the day and not liking needles.  The patient was feeling much better and declined further medical treatment, including going to the hospital.  He was instructed to go home and relax.

They immediately put me into a wheel chair but I wasn?t getting better until they laid me down in the stretcher. My lips turned blue and I think I was having an allergic reaction to the shot. It was hard for me to breathe before laying down on the stretcher my heart rate dropped and my blood pressure. It took me 30-40 min to come back to stand up and slowly walk out. My arm was super sore afterwards and I would have little shocking pain flashes in my chest. I felt tired and run down/ sensitive the rest of the night. The next day my arm was still super sore and I still feel very tired and run down.  The doctor on site took care of me and they put the stickers on me just in case they needed to revive me. I was sinking quickly but luckily when I laid down I got better.

                                                Roughly 15 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop muscle aches. Within 30 minutes of the aches, they became severe. Aches were primarily located in the lower back, shoulders, hips, and calves. 30 minutes following,  I started to feel very fatigued and had labored breathing. Another 1.5 later, I developed chills and had flu like symptoms. By the afternoon, I had broken into a fever and had mild nausea. Besides the muscle aches, as one symptom onset, the others seemed to fade away. By 5:00 in the evening, (roughly 25 hours after receipt of vaccine) the symptoms quickly subsided. The only residual side-effects within the rest of a 48 hour period were soreness in the area of the injection, and mild headache.

But then yesterday started to have similar symptoms, as well as chest pressure, hurts to breathe all the way in, feels a twinge feeling on the inside. Also noticed a muscular pain as well in the same area, hurts to move down the middle of his chest. Also having pain on the right side. Symptoms are persistent, will wax and wane slightly but doesn&#39;t go away completely. Feels better when he is standing if feels better, has not noticed food triggers, no difficulty eating or swallowing. A few weeks ago also started a higher fat intake diet. No fevers or chills, no diarrhea, no rash, no sore throat, no runny nose. No known muscular injury that he can think of.&#34; May 20, 2021-- &#34;Today is feeling some decrease in symptoms, but still feels like he needs to take deep breaths. Feels like &#34;something is erratic&#34; once in a while. Not feeling increased improvement. Laying down does seem to make it worse. One time he was leaning forward and then sitting up made it worse.&#34; May 26, 2021 -- &#34;he reports that he is still feeling some chest pain, but overall is feeling better, symptoms are up and down. Feels like a &#34;tiredness&#34; in the chest wall area. The most pain is from twisting. Not worsening with acidic or greasy foods. Feels like pain is mostly in the muscle now. No SOB at all with increased exertion.&#34;

After the first dose they started small and got bigger and more frequent after the second shot they have become smaller and a little less frequent but still occur. I should note that I used to have anxiety attacks 5 or so years ago just like this but have since stopped having attacks all together up until my first shot

CT pulmonary embolus protocol showed subsegmental pulmonary embolus with evidence of pulmonary infarcts for which the patient was started on an anticoagulant. An echocardiogram showed a mild to moderate decrease in LV systolic function with global hypokinesis.  Cardiac MRI findings were consistent with acute myopericarditis with underlying non-ischemic cardiomyopathy disproportionate to the degree of myocarditis. The patient was discharged on a beta-blocker.

                                                4 weeks following 2nd Moderna Vaccine, I started having symptomatic Bigeminal PVC&#39;s that lasted approximately 45 minutes. Symptoms included dizziness, near syncope, palpitations, and shortness of breath. After 2 ED visits, I was referred to a cardiologist who ran tests to include a Holter monitor, and echocardiogram. I followed up with a Cardiac Electrophysiology Doctor who prescribed Flecainide to control the PVC&#39;s. I have been on Flecainide since early March, which has controlled the PVC&#39;s to a tolerable level (roughly 100/day). Before the Flecainide use, I was having roughly 1,000 PVC&#39;s a day, and had multiple episodes of Bigeminy.

                                                Following administration of the vaccine, the patient and his wife were seated and I requested they remain seated for 15 min after because I had recently had someone with a fear of needles collapse after their shot, at which point I had already counseled on the things to expect afterward but the patient stopped responding and slumped over. I was unsure if he was breathing as his wife was cradling his head, so I shouted for a technician to call 911. I heard a sound that I perceived to be wheezing and administered an epipen at which point the patients limbs began to contract so I then suspected it was a seizure. We lowered the patient to the ground and shortly after he became responsive. He was able to state his name and date of birth and breathing was unlabored. Pulse ox was 98 and HR was 88 BPM before  EMS arrived. They examined the patient and determined it was &#34;anxiety induced response&#34; but also noted that the bloodpressure was &#34;very low&#34; which is consistent with anaphylaxis, but I did not examine the patient at that time. He was sent home afterward.

Followup cardiac MRI performed 7/6 corroborated echo findings (LVEF 52%) and showed patchy areas of subacute pericarditis and myocarditis inflammation with changes to tissue noticed.  Visited urgent care with pericardial chest pain 7/21, received indocin as short term replacement for nabumetone NSAID treatment.  Currently waiting on stress test scheduled for 9/16.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after being vaccinated with Moderna vaccine for his 2nd dose, the patient said his throat was closing up a little and itching and he felt nauseous. The patient was told to sit down and wait for 20 minutes after administration. The patient was walking around the pharmacy and talking. The covid ambassador reinteriated to the patient to sit back down. A few minutes after sitting down, he admitted he should have listened and proceeded to tell the pharmacist of his symptoms. The pharmacist clarified if his throat was closing up or was it itchy. The patient said it was a little itchy and a little difficult to breathe. The pharmacist gave the patient 25mg of liquid benadryl. The pharmacist continued to monitor the patient. The patient said he felt chills in his hands a few minutes later but he was no longer feeling nauseous. The patient did not claim to have any allergies on his form or any previous allergies he was aware of. The pharmacist followed up with the patient 5 minutes after his claim of chills. He said he can breathe better but still had the chills. The patient sat in the chair for approximately one hour while the pharmacist monitored him. He called a relative to come pick him up. He told the pharmacist his ride was there and he felt much better before leaving. The pharmacist told him to rest and monitor his symptoms. If the symptoms came back or got worse he needs to call 911 or go to the emergency room.

                                                I had complete loss of smell and taste November 26th and tested positive for Covid-19 on the 28th. At the time, it started as my smell and taste fading out. Day one of noticeable symptoms also included a slight fever at approximately 99.7 degrees, full body aches as if I&#39;d been in a car accident, chills, a headache, shortness of breath and fatigue. The fever and chills and body aches had gone away after only two days but the shortness of breath and fatigue persisted at least 3 weeks or late December.  By January, I was slowly having my smell and taste back to normal. Early in February, around Feb. 4th, after my first vaccine and approximately 5 days before my second one, my smell and taste became horribly distorted. It started with mint and toothpaste. It started tasting/smelling like mold with pottery clay. After about 2 or three days, almost all foods began tasting and smelling like it was musty, moldy and rotten. Like dead fish or expired meat.  I first noticed with food but now it&#39;s other things as well. Cleaning agents like disinfectant wipes smell the exact same as a jar of peanut butter which is a strong, musty, moldy smell.  A pot roast bought the day of at Kroger was cooked by my fiance and it smelled so rancid to me I almost vomitted. Almost everything smells and tastes horrible and it&#39;s been about two weeks. The only things that seem normal are bubblegum, fruity pebbles and most beverages although not all. Coffee has the same pungent smell.  I have has to switch my diet almost completely to yogurt, fruity pebbles and meal replacement shakes. Along with a multivitamin so I don&#39;t miss anything.

A few minutes after the vaccinations  pt started to develop a rash around his neck he also started complaining of shortness of breath . All these happened in a spun of about 5 minutes. He was offered assistance in the form of water but pt declined . Patient felt okay and rejected as calling 911 and also an epipen shot. He indicated that he hears those shots are crazy and flat out refused. He decided to have his wife drive him to the ER. I called later to check up on him but his wife  said he was fine and that they were almost at the ER. Will follow up tomorrow

The patient was offered EpiPen, he accepted and was administered one dose. The patient never lost consciousness and was responsive at all times. The patient was offered 911 services but he refused. After 20 mins of the EpiPen administration, he said he was feeling better without any symptoms and left the facility. I gave the patient instructions on what to do in case of anaphylaxis and he confirmed understanding. I gave him a call at 3:30 pm. He was doing well at home with no complaints. I once again advised him on what to do incase of emergency.

The first shot gave me a mild chills and pretty bad body pain, however, the second shot gave me a sore throat, nasal congestion, chest congestion,  wet cough, body pain, and shortness of breath. In order to tally out a second exposure to Coronavirus, I got tested twice and was negative. These adverse symptoms started 4 hours after the 2nd vaccine and are still the same intensity. I?m taking mucinex and anti histamines but nothing has been helping much. I?m on my 6th day now.

                                                Woke up at 3:00 AM Friday 5/24 having chest pain near my heart and issues breathing. I sat up on the corner of my bed feeling dizzy. Every time I would take anything more than a light breath, I would get a tight pain on the left side of my chest, which specifically felt like I had blockage in my heart. As I sat on the corner of my bed I tried to control my breathing and started to rub the area as I was taking breaths. The sharp pain in my chest while taking normal / deep breaths lasted for a few minutes and I feared I was having a heart attack. After going away initially that night, I felt the sensation  in a less intense fashion again later on Friday night and once more got a slight tight feeling in my chest while breathing on Saturday. During the initial episode on Friday night, I also got a deafened noise in my ears as if they had to pop as if I was gaining altitude in a plane or something. I got up off my bed to go to the bathroom and sat to urinate in case I was going to faint. The deafened noise went away after about a minute or so and turned into a static / fizzy noise for another minute or two while I was in the bathroom.  (The static fizz sounds got louder as I put my chin to my chest for some reason.) I was also sweating profusely throughout this entire process.

I also experienced the common fatigue. However, at 12:13a.m on May 25th, I was woken from sleeping to what can only be described as either the most severe case of the shakes that have ever been experienced, or convulsions. I was unable to move, speak, and could hardly breathe. The effects of this lasted well over an hour and a half. It was only after what I was experiencing stopped, that I suddenly became burning hot, but did not have a fever. 98.7° was what was read at the time I started to feel hot. Since then I have experienced severe joint and knuckle pain on my left hand, still bicep soreness, pain in my left forearm, again joint and knuckle pain in my left hand, and headaches.

It felt like I could only breath in for about a second and a half without a lot of strain or coughing. It is now 10:41 AM and I still have a heavy chest and shortness of breath but it is much more manageable than before. I still can&#39;t take a full breath, but I can breath in for about 5 seconds before it feels like something is blocking me from going further. No current pain.

There has been slight fever during the initial days but the weakness and mild headache is still there till today i.e. June 9 2021. I do experience a little shortness of breath and chest pain (on both sides) sometimes but that is not continuous and remains normal most of the time. I have got stomach infection and constipation too during these times and I have taken a pill of Prilosec upon prescription of doctor. Stomach looks good and bowel movement is fine as of now. I have been monitoring my blood pressure and body temp during these days and they all were normal.    Apart from that I experience chills more than anyone around me and don&#39;t know if that is related to vaccine effect.  Currently, my main concerns are - mild headache, weakness in body and dizziness which is happening for almost a month now.

On the night of May 20, I started feeling chest pains, difficulty breathing, and an elevated heart rate (around 100 bpm) in bed. These symptoms remained and I went to the emergency room around midnight. I did a chest xray and electrocardiogram and waited to see a doctor over the next few hours; ultimately the symptoms decreased in severity on their own.

                                                Patient is a 27 year old male with history of allergic rhinitis.  He moved to the area in April 2021 and had some initial problems with pollen allergies, but had improved and doing well with Singulair.  He had COVID19 in November 2020, recovered fairly quickly and did not have much in the way of breathing difficulties.  Last month he received both doses of Moderna COVID19 vaccination, second dose administered on 5/25/2021.  After his second dose, he has become progressively more ill.  He did have a fever up to 105F for 24 hours afterwards, but this resolved. He has gone to several urgent cares due to progressively worsening SOB, cough, and malaise.  Coworkers have commented to him that he is just not himself and is slow to get around.  He has gotten to the point he cannot take the trash out without having to stop to catch his breath.  He has been treated with a variety of regimens, including amoxicillin, doxycycline, inhalers, prednisone, and IM steroid shots.  He does get brief mild relief with albuterol inhaler.

                                                I had a stomach virus a week after receiving the vaccine, then the following week began to develop chest pain which progressed to include fatigue and shortness of breath. I lost tolerance to caffeine and alcohol, and the symptoms got worse. I ended up in the er on June 7th and tested positive for blood troponin. I was diagnosed with myopericarditis secondary to covid vaccine or a viral infection after further tests and an echocardiogram. I am receiving 600mg of ibuprofen three times per day along with  .6mg of colchinine twice a day for the next few months.

I took medication for the pain but the symptoms were lessened not for much, I remained in bed until 2:30 PM on Sunday 7th. I am still weakened, fatigued and with a slight shortness of breath, I am assuming by tomorrow I will be feeling better. No regrets whatsoever.

                                                On March 18th I experienced normal side effects (fatigue, body aches, chills, along with soreness of the injection site).  Starting on March 19th, I experienced mild shortness of breath for 3 days.  I checked my O2 sat throughout those 3 days and never dropped below 98%.  My wife experienced the same shortness of breath for the same period of time with a low of 97% on her O2 sat.  She received a Covid test on the last day of her symptoms and received a negative result.  Now, on March 25th I have developed a red, circular rash at the injection site (upper portion of left arm).  It is itchy, warm, and has a firm feel, roughly 2.5 inches in diameter with a slight, inward, crescent-shaped curve of the red patch on one side.

The warning signs before passing out was an extreme headache the likes of which I?ve never experienced before.  I was then taken to Hospital where I stayed getting fluids, blood drawn, and other test to figure out what cause the incident.   Since my time at the hospital my chest (heart area) is always in pain. I can barely make down one city block before running completely out of breathe.   Yes I am overweight! However the only time I ever became out of breath before was when exercising . Now I feel that shortness of breathe all the time even when relaxing on a chair.

                                                On May 11 2021, I went to the gym to workout my back muscles in after work (around 3pm). After completing a heavy set of rack pulls I got light headed. After removing the weight to put it away, I accidentally dropped 25 pounds weight which was abnormal because I lost grip while light headed. I tried to walk off the pain by walking to the other side of the gym and within the next 10 minutes my face started turning pale and my lips dark blue/purple. I was sitting down as I progressively grew more light headed and started blacking out. My brother called over several people to help me maintain consciousness and an employee noted my lip and face color, low pulse and high rate of breathing. I fainted for a couple minutes then took a sip of gatorade and bounced back. I felt like that was a near death experience. Possibly related to some heart issue. A few weeks after I got a physical checkup at my doctor&#39;s office and the bloodwork came back clean. I have nothing to show why this episode occurred and feel like I should have some heart tests as a follow up.  Before this incident I have been going to the gym without ever having experienced this kind of issue. What was notably odd though is I started having some chest pains not too long after my 2nd vaccination that I originally attributed to a bad sleeping position (I sleep on my side). I would have tightness that at times were consistent. Overtime the pain got weaker as I stopped doing intensive workouts. I thought it could&#39;ve been a muscle tear but a tear would&#39;ve healed by now. I still experience a bit of tightness when I do heavy chest exercise or if I compress my chest muscles and squeeze in the middle.  I&#39;m submitting this report because its been recently identified myocarditis is a possible side affect of the vaccine.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

After I returned home between an hour and an hour and a half after receiving the first dose of the Moderna Vaccine,  I felt the onset of an anaphylaxis reaction in which my mouth felt dry and my throat began to feel swollen. I used my Epipen and took Benadryl to help the allergic symptoms subside. After this treatment, the symptoms subsided and I did not seek further medical attention as it was unnecessary.  I was in the care of my father who is a physician.

                                                I started developing issues with swallowing six hours after I was vaccinated. This resulted in a panic attack. I was able to calm myself down and used Benadryl several hours later.  It seemed to help with the swallowing issue and I went to bed. I woke up this morning (03/06/21) feeling much better. I still infrequently have trouble swallowing liquids. I?ve continued to take Benadryl. The feeling of tightness in my throat is located in my superior throat. My breathing - to my knowledge - has remained unobstructed the entire time. If I don?t return to normal by Monday, I will be visiting the center on campus.

                                                Asthma Reaction; Dizzy; Lighted headed; Difficulty breathing; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who is a 29-year-old male patient that received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced dizziness, light headed, asthma reaction (asthmatic crisis) and difficulty breathing.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included pantoprazole 40 mg.  On 28-Dec-2020, approximately three hours prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28-Dec-2020, the patient developed dizziness, became light headed, experienced an asthmatic reaction and difficulty breathing. The events were treated with a dose of albuterol. The patient was transported to the Emergency Room but additional information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, dizziness, light headed, asthma reaction and difficulty breathing was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He  states he was fine yesterday, but this morning has noticed body aches (not unusual with an immunization) and also labored breathing, vision changes, and a rapid heartrate (which could be related to allergy).  He states this has been going on intermittently this morning, and I recommended either getting in to his doctor, or discussing with a nurse.  I did let him know that Benadryl may help as well.  I called to notify his doctor.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient  is a 29 y.o.  with a history that includes # Asthma # Diabetes, recently diagnosed # Obstructive sleep apnea # Remote pulmonary embolism, no longer on anticoagulation who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of known COVID-19, since admitted to Hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -&gt; 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.

                                                Noticed hives about an hour after getting the shot forming all around my body.  Thought it was normal as the covid rash.  Quickly started feeling ill. Had a small amount of trouble breathing and a fever with swelling  and the hives became larger as my skin was flushed. Googled it and it said that this was a normal reaction and common side effects.  So I did not do anything and fell asleep because I felt badly. The next day I woke up to see the bumps all over my body including my digits and pelvic region. Called and talked to my wife she told me to go to the hospital. I started feeling a bit better though and decided against it and took rest that day. The following day the rash had become raised and tender across my body.

                                                Typical side effects began next day(4/18), Arm soreness at injection site, headache, feeling of fatigue, breathing feeling slightly off,  but subsided after the second day (4/19).  Third day was completely fine (4/20), Morning of fourth day (4/21) wave of dizziness and fatigue began accompanied with feeling of pressure in ears with occasional ringing. Also headache at the back of the head and where the cervical spine meets the skull. Occasional congestion. Hard to concentrate and occasional lightheaded feeling. Going on one week since injection and 3rd day of dizzy spells. (4/24)  Treatment: Drinking mostly water. Diet consisting mostly of vegetables and grains (no changes have been made to my diet) Ibuprofen 200mg seems to alleviate earache which in turn relieves some dizziness but feeling of being off balance remains.  No previous history of any sort of vertigo or ear infections.

He was vaccinated with the Moderna COVID vaccine on May 5th which caused fevers and sore throat that resolved. His pleuritic left sided chest pain began 11 days from vaccination. Given the symptoms, the PCP ordered a CXR and d-dimer. Because of the elevated d-dimer and tachycardia while in the office, she ordered a CT chest for PE protocol. This showed bilateral pulmonary emboli so the patient was directed to the ER. He was admitted and started on anticoagulation therapy. Given the CT chest findings of adenopathy, Hemotalogy-Oncology service was consulted and ordered labs.

Next day I was in bed all day the next day because of the severe body aches. Cough got worse for the next few days or so after that.  I had some shortness of breath because of the coughing. Migraines started - strong headaches. The first one was the morning after the vaccine. During the next day (third day after vaccine) I had another migraine.  Symptoms were acute for three days.

                                                30 yo man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED for chest pressure and SOB that started this morning when he woke up. It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

                                                Because of my celiac condition, I avoid eating products with wheat and gluten in them. However, occasionally it is unavoidable, such as with traveling. Typical reactions include fatigue, headache, mild brain fog, irritability, and watery bowel movements for up to 3 days following ingestion. However, since receiving the Moderna vaccine I have encountered wheat products 3 times; in all three cases the reaction was much more severe and included whole-body ache for 5-7 days, insomnia for 2-3 days, dry heaving for 24 hours, extreme sensitivity to motion/motion sickness for up to 3 days, intense gastrointestinal discomfort for up to 7 days, constipation and diarrhea, severe congestion, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, confusion or disorientation, and an overall elevated level of symptoms lasting from 4-7 days depending on the amount ingested.

No other signs of allergic reaction upon examination.  Laid patient down and checked blood pressure which was normal (127/85). Patient stated that he still felt the same after several minutes of observation and felt little to no improvement.  Because he stated that he felt some tightness in his chest he was given 50 mg of diphenhydramine orally and EMS was called.  Patient stated that he began to feel better after the diphenhydramine.  EMS arrived and took vitals, patient refused going to hospital and left the pharmacy.

On the way back He was leaning over. Our tech and I helped him. He then said his throat was closing and then he started struggling to breathe and his arms looked red and rashed. Gave dose of Epipen in left thigh and had tech call 911. His breathing got easier (just fast) Then said he felt like he was going to throw up (he did not) EMTs arrived about 1:07pm and checked him out and said everything 100%. His wife got him some food and he sat in waiting area for a bit and then was able to walk away. Did not go to hospital. EMTsaid probably not an allergic reaction just fright of having vaccine. He was smiling and laughing a bit by the time he left

                                                One week after vaccine, I became incredibly dehydrated, began vomitting and within 2hrs spiked a 104.4 degree F fever. I had uncontrollable shakes, chills &amp; hot flashes. Tylenol wouldn&#39;t reduce my fever. I was taken to the ER where I was given fluids, potassium and magnesium which eventually calmed my fever. My blood pressure was very low as well. I tested negative for COVID-19 and Mono. No clear indication of cause resulted from chest xray and CT scan. Later small nodules were detected in my lung. Doctor&#39;s referred this as a viral reaction but couldn&#39;t determine a cause. I was discharged from the hospital after being there about 6hrs. The next day I was lethargic but felt almost back to normal. Within 36 hours I felt 100% and like nothing ever happened.

                                                First COVID vaccine 5/4/21, moderna. Had SE and pharmacist recommend doc recommendation for 2nd vaccine.    Day of vaccine felt fine.  Next morning 5/5/21 had headache.  At 11am took nap and was having an episode almost like &#34;sleep paralysis&#34; where he would wake up feeling like he couldn&#39;t move and gasping for air.  He reports he did this sleeping and waking for about 1 hour (he had no problems sleeping the night before.)  He woke up after an hour and had vomited in his sleep - he thinks he choked a bit on it.  But when he woke up his breathing was normal, movement normal.   He then only experienced fatigue and headache for the rest of the day.  Then by next day felt totally normal.

Racing heart, felt like I was passing out, mental fogging, trouble swallowing lasted about 1.5 - 2 hours. After 2nd dose I had the normal side effects, headache, chills, body aches fatigue.. After about 2 days of common side effects I noticed I was having trouble swallowing and it felt like I was being choked pulse food regurgitation and diarrhea.  It kept getting worse and worse after a week or so of hell I get an emergency endoscopy showing I have  eosinophilic esophagitis.  I?ve been put on all sorts of meds that are supposed to be treating this but nothing is working.  It?s been near a month now and 2 weeks have been on a hard core elimination diet  symptoms are persistent and discomfort it spreading to what feels like intestines, kidneys and possibly other locations I now have to go in for a colonoscopy soon as the meds should be working and discomfort is spreading.  Loads of headaches can?t sleep with all the discomfort.  Never hungry.  Possible permanent esophagus damage maybe more everything is still being diagnosed and no one is really finding any answers why.  For the last 6 years I?ve been on a health kick working out almost daily and eating very healthy.  No symptoms no warning  signs these one or more diseases it has all just started out of the blue post vaccine nothing else in my life has changed.

THE pain started to get worse and decided to visit a local urgent care who then referred  me to the ER. I was admitted to the ER June 15th.  After multiple blood tests, X-Rays,  EKG?s, and ultra sound, swelling of the heart (pericarditis) was  the diagnosis. I was given colchicine to take for 90 days.

I periodically used and ice pack and I took some advil.  2 days later, I woke up several times in the middle of the night with chest pain and shortness of breath. I felt paralyzed and just went back to sleep a few times. Around 6am,  I woke up and changed to sleeping in a chair in a sitting position as I felt a little less pressure on my chest while doing so. After I finally woke up a couple of hours later, my symptoms were more bearable although I did still feel chest pressure and slight shortness of breath, it did not seem like an emergency any more. These symptoms continued on into the next couple of days and started to go away with time.

                                                After 9min of getting vaccine I experienced heavy breathing and dizziness which lasted for a minute and got normal. Again after 18minutes of getting the vaccine, same thing happened. I was in a sitting position for 20min. After 22min i felt itching on my left foot finger and neck for few minutes. I feel these are side effects of vaccine as i never had such feeling before for any medication.

He notes he was not until approximately 1.75 hours after vaccination that he began to develop a runny nose and aching primarily in his arm.  He felt this might be normal but then soon after developed a hot itchy tight feeling in his throat with ongoing rhinorrhea, mild tightness in breathing and soreness in his left arm. He has had similar reactions with Remicade in the past and they became severe and that is why he is no longer using Remicade.

EMS stated resident should be fine as no allergic reaction was observed. SSM and LRA spoke with resident and got permission to check on him 1x per hour for next four hours (as suggested by RN on site).  After paramedics left resident was observed walking dog with no sign of distress. RN called to report incident to primary care physician. At 230pm on 1/20/21 RN received called from staff at building where resident lives to report that after reviewing the video survelliance tape that at the same time of the incident with resident with SOB; an unauthorized guest was seen running out of patient&#39;s apartment.

Clinic RN called to follow up with patient per RN he stated, &#34;I felt short of breath but I&#39;m fine now.&#34; Staff RN then called Clinic RN to report that the resident had an unauthorized guest run out at same time of incident. Follow up checks on client continued to find resident without symptoms.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Swelling of the throat occurred between 45 mins and 1 hour after Vaccine. Treated with 1 Benadryl and 1 Claritin near the 45 minute mark. Symptoms improved about 1 hour and 30 minutes after getting the vaccine and were no longer noticeable by 3 PM (approx 3 hours after vaccine). After the throat swelling receded I noticed a little bit of numbness in the tongue and throat for another 1-2 hours (4-5 hours after the vaccine). Swelling of throat was uncomfortable but not severe enough to cause breathing issues. There were also no problems swallowing or speaking.

                                                Administered Moderna vaccination at 12:40 pm Sunday April  11,2021. Instructed patient to sit and wait in the vaccination waiting area for 15 minutes. Patient approached me  10 minutes into waiting time and told me he did not feel well. Patient was drenched in sweat. I instructed my tech to paged code white while I stayed with him. I advised him to remove his sweater and face mask. He said he had labored breathing and did not have much energy to talk. I provided him with ice pack, and had him sit down in the clinical service room. His sweat was dissipating. His finance stated he may need electrolytes and he gets anxious with needles. Front lead staff provided him with Gatorade, he took few sips.  He requested Emergency medical services to be called. He called his finance on the phone and informed her of his current condition. He stated he drove 1 hour and 45 minutes to get here and did not feel well enough to drive. EMS came on site and evaluated him. The patient requested to be taken to hospital, after further evaluation they transported him to the hospital. Patient was alert, but seemed slow to respond to questions. He kept stating he did not feel well. We advised him we call EMS and they are on the way.

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 31-year-old white male who previously healthy, he works with a maintenance crew, he was in his usual state of health last week, he did receive his 2nd dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on Thursday.  Over the next 24-48 hours he began experiencing myalgias malaise and fatigue, he self treated with ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed.  He felt a little bit better on Sunday and went to assist in picking up a brush more.  During the process he became  short of breath as well as midsternal chest discomfort. He presented to the ED.    Evaluation found a CRP of 112, elevated troponins and a  leukocytosis of approximately 20,000 along with elevated neutrophils.  His influenza a and influenza B testing have been negative and his SARS COVID the PCR was negative.  Given his elevated troponins, he was started on IV heparin and admitted for further evaluation.   On admission to the floor, he was chest pain free. We were concerned for potential myo/pericarditis given his history and laboratory study findings. Cardiac MRI was performed which suggested active myocarditis with biventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 34%, RVEF 37%). Given his new LV dysfunction he was started on low dose lisinopril and metoprolol succinate.  It is unclear whether this is atypical viral myocarditis or whether it potentially could be vaccine related, the MRI is consistent with that of myocarditis. We did not proceed with cardiac biopsy unless since there was no evidence for clinical decompensation, unstable heart rhythm or other worrisome features. He will plan to follow up with Dr. 1 week post hospitalization with repeat echocardiography and blood work.  If at that time there are any signs of instability we would proceed with more aggressive workup at that time.    Infectious disease was consulted who recommended infectious work up including serology testing for: parvovirus IgG and IgM was positive, Herpes Virus type 6, EBV, CMV (undetected) adenovirus, enterovirus (negative) and HIV (negative) .    He does not have any family history of cardiomyopathy.  There is no family history of sudden cardiac death, he states that his family has been quite healthy from a cardiac standpoint he was previously healthy before this episode.

July 4th - I had a sinus infection feeling and loss of smell and taste. I got tested and I tested positive for COVID - for Delta Variant. After my quarantine period (10 days) - a couple days after that I started getting shortness of breath and difficulty breathing and fever. It turns out I have COVID Pneumonia. This past Friday morning at 04:00 am, I was having high fever, oxygen 87 -86 and shortness of breath and I ended up in the ER - they prescribed me another round of steroids and another round of antibiotics. Scheduled with Primary Care doctor - this coming Thursday morning.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna on January 19, 2021. 48 hours later upon waking from sleep patient had myalgias, arthralgia in all distributions, and  a frontal headache. Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

On the 16th I went got a COVID test which was negative. On the 16th my knee from a previous surgery got infected, it was swollen and painful. It was fine before the 16th. I had the surgery back in December. . I am now using crutches to walk. On the 17th my temperature was 104. I feel like numb like both of the arms and mouth and I couldn&#39;t breath. On the 17th my friend called EMS and they took me to the Hospital. They  didn&#39;t do nothing but check my oxygen and tell me these symptoms are normal for the vaccine. When I went to the ER I told them about my knee but they didn&#39;t look at it. I am still have a painful swollen knee and a fever. I have been taking ibuprofen for the fever.

I had a sharp and persistent headache that lasted most of the night. I felt a little pain in my chest, and even when I took deep breaths it never felt like I had enough air. I&#39;m wondering in the breathing difficulties might have been due to heartburn/indigestion. I had to stop taking my heartburn medicine because it&#39;s not good for my kidneys (I also have kidney disease). On rare occasions I have had symptoms from heartburn that feel almost like asthma. The fever-symptoms and chills subsided a few hours later after I took a Tylenol, but I continue to feel fatigued and I have a bad headache.

                                                Patient felt that his throat was tightening 5 minutes after vaccination during his observation period. He was immediately pulled into a private exam room. Vitals were stable at that time. 50 mg of IM Benadryl was administered. Patient did not improve with this treatment and went on to develop a muffled sounding voice and mild swelling of his left posterior tongue 10 minutes later. At this point, 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered.  Symptoms rapidly improved with treatment. EMS was contacted for transfer to the ER for further treatment as indicated and close observation.

                                                The evening of Wednesday I began feeling chest pressure/discomfort and slight difficulty breathing. The same on Thursday, but a little worse. Friday morning at 4:30am I awoke from intense pain and pressure in my chest, difficulty breathing, and back/shoulder/neck pain. I went to the ER at 7:30 in the morning. Had tests taken, was given colchicine to help with the pain, and it did help lower the pain level a little bit. By Noon the pain was tolerable enough that I could go home. I was told to take ibuprofen to manage the pain. I took a nap but awoke at 2:30pm, this time with even more intense pain, my back/neck/shoulder muscles convulsing/twitching from pain and from being in a state of involuntary clenching as well as chest pain/pressure and difficulty breathing. I went back to the ER and after several more tests, an ECG gave the doctors cause to worry about the health of my heart (they were concerned I may be having a heart attack or heart failure). They kept me overnight and after taking more blood tests and ECG tests were able to diagnose me with Pericarditis on Saturday morning. I was prescribed colchicine, which I am to take twice a day for three months and ibuprofen to manage the pain.

For then next couple days just felt rundown. Then three days post vaccine I began having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath. That night around one thirteen the morning I went to Emergency Department. they took a ECG and drew labs. the ECG showed normal rhythm just a little elevated and my Blood pressure was elevated. Upon the attending physician getting my lab work back i was admitted for my triponin levels being elevated. I was taken for chest X-rays and a Cat Scan per their pulmonary embolism protocols. Both of which showed nothing.  The next day i had a Echocardiogram, and Cardiac Catheterization, and a Cardiac MRI.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

                                                At appox. 1313 a male party with a probable shellfish allergy reported feeling tingling and flush immediately after being vaccinated.

When asked to elaborate he said he was a little dizzy,  was having some difficulty breathing and &#34;rubbery legs&#34; at this point RN 2  discussed with pt that clinic staff feels more comfortable having him evaluated for continued chest tightness and new SOB. Pt agreed to that.     1416 Requested EMS through Deputy.    1424 EMS was on site.  EMS evaluated the patient and decided to transport him to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                2 days after receiving my first dose my tongue began to feel tingly and swell, I could feel the tightness in the back and in my lymph nodes as well. I began to have sensitivity to spicy foods on Thursday. On Friday I woke up and my words were slurring as my tongue felt more swollen  and I started to notice some slight swelling in my throat, maybe 5%. I started gargling diphenhydramine on Friday night and that helped a lot, I also took loratadine and Fexofenadine. By Sunday my symptoms were masked by the allergy drugs and I stopped taking the diphenhydramine. 1 week later, 12 days post Moderna Vaccinne I stopped taking the fexofenadine and Loratadine. I continued to have tongue irritation and a sore on my tongue for 2.5 weeks. I then had an adverse event after the 2nd shot as well.

                                                I premedicated with Diphenhydramine, fexofenadine and loratadine as suggested by the urgent clinic from my previous adverse event. 10 minutes after the 2nd shot I felt hot flashes in my L glut region, then 15 minutes  in I started to feel tongue swelling and slight throat swelling (maybe 10-20%). I felt this decrease but was still present 25 minutes after the shot, I notified a rep at the nurses tent. They asked some questions and said they could take me into the tent but that if I felt it was improving to just wait 15 more minutes, I did that and left after. I continued to have some tongue swelling the next day and continued taking all 3 antihistamines for maybe 3 days. I previously had sensitivity to spicy foods and my tongue feeling inflamed but not swollen from the previous shot, this again occurred the 2nd time. I maintained this with gradual dissipation of symptoms until about 3/1/21. I believe all my symptoms were resolved at that point.

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

                                                At 11:08 patient slumped down in chair and stated &#34;oh no, here it goes.&#34; Patient lost consciousness at 11:09am.  I continued to speak to him and he was unable to hear initially.  He did cry out and gasp and tighten then started to have a few slow jerky movements bringing both arms and body up from the chair. It appeared as if he may vomit and I repositioned to ensure he would not slide off of the chair.  The movements lasted about a minute and then he started to come to.  He described feeling dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and sweaty.  During the event his pupils were non responsive. At 11:17 he went pale and started feeling as if he was spinning and experiencing tingling.  He was still reclined in the chair and sitting up aided with the tingling.  He was given a cold pack to help regulate and given ice water at 11:18.  He stated he had not eaten yet today as he usually doesn&#39;t eat until 11. His temperature had dropped to 96.1 vs 97.5 prior to the vaccination.  BP was checked at 11:25 and was 120/72 which is lower than usual for him and to be expected with the LOC.  After drinking his water, I had him attempt to stand while grasping the wall/table for 2 minutes to assess his steadiness, then standing unassisted for 2 minutes.  After he felt steady enough we had him walk 10-15 feet and stand for another 2 minutes.  Patient was feeling tired and instructed not to drive home.  The situation was conveyed to his wife and they were instructed to seek ER/Urgent care if any of his symptoms reappeared. They stayed in the area to eat lunch and I checked in again at 12:12pm with the patient and he is feeling better after eating but still tired.  I also recommended following up with his primary as I will be sending her a copy of this report.

                                                03/28: At 9 PM (9 hours after shot), I rapidly experienced fatigue, fever (101 degrees), chills, aches, and slight nausea. I took my vitals during this time: SPo2 of 98-99%, BP was 123/80, and heart rate was in the mid-to-high 80s. By midnight, I felt much better and assumed everything was over.   03/29: Woke up feeling fairly tired. As I was trying to do my normal morning routine of cleaning up, taking out trash, etc. I noticed a shortness of breath. No fever or other symptoms from the night before. I checked my SPo2 levels with 3 different oximeters, and all gave readings in the 93%-94% range. My heart rate, which is usually in the 80s and 90s when moving about, was in the low 70s, bottoming at 72. This was nerve racking. This along with intermittent dizziness persisted for 24 hours. I got COVID tested and it came back negative. Flu came back negative, too. A consult with a doctor inferred that &#34;everyone has different vaccine side effects.&#34; Not helpful.   This shortness of breath/fatigue/low blood oxygen saturation continued persistently for the next 48 hours. I was essentially advised to stay home and rest. I noticed some lymph node swelling, too.   By day 4, I was feeling much better. My heart rate had gone back up into the 80s, and my blood oxygen sat. had increased to 96-97%. I was still somewhat tired and got winded very, very easily.   It&#39;s been over two weeks since my second shot upon writing this. I didn&#39;t want to report, but I can&#39;t make heads or tails as to why this happened. The only change in my health was taking the vaccine. I don&#39;t have any blood clots, asthma, or underlying issues. However, these side effects, if they are as such, need to be discussed. I know others who got the Moderna vaccine with similar anecdotes. The difference is, living with a clinician, I monitor my vitals all the time and knew enough to take measurements.

Parent took a printout of patient&#39;s symptoms when she came in for her second dose. Symptoms started  24 hours after vaccine. Symptoms were as follows: extreme stiffness/soreness/pain in entire neck, feeling of being strangled, shortness of breath, trouble swallowing, acute weakness and fatigue, cannot hold head up, feeling of falling forward, base and top of spinal cord pain and numbness, shooting pains and numbness in head and neck, loss of appetite, weakness and very minor pains in both arms, dizziness, brain fog. Symptoms described as &#34;extreme&#34; for 3 weeks. Patient reports tat the first week was &#34;very, very bad.&#34; Pt reports that most symptoms still come and go even after one full month. The neck and base of spine are still the most afflicted at this point in time and fatigue is ongoing. According to the patient&#39;s parent, no medical care was sought. Recommended patient should see a doctor.

                                                The patient came in today (6/28/21) and got his second vaccine with his wife. I explained the recommended wait time and they chose to walk around the store instead. They returned to the window maybe 15 minutes later and he said that he had mild SOB only when he took in deep breaths. I went through the anaphylaxis related questions to make sure that he wasn&#39;t having any throat or tongue swelling and no trouble breathing and he said no to all questions and that &#34;its really not even that bad, only if I breathe in deep. I just wasn&#39;t sure if it was a normal reaction.&#34; I explained to him that it wasn&#39;t normal and that if it continued and especially if it got worse he would want to go to one of the clinics/hospitals to get it checked out. Him and his wife didn&#39;t seem too worried but verbalized their understanding and continued to walk around/leave the store. Pt was not short of breath on presentation to pharmacy window. I called the patient about 20-30 minutes later to ask how he was doing and he stated that he &#34;was feeling better&#34; and was thankful that we called to check on him.

                                                It completely messed me up. After I got the vaccine I got the normal symptoms, fever, chills, cough, and then I started having trouble breathing and very major back pain and chills. I ended up getting pretty bad hypothermia my body tempt dropped down to 91.2, my whole right side of my body was completely numb to the point I could not move my right arm or leg. 2-3 days later I ended up passing out in my bedroom. I was out of work for about a month and a half. I remember being very weak and trying to call for help and I just blacked out completely confused. I woke up again and then I tried to get up but I was to weak so I fell down in my bed. I blacked out again. I woke up very confused not knowing where I was. it took me a minute or two to realize I was still in my bedroom. I could not breathe so I drove to the hospital. They said I had double pneumonia, they gave me antibiotics, They also gave me an emergency inhaler that I am still using sometimes. I still sometimes have attacks that I cannot breathe and sometimes I cough off phlegm out of my lungs.  Also, palpitations rapid and slow palpitations. Also, light headedness, I walk around and I felt very dizzy so I would have to sit down and catch my breath. I lost taste and smell. My oxygen levels dropped too below 95.

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

                                                Approximately 1.5 weeks after my initial vaccination for COVID 19, I developed 2 notable side-effects:  1) The site of the objection become slightly swollen, and itchy.  The itchiness was immediately accompanied by a reddening of the skin and a subsequent rash.  The affect was entirely localized to about an inch &#39;around&#39; the site of the injection and did NOT extend to any other part of my arm or body.  2) A shortness of breath developed that -could- be compounded by a pre-existing anxiety condition.  The shortness of breath is NOT a major impediment, and simply manifests itself throughout the past two days (4-17 and 4-18) as becoming easily winded with light activity (walking) and general need to take deeper, more &#39;forced&#39; breaths.

I went to be around 11pm.  Upon laying down I began to get dizzy and my heart began to pound rapidly.  This strong heart pounding would last 5 hours straight. An hour later my throat started to get a tight feeling with tingling under the chin area and my saliva production began to slow drying out my mouth.  Breathing became more labored and difficult.  At this time my heart was still beating strong.  I had intense Insomnia.  The one time that I tried to lay down; when my body would try to doze off for a second; my body would suddenly jolt me awake with an intense shaking and heart pounding.

                                                I felt nothing for the 15 minute waiting period after the shot.  About 35 minutes after the shot (while driving home) I noticed tingling on the tip of my tongue with mild lightheadedness, sweating, and shortness of breath.  I pulled over, drank some water, and all these symptoms went away in less than a minute.  I felt a little malaise on the drive home.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                On Friday April 16th, 2021, at around 12:10 AM, I had responded to an email for work that I forgot to respond to in the afternoon because I was receiving my first Moderna vaccine at that time. The email induced a lot of stress and shortly thereafter I felt my chest feeling heavy and started wondering whether I had trouble breathing. It is currently Friday April 16th at 1:32 AM, I woke up my housemate and we took a walk around the block for about 30 minutes and I am feeling better. Since receiving the Moderna injection, the area that received the injection has felt sore.

From the moment I got it, it felt like my arm was going to fall off.  I got progressively worse throughout evening and woke up at some point last night with chills.

He felt slightly better and upon arriving home the patient had troubles breathing and explained it as a panic attack without actually having any anxiety. The patient consulted with a physician at a local clinic and was instructed to go to the emergency room. I have not had contact with the patient since arriving at the emergency room.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

                                                Pt was admitted for hemoptysis and a PE 6 days following the event. The PE was in the lung previously damaged by the tumor. The PE was small, the hemoptysis is due to likely a small arterial bleed. He&#39;s been bronched twice and as of 5/10 continues to bleed. The PE is small but we are unable ot anticoagulate due to ongoing hemoptysis. The CT shows ground glass opacities/bronchiectasis in the area where there is bleeding. It&#39;s mostly likely this is due to previous tumor resection and damage from his surgery and XRT and shrunken lung. However, the PE and hemoptysis DID occur within a week of the second covid vaccine so we felt it necessary to report. Pt has no history of DVT/PE. His LE u/s for DVT were negative.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bronchoscopy (left lung filled with blood). Concomitant products included COLECALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) for an unknown indication.   On 31-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 28-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 03-May-2021, the patient experienced HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). an unknown date, the patient experienced HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days). The patient was hospitalized on 03-May-2021 due to PULMONARY THROMBOSIS. The patient was treated with HEPARIN (intravenous) on 04-May-2021 for Clot blood, at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) and PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) had not resolved, CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats) outcome was unknown and HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days) had resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   They did some tests and found there was blood clot in his left lung and put him on blood thinner but he reported that the blood thinner made his bleeding more worse. The patient still in hospital and currently in ICU and the Doctors are unable to determine where the blood is coming from and unable to remove the clot. And he is still suffering with blood cough.

                                                The following happened Tuesday, May 4th, 2021 around 10:00 Central time.  I started off with chest pain that I thought was a side stitch.  Tried stretching to make it go away and it only got worse.  Shortness of breath came on and I asked a co-worker to take me to a local hospital as I thought I was having a heart attack.  The hospital gave me morphine and I passed out maybe 15-20 minutes later.  After I passed out, the hospital sent me to another hospital.  At the second hospital, I had a heart cath, heart echo, an EKG, and blood drawn both nothing indicated a heart attack.

                                                After the vaccine I had chills, fever, shortness of breath and body aches that lasted for a short time. A long term effect that I noticed is a difficulty breathing, heightened allergies (seasonal) and frequent body aches. I also feel tired often. I contacted my doctor a couple of week after my symptoms and as of today we are still trying to do more tests and figure out what options I have. They ran some breathing tests and determined I have some damage in my lungs, which may be from the Moderna or when I had Covid in November.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included ACETYLCYSTEINE (N-ACETYLCYSTEINE), PAROXETINE, LISINOPRIL, METOPROLOL, LEVOTHYROXINE, LORAZEPAM, BUPRENORPHINE and RISPERIDONE for an unknown indication.   On 09-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-May-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 12-May-2021, the patient experienced ILLNESS (Really sick\sicker than dogs) (seriousness criterion medically significant). In May 2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Can&#39;t catch his breath\like he is hyperventilating\very short of breath) (seriousness criterion medically significant), RESPIRATORY RATE INCREASED (Breathing very fast) (seriousness criterion medically significant), BED REST (In bed for 3 week) and HYPERVENTILATION (Like he&#39;s hyperventilating). At the time of the report, DYSPNOEA (Can&#39;t catch his breath\like he is hyperventilating\very short of breath), ILLNESS (Really sick\sicker than dogs), RESPIRATORY RATE INCREASED (Breathing very fast), BED REST (In bed for 3 week) and HYPERVENTILATION (Like he&#39;s hyperventilating) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No treatment information was not given.  Patient&#39;s son received the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 7-May-2021 and now was sicker than dogs, very short of breath, can&#39;t catch breath. The patient was living with that type of breathing, like hyperventilating. This has been going on since second Moderna shot.  Right after taking the second dose, patient started feeling really sick and in bed for about 3 weeks. Starting from about a month ago, started breathing very fast. Seen by a physician, but not hospitalized or administered any specific treatment for these symptoms.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. The company physician considers the reported events as non-serious, because there is no apparent rationale to deal them as serious. Further information has been requested.

Symptoms persisted and an urgent care prescribed antibiotics.  A week later I had food posioning and was hospitalized for this due to not being able to keep liquids down for the better part of a day.  A few days following this incident I woke early in the morning with chest pain shooting down my arm, not being able to breathe and a dry cough.   When I went to the hospital tests were run and revealed (heart markers?)

Had been sitting at computer for at least six hours straight (and probably smoking more pot than I should have), felt dizzy and short of breath, got up, ended up losing consciousness on the living room floor. Woke up a few minutes later and put myself to bed; felt fatigue, aches, chills, and like I might have been running a mild fever. Slept unusually well; woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine. Not particularly concerned but felt like I should report it.

                                                Patient had flu-like symptoms while deployed at start of pandemic (approx. Jan/Feb 2020), but testing was unavailable. His symptoms (URI-like) completely resolved. He received Moderna dose 1 on 02 Feb 2021 without incident, and Moderna dose 2 on 02 Mar 2021. Approximately one week later, he developed mild, dull, diffuse chest pain and shortness of breath which has persisted since.   He was seen in clinic for chest pain and dyspnea on 15 Mar 2021. Patient noted his chest hurt ?all over? especially with deep or with normal inspiration. Reclining, laying down, and sleeping on his right side increased his pain (he did not trial sleeping on his left). Leaning forward decreased pain. He endorsed feeling short of breath, and stated he felt light headed twice while going up stairs, without passing out. He denied recent illnesses and other symptoms. He is a very physically fit Active Duty Marine, who has continued running despite his symptoms. During this encounter and later f/u encounter, he expressed he did not believe running made his symptoms significantly worse.  Vital signs were within normal range and he did not appear in distress. Cardiac and lung exam were normal, and no friction rub or murmur was appreciated. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with HR consistent with his known, athletic-type normal variant heart rate. No other abnormalities were detected. Due to limited ancillary services within clinic, he was sent to USNHO ED for evaluation. There, he had basic labs (including Trop I) drawn, which were normal. EKG and portable chest xray were also unremarkable, and he was discharged with Motrin 800mg PO TID.  He was seen in clinic again 29 Mar 2021 for continued, unchanged symptoms, and reported he had been taking his Motrin only in the mornings and afternoons. Vital signs were unchanged (normal limits). Exam, including heart and lung, were normal. EKG again demonstrated sinus bradycardia, consistent with his normal resting heart rate. He was started on empiric therapy for pericarditis. He was released from clinic and will follow up in several weeks.

I had to lay down for about 5 minutes before I started feeling any sort of normal.  Just about everyday since the Shot I have had a a high pitched ringing that comes and goes and a sever migraine that does not change if I take any medication (Advil). the only way to feel better is to sleep. yesterday was the worst yet.  when I contacted my pharmacist that administered the vaccine they informed me that they did not report my initial side effects and only after I called today were they going to report them.

                                                After patient received his shot, while sitting during the 15 min waiting period. The patient began getting lightheaded and hot, his color went out of him and his eyes began rolling back in his head.  His eyelids turned a purple color and he appeared to momentarily stop breathing.  Myself and another pharmacist got him on the ground and supported his head with a coat.  When he &#34;came to&#34; and was talking to us.  He described feeling better on the cold floor and his color began coming back.   I was speaking with him the entire time.  While we were out with his 9-1-1 was called and paramedics arrived 15 min later.  by the time paramedics had arrived the patient had gotten up and back into the chair himself, was lucid and had color back in his face.  Paramedics arrived and took over.  He was given the green light from them and remained in the pharmacy area for a total of about 30 minutes before heading home. The patient was admittedly nervous for the shot and had not eaten or had anything to drink the whole day to that point. I believe he passed out from a variety of factors not related to the actual ingredients in the vaccine but cannot confirm this.

An hour later I felt it was difficult to catch my breath.  After getting medical attention (benadryl intravenously and fluids intravenously), the next day I had chest pain and continued labored breathing. Two days after the vaccine I still have persisting labored breathing.

                                                First I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to light, I was also feeling light headed and dizzy on my walk back to the car. (about 30 minutes after injection). I had someone else drive because I felt like I could not drive in my condition. On the ride home, about 40 minutes after injection, I began to have an increased heart rate and had a hard time swallowing. It was also slightly difficult to breathe. I felt like my head was cloudy and I had a hard time concentrating. I felt like my brain was responding about a half a second slower to what I saw. Like if I wanted to turn my head, I would think try to turn my head and my body would react a second later. When I got home, about 1 hour after the injection, my girlfriend told me my hands were freezing cold. I was also having a hard time walking in straight because I was so dizzy. I was still having some minor trouble breathing and swallowing. It was difficult to drink water. After about 2 hours my breathing returned to normal. My mind was cloudy all day, I felt like I was drunk.  On the second day, I woke up with an intense headache. It lasted for 3 days. My arm started to hurt on the second day as well, no pain at all the first day. My head was still cloudy and I had difficulty trying to recall memories or answer questions. By the third day this was basically gone. I was extremely tired for three days total. My mind remain cloudy for about a week.

Initial blood pressure was &lt;80/60, which recovered to normal within 20 minutes. During that period, experienced shortness of breath / gasping (though 1st responders noted clear airways and no wheezing in lungs), nausea (did not vomit), and disorientation / dizziness. No medications or interventions were administered

                                                After a day of fatigue and fever, which I experienced with the first shot too and didn&#39;t worry me, around 4 PM on the day after I got the shot I started having difficulty breathing. It felt like there was a large pressure pushing down on my diaphram keeping me from taking even small breaths, and if I tried I&#39;d cough. After about two hours of this I took ibuprofen and that relieved the pressure entirely. It came back around 2 AM and once I got up around 8 I took more ibuprofen, but I still feel some pressure.

Patient&#39;s face appeared red and flushed. I gave him a Benadryl and water around 10:58 am. A few minutes later patient reported his throat felt like it was closing and his tongue felt swollen. He did not appear to have trouble breathing. I called an ambulance at 11:04 am and they arrived around 10 minutes later. Patient was able to walk to ambulance and they transported him to \Hospital.

In my previous 4 years of working, I&#39;ve only missed a less than a 1 handful of days of work due to health conditions, but suddenly after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine, I&#39;ve had a myriad of what I initially thought were heart attacks where I was unable to drive to work (had to pull over twice on the road due to serious risk of being in an accident / having unprovoked panic attacks the morning of  4/19/21 and 5/8/21).  Had extreme SOB and could seriously considered calling 911 on all 3 of my first episodes.  Went to Urgent Care on 5/10/21, and have had several phone visits with my primary care physician since then and was placed on medical leave until 5/22/21, although I still am experience some side effects even today.

                                                A few minutes after giving vaccination, patient&#39;s mother and caregiver stated that he was having a reaction.  Patient can only use his eyes to respond &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34; since he is non-verbal and when he would not respond to his mother&#39;s questions with his eyes she became very panicked and alerted the pharmacy staff.  When I got to the patient he was very clammy, sweating, and breathing heavy.  She said his eyes had rolled back in his head and his tongue had turned blue.  I propped his legs up on a chair and took his blood pressure with an automatic blood pressure cuff and it was 164/124 with pulse 95.  I decided to contact EMS for assistance. Retook BP  few minutes later and it was the same.  EMS arrived and stated it was most likely a reaction to being afraid of needles but would take him to get checked out.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Hard to breathe; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient&#39;s wife), regarding a 37 years-old white male patient, unknown ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, atrial fibrillation, uncomfortable (discomfort), and hard to breathe (dyspnoea).  Current medical conditions reported as controlled atrial fibrillation and cardiomyopathy. Past medical history includes atrial fibrillation diagnosis (May 2018) and stroke (May2018/hospitalized). Weight reported as 180 lbs.The patient&#39;s medication allergy included albuterol inhaler. Concomitant medications reported included are rivaroxaban, levetiracetam, bisoprolol and flecainide.  On 15 JAN 2021, one day prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 029L20A), at a dose of 0.5 ml, intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The consumer reported that the patient became uncomfortable and it was hard to breathe on 16 JAN 2021. On 17 JAN 2021, in the morning, the patient went into atrial fibrillation. The patient received treatment medication with a double dose of flecainide and went back into normal sinus rhythm about 2 hours later. On 18 JAN 2021, in the morning, the patient had a second occurrence of atrial fibrillation, for which he received treatment with a double dose of flecainide and went back into normal sinus rhythm. On 21 JAN 2021, the patient again developed atrial fibrillation third occurrence, for which he received treatment with a double dose of flecainide and went back into normal sinus rhythm. On 27 JAN 2021, the patient had a fourth occurrence of atrial fibrillation, for which he received treatment with a double dose of flecainide and went back into normal sinus rhythm. These adverse events were reported to his physician. The consumer stated that she can be further contacted if the safety department follows up for any additional information.

At 5 pm I had fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain, as well as dizziness. By 5:30 my condition worsened, and I have a fast heartbeat, significant dizziness, and chills. At 5:40 I contacted my wife to leave work to drive me to the hospital. We arrived at the hospital around 6:15; by 8 pm most symptoms except dizziness had disappeared. By 9 pm the dizziness had abated. It is 10:40 pm and I am still a little dizzy, but able to move and operate fine.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

Received 1st Moderna COVID19 vaccine on 2/3/2021.  Developed a rash, biopsy showed lichenoid dermatitis, but no other symptoms after that first shot.  Received 2nd Moderna COVID19 vaccine on 3/12/21 and rash persisted (may or may not have worsened, hard to know from patient report) and the patient presented to medical attention on 3/23/21 acutely short of breath and hypoxic, after being able to exercise (walk 2 miles every other day, etc) prior.  Found to have biopsy proven lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis with diffuse alveolar damage/ARDS requiring supplemental oxygen.  Started on systemic steroids without response.  Also with concurrent mild transaminitis.  From prior recent labs, LFTs were normal prior to presentation with hypoxia.

                                                Within five minutes of the vaccination, the patient expressed distress.  Patient was slumped over in his seat, extremely labored breathing and his eyes were rolling to the back of his head.  The Pharmacist spoke to the patient to see how he was feeling but he wasn&#39;t very responsive so we administered an Epipen and immediaetly called 911.  The paramedics came at around 6:20pm and checked the patients vitals. EMT said the patients vitals were normal and have the patient the option to go to the ER.  Patient was alert and able to drink water.   Patient refused hospitalization.  We advised the patient to go directly to the emergency room if he was developing any symptoms once home and to follow up with his primary care provider.

                                                Approximately five minutes after shot, my face began to tingle. My heart felt like it was racing. I had difficulty focusing with my eyes, it felt like my eyes were rolling.  My feet began to tingle. My spouse honked the car horn for assistance. I reached for my epi pen but did not administer it because a doctor was approaching our car. I checked my pulse rate on my iWatch, it was 168.  My throat began to feel tight. The doctor listened to my lungs and heard wheezing. A paramedic came over as well. My blood pressure was taken but I do not remember what my blood pressure was.  At that point the doctor said I should use my epi pen. The paramedic said I should use Benadryl. They were in disagreement, and the paramedic said I should take 50mg of Benadryl and had me put my car seat in recline position.  It was at the point they noticed that my face and chest were flushed.  They had me drink water.  We waited about 45 minutes. My lungs were checked again by the paramedic and I was told my lungs were clear, my blood pressure was taken second time but I do not remember my blood pressure, my face was less flush,  my pulse was in the 70?s.  I still felt tingling on my scalp and feet, my throat felt like it had a lump in it.  I Began to feel nauseous.  I was given the okay to leave and go home.  I had nausea until the evening the next day.  I did not eat until dinner time the night after my shot.  I only drank water.  The next day I experienced shortness of breath performing  duties that typically do not make me out of breath.  I had to take many breaks and used my abuterol inhaler two times.

I breathe through my nose mostly and I&#39;m in very good pulmonary and cardiovascular condition.  I went for a run and 1 mile in I started drooling a lot! Spitting out mouthfuls every 15-30 seconds and I never spit.  Then my chest got tight and hurt and got irritated.  The feeling was identical to Bronchitis.  I started walking home and my breathing rate increased with wheezing. I got nauseous and was bent over with saliva poring out of my mouth.  Walking up one flight of stairs was difficult.  I have a finger pulse oximeter and it was at 84!  Breathing was very rapid and difficult. After 5 minutes it went up to 94 and then up to 98-99 after 1 more minute (when my pulse fell back under 100bpm.  Chest tightness continued for about 1 hour before I was back to normal for the most part. by today I feel 100% again.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

Woke up with a fever in morning, fever off and on the following day, fatigue the following two days. By day two I was having difficulty breathing while laying down, shallow breaths. I went to urgent care by the fourth day because the breathing difficulty increased, to the point where it was hard to breathe sitting up. Dr. at the urgent care did chest Xray and EKH, which were both normal. He tested me for COVID-19 and the results were negative. It is now day 7 and I am still having shallow breathing, with what feels like an unclearable chest congestion, and cough.

I have experienced some shortness of breath and became quickly exhausted with light physical activity (including standing and walking). These two symptoms appear to be better after 24 hours.

Asthma symptoms were resolved using albuterol in a nebulizer for several days and use of inhalers (Qvar 80 and Beclomethasone). Ulcerative colitis is resolving using hydrocortisone suppositories, turmeric orally, vitamin E, and medical cannabis oil rectally. I&#39;m also receiving three IV treatments of glutathione spread across a week to calm down my immune system.   Regardless, I still would have taken the vaccine had I known in advance. I just want others to be aware so that they are not caught by surprise, and can plan to have the necessary medications and/or their physician on call if needed.

Never experienced one before.  Upon riding back home, went to urgent care near my house, they treated me with diphenhydramine 25mg (2 tablets).  Stayed there for about 90min. Conditions improved a bit. Went home, took 2 benadryl 10 mg tabs approx every 5 hours. Constant daily improvement. By Friday, conditions were pretty much non-existent.

Within a few minutes after that I told them my throat was starting to close up, I was having trouble breathing and both arms went numb. They said I was very pale, horse when talking and that they were going to start treating me for anaphylaxis due to my throat and airway issues. They immediately called for ambulance and  gave me 10 ml of liquid Benadryl and prepped an epi-pen. Within maybe 5-10 minutes the Benadryl help stop the throat closing and I asked them to not inject the epi-pen until the EMT arrived since the symptoms held and didn?t get worse.

                                                3pm, hours after the shot, i felt shortness of breath for about an hour.  Throughout the weeks, i would feel the shortness here and there but not so serious. Fast forward to May 6, it attacked me and it is very difficult to breathe.  Almost getting dizzy. I had to buy primatene mist which does not work 100%. The episodes lasts for almost 2 hours.

After about a week I noticed numbness/paresthesias in my fingers and forearms. About a week later it progressed to my face and is now also in my oral cavity (teeth, tongue, and posterior oropharynx). The paresthesias have been accompanied with intermittent mild vertigo, headaches, mild shortness of breath, and palpitations.

Approximately two weeks ago (around 6/27/2021):  Sudden onset of pain in the chest, then heart felt like a clenched fist, then heart started racing.  Couldn&#39;t catch a breath and felt like passing out.  I crawled to my neighbors house and told them to call an ambulance as I thought I was having a heart attack.  While waiting for ambulance, got extreme chills and sweats.  Ambulance came and did EKG which was normal.  Gave me the option to go to hospital, but felt better so I declined.  Since I have gotten the vaccine, I have consistently struggled with shortness of breath, tachycardia, and lightheadedness, to the point where I feel like I&#39;m going to pass out, or die.

He did not report his symptoms, as per his wife, he assumed this was related to the COVID vaccine. By the following morning, his fevers had resolved. He took a nap midday, and shortly after waking, he reported to his wife that he was feeling short of breath. According to his wife, he appeared in respiratory distress and she heard wheezing. He asked to be helped to the ground, and she immediately called EMS. Unfortunately, before they could get him to a hospital, he died. At the hospital, his wife was told that because his death was outside the hospital, it was presumed to be due to &#34;natural causes&#34;. She was told an autopsy would cost $5000, which she could not afford.

                                                Besides the usual and expected muscle pain, injection site soreness, and headache, I experienced a mild allergic reaction. Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

The patient had a medical history of celiac disease and is a kidney patient (other kidney surgically removed). The reporter states that Patient&#39;s concomitant medications are gabapentin and duloxetine hydrochloride for chronic back pain.  On 11 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (unknown lot number) via intamuscular route on left arm for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On 11 Mar 2021, anaphylaxis 3 minutes post receiving the first dose of vaccine the patient developed numbness and his eyes became swollen, then numbness of the tongue, lips and closing of the throat, which all happened at the vaccination site.The attending EMT provided 3 pills of oral 50mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and did not apply an EpiPen. Patient&#39;s blood pressure went extremely high (180/111mmHg) instead of dropping. At that moment, it was decided to contact 911. The paramedics placed the patient on a stretcher and loaded him onto the emergency vehicle to be rushed to the hospital. On the way, the patient was given an EpiPen. While in the hospital, the patient was given more diphenhydramine and injected with methylprednisolone. Patient was in observation for 4 hours and then released with a prescription of an EpiPen. It was reported that the patient was extremely sleepy due to the medications given. When the patient arrived home, he went straight to bed. The patient was hospitalized on 11 Mar 2021 for Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Pruritus and released on same day after 4 hours. The next day, Friday (12 Mar 2021) the patient got up around 10:00am. Then at 10:05am, the symptoms began to reoccur with numbness of the lips, tongue, closing of throat and extreme itchiness. As soon as patient&#39;s husband noticed, he did not apply EpiPen and drove the patient to the emergency room. The emergency room followed the same protocol with methyprednisolone steroid, EpiPen and diphenhydramine. On Saturday (13 Mar 2021) and Sunday (14 Mar 2021), the doctor was seen and the patient was advised to take diphenhydramine every 4 hours. Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal. A check for blockage of the heart, also had looked fine.

                                                I began to feel a little dizzy on 03-25.   This light lack of equilibrium steadily grew for the next couple days. I found my limbs had apparently began to lose strength.  breathing became difficult  as if I could only take 1/4 breaths unless I actively forced myself to inhale deeply.  I developed sleep apnea about this time.  Driving became difficult. I was walking and driving as if I was drunk.  When walking, it felt as if I was on a swaying ship. Driving felt like my workvan was in a constant crosswind that I wanted to correct from.  At this point, I stopped driving.  That was on 03-25.  On 03-26 I suddenly developed up-beat nystagmus in my vision that continues to this day, making me functionally blind.  I visited multiple urgent care facilities.  Received full panel blood work, urine tests and a MRI. All tests came out completely normal.   Doctors are baffled. I was given Valium to help with my eyes and that does help a little.  However I&#39;m still unable to see adequately to function without assistance.

                                                Patient developed dizziness, slight tingling and muscle tension in neck 45 minutes post Covid vaccination Dose #1 on 3/25/21. States symptoms stayed a day and went away however he felt &#39;off&#39; for a few days. About 4 days post-vaccination developed tingling/numbness and intermittent lightheadedness with slight difficulty breathing at night when trying to get to sleep. No swelling of face and no hives reported. Able to exercise (weightlifting &amp; biking) without SOB. Became concerned and went to ER on 4/6/21. Per ER report stated that substernal chest pain started one week prior and worsens at night along with BL leg numbness, numbness in hands, L sided facial tingling and muscle tightness that wraps around neck. Denies SOB except when trying to go to sleep. Not sleeping well due to the feeling of not getting enough air when trying to fall asleep.  No fever, chills, N/V/D. ACS ruled out: EKG showed no signs of ischemia &amp; troponins WNL. PE ruled unlikely d/t no DOE, sats 99%, HR 71 in ER. Chest pain not reproducible on palpation. Referred for sleep study to evaluate for sleep apnea.

Pain radiated through body with slightest movement, felt in joints, muscles, bones.  Only alleviated by laying perfectly still.  Both injection sights became painful during this period, one in both arms.  Worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life, thought I might need to call ambulance and upon reflection, probably should have. Since then chills and sweating periods with minor exertion, getting less severe as time passes, but within norm.

After that, I decided to go home and on the way home my neck started to get tight, not stiff, tight. I could still breathe but it was hard to take in a deep breath. I turned around and headed to the Hospital. I stayed in the hospital parking lot for about 30 minutes and the symptoms improved as well as my breathing improved but still felt tight in my neck. I went home started driving with plenty of water and was monitoring my breathing., and put on my machine for at least an hour.

                                                Severe and erratic heartbeats, heavy slow breathing accompanied with severe fatigue, severe headaches, and severe chills with no energy to move around for a week. After these symptoms eased, no appetite (went from eating five times a day and gym workouts 5 days a week to maybe eating twice a day and unable to walk up 20 stairs without shortness of breathe and heavy erratic heartbeats) still accompanied with little energy, erratic heartbeats, shortness of breath, and lingering headaches well into week three.  Admitted myself to the ER on due to lingering affects and a new symptom of swelling/throbbing on the left side of my head; previous mentioned symptoms still there but milder than before.  Diagnosis at ER was high blood pressure 150 over 92; never had blood pressure problems prior 1st COVID vaccine dose. Follow-up visit with primary care provider, checked my vitals and high blood pressure remained; primary care provider diagnosed high blood pressure, prescribed Amlodipine 5MG tablets.

I am currently sick with a respiratory infection that has gone on for appx. 6 weeks with heavy symptoms recently (i.e. bed ridden, extreme difficulty breathing, heavy congestion, etc.)
