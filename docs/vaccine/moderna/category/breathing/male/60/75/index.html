                                                I woke up at approximately 4:00 am with an extremely dry mouth. I went into the bathroom and took a drink of water. I returned to bed. I noticed that my breathing was becoming more rapid. I had trouble catching my breath. I sat up on the side of the bed. My heart was pounding and quick. My breathing was difficult. I woke up my wife. After about 5 minutes my symptoms improved. She took my pulse which was now at 62ppm.  I laid back down in a reclined position. My symptoms of difficulty breathing and elevated heart rate quickly returned. My pulse was now up to 98 ppm.  I sat up again. My symptoms gradually improved. Being unsure of what was going on my wife called 911.  The ambulance arrived in about 8 minutes.  I was about 60% better. Vitals were improving other than my blood pressure which was 180/100 Being unsure of what was happening, I was transported to Hospital.   I  had a chest x-ray, a chest CT scan with contrast to rule out a blood clot, blood work including tests to rule out MI x2. All test were negative.  By about 6:30 am I was feeling at least 80% better. My breathing I felt had returned to normal. My pulse was down into the 50&#34;s which is my normal range.

He went up front to purchase something 5 minutes later and collapsed face first on the floor as observed by a nearby customer. The customer said he started having convulsing seizures and the customer went to aid in keeping the patient safe. the pharmacy manager (myself) was alerted and I immediately ran upfront to the patient with the emergency bag. 911 was already on the cashiers phone. They dispatched an ambulance. The only treatment was keeping the patient on his side and safe. He was having some labored breathing initially which quickly calmed down. The EMT arrived and they called his Dr office off the VAR. They said he had some hx of seizure. He had selected no to question #6 on VAR (Have you had  History of seizure for which you are on medication for). He became conscious before transport to the hospital. The EMT stated that he seemed to be covering  as expected from seizure.   He was then transported to Hospital Center.

                                                4 days after the vaccination I started having breathing problems and a racing heart. I first went to Urgent Care and they sent me to the E.R. immediately.  They x-rayed my chest and ran 3 EKG&#39;s which all came out normal. However, they wanted to check my into the hospital to run a heart stress test the next day. I chose to go see and cardiologist and a pulmonary specialist. Those are appointments are being scheduled.

Admitted 3/17/21 due to hypoxia, had ground glass opacities on CT. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x 2.  Vigorous immune response could have caused lung inflammation and hypoxia, similar to a covid infection, but from the vaccine. 60YM with a history of a chronic inflammatory arthritis on methotrexate, hospitalization in November 2020 with Covid pneumonia, he was discharged on 1 to 2 L of home oxygen, and reports that he was told by his PCP about a month after discharge that he was able to come off the oxygen as his oxygen saturations had normalized.  He returned to his usual state of health and activity with no issues until he received the first dose of his Moderna covid-19 vaccine through his primary care office on 3/13.  The next day he developed arm pain and then progressive body aches, headaches, fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.  He presented to the ER and was found to be febrile with hypoxia and admitted for treatment and evaluation.   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with ground glass opacities on CT : oxygen 87% on RA in ER, 84% on room air 3/19, resolves with oxygen support of 2lpm.  CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x2 as well as respiratory virus panel, CT shows ground glass opacities, patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for empiric treatment for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although procalcitonin was negative.  BNP was elevated at 458, so an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was given 2 doses of furosemide during the hospitalization and BNP normalized. Patient was started on prednisone to calm down a possible inflammatory response triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine in a person who likely already has antibodies, causing hypoxia.  With this patient significantly improved and at discharge is on room air at rest, but still requires 2 L/min with exertion.  CRP was markedly elevated, supporting an inflammatory process.  Autoimmune lung disease panel was sent and is in process at time of discharge.  Patient requested discharge home, Discharged on a slow prednisone taper to avoid rebound with abrupt discontinuation of steroids.  Patient will complete 2 additional days of Augmentin and doxycycline at discharge.

                                                I haven?t had the chills like that in forever! It came in waves. You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

                                                Had COVID vaccine on 02.11.21. States the next morning his anxiety was very high. States he did not know who he was. Still experiencing a lot of anxiety at night. Admits to heart palpitations and hard time breathing. Can&#39;t sit still. Reports manic episodes and cycles of depression over the course of hours. Patient states it has gotten a tiny bit better. Tried trazodone which helps temporarily. Denies chest pain. Patient states he has no appetite. Palpitations resolved pretty quickly. Shortness of breath is described as tightness that comes with anxiety feeling. Resolves with shoulder massage. Occurring three times per day. Also admits to dry mouth. Patient admits to needing to sleep with multiple pillows or feeling like he had to sit up and couldn&#39;t lay down as shortness of breath would get worse.  EKG in office on 2/24/21 showed ST-T changes and given symptoms patient was transferred to emergency room via ambulance.  Work up in hospital was unremarkable and patient was diagnosed with pericarditis (unknown etiology) and prescribed NSAIDS from ER and discharged.  Admission not required.   Patient followed up to us as outpatient on 03.02.21.  Patient felt much better and had not take motrin for 1 day.  COVID testing obtained at this point (unclear why ER did not send it).  Patient referred to outpatient cardiology given risk of cardiovascular disease, stress echo, and event monitor.

After second shot in series, 8 hours post-injection, I developed headache, moderate to severe joint pain throughout, fever around 100, extreme fatigue and weakness, slight difficulty breathing.  Went to bed for 19 hours and began to feel better with recovery in two days.  14 days post-injection, I developed a systemic rash throughout my body. Consulted with my PC physician. Was prescribed  Medrol Dose Pack.  This had very minor effect on rash.  Returned to physician for consult upon completion of steroid series.  I then received a steroid shot intramuscular in right hip and one week oral steroid protocol.  This achieved a more positive result, almost clearing up the rash.  I had a consult with a dermatologist on 03/02/2021 who confirmed the opinion that the rash was probably a side effect of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash has returned fully as of 3/14/2021.

                                                The night of my vaccination I went to bed early. I was tired and a little achey. I woke up about 2:00 AM with significant discomfort in my chest. My chest felt heavy and when I inhaled it felt like someone was squeezing both lobes of my lungs. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to urinate. I went back to bed and tried to get back to sleep. The discomfort in my chest continued and seemed to get worse. I got back out of bed at about 2:45 AM and went downstairs where I walked around my living room to see if that would help me feel better. I continued to feel severe discomfort in my chest and lungs. I did not otherwise feel bad. I was not congested. I could  still take a deep breath but it hurt to do so.  I took my temperature and I did not have a fever. At about 3:00 AM I woke up my wife and she drove me to the emergency room at Medical Center. On the car ride to the hospital I started to feel much better. By the time I checked into the emergency room most of my discomfort had dissipated and only a very slight feeling of heaviness remained in my chest.

                                                experienced extreme shortness of breath a day or two after receiving 2nd COVID-19 vaccine. Breathing became worse at night, more so in reclined position than upright. Thinking it was a vaccine side effect waited for it to subside, when it did not sought medical attention. Doctors determined to be acute congestive heart failure exacerbation. Treated with diuretics and blood pressure medications. Hospitalized from 3/14/2021 to 3/19/2021.

While in bathroom, became dizzy, broke into sweats, and felt I was about to faint. I went to my knees holding onto counter. My wife came in to help me in bathroom. She observed I was incoherent but uttering moaning sounds and breathing heavily. She called 911. While on phone I came to and vomited into sink. It appeared I had not digested anything from dinner that night. After vomiting (1x) I felt much better.  First responders reported normal vital signs. I did not go to E.R. that night but went to Urgent Care later that morning and all seemed fine.

                                                32 hours after the vaccine, he suffered a massive heart attack due to a blood clot and a massive clot in the right arm. He went to the hospital and under went surgery at 12 am on Saturday. The coronary surgeon mentioned that this was not from heart disease as all vessels were clear. Rather, this was due to an embolism due to an unknown origin. A further work up concluded that he also had blood clots throughout his body (both lungs, one kidney, heart, liver, legs, arms, and possibly brain). By 12 p.m. we were asked back to the hospital as he was worsening. Treatment options included a heparin drip, which caused a brain hemorrhage. He was just at the doctors two times this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday and was fine no issues found. They went through with the 2nd dose and came to our home on Thursday.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, the symptoms started with a stiff neck and headache on the left side including soreness at the injection site. As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.   As a school teacher, I have taken the appropriate precautions and received a Covid19 test: Results negative.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included asthma and unspecified allergies. Concomitant product use included unspecified allergy medication and asthma/bronchitis inhalers.   On 02 Jan 2021, the same day as the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and sinus congestion. The patient tested positive for COVID-19. The patient was taken to the hospital where he was treated with an infusion.  On an unspecified date, a computed tomography scan showed bronchitis. Additional treatment for the events included unspecified antibiotics and steroids.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events COVID-19 and bronchitis was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report concerns a 63-year-old male patient who experienced the serious events of COVID-19 and bronchitis. The event occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot #: Unknown, expiration date-Unknown). Treatment administered included antibiotics and steroids. Outcome was unknown. Although a temporal association exist, there is not enough information to adequately assess the causal association between the reported events and mRNA-1273 vaccine administration.  Critical details such as diagnostic test for COVID infection prior to vaccination was not ascertained. Causality is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Main field defaults to possibly related&#39;

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Jan2021, the patient tested negative for COVID-19). On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, and feeling weird/funny. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced difficulty breathing and swelling. On 18 Jan 2021, the patient declined dialysis, was tired and wanted to lay down. At 8 am, the patient was found nonresponsive and cold and is believed to have passed away around 4 am. The coroner tested the deceased for COVID-19 and the test was positive. No autopsy was reported. No death certificate was issued at the time of the report but the reporter believes it will list cause of death as COVID complications.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided. Based on reporter&#39;s causality the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19

When I got under covers and warmed up so chills subsided and breathing returned to normal it felt like I was being squashed in a Panini press. Every cell in my body felt like it was vibrating in pain. I had to get up ever hour or so to urinate. I would be back in sever chill mode before i made it to the bathroom and it took about 5 minutes back in bed for chills to stop and breathing back to normal. I was also nauseous the whole time but did not vomit Then. The room temperature was 72F. This continued for 12-14 hrs.  I then tried to drink cranberry juice and eat 3 bites of a banana which  I immediately regurgitated. The rest of the day I was drained of energy. No sleep 48hrs. 3 days

No heart beat pulse etc... used CPR machines and paddles  Patient had walked 6 1/2 miles that morning no problems did about 50-60 miles weekly outside. This was sudden and me, his wife, say it was a reaction to something in shot that contributed to this event- there is absolutely nothing you could say to make believe differently. This happened 1 1/2 hours after getting shot.

It almost like little shocks going thru my body. I had a video appointment with my Dr. and he prescribes doxycycline and prednisone.  The next day the fever went away and started to feel better (48 hours later).  I also tested positive for Covid on 12/24/20, I didn&#39;t wait 90 days before I got my vaccine.  I felt awful with the second dose, almost worse than being in the midst of Covid. I&#39;m currently on Workman&#39;s Comp. I&#39;m constantly out of breathe and have no energy, I use to have tons of energy. From my atoms apple to my sternum I have tons of pain. My lungs feel like I&#39;m smoking and have tons of pressure.  My Dr. ran test because I have the worst head aches. I&#39;m like slow motion.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

Later in the morning, he complained of nausea, generalized muscle aches, intermittent increase in confusion. At approximately 14:00, he had a fall out of bed and at that time noted to be short of breath, tachypneic. He was taken via ambulance to Emergency Department. From there he was transferred to Hospital for admission with acute respiratory distress, suspected sepsis with lactic acid 7.4 and Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli. He was started on heparin and broad spectrum antibiotics and transitioned to ELIQUIS on 1/3/2021. Infectious etiology of sepsis was unclear. He continued broad spectrum antibiotics with clinical improvement. Abdominal CT scan was obtained due to intermittent nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loose stools. His heart rhythm flipped to Atrial Fibrillation with RVR on 1/2 and his rate improved with titration of metoprolol. He was also treated with prednisone for suspected underlying undiagnosed COPD. It is noted in his hospital summary that PEs presumed provoked in the setting of his recent COVID 19 infection. He was discharged from the hospital on 1/8/2021 and readmitted to the Veterans Home.

                                                ADVERSE EVENT REPORT: MODERNA VACCINE 1 of 2 Dates: Feb. 17 to March 16, 2021  1. I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

Then proceeded to get a slight noticeable increase in heart rate.   After setting for approximately 15 minutes I was released to leave. I mentioned to them that I just lived down the street and told them if I had any further issues or symptoms I would call them.  Approximately 30 minutes later I was having a slight lightning of the throat or airway and some slight tightness in breathing.  This tightness continued for approximately 2 hrs. I called the clinic and was attempting to get there recommendations but the nurse had left. I was told to get the ambulance personnel. As a prior EMT I felt that an ambulance was not needed at this time. I took 2 ea   Benadryl tablets and those symptoms lessened. Some numbness in lips and face, and felt heart beating in lips. That all subsided as well after taking Benadryl.  Still trying to get with a provider that could give me advise moving forward. The doctor was busy with an Emergency.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

He then started with some shortness of breath and wheezing the next day.  He then used his inhaler to get through the symptoms quicker and it did help. Patient notes that within 22 hours of having the shot his symptoms then resolved.  He is not having any further issues or symptoms from the COVID vaccine at this time.

I felt a rush come over my body followed by rapid heart beat. These symptoms lasted about 2 mins then subsided. I really didn`t want panic everyone  or go to the hospital all I wanted was fresh air so I left, admittedly not my smartest move but I knew my doctors office was right across the street.  After 24 Hrs. still Light Headed, no breathing issues, heart rate normal  sore arm no rash.

Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

                                                Prior to the vaccine on 2/13/21, He was a healthy 65 year old active college professor.   32 hours after the vaccination on 2/14/21, He had acute pancreatitis, which led to  septic shock and respiratory failure, and he was placed on a ventilator at  Hospital.   On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

Unable to lay down as it made his breathing worse.   The next day, he did a nebulizer treatment and that helped his symptoms.   Unfortunately, he has had an acute asthma attacks nearly every day since.  Starting 1 week ago, symptoms have gradually improved.  He is still having to use his nebulizer, but not as often, as his usual inhalers have not been ineffective.

He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution. Discussed risks of receiving the vaccination vs benefits of the vaccine, which patient states &#34;I already had this discussion with Dr.!&#34; He has multiple comorbidities which place him at a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. Again received the risk vs benefit discussion. Patient stated understanding and desire to proceed with the vaccination. He will be monitored for at least 30 minutes in area where staff can directly observe him. Patient received the COVID vaccination at 13:00. At 45 minutes later, staff alerted that he was c/o palpitations. Due to confusion and weakness, we were unable to transport him to an examination room. Oxygen, water, and vitals machine were brought to him. He presented with SOB, confusion, lightheadedness. Exam demonstrated acute distress, speaking in staccato sentences. HR in 80s, with lungs CTAB and no stridor - despite increased RR to 20s. Vitals with HR in 70s, SpO2 remained 97% or greater on RA. BP was initially 140/72. A code blue was called and Drs. presented to the area. Patient c/o itchy throat and still p/w confusion/combativeness, loss of orientation, and SOB. No visible swelling noticed. At around 13:58, patient syncopized. HR and SpO2 remained 70-80s and &gt;98% on room air respectively. Pulse remained palpable. At that time, an epipen was administered. Patient woke up. During the entire episode, he was able to recognize a staff member with whom he was previously familiar. EMS arrived, vitals remained stable. EMS transported patient to the ER for further monitoring and f/u. Concern for immediate allergic reaction 2/2 vaccination. After event, patient in need of referral to allergy provider for evaluation prior to consideration of 2nd dosage.

                                                -Approximately 5 hours after injection, developed 12 hours of chills (no fever), diffuse aching, fatigue, and very low energy. -Approximately 3 days after vaccine noted difficulty completing usual daily exercise routine-stamina appeared low. -Approximately 3-5 days after vaccine noted difficulty completely taking in deep breath, with &#34;catch&#34; or discomfort in substernal area. -During early morning hours of day 7 after vaccine, was awakened with sharp, intense toothache pain right flank.  With change of position was able to get comfortable after which pain resolved.  This reoccurred the next two nights prompting ED visit. -First ED visit focused on right flank pain and CT Abdomen and pelvis was negative except for &#34;atelectasis&#34; right lung base -Due to more pleuritic symptoms, second ED visit occurred, and CT chest with contrast demonstrated bilateral PEs (approximately 5 on right and 2 on left) with evidence for RV strain -Hospitalized and started on anticoagulation (Lovenox SQ for one dose and then Eloquis). Echocariogram confirmed mild RV dilatation.  Interventional Radiology did not feel removal/lysis of clots necessary. -Completed exhaustive evaluation with Hematology--no underlying clotting disorder identified to date -Have returned to 100% activity without significant symptoms at present

                                                My first vaccination was given at Medical Center, on 1/27/21.  Medication was Pfizer, Lot # EL3302.  At time of scheduling I was told that I could get my second vaccination at facility, which was  about 50 miles closer to my home.  The scheduler verified that facility administered both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.   On 2/16, when I reported to facility for my second shot, I reminded the intake person and the one who escorted me to the vaccination station that I needed the Pfizer vaccine, and was told by both people that  Pfizer was in the record and that I would receive that vaccine.  The person who escorted me to the vaccination station brought the syringe to the vaccinator, who asked me my name and date of birth, administered the shot, and handed me the post-administration paperwork.  While seated in the waiting area I read over my paperwork and reviewed my dosage record card and discovered, that I had been  given the Moderna vaccine., against the CDC guidance and without prior notification to or authorization by me.  I have subsequently experienced shortness of breath, an unusually high level of  nasal congestion, nad a serious lack of energy.  These symptoms began about 72 hours after the second vaccination.

I assumed these were  some of the symptoms as a result of the vaccine. I monitored my fever for several hours. The cough persisted for the next 9 plus days and I didn&#39;t have any desire to eat or drink liquids. I lost my taste and smell during this 9 day period. On February 25 my wife and I took a Covid-19 self test at pharmacy. Also on this same date I went to urgent care My wife was concerned about my labored breathing.  My vitals were checked and I requested a chest xray. I was given 2 prescriptions. 1 for Prednisone 20mg and Ventolin.

I spent the entire weekend in Hospital. I had gotten the vaccine in that same hospital earlier that afternoon. I had a similar reaction with the first dose also given at hospital one month before on Feb 5 ,2021. It  was not  severe enough to make me go the emergency room. It happened approximately the same amount of time after the vaccination. approximately 12 hours after the shot.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine dose #1 on 3/3/21 at approximately 0900.  In the afternoon of 3/4/21, patient had sudden onset shortness of breath while at home, as well as fatigue and low energy. Patient knew that a potential side effect of vaccine was fatigue, so he assumed this was just a normal side effect to be expected. States that his difficulty breathing and fatigue continued for about a week. After continued urging from wife to seek medical care, patient visited urgent care center on 3/15/21. The urgent care did a D-Dimer lab, and an x-ray of chest. X-ray &#34;showed something abnormal&#34; so they did a CT scan as well, which showed a &#34;huge pulmonary embolism.&#34; D-Dimer lab was elevated. Patient was transported to hospital by ambulance and had immediate surgery to remove blood clot from lungs at approximately 2100 on 3/15/21. Per patient, the surgeon said the clot was about the size of his palm. Surgeon reported that there was &#34;100% blockage to left lung from the aortic artery and 90% blockage to right lung from aortic artery.&#34;  A DVT in popliteal vein was identified, and the surgeon assumes the clot started in the popliteal vein and broke off and traveled to lungs. Patient was admitted and hospitalized until he was discharged home on 3/18/21. During course of hospitalization, genetic testing was done and it was determined that the &#34;genetic marker for clots was negative, so they think the clot is from a one-time event--patient&#39;s family does not need to be concerned that they have clotting issues.&#34; Patient states that he was started on heparin in the hospital, and was discharged home on Eliquis blood thinner, which is being tapered. Patient states that the doctors think he will be on Eliquis for about 6 months and will not need to be on it for life. Doctors say the DVT in leg will dissolve on its own. During hospitalization, an echogram and cardiac cath was performed, which showed &#34;an old heart attack on the left side, but that collateral vessels have built up already.&#34; Right side of heart was weaker from having to work so hard due to blood clots in lung, but prior to discharge from hospital, the right side of heart was already showing improvement. A heart cath was done to check vessels and it was determined no stents were needed, although there was a small clot in left anterior descending artery. Patient was also newly diagnosed during course of hospitalization with Type II Diabetes in a non-obese person, HTN (which patient had never had before), Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia, 1st degree AV block. Was discharged home with metformin, losartan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and Aspirin. The chlorthalidone was discontinued, due to &#34;blood pressure dropping too low--they think his high blood pressure was situational&#34; per wife of patient. Medical doctors advised against receiving the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. Patient being followed by Internist at hospital.  Patient&#39;s shortness of breath resolved &#34;immediately after clot was removed&#34; but is continuing to be followed while on new medications and blood thinner dosing.  The above information was provided during telephone interview of patient and his wife.

                                                About six minutes after the vaccination, while sitting in the clinic, I experienced a feeling like I was about to lose consciousness, together with salivary gland activation and heavier breathing.  This lasted about one minute and I did not pass out.  But about 25 minutes later, while driving home (alone), I experienced the same thing but for about 5 or 6 minutes.  Fortunately I didn&#39;t pass out.  About an hour after the shot I felt sort of back to normal.

Pt was found to have elevated BTNP at 2240 pg/ml with fluid overload, and Biofire Respiratory Panel showed Coronavirus PCR positive.  At that time, his COVID markers were also elevated.  CRP 91.4 mg/L,  D-Dimer 2340 ng/mL.  Patient was admitted, diuresed, and started on inpatient COVID protocol which included Ivermectin.  March 9:  EKG was performed and patient was found to have a heart block.  All labs had improved over the past 48 hrs. BTNP reduced to 1530, D-Dimer reduced to  1700, CRP reduced to 47.9.   Due to the heart block, patient was transferred to a care center to a cardiologist.  Just prior to transfer, a follow up Biofire respiratory panel showed Coronavirus PCR NEGATIVE.  PCR positive and negative results were relayed to accepting facility - facility and they were going to refer to epidemiology for follow up.

He received COVID vaccine on 03/26 with Moderna vaccine (second dose) and was doing well until 3 days PTA. In the doctor&#39;s office patient had an EKG that was read as atrial flutter and doctor sent patient to the ED for rule out PE and evaluation of chest pain and shortness of breath. CTA chest showed numerous bilateral pulmonary emboli and evidence of right heart strain. Of note, his father had history of pulmonary embolism as well as rectal cancer. Patient was evaluated by pulmonologist and cardiologist and was started on full-dose anticoagulation for PE treatment. Patient did not report anything different in his life that may have contributed to development of PE (besides COVID vaccine). He denies any prior cardiac history and indicated maintaining an active lifestyle. Patient had symptomatic improvement and was discharged on full-dose rivaroxaban.

This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of PULMONARY EMBOLISM (multiple pulmonary embolism) and DYSPNOEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH) in a 67-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Drug allergy (allergy to Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and Salsalate.Fluconazole) since an unknown date, Hives since an unknown date, Rash (patient develops rash with Zipro.) since an unknown date, Hypertension since an unknown date, Hypercholesterolemia since an unknown date, Prostate cancer since an unknown date and Chronic back pain since an unknown date.    On 26-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (multiple pulmonary embolism) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On 27-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PYREXIA (low grade fever / 100 degree Fahrenheit ) and MYALGIA (MYALGIA). On 28-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MIGRAINE (MIGRAINE) and NAUSEA (NAUSEA). On 29-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (multiple pulmonary embolism), DYSPNOEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH), MIGRAINE (MIGRAINE), PYREXIA (low grade fever / 100 degree Fahrenheit ), MYALGIA (MYALGIA) and NAUSEA (NAUSEA) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Computerised tomogram: for pulmonary embolism in lungs. On an unknown date, Ultrasound Doppler: Negative.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment included were  Sumatriptan, Prednisone and home nebulize albuterol. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable. There was complete workup done and he was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism with CAT scan with dye, multiple pulmonary embolism in the lungs, Ultrasound in legs which was negative. He reports that his D-dimer were very high. In conclusion his imaging and D-dimer pointed towards the pulmonary embolism diagnosis.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.       Concurrent medical conditions included Heart transplant (0.58 years from treatment for COVID-19) and Cardiomyopathy (Cause for heart transplant was Nonischemic cardiomyopathy). Concomitant products included TACROLIMUS, MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL and PREDNISONE for Immunosuppression.    On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced COVID-19 (covid-19 infection) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), HYPOXIA (hypoxia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), COUGH (Cough) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), CHILLS (Chills) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and VACCINE BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION (Covid-19 infection 19 days after COVID-19 vaccine). The patient was hospitalized for 5 days due to ASTHENIA, CHILLS, COUGH, COVID-19, HYPOXIA and LUNG INFILTRATION. At the time of the report, COVID-19 (covid-19 infection), HYPOXIA (hypoxia), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate), COUGH (Cough), ASTHENIA (weakness) and CHILLS (Chills) outcome was unknown and VACCINE BREAKTHROUGH INFECTION (Covid-19 infection 19 days after COVID-19 vaccine) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Blood creatinine: &gt;0.3 mg/dl milligram per decilitre (abnormal) &gt;0.3 mg/dl. On an unknown date, Lymphopenia: &lt;900/mcl (abnormal) &lt;900/mcL. On an unknown date, Oxygen saturation: &lt;92% (abnormal) Hypoxia. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) Negative.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patients were comparable to those of solid organ transplant patients (SOTs) who had COVID-19 infection and have not been vaccinated. Antinucleocapside antibody at COVID-19 diagnosis was also negative. Treatment for COVID-19 was with Remdesivir and Convalescent Plasma. Patient was discharged on 2 liters of oxygen.  Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The date of vaccine administration, onset date for the events and the date for the antibody test are required for further evaluation. Based on the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. However, immunocompromised state in solid organ transplant patients may remain as risk factors for reduced immune response and infection.

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

Then at 9:00pm on March 15,2021, a sudden fever of 102.5 occurred, giving a significant feeling of unwellness, but with no cold or flu like symptoms.  I took Tylenol and the 102.5 fever dropped to 100 within hours.   The next morning the fever was gone, but an unwellness feeling remained with no cold or flu like symptoms.  Fever returned later that day but only to 99.2 and then was back normal that day.  The next day a uneasy unwellness feeling with no cold or flu like symptoms occurred, with no fever.   The third day I was recovered.   I had no social interactions between the day I received dose 1 on Feb 27.  Symptoms on Feb. 27th were minor.  No fever.

                                                Approximately 10 days after the vaccination I began to develop muscle and joint pain on my left side. two days later I started to have problems breathing and the muscle pain, all on my left side, worsened. A day or two later I developed a fever of 102 and the muscle and joint pain became worse, again all on the left side of my body. To treat the fever I took Motrin, this also helped with the headache. I also had a lose of appetite as these symptoms progressed and lost about 7 pounds. I developed a cough that persisted for about 7 days. These symptoms were intense for about three days and persisted at varying intensity for about 10 days.

After my second shot I asked to see my Dr. to talk about this shortness of breath issue as it had gotten progressively worse. He was not available so I was brought in to see a nurse, who checked my vitals etc  and told me  she was calling an ambulance to bring me to a hospital of my choice. I was brought to the hospital and the found my blood count down to 5.1. My last blood count check was in January and it was at 11.0. I have never had a low blood count issue prior to this. While at the hospital I was given three pints of blood and as of this day 3/11/21, I have received nine more pints and no resolve as of yet.  There is no internal bleeding evident.

                                                He received his vaccine, had a sore arm and that evening around 7 hours later it was as if a switch flipped he was not able to breath, and his wife noticed on his body she could see all his veins like a track on his trunk and everywhere.  He could not talk.   He said that he was burning up, was hot and clammy.  He got in the shower to cool himself down, and was told that the oxygen was not getting to where it was supposed to go.  His wife called 9-1-1 and the EMT&#39;s said that his oxygen had dropped down into the 60&#39;s. He went to the hospital and they said he had pulmonary edema that filled his lungs that quickly.  He was not intubated, and is on a BiPAP.  He was given Lasix, steroids, antibiotics trying to pull the fluid off of his lungs.  He has had so many different scenarios from people at the hospital right now and at one time one of his nurses said that his blood work showed a possible blood clot.  They looked at his lungs and they said that they did not see it in his lungs.  Then they said that he had a heart attack and that he needed a valve replacement.  Today, 3/25/21 they told him that he did not have a heart attack, did not need a valve replacement.  Last night they said that his BP was dangerously high and today, his BP is fine.  He also had an adverse reaction to the steroids and had a ROID rage from that as well giving the nurses and his wife a hard time, hanging up the phone on her, and said that he was leaving the hospital.   He was fine prior to the vaccine, and does not have any other issues for him to have this reaction.  He is in ICU and they keep saying that they are going to put him in a cardiac care unit.  He has a lot of IV lines and his 2nd COVID test came back negative.   He feels like they are just running test to get money out of him.  They said that he may be able to go home tomorrow.

H ehad similar incident in 2012 after Reclast second dose. Had flushing first and then asthma flare. Lasted a couple weeks with just inhalers then had to do prednisone to calm it down. When tapered off he relapsed and had to do three iterations over a couple months.  After the second vaccine on Thursday AM, he was well until about 9PM that night, he developed sore throat and coughing that progressed through the night. On Friday AM he started using his nebulizer with albuterol and budesonide. His symptoms were manageable over the weekend. On Monday he coughed up a large collection of clear mucus and felt much better. On Wednesday 3/17, symptoms returned with cough and shortness of breath. He was started on a single dose of prednisone 40 mg and on Thursday he was seen in clinic. His symptoms seemed to be a mix of laryngeal and chest irritation. He was given an 8-day tapering course of prednisone and albuterol-ipratropium nebs every 6 hours. On follow up 3/25, he was much better except for side effects of the steroids. He is still being followed so I will provide updates if there is some change. He had a very similar reaction to Reclast in 2012 but has tolerated all other vaccines previously.

He awoke from his sleep with palpitations and chest pain.  He said he maybe  breathing was affected. He arose from his bed, sat in a chair, and sipped warm water with easing of discomfort. Although he had a NTG, he did not choose to take any, nor did he check his pulse.  Not wishing to repeat the experience, he refused a second vaccination.

                                                Patient is a 70 y.o. male w/ h/o CHF,HTN, sleep apnea on CPAP and 2 L O2 at night, IDDM, CKD stage III-IV, prior tested positive for SARS-CoV2 (12/2020) presented to SAMC ED w/ the complaint of SOB.    Pt states he received his 2nd dose of Moderna SARS-CoV2 immunization 4 days prior to arrival and developed SOB since then. He states that the SOB progressed and included coughing productive of bloody/blood-tinged sputum. The main reason he decided to come to the hospital was because of his shortness of breath and associated chest tightness which he says radiated into his abdomen.    In the ED he was found to have new RBBB and troponin 7.2. He was seen by cardiology d/t concern for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, and taken to the cath lab. There he was found to have RCA lesions x2: the more proximal underwent stent placement, the more distal lesion was unable to be stented. Post-procedure pt&#39;s respiratory status was tenuous and therefore CCM was consulted. Patient discharged 9 days after admission after somewhat rocky course of recovery.

                                                severe bilateral pneumonia; hypoxia; shortness of breath; This spontaneous case was reported by a health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of PNEUMONIA (severe bilateral pneumonia) and HYPOXIA (hypoxia) in a 70-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Tobacco user since an unknown date, Hyperlipidemia since an unknown date, Chronic pancreatitis since an unknown date, Hypertension since an unknown date and Diabetes mellitus since an unknown date. Concomitant products included INSULIN GLARGINE (LANTUS), INSULIN LISPRO (HUMALOG), METFORMIN, OMEPRAZOLE, ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE (LEXAPRO), ASA, PROPRANOLOL and OXYCODONE for an unknown indication.    On 04-Apr-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath). On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PNEUMONIA (severe bilateral pneumonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and HYPOXIA (hypoxia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized on 10-Apr-2021 due to HYPOXIA and PNEUMONIA. At the time of the report, PNEUMONIA (severe bilateral pneumonia), HYPOXIA (hypoxia) and DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Blood test: normal wbc 17.3 with 79% neutrophils and 1.2 lymphocytes.. On an unknown date, Brain natriuretic peptide normal: normal normal. On an unknown date, Computerized tomogram: abnormal chest with collapse of the left upper lobe with dense consolidation with possible mass like density occupying much of the left upper lobe bronchus, diffuse ground glass opacities throughout the left lung are seen and ground glass opacities of the right upper lobe and right lower lobe are seen infectious/inflammatory. there is also mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy seen.. On an unknown date, Influenza: negative negative. On an unknown date, Procalcitonin: normal normal. On an unknown date, Productive cough: normal normal. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative negative.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.

                                                3 days prior to receiving his covid 19 vaccine, the pt had a sedated bronchoscopy at hospital. At the time, no lung tissue samples were taken due to no symptoms of rejection. Within a few days to a week of receiving his covid 19 vaccine, he started experiencing shortness of breath, returned to the transplant doctor at hospital and was diagnosed with rejection.   The timeline suggest to me that this could have been induced by the vaccine. I requested that  the transplant coordinator make the report, but she said the rejection had nothing to do with the vaccine.   Hospital is currently doing a study concerning rejection post covid vaccine in transplant patients.   I want the accurate information reported

At on or around 8:45 PM my dad called my sister that he was having trouble breathing and felt very short of breath. My sister was there in about 7min by the time she got to him my dad was gasping for air he would lift his head up trying to breath. They got him to the hospital shorty after about a 7 min drive. My dad was taken into hospital we were not able to go in due to restrictions.

No prior medical history and concomitant medications were reported.     On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     The patient experienced the events like severe COPD, could not breathe, had chest pressure, pressure in the neck, rapid heartrate (have extra heartbeat), premature ventricular contractions and swelling in face on 12 Feb 2021.  The reported case is serious as the events, severe COPD, could not breathe, had chest pressure, pressure in the neck, rapid heartrate (have extra heartbeat), premature ventricular contractions and swelling in face lead to hospitalization and resulted in prolonged hospitalization.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.     The outcome of the events were considered not resolved and the patient is still in.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

They found D/Dima was elevated and sent me for a CT scan.  This showed a significant blood clot in the right lung and a lesser clot in the left.   I am usually extremly health, walking 2 miles at least 5 days a week and bicycing about 50 miles per week

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

                                                Patient presented with sharp right lower quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and emesis beginning the day he received the COVID vaccine, after vaccine injection. He had decreased appetite and pain was made worse by eating.  He presented to the hospital 3 days (2/6/21) after receiving the vaccine/symptom onset. His vital signs were T 101.5, HR 78, BP 156/67, RR 20, SpO2 94 on RA.   As discussed below, imaging showed acalculous cholecysitis. The day after presentation, pain was more localized to RUQ.  He was treated with IV ceftriaxone and flagyl. He underwent percutaneous cholecystomy tube place on 2/7/21 with plan for delayed cholecystectomy following drain placement x 6 weeks. Bile fluid culture has been no growth. We are attempting to test bile fluid for COVID-19 via PCR.   He tested positive for COVID-19 via nasal swab RT-PCR and developed a 3L oxygen requirement and mild dyspnea. He was treated with remdesivir and dexamathasone 2/6-2/10 with resolution of hypoxia and dyspnea.

Of more concern, when I lay down for bed, I felt a heavy weight in my upper chest, making breathing painful.  Use of my CPAP machine allowed me to get some sleep.  these symptoms continues for 4 days, after which they subsided.

Now a week or two after the 2nd shot, I&#39;m having significant shortness of breath after very little exertion. I did NOT have breathing issues when I had the COVID back in NOVEMBER. I called my Doctor on 03/15/2021 and he prescribed WIXELA and MONTELUKAST , so far though and it&#39;s only been a few days, I see no improvement. I just felt like since it might be COVID related, I should at least let someone know about it. I feel fine other than when I do minor physical stuff, even tying my shoes will leave me gasping for air.

                                                Both my mother and father had their shots on the same day.  Mother (77) had mild fatigue the day after the shot with some arm soreness.  She was fine after about a day.  My father reported  arm soreness and fatigue that lasted about three days after the shot.  He thought he was rebounding from the shot and continued his usual activities.  Though, he started complaining of being &#34;winded&#34; and difficulty breathing.  He slept a lot and continued with fatigue and shallow breathing.  A week after his shot he felt he needed to go to the ER because of difficulty breathing and being exhausted after walking up a flight of stairs (we live in a raised ranch style house).

Pt. only has muscle function in the right side of his body due to his stroke damage. His wife immediately approached him in his chair and asked him what was wrong and all he was able to state was &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; before loosing consciousness and stopping breathing. 911 was immediately called and due to his wife being frail herself she was not able to remove him from his wheelchair to perform any CPR. EMS arrived and begin performing CPR until the DNR papers for pt. were located. Medical examiner came to the home and stated she did not feel that an autopsy was needed even though family had told her NUMEROUS times that pt. had received his second Covid vaccine the day prior. He was pronounced dead by the medical examiner and taken directly to the funeral home due to the DNR papers being present.

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

Later, I noticed that the muscles on my right side over my ribs were tightened and later the intercostal spaces of my ribs started hurting very badly and it made breathing very painful and difficult and the pain stretched around my ribs and to my back. If I drew a deep breath I would experience a sharp stabbing pain. Lying down vertically was very painful and uncomfortable. I took my temperature and it was 97.5 which is a little high for me. my blood oxygen level was 99 which was good. on the 16th I woke up and the stiff neck was gone and my headache was a little better. My temp was 98.5 which is 1.1 degrees of fever for me.

                                                Patient called this afternoon to report decreased oxygen levels after agency.   Patient reports to have COPD and remains on oxygen. He reports after the administration his oxygen levels will dip as low as to 70 percent when oxygen is removed. Upon speaking to the patient he did admit to feeling bad several days before the administration in which he had a physician&#39;s office visit due to complaints of chest pain. The patient said the physician preformed x-rays and EKG to evaluate his symptoms. All test reported no abnormal findings. The physician changed his breathing medication and added steroid therapy for a few days to help him recover. This apt occurred on Tuesday 23rd. The administration occurred on Friday 26th. The patient said they experienced the &#34;trouble breathing&#34; during the weekend. He contacted his physician again on Monday the 1st and reported the vaccine had made him worse. Unfortunately he contacted them at 4:15 in the after before the office closed and they told him to report to the ER if he was in discomfort. He called me today the report the issue at 4:30ish. I was able to reach out to his pulmonary physician to confirm his therapy and previous apt and complaints.  They instructed me to tell the patient to make an appointment if needed.   The patient does not fill medication here. On the vaccination form he denied feeling unwell as well as denied the use of steroid therapy.

Wednesday 1/6/21 swelling had spread significantly to inside the right side of mouth and tongue also affecting right jaw. By 3 Pm that day my tongue was numb and swollen on the right side as well as the right side of my mouth and jaw. I could only chew, eat, and swallow effectively on the left side of my mouth using the left side of my tongue to negotiate eating.  I could only this with small amounts of food. By that evening about 4 hours later I could eat , chew etc. pretty good but the swelling &amp; discomfort remained but reduced to a functional level.  Today, Thursday 1/7/21, the soreness and discomfort remains inside throat, mouth, tongue and jaw all on the right side.

Stayed in the pharmacy for about 45 minutes. Felt the breathing difficulty going away so decided to drive home. The breathing difficulty came back when I reached home (a 5-minute drive).  Feel asleep; woke up after about an hour and the breathing difficulty is completely gone. Have not felt it again until this report date (1/22/21 1:16am).

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

                                                On February 21 I had my first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. The next morning I experienced a mild 24-hour flu with low fever, fatigue and diminished appetite. My left arm, where I had the injection, was mildly sore. The following day all was fine. At 10:40am March 21 I had the second Moderna vaccination at the same location. By 7pm that day I began to feel flu-like symptoms. By 9pm I had a fever of about 102 degrees, moderate chills and sweats. By midnight I could barely sit up in bed to go to the bathroom, and had to steady myself on the walls as I walked. At one point during the night I began gasping for air and breathing hoarsely. I woke up hourly all night. Throughout Monday the weakness continued. I was slightly nauseous, developed mild diarrhea, and emptied the bowels. Zero appetite; drank lots of cold water. Slept the same as Sunday night with occasional chills and sweats. No more gasping episodes though. Tuesday ? Thursday I improved very gradually. Ate small amounts of plain yogurt, then plain toast. A low-grade fever came and went. I rested in bed all day and slept fitfully. Still very weak. Fast forward to March 31, 10 days after the shot. My appetite is OK now, no fever for several days, energy level about 85% of normal. I am very appreciative of getting the vaccine. The intense reaction to the second injection was startling, as my health has generally been excellent. I have masked and kept socially distant since last March.

After starting the infusion he developed sudden onset shortness of breath.  He is noted to be wheezing.  He was given Solu-Medrol and benadryl prior to transfer to ED.   Acute hypoxic respiratory failure in patient with recent Covid diagnosis with sudden worsening during monoclonal antibody infusion.  Differential includes allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, flash pulmonary edema, worsening Covid. Given the wheezing he was given a DuoNeb with no significant improvement but may be slightly decreased wheezing.  Patient was placed on BiPAP given concern for pulmonary edema and increased work of breathing.  We were able to titrate down the FiO2 to 40%.  He was transitioned to high flow nasal cannula.  Will admit to the hospital for further supportive cares given Covid and hypoxic respiratory failure.

About 5 minutes into the waiting time, patient said he was getting light headed. It was noticed he was taking deep, sharp breaths causing his mask to go in his mouth. We switched him to a chair with arms and asked him to remove his jacket and called 911 as a precautionary as the breathing pattern was not improving.  EMS arrived to ask the patient how he was feeling and he said he had a dry mouth and was thirsty. At this time, it was aout 15 minutes after the vaccination. Patient refused transport and asked for water. I asked EMS if that was advisable now that he declined transport and it was beyond the 15 minutes. EMS was still near the patient. Patient was provided water and was able to remove his mask to drink and was much more coherent afterwards. He stayed in the pharmacy area about 20 minutes. He was asked to have his wife drive, which he refused.

                                                Patient was into the clinic yesterday for his first COVID vaccine.  Patient had no contraindications for the vaccine.  Vaccine was administered to right deltoid.  Patient then was asked to sit in the waiting room for 15 minutes for observation.  Patient was sitting in waiting room and developed shortness of breath and dizziness.  Patient vitals signed were obtained blood pressure was elevated 150s/100, heart rate 120s, oxygen level upper 90&#39;s on room air.  Patient was brought to an exam room where he could lay down via wheelchair.  Multiple vital signs were taken during the duration of his time at the clinic.  Blood pressure did come down to 140s/90s, sats remained in  upper 90s, heart rate came down to 70-80.  Patient remained dizzy the entire time.  Patient states that he has a history of idiopathic angioedema as well as a heart stent.  Patient goes on the explain that at different times he can have swelling internally.  He has had this happen several times in the past to his abdomen, saliva glands, tongue, as well as extremities.  Patient and his wife called his primary care physician and MD advised if episode did not resolve to go to the ER.  After waiting in the clinic for around 45 minutes the patients wife decided it would be best to go to the ER.  EMS was notified. Ambulance responded.  Patient was transported via ambulance to ER.    Patient wife was called the afternoon of the incident.  She states that patient was admitted to the hospital for observation.  He was treated with Benadryl, Pepcid, Decadron; CT of head was normal; blood pressure was still elevated; and they were not sure what was the cause of the episode.  I called the patient&#39;s wife on 1-29-21 to check on patient again.  His wife stated that he was been discharged home.  They were unsure what caused the episode and to follow up with primary physician in one week.  She states that at one week follow up visit they would discuss the need/desire for second COVID vaccine.  .

He is still hospitalized but improving as of the date of this report. His COVID-19 test was negative on the day of admission. He had no symptoms out of the ordinary on the day of his vaccination. I am reporting this as it occurred in the week after his first dose of vaccine though would suspect the timing is likely coincidental rather than directly related to the vaccine.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

                                                One week after 2nd Moderna, started coughing periodically in day and night chest conjestion started to build at night. After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?
