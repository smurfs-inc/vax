                                                Syncope; Shaking; Struggling to breathe; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 90-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included warfarin, ezetimibe, bupropion, finasteride, tamsulosin, furosemide, potassium chloride, rosuvastatin, and nitrofurantoin.    On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient stayed at the vaccination site for fifteen minutes to watch for any reaction, he had none, so he left. Later that night the patient began shaking and struggling to breathe, so 911 was called. At the hospital, the patient was diagnosed with syncope. He spent overnight in the hospital and had an echocardiogram the following day. No results were provided for the echo, but the patient was cleared to go home after a sixteen-hour hospital stay. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The outcome of the events, syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe, was resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 90 year-old, male patient, who experienced events of syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.  The events occurred the same night after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

                                                Patient had started peritoneal dialysis at home with me, his wife, 8 days before the second shot. All was going well. We got his second shot on the morig of March 18.  His only reaction seemed to be soreness at injection site. At 11 pm we started dialysis as usual, with the cycler.  At 12 pm he was having trouble breathing after just having been filled with 1500 ml of dialysate. This was the first time this happened. I gave hi nitro glycerine and had the cycler take out the 1500 ml of dialysate, and stopped the therapy for the night. He then felt better, and apologized for waking me up. In the morning he was dead.  I believe it is possible that the vaccine tipped the balance of patients already taxed system. As I know that people who have serious diseases and are older are encouraged to take the vaccine, this outcome should be known to the CDC.

                                                right sided pneumonia; having difficulty breathing; cyanotic; coughing; sounded congested; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning a 92-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced right sided pneumonia, difficulty breathing, cyanotic, cough and sounded congested.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included Alzheimer&#39;s, hypertension, arteriosclerotic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, covid-19, allergy to aricept and exelon. The concomitant medications reported included atorvastatin, tamsulosin hydrochloride, paracetamol, macrogol 3350, furosemide and ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulfate for unspecified indications.  On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 26 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k208) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient was on droplet isolation due to possible exposure of Covid 19 and received duoneb treatments for chronic nonproductive cough. The patient also received honey consistency fluids.  On 19 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s droplet precautions were discontinued.  On 26 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced difficulty breathing, cyanotic, cough and sounded congested following which the patient was repositioned. The  lab findings included oxygen saturation at 78 percent on room air, so oxygen was applied at 2L which increased oxygen saturation at 88 percent, so oxygen was increased to 4L and oxygen saturation increased to 95percent, body temperature at 103.1 degree Fahrenheit, blood pressure 188/110 mmHg, respiratory rate at 28 breaths per minute, pulse rate at 128 heartbeat per minute. The patient was then sent to the Hospital emergency room (ER) where he was diagnosed with right sided pneumonia.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome for the events, right sided pneumonia, difficulty breathing, cyanotic, cough and sounded congested was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 92-year-old, male patient. The patient&#39;s medical history od Alzheimer&#39;s, hypertension, arteriosclerotic heart disease, prostate cancer, covid-19, on duoneb treatments for chronic nonproductive cough remains as contributing factors. Very limited information regarding this event  has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                In the early morning hours of Saturday 2/27, Dad woke with severe pain in his right arm, shoulder and shoulder blade.  He realized the right side of his neck was swollen and his throat was swollen as well. He was having trouble swallowing, talking and his breathing felt obstructed. He tried to awaken my Mother but she couldn&#39;t understand what he was saying. He finally managed to get up with on walker and make his way to get a drink of water. After that his throat seemed to loosen up some and by later in the morning  the swelling had subsided. He did not inform me until I called later in that morning to check on them and he did not feel he needed to see a doctor.

                                                2/14 Emergency room HPI Patient is a 94 y.o. male who presents with complaint of cough that started about a week ago, and was seen by primary care provider on the 9th February 2021.  Patient was started on Augmentin and has taken it for about 5 days but said the cough is worse and productive of clear sputum.  Patient in ER to get checked for pneumonia.  Patient denies a fever or chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea vomiting and no headache or dizziness. Transferred to another facility h&amp;pHistory of Present Illness:  94-year-old former smoker with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not currently on anticoagulation, coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, CKD 4, prostate cancer on surveillance, TAVR 2/17, with a son who is a doctor and a caregiver who is a Radiology NP by his report, who presents in transfer from previous Hospital due to a large right pleural effusion.  He has had a cough for some time now, but thinks it may have worsened, at least per his caregiver, over the last 4-5 days.  He was seen by his PCP on February 9th and placed on Augmentin, but nothing changed.  He himself denies being short of breath, having any chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, change in appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea.  Of note, on a chest x-ray in June he had bilateral pleural effusions, and on an MRI in July to investigate a renal mass, he was noted to have a small right-sided pleural effusion.        On arrival to facility this morning, he was afebrile, normotensive, had a normal heart rate, sometimes mildly bradycardic, normal respiratory rate and saturations of 97% on room air.  Labs demonstrated chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, stable stage 4 kidney disease creatinine of 2.6, BUN 64, glucose 187.  Chest x-ray demonstrated a moderate right pleural effusion, noting that underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  He was also felt to have bibasilar atelectasis.  CT of the chest without contrast showed a large right pleural effusion with most of the right lower lobe being collapsed.  Superimposed infection could not be excluded.  He had a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and a small pericardial effusion as well.  EKG and procalcitonin were not performed.  He was sent to our facility for thoracentesis.         On arrival here, vitals remained stable.  His bedside RN informed me that upon returning from the bathroom, he appeared to be a bit dyspneic, but the patient himself denies any shortness of breath or ?huffing and puffing?. 2/25 admEd to hospital admission

They were told that he aspirated and that was how he developed pneumonia. Patient reported having a CT scan but was unsure if they did a chest x-ray. Patient was on oxygen but not a ventilator. Patient was not admitted to the ICU but was on the COVID wing at the hospital.
