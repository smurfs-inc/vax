                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.

                                                Currently having it. I have a swollen face. Blurry vision. Difficulty standing. Shallow breaths. Headache. Chills. Body aches. 101 fever. Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

This subsided after a short while (within 15) minutes after I left the vaccine location. I arrived home and felt fatigue and a  slight headache develop.  The headache has since stopped. I also experienced some chills. No fever as of yet. Soreness at injection site is moderate.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On the same day, 11 Feb 2021, the patient developed fever with a body temperature of 102 (unknown units). On 02 Mar 2021, three weeks after his second dose, the consumer stated that her son was exposed to his girlfriend who had COVID. The consumer stated that his girlfriend, her roommates and four male friends that were visiting also contracted the COVID virus. The consumer reported that eight of ten people that were at girlfriend&#39;s house, contracted the COVID virus. The consumer stated that the patient had fever, a hard time breathing, and chest congestion. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of events, chest congestion, Contracted COVID three weeks after second dose/exposed to someone with COVID, hard time breathing, and fever were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and the known safety profile of the vaccine, a causal association between the event of fever and mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The event of COVID s not consistent with the vaccine profile and is of an infective etiology, hence assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Pulmonary congestion and dyspnea are assessed as symptoms of COVID-19 also assessed as unlikely related.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

                                                I took the FIRST dose of the Moderna vaccine this Tuesday on the  20th of April at 11:30 AM. Around 10:00 PM Wednesday I have been feeling short of breath. This feeling has persisted throughout the entire day of Thursday and I continue to feel the same way (I think it has slightly worsened). I can breath, but I am completely unable to take a full, deep breath. I sometimes can achieve a full deep breath but it&#39;s completely at random. I find myself trying to forcefully take a deep breath but can&#39;t seem to fully fill my lungs how I normally am able to.  Additionally, my throat feels mildly swollen/sore, starting from the back of my mouth and down my esophagus. The lowest point of my esophagus at which I feel the soreness/mild swelling is near the center of my chest.  I think my shortness of breath is progressively, and slowly worsening, but its hard to tell for certain. Some of the muscles around my back are beginning to feel uncomfortable due to me constantly trying to forcefully achieve a full and deep breath.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

I couldn&#39;t stand up and was scared to walk, so I was put on a stretcher. My throat started to close up. I was put in an ambulance and my throat swelled more on the trip to the ER. They gave me Benadryl and Prednisone. I was there for about 4 or 5 hours. I was okay after that. I checked the CDC site and it said I couldn&#39;t take the 2nd dose.
