                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.     History obtained from:  ? patient                    ? outpatient clinicians  ? family                                  ? staff at facility  ? other                                   ? review of medical record as summarized below   Pt unable to provide reliable history because: ?

Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

Headaches, body ache, tired, sore arm, slight difficulty breathing, and slightly faster heart rate. Those didn&#39;t really concern me since i took it as the vaccine is working like it?s supposed to. but starting yesterday when i woke up until this moment i?ve had a really weird pinching feeling by my heart and the side of my rib cage on the left side of my chest. that?s the only thing scaring me now since my other side effects have already gone away.

I am concerned it may be myocarditis, and I have not seen a medical professional for this. I recovered after two days but sometimes experience pangs of chest pain time to time.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

I checked the pt&#39;s pulse, it was normal. He complained he was feeling worse, I instructed him to stop drinking water and to lay down and elevate his legs. I had a staff call 911 as the pt was complining he was having trouble breathing. The paramedics showed up before I could check his blood pressure. They checked his vitals then motiored the pt for 15 minutes. They then cleared him to leave when he felt ok.

                                                Admission HPI: Right-sided chest pain began 2 days prior to admission (3/19) after getting out of car, without identifiable trigger. Pain was sharp, pleuritic, and worst with movement; didn&#39;t feel it when still. Pain not responsive to ibuprofen or heating packs. Reported 30-60 seconds of self-resolving heart racing during ocular migraine which has been his baseline for years. Not associated with SOB (at rest or with exercise), palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. No viral URI symptoms, N/V, or rash. He did receive his 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine about 1 week PTA, followed by 36hrs of fevers, chills, and body aches. Given persistence of pain, Patient asked his parents to present to urgent care.   In UC, he was noted to tachycardic with CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and b/l effusions, per report. Given continued tachycardia, decision was made to transfer to ED to r/o PE.      In ED, tachycardic to 104-116 and tachypneic 22-26. Had one episode of tachycardia to 182 iso ocular migraine. Endorsed chest pain but points to R middle abdomen when asked where worst. Exam was unremarkable. He received 1 dose of morphine which reduced pain from 10/10 to 0/10. Labs notable for leukocytosis (14.61), thrombocytopenia (422), elevated d-dimer (1.56), and elevated CRP (5.6). Otherwise normal chem and coags. COVID/RVP negative. CXR unremarkable. CTPA showed scattered PEs in b/l lower lobes with small pulmonary infarct in RML. No evidence of right heart strain. Heme was consulted who recommended starting him on lovenox and sending lupus anti-coagulant. Cardiology was consulted who recommended EKG, BNP, and troponin, all of which were normal and reassuring against right heart strain. ECHO was therefore deferred to the AM. The decision was made to admit.   Upon arrival to the floor, Patient was tachycardic 114 and tachypneic to 22, otherwise stable vitals. He denied any pain since morphine. Denied any unexpected weight loss; reports that car ride was short. Mom reports that Patient has been less active d/t cold weather and baseball being on hold. Denies family or personal history of clots. Last seizure ~13 years ago.  Hospital Course: (3/21 - 3/22)  Patient was admitted to the hematology service. He was therapeutically anticoagulated with LMWH injections and his anti-Xa level prior to discharge was 0.92. (goal 0.5-1.0) Lower extremity ultrasound with Doppler showed patent veins and no evidence of DVT and upper extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, though there was potential evidence of collateralization seen in mid and distal third of right subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Since this was an unprovoked PE, a full thrombophilia workup was sent and will be followed up by the outpatient hematology clinic. Cardiology consulted regarding possibility of right heart strain and the tachycardia during migraine episodes. Echocardiogram performed on 3/22 was technically limited but showed no gross abnormalities. The cardiology team requested a repeat echo scheduled outpatient for 1-2 months after discharge.

                                                Patient came to the pharmacy to get his first Moderna COVID vaccine today with his mom. After 15 minutes after receiving vaccine, he stated he felt dizziness, warmness, and flushing. I was able to elevate his feet and provide some cold water for him. After 10 minutes, he stated he felt his airway was getting closed and tongue was getting swollen. We decided to call 911 and provided Benadryl 50mg and Epipen for him. His blood pressure was 114/90 when EMS arrived. Since his vital was normal, EMS gave options to go to emergency room or urgent care. His mom and he chose to go to urgent care since he was getting better. I was able to follow up with his mom and he is going to take Benadryl for 2 days and follow up with Additional information for Item 18: his family physician. I will follow up with his doctor as well.

He stated he felt like he was going to pass out and was out of breath.  His supervisor sent him home.  He attempted to drive home and swerved off the road.  He parked his car and got a ride home.  He slept for several hours.  He stated he is feeling better this evening.  Now he has a headache, but does not have dizziness, unsteady gait, or feeling like he will pass out.  I advised him that headache is a possible side effect of the vaccine, but the other symptoms are uncommon.  I asked him to seek medical attention if the symptoms come back.  He voiced understanding.

                                                On Monday April 12 I had terrible chest pain and it was very hard for me to catch my breath. I tried to get up and walk and became very dizzy. I was then taken to the hospital and my mom stated that while in the car I had a loss of consciousness. Doctors at the hospital came to the conclusion that it was a heart attack but after following up with the cardiologist then he thought I may have myocarditis. Unfortunately I have a pectus excavatum that is being repaired and the mri couldn?t confirm the myocarditis due to the metal in my chest.

                                                I had no symptoms after receiving the first dose, but after receiving the second dose I developed a high fever of 103 degrees as well as body aches, hypersensitivity, dizziness, migraines, and diarrhea. I eventually began taking ibuprofen to manage the symptoms, starting on night one. I then usually took ibuprofen twice a day after that. My symptoms were completely treated by ibuprofen and nearly all of them disappeared when I took it, besides the diarrhea. Oddly I also developed cold sweats when taking ibuprofen, which would dissipate after the ibuprofen stopped working. The symptoms kept coming back, as far as a week later, however, I didn?t have to take as much ibuprofen as before because they were becoming intermittent. Today, I almost got through the whole day without a return of any of my symptoms, until about 11:00 PM, after which all symptoms came back, the difference being that my fever is now low grade. This has been the case for two days now, no symptoms until night, when they all return promptly.

                                                Chest congestion; Contracted Covid 3 weeks after second dose/Exposed to someone with COVID; Hard time breathing; Fever; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient&#39;s mother), regarding a 21 years-old male patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced chest congestion (pulmonary congestion), contracted COVID three weeks after second dose/exposed to someone with COVID (COVID-19), hard time breathing (dyspnea), and fever (pyrexia).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On the same day, 11 Feb 2021, the patient developed fever with a body temperature of 102 (unknown units). On 02 Mar 2021, three weeks after his second dose, the consumer stated that her son was exposed to his girlfriend who had COVID. The consumer stated that his girlfriend, her roommates and four male friends that were visiting also contracted the COVID virus. The consumer reported that eight of ten people that were at girlfriend&#39;s house, contracted the COVID virus. The consumer stated that the patient had fever, a hard time breathing, and chest congestion. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of events, chest congestion, Contracted COVID three weeks after second dose/exposed to someone with COVID, hard time breathing, and fever were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and the known safety profile of the vaccine, a causal association between the event of fever and mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The event of COVID s not consistent with the vaccine profile and is of an infective etiology, hence assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Pulmonary congestion and dyspnea are assessed as symptoms of COVID-19 also assessed as unlikely related.

                                                My left arm was sore starting a few minutes after the vaccine. This soreness last through that night. When I woke up the next day, my arm was extremely sore and I was very dizzy. Additionally, my pulse felt fast but my heartbeat seemed to have less strength. My breathing felt more shallow like I wasn&#39;t getting as much oxygen from the air that I breathed in as I should. For the first two weeks, the dizziness was very strong. Now, at the three-week mark, it is more manageable and life is somewhat returning to normal. I visited an ENT doctor and their diagnosis was that my dizziness was not being caused by a preexisting medical condition.  Their prediction was that I would be fine, though looking back, I downplayed the severity of my vertigo. At its worst, I felt that, when I went for a walk outside, the surface was the Earth was violently spinning through space, with me stuck to the surface. It felt paralyzing. My body felt almost stuck in shock. I was afraid I would be stuck with this dizziness for the rest of my life since it was so long-lasting. Now, I am taking ginger pills and am watching my sodium intake. I feel better but am extra vigilant about taking ginger and not stressing myself too much. I do not plan on getting a second shot since some of my symptoms mirror those of anaphylaxis.

                                                This is a very pleasant and healthy 21-year-old with history of migraines with aura who presents to the ER 2 days after receiving his second Materna vaccine with complaint of chest pain, myalgias and fatigue.  Patient reports normal postvaccination myalgias and fatigue for the last 2 days but had onset of left-sided chest pain that radiates to his upper back and is worse with deep inspiration, some positions and movement of his left upper extremity.  He denies cough, shortness of breath or rash.  He is low risk for pulmonary embolism with PERC score negative for PE.  Screening EKG showed a sinus rhythm with elevated J point in anterior-lateral leads, ? ST elevation in 1 and AVL w questionable reciprocal changes in leads 3 and AVF.  Patient went to CXR.  Clinically very low risk patient for STEMI from CAD.  ? Myocarditis or pericarditis?  No hx of stimulant use or early CAD in family.  Upon reevaluating the patient, clinically he seems to have musculoskeletal chest discomfort, worse with palpation and movement of LUE. Repeated EKG - showed more definative ST elevation through anterior and lateral leads with reciprocal changes in 2, 3, AVF.  Slight ST elevation in AVL.  ? Pericarditis vs myocarditis.     Will call cardiac alert.  Evolving EKG changes.  Discussed with ED physician and Interventional Cardiology, we agreed, patient likely has acute myocarditis clinically.  Very low risk for CAD.  Gave aspirin and heparin.  They will evaluate him.   Labs coming back... wbc 17.4, normal chemistry.  Sending off CRP, ESR.  Troponin pending.   Patient and family appreciative and understanding.   1710 - Follow up call from cardiology.  Stat echo normal wall motion.  With elevated CRP and mild trop 1.6, patient has myocarditis with pericarditis.  Dr very appreciative for the detailed history and physical.  CP free.  Holding off on cath lab.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

                                                Pt received the first of the two-series COVID vaccination at 1512. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down.

                                                Around 11:30pm I started to get chills and my teeth started to chatter. At the same time my body was shaking slightly. I was laying on the couch during the start of it for the above events, this lasted for about 20&#43; minutes. Then I tried to get up to go to bed. I was shaking very badly at this point, teeth chattering a lot and I was very cold. I tried to use the bathroom and I couldn&#39;t even stand still to use the bathroom. My chest was also tightening and it was hard to breathe.   I went to bed to lay down and I was practically hyperventilating for about 15 minutes at a time and I would stop for a minute then it would start up again. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn&#39;t because I couldn&#39;t breathe and my chest was closing in, it felt like.   I called my parents in and they sat with me and gave me ibuprofen and benedryl. I started to feel better after about an hour. During that time, though, my body was extremely hot (but no fever) but I was still cold and had the chills. My head also was hurting like a headache and my eyes were really hot too. It was hard to get air and if I sat up I would get dizzy.

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34;  Before the adverse event, I was experiencing chills, fatigue, nausea, and a small fever. I then fell asleep. I woke up at 1:30am to brush my teeth but I couldn&#39;t take full breaths. When I was trying to take full breaths, I could only get ~70% of an inhale. This lasted for about 10 minutes. I then experienced the rest of the symptoms, minus vomitting for the rest of the day.

                                                Around 3 pm on 4/14/21, I started to feel very tired and I started to get a headache. Around 6 pm, I started to experience lower back pain and my legs began to throb and my whole body became very sensitive to touch. I took tylenol or ibuprofen every 4 hours for the rest of the night. This went on until Thursday 4/15/21, when the dizziness and throbbing headache started. Every time I would stand up I would become off balanced and need to hold on to something. I was still experiencing the lower back pain, leg throbbing and skin sensitivity but the dizziness and headache became much more intense. Around 9:30  pm on Thursday, I felt like I was hallucinating and was experiencing euphoria along with a fever. I did not sleep the night of 4/15 into 4/16. I was sweating profusely with a throbbing headache that would cause spinning when I would stand up. Around 3 am on 4/16, I fell asleep until around 4:30 am when I woke up in a pool of my own sweat. The body aches, leg pain and skin sensitivity went away along with my fever. Throughout Friday 4/16, I had a throbbing headache and was dizzy with no relief. This continued into Sunday 4/18 when I started to feel some relief. My headache was pretty much gone but the dizziness is still very much there. I have also an experienced elevated heart rate and respirations throughout the last 5 days.

                                                Approximately 3 to 5 minutes after immunization, patient was observed  in a waiting room chair unconscious, unresponsive and not breathing (respiration was not immediately observable or recognizable).  Patient was carefully and quickly placed in a supine position on the floor.  Pulse was present but the patient was completely unresponsive.  Respiration was not observed.  EMS was immediately notified.  Pharmacist and staff prepared for resuscitation and utilization of Epinephrine if needed.  Patients face was flushed, arms became flushed and the patients skin became moist.  After approximately  45 seconds in the supine position the patients eyes opened and he became responsive to auditory communication.  Respiration became reestablished.  BP was recorded at 130/91 with a pulse of 91 BPM.  EMS arrived on scene and provided further evaluation.  After an additional 5-10 minutes, patient was completely conscious and coherent.  Patient indicated that he had a similar experience in a grocery store over 1 year ago that was unrelated to immunization and was attributed to dehydration.  Patient refused additional medical care or transport to ED.  Patient was released to a friend who drove him home.  Patient was observed 1 day later picking up his car from the pharmacy and has recovered.  Patient was advised to seek additional medical evaluation to assess the root cause of this event.

                                                * Tuesday, March 16th, I received my first Moderna shot. No immediate symptoms, felt fine. * Thursday, March 25th (9 days post-vaccination), I was sitting at my desk and experienced some kind of visual distortion (my computer monitor bounced up and down 4 times in quick succession, even though I was perfectly still). Got up from my desk and laid down, and it went away. * Tuesday, March 30th (two weeks post-vaccination), I started experiencing persistent dizziness/imbalance. It was manageable for the first couple of days, and I still went about my daily activities. * Thursday, April 1st, symptoms got noticeably worse. I had a really bad episode of vertigo/dizziness in the afternoon. This spell of bad symptoms lasted until Saturday evening/Sunday morning. I wasn?t falling down, but I would describe it as akin to being on a boat in rough seas or a plane flying through a storm. Pressure in head and ears was intense. I?ve had longstanding tinnitus, but pitch/volume definitely seemed to change somewhat. My neck was incredibly stiff, and my throat felt somewhat ?tight? (tonsils or lymph nodes in neck felt enlarged). Took ibuprofen and Benadryl on and off over next several days. * Tuesday, April 27th, symptoms are ongoing. Still having imbalance, dizziness, and non-spinning vertigo, though less severe than previously.

                                                It started off with me becoming really irritable over the smallest things.  I started getting cold chills even though it was 70F.  I had a nightmare that felt like an eternity. My dreams get warped when I&#39;m sick.  I woke up and I had a headache that was centered around several spots in my head. I couldn&#39;t get comfortable no matter what I did.  It&#39;s impossible to lay down on the side you get the shot on. It hurt like... 7x more than the first one when they&#39;re administering it.  The scariest symptoms though, for me, was that I couldn&#39;t catch my breath. You know when you take a hot shower and you can&#39;t really breathe 100% because of the steam? That&#39;s how I felt all day after the 2nd dose. Also, I couldn&#39;t tell if I was full or not when I ate. The only way I could tell was stomach pains.   That&#39;s all that&#39;s happening/has happened to me. I do feel better alot better though two days after having the 2nd dose.

                                                The patient experienced body aches and headache within the first 24-48 hours of receiving the vaccine. On 4/1/2021, the patient had swelling around his eyes at around noon. He stated that he feels that the swelling worsened that night but this morning (4/2/21) the swelling has improved. He came to the clinic this morning to check in regarding his symptoms. I called in PA to assess the patient. She assessed the patient and he stated that he had some SOB yesterday but denied any SOB today. The patient&#39;s O2 sat was 99% and HR was 98 bpm. She recommended that the patient take Claritin BID and return for follow up on 4/5/21 to see her in clinic. She advised him to go to the ER if he experiences any SOB, increased swelling, or difficulty breathing and he verbalized understanding. The patient has a hx of HTN and takes Lisinopril 10 mg daily. He did take his medication this morning. The patient denied taking any new medications. He also denied any previous vaccine, drug or food allergies.

                                                I took the FIRST dose of the Moderna vaccine this Tuesday on the  20th of April at 11:30 AM. Around 10:00 PM Wednesday I have been feeling short of breath. This feeling has persisted throughout the entire day of Thursday and I continue to feel the same way (I think it has slightly worsened). I can breath, but I am completely unable to take a full, deep breath. I sometimes can achieve a full deep breath but it&#39;s completely at random. I find myself trying to forcefully take a deep breath but can&#39;t seem to fully fill my lungs how I normally am able to.  Additionally, my throat feels mildly swollen/sore, starting from the back of my mouth and down my esophagus. The lowest point of my esophagus at which I feel the soreness/mild swelling is near the center of my chest.  I think my shortness of breath is progressively, and slowly worsening, but its hard to tell for certain. Some of the muscles around my back are beginning to feel uncomfortable due to me constantly trying to forcefully achieve a full and deep breath.

                                                On Sunday April 25th 2021, I woke up with severe chest pain that went up to the right side of my neck, as well as having shortness of breath.  I was admitted into the ER and they ran blood work, did a CT scan and x ray of My chest. When my bloodwork came back, it showed I had very elevated troponin levels. Because I was having continuous pain, I was given morphine but it didn&#39;t work. So they upped it and gave me dilaudid and that took the pain away. It was in the doctors best interest I get transported to a facility with a good cardiatric team. Upon arriving to the new facility, they further drew my blood and ran more tests. I got admitted as an in patient on the cardiatric floor. The cardiologists ordered for me to have an echocardiogram done, another CT scan with a special protocol to view my heart, and an MRI done of my heart.   After my echocardiogram and CT scan came back fine, the doctors said they&#39;d be surprised if the MRI DIDNT show something. When that result came back, it did reveal my heart was still inflamed.   After ruling out all other possibilities they concluded that the 2nd Dose of Moderna COVID vaccination I&#39;d received was the culprit behind my diagnosis. My diagnosis being, a case of myocarditis as well as a mild heart arrhythmia.   For the next several months I am kn a medication called metoprolol 25mg, 2 half tablets a day, to correct my heart arrhythmia and relieve stress from my heart as well as minimize the amount of stress I encounter each day. No heavy lifting pushing or pulling of any sort for the next 3 months.

His muscles tensed and shook a little and he passed out, falling slightly to the right. The technician was able to place herself between him and the floor and slowly lower down, leaning  against the wall of the pharmacy.  By this point, about 30 seconds at most had passed, and pt was awake and cognitive, but had no recollection of passing out or how he had gotten to the floor. He did know his name and where he was, but was breathing heavy.  We took his blood pressure at this point and it was 82/46 with a pulse in the 40&#39;s as well.  Pt refused ambulance and we had him continue to sit on the floor.  Patient mentioned he had this type of reaction in past to other vaccines (not stating what), though only telling us prior he had &#34;slight dizziness once&#34;.   He also stated he had not had anything to eat or drink that am so we got him a snack and some water.  Patient continued to breath deeper as we suggested and stay on the floor as we called mgmt from the store.   We took blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it had gone up to 117/71.  and then again 10 minutes later and it was 121/69.  After 30 minutes total, pt asked if he could stand and leave.  He stood with no dizziness and said he felt &#34;fine&#34;.   We called patient approximately an hour later at his residence to make sure he got home ok and patient stated he had no other symptoms at that time and continued to feel &#34;normal&#34;.

They were going to the car and he got in first as he was going to drive, and mother got in the car, and he acted like his head was spinning, had a blank stare and started making weird sounds like he could not breath, started foaming at the mouth and then he passed out.  She called 9-1-1 and when they got there he was coming out of it.  They checked his VS and said that everything was OK, and felt that he did not need to go to the hospital but it was their call.  He didn&#39;t want to go either.  She drove him home and he slept OK, he had a bad headache and felt extremely tired and lied down.  He seemed to be OK the next day other than his arm being sore, but no other issues and he&#39;s been fine since.  The pharmacy did not have them wait before leaving to make sure they were OK, the pharmacist told her they were fine and they could go, but the incident occurred within 5 minutes of the vaccine.

The next morning I experienced a less severe headache but experienced noticeable shortness of breath especially on exertion. Tylenol P.O. helped my headache that morning, no known fever.  Approx 2 days after injection I also experienced a noticeable reduction in the ability to smell or taste. This Stayed for at least another day or so.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                Pt began to feel sweaty with sensation of throat tightness about 15 min after vaccine was injected.  At that time, all vital signs normal.  Pt did not have tongue swelling and did have a patent airway.   No rash.  Patient was given a total of Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg.  He was observed for 1.5 hours, during which his vitals remained normal, airway remained patent, and no rash was noted.  Patient continued to have sensation of throat tightness after the observation period, and we recommended that he proceed to the ER.  He declined to do so.  He was then given a syringe of epinephrine 0.3mL of 1:1000 solution for the ride home.  He was driven home by his parents.  We attempted to contact him later that evening but received no response.

I couldn&#39;t stand up and was scared to walk, so I was put on a stretcher. My throat started to close up. I was put in an ambulance and my throat swelled more on the trip to the ER. They gave me Benadryl and Prednisone. I was there for about 4 or 5 hours. I was okay after that. I checked the CDC site and it said I couldn&#39;t take the 2nd dose.

Because I do not have aassigned to the clinic, I went to ask an to do a physical examination on the member. The went retrieved water for the member to help him cool down and another patient was in need of my assistance. As I returned I saw the conducting his physical examination of the patient where he started to examine the member where the member did not present with any hives on his body but his tongue was slightly larger than normal and he started to clinch his stomach and he could not physically drink the water and he then fell over gasping for air and eyes bulging(you could hear him

                                                He was ok right after administering vaccination. 10 minutes later he stood up and said he was feeling hot and collapsed on the floor. Seemed like he was having difficulty in breathing.  Called 911 and administered chest compressions. He was partially alert during chest compressions and after 2 minutes of administering chest compressions he gained full consciousness and requested me to stop chest compressions and requested an ice pack to place on his forehead and also requested some electrolyte drink  and they were provided. He sat up on the floor after a few minutes. He also said this fainting happens to him all the time when he gets any shot (injection). He  was responsive and sat on a chair until paramedics arrived. on arrival they asked his couple of questions and checked his blood pressure and monitored his heat for a few minutes. He left with paramedics about 30 minutes from the time of vaccination.
