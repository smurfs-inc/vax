Presented to ED with newly diagnosed AML, in MDS with WBC counts ~250, 000.    He had a normal (EX ANEMIA) CBC on Jan-21. He had COVID vaccine #1 on Jan-25.  About 4-days later he developed diffuse dermititis and severe fatigue. He had an  ED visit on Feb-8 for these issues and was prescribed Prednisone and Cefalexin  (completed Feb-15).  CBC was NOT done at that ED visit. He called HEME clininc  on Feb-16 (see also the Hematology Note) stating that he was just NOT feeling  well in general with increased fatigue and DOE. He noted that the dermatitis was  mostly resolved. We rechecked CBC on Feb-17 (results available about 4-PM) that  indicated ACUTE LEUKEMIA.  Presents to the MC with MDS on FEB18.

                                                My husband received the first injection on Feb 3, 2021 he developed a cough afterwards, cough would come and go.   He was scheduled to receive 2nd dose on March 11 and I was concerned about having a cough at the time of 2nd vaccine.  He went to walk-in clinic and got a covid test was negative, he said his exam was normal, they gave him prescription of Benzonatate 100mg he took one and it did not help so he never took any more.  On March 5 while working in the yard he collapsed, paramedics arrived and he was in cardiac arrest, they started CPR,  they used AED was in vfib, he was taken to Hospital then transferred to second hospital.  I was told he had blood clots in both lungs, one in his leg, and possible clots in the mesenteric area of abdomen.  His heart stopped due to the blood clots in his lungs.   He remains in the hospital in the Intermediate Coronary Care Unit.  He has not yet gained full consciousness.

He had an office visit on 3/3/21 with his PCP where he was found to have an elevated d-dimer. He was sent to the ED for a CT-scan that confirmed an acute bilateral pulmonary embolism with large burden of thrombus within the right lung. He was admitted from 3/3 to 3/11. He underwent a pulmonary arterial embolism on 3/5. He was also on a heparin drip while inpatient. He was discharged on Eliquis.

                                                Approximately 8 hrs after the second Moderna vaccination I starting having chills. These continued and increased in intensity along with the onset of fever. I did not have an accurate means of taking my temperature at the time. Over the course of the night on the 17th/18th of February the chills and fever never subsided, even with two doses of Tylenol. The day of the 18th, fever and chills continued along with a feeling of intense malaise. My sternum was very sore and it hurt to breathe as a result of the prolonged shivering. I had no appetite and ate absolutely nothing the day of the 18th. In the early morning hours of the 19th my fever broke as did the chills. However, later in the day, a thermometer was obtained and my fever was 101.4 degrees. When taken at bedtime, it was down the 99 degrees and returned to normal later with no future spikes. On the morning of the 20th when I awoke, I noticed a stinging soreness in my mouth and lip area, followed later in the day with my nostrils and inner nose. This turned out to be an intense outbreak of Herpes. The roof of my mouth, gums, upper surface of my tongue, lips, nostrils, and inner nose ultimately became covered and extremely painful. These lesions were not typical blebs, but were tiny, albeit most painful. After five days they resolved and I have had no further issues. As a possible area to investigate - I had had the second Shingles booster 14 days prior to my first Moderna COVID vaccination. I understand Shingles is also a Herpes family virus.

                                                Respiratory failure; Messed up with medication; A spontaneous report was received from a Consumer concerning himself, a 76-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced respiratory failure and messed up with medication/ Medication error.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication was not reported.  On 24 Feb 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 001A21A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 24 Feb 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273, the patient experienced respiratory failure and messed up with medication. He was hospitalized in ICU from 27 Feb 2021 till 08 Mar 2021 due to his medication messed up and had a respiratory failure.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The events respiratory failure and messed up with medication were reported considered resolved on 08 Mar 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: There is insufficient details to assess the event of medication error as the specific drug and error was not ddescribed as well as the condition leading to error. In addition, limited information has been provide about the event of respiratory failure but for the fact that  it was due to medication error.  Hence assessed as unlikely due to  mRNA-1273

                                                cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient received dose 2 series of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. First dose was received on 1/17/21 and second dose received 2/14/21. After both doses patient was observed for 15 minutes and did not have any adverse reaction per administering RN. No data in database or database as to any other adverse events occurring 15 minutes post-vaccination. On 3/20/21, EMS was called to patient&#39;s home who was discovered on the floor with an unknown breathing status and pulse. AED was attached to the patient. A very weak pulse was found and patient had agonal respirations. Cardiac monitor was attached to patient with a HR of 32. 1mg of atropine was administered and patient&#39;s rhythm changed to PEA with no respirations or pulse. Per patient&#39;s wife and son, he was a DNR, therefore all resuscitation attempts were stopped (patient was never admitted to the hospital). Patient was never known to be previously positive to COVID. PMH that may have predisposed patient to this adverse event leading to death include h/o DVT on chronic anticoagulation, COPD, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is insufficient information to determine the exact cause of death or what led to the cardiac arrest given that the time from last vaccination to the adverse event was almost a month apart.

                                                respiratory and cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient with PMH of esophageal cancer, larynx cancer, liver cancer, PTSD, A. fib, and alcohol abuse. He received his COVID-19 vaccines on 2/14/21 and 3/14/21. Both vaccines were administered without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without adverse effects. No other adverse events noted between time of last COVID-19 vaccinations and death. On 4/11/21, patient&#39;s wife called 911 in which EMS found patient unresponsive with abnormal breathing. Wife reported that patient was breathing up until 5 minutes prior to EMA arrival, but had been unresponsive. Wife reports that patient suffered from multiple forms of cancer, PTSD, and alcohol abuse. Wife believed that patient quit smoking and drinking but the morning of death found vodka and cigarettes in his coat. Wife reports that patient asked for help getting up from the stairs and then laid down in the bed, and went unresponsive afterwards. EMS attempted to revive the patient with CPR but were unsuccessful. Per EMS note patient suffered from respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, then cardiac death. Patient was not brought to the hospital prior to death. It is very unlikely that the COVID-19 vaccinations contributed to this patient&#39;s death due to his extensive PMH with substance use disorder and cancer.

                                                Severe difficulty breathing; Blood pressure shot up to 200; Troponin level jumped up; A spontaneous report was received from a non-health professional concerning a 77-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced severe difficulty breathing and that his troponin level and blood pressure (BP) had shot up.  The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 09 Jan 2021, at approximately 14:42, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 09 Jan 2021 at 20:30, the patient experienced severe difficulty breathing and his BP shot up to 200. The patient went to the hospital and they found his troponin levels had jumped up. The patient reported no known heart issues. On 12 Jan 2021, he went to see his primary care physician (PCP).  No treatment information for the event was provided.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.    The outcome for the events, severe difficulty breathing and  troponin level and blood pressure (BP) had shot up, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 77-year-old, male patient, with medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who experienced a serious, unexpected event of dyspnoea, hypertension and raised troponin level. The event occurred 5 hours 48 min after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A).  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

After shower I felt clogged, I did neti pot sinus drain with warm water and hydrogen peroxide  10 to 1.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

                                                8 minutes after the vaccine was administered,  he started to act funny.   At first, he looked like he was having a vasovagal/ syncopal episode: he became non-responsive, stared straight ahead.  then shortly thereafter he started to take be gasps for air, his lips turned blue.  It soon became clear that he was having an anaphylactic reaction. we called for an ambulance,  we administered one dose of an Epipen, and administered oxygen. His pulse ox was in the low 80&#39;s.   within a minute or two, he started to react and started to moan, breathe more normally, then began to speak to us.  His BP was checked and was 118/83.  His oxygen sat went up to 100%. after a few minutes,  We took the oxygen off and his sats dropped into the 80&#39;s so we restarted the oxygen.  We are rural, so it took the ambulance 30 minutes to arrive. He was very stable at the time that he was  taken to an emergency room for further evaluation.

                                                78 year old man without prior DVT/PE history, who had first Moderna vaccine dose on 12/29/20 (lot 011J20A) and second Moderna vaccine dose on 02/02/21 (030L20A) (information from patient provided vaccination card) who presented to the ER on 02/20/21 with one week of subjective dyspnea and palpitations. Chest CT with bilateral pulmonary emboli. There were also groundglass opacities in the right upper lobe. Rapid test for COVID 19 on 02/20/21 was negative. Subsequent antibody testing for COVID19 on 03/01/20 (IgG, IgA. IgM) also interpreted as negative. The pulmonary embolus was considered to be unprovoked and an association with prior COVID19 vaccination is interpreted as possible but unproven. The patient was initiated on anticoagulation. Further workup for underlying thrombophilia hematological disorders is pending at this time however the current assessment remains as an unprovoked pulmonary embolus occurring 18 days after second Moderna vaccine dose. Current CT imaging without evidence of recurrent malignancy and there are no identifiable risk factors for pulmonary embolus. The physician submitting this report is a Hematologist Oncologist.

I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding) in a 78-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 014C21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Urostomy, Nephrostomy and Colostomy. Concurrent medical conditions included Lymphoma (stage 4 lymphoma cancer), Renal failure (stage 4 renal failure) and Neuropathy NOS (chemo related neuropathy).    On 23-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain), DYSPNOEA (labored breathing), ASTHENIA (very weak), RASH (got rash on both of his forearms), HEADACHE (headaches), FATIGUE (fatigue) and CHILLS (he had chills). On 27-Apr-2021, the patient experienced NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and DEHYDRATION (he was dehydrated). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MYALGIA (hurting all over). The patient was hospitalized on 28-Apr-2021 due to NEPHROSTOMY. At the time of the report, NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding), DEHYDRATION (he was dehydrated), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain), DYSPNOEA (labored breathing), ASTHENIA (very weak), RASH (got rash on both of his forearms), HEADACHE (headaches), MYALGIA (hurting all over), FATIGUE (fatigue) and CHILLS (he had chills) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. After the patient got the vaccine, he was very fatigue for a few days. He had a lot of arm pain. The doctors noticed that he got rash on both of his forearms. He complained of headaches and it was hurting all over. He was very weak and had chills. He had labored breathing. His nephrostomy was bleeding a lot in the tubes so they had to hospitalize him. He went to hospital on 27-Apr-2021 and was currently in the hospital. He had blood transfusions and he was very dehydrated. He was put on IV saline. He took Eliquis but doctors wanted to stop it because his kidneys were not in good shape.  Company comment: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

He complained of dyspnea and fear of impending doom after waking up the following morning with some disorientation.  He was found to be in AFib with RVR after it was brought to ER  the following morning  and the rhythm was converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient continues to have confusion after admission yesterday that seem to get worse today to the point where he did not know his own name or birthdate, and seemed to have global amnesia.  Patient has been more drowsy this afternoon after receiving lorazepam 1 mg IV for potential seizure activity so no reliable neurologic exam was obtained.  Patient remains afebrile with pulse ox in the low 90s on 4 L of supplemental nasal oxygen in the hospital.  He had moderate decrease in kidney function upon admission that has improved.  He has baseline anemia with hemoglobin at around 10. Incidentally patient had shingles in the right thoracic dermatome week ago for which he received valacyclovir.

The patient&#39;s medical history included afib (atrial fibrillation). Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included finasteride, warfarin, sotalol, simvastatin, mesalamine, metoprolol, and oxygen.   On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient reported that he felt a little nausea for the first few days after vaccine administration.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 1:00 AM with hives on his right arm from the elbow to the shoulder. He stated the hives were painful to touch. The patient took diphenhydramine and the hives disappeared that morning. Later that day, the patient developed difficulty breathing and the hives appeared on his left arm from the elbow to shoulder.  The patient went to the emergency room and was hospitalized overnight due to breathing issues. He was given diphenhydramine and steroids and was released from the hospital on 26 Jan 2021.    On 27 Jan 2021, the hives reappeared from the patient&#39;s hands, spreading to the arms, shoulders, head, neck, and face. He described some of the hives as being nearly a quarter-inch high and he stated they looked like water blisters.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient went to the emergency room again because he was having a lot of trouble breathing.   On an unknown date, the patient&#39;s legs had also itched but there were no spots.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, nausea, hives, difficulty breathing, legs have also itched, and hives painful to touch, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 81 year old, male patient, with medical history of atrial fibrillation, who experienced serious unexpected event of dyspnoea, and non-serious unexpected events of urticaria, pruritus, pain, and non-serious expected event of nausea. The event of nausea occurred on day 1 after mRNA-1273 (Lot# Unknown). The event of dyspnoea, urticaria, and pain occurred 14 days after mRNA-1273 and the event of pruritus occurred on an unspecified date after mRNA-1273. Treatment included diphenhydramine and steroids. Concomitant medications included finasteride, warfarin, sotalol, simvastatin, mesalamine, metoprolol, and oxygen. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

Earlier in the day he complained of not feeling well, but non-specific.  He was assessed and given an albuterol nebulizer treatment. In the coming hour, his wheezing resolved, work of breathing improved, heart rate and respirations decreased. He was ambulating around without signs of activity intolerance. It was felt that he was stable and back to baseline, so he was monitored by the nursing staff. A chest x-ray was ordered but not completed.  On 1/1/2021 at approximately 0925, a nursing assistant described loss of consciousness for 20-25 seconds. It appeared that he was not breathing, slumped over in the chair at the breakfast table eating cream of wheat, eyes rolled back in his head. He regained consciousness, breathing normally after coughing. He did not appear to be choking. His heart rate was recorded as irregular, rate 32 by the nursing staff. He was transported to the Emergency Department at Hospital for evaluation. No concerning findings.

Per documentation by the MD, the patient had COVID19 &#34;several weeks ago&#34; and the nursing facility felt like he had recovered. A rapid test done in the ED was negative. When the patient worsened and seemed to be following the same path as other COVID patients, a send out PCR test was done, which was positive. The patient worsened and passed away that same day (02/05/2021) I was not made aware that the patient had the vaccine on 01/21/2021 until Monday 02/08/2021.

Liquid oxycodone given and did not help much either.  Nebulizer given x 2.  More oxycodone given and after 1 hour was able breath easier but still struggled all night.  Refused to go to hospital due to not wanting to die in hospital.  Nebulizer given again at 3 am.  Arm and legs jerking really hard.  Boost given.  4 am fell asleep.  6 am did another nebulizer tx.  Oxycodone given.  Still struggling with breathing and albuterol.  Continued this  the next 10 days.  Slept in recliner every night.  SOB with activity and eating.  Went back and forth with walker to bathroom and did not have to use a walker prior.  Arm was very red and had a rash.  Also had a bad headach.  Called doctor and said to go to ER but refused due to not wanting to die in hospital.  28 days later is using Nebulizer 3 times a day instead of 6.  Now just started not using walker.  Was shoveling snow prior to shot.

Client was ushered up into the bleacher seating at the vaccination site following the dose administration, and upon sitting down was experiencing shortness of breath (reported by the client to be from walking up the stairs). Client pulled out personal inhaler (albuterol) and self-administered a dose. Responder noted pallor and increased difficulty with speaking for the client, but client&#39;s breathing returned to a regular rate and rhythm in the minutes following albuterol administration. Client&#39;s pallor resolved. The client refused emergency medical services twice, and refused having his vitals taken. The client was monitored visually by responder until deemed appropriate for discharge from the observation area. When the client ambulated down the stairs, Responder noted unsteadiness in gait. Once the client was safely at the bottom of the stairs, a wheelchair was retrieved for the client so that the client could safely exit the facility. Client accepted the wheelchair at this time. Client refused a vitals check a second time at the checkout station, per responder.

                                                COVID positive with mild infection; Difficulty breathing; Nose bleed; A spontaneous report was received from an 82-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced nosebleed, difficulty breathing and COVID positive with mild infection.  The patient&#39;s medical history included Pulmonary arterial hypertension and Concomitant medication include TREPROSTINIL SODIUM and TADALAFIL. Lab tests provided for COVID-19 tests positive.  On 26 Jan 2021, patient received first of two planned dose  and on 16 Feb 2021, received second of two planned dose.  On 13 Mar 2021, the patient was hospitalized with nosebleed, difficulty breathing and COVID positive with mild infection and the treatment provided was unknown.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable as the patient received both the planned doses prior to the event  The outcome of events, nosebleed, difficulty breathing and COVID positive with mild infection was reported unknown; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. Based on the known causative agent of COVID-19 infection, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. It is likely that the patient was already infected with the virus but asymptomatic before being administered with the mRNA-1273 vaccine

PTA bowel obstruction led to a syncopal episode following use of laxative, and several episodes of vomiting in the days prior . Upon admission Patient was receiving conservative therapy for a partial obstruction when he developed increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory status and eventually developed significant hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Neurology was consulted for altered mentation in the setting of respiratory failure. Patient with ascending paralysis. MRI of the head and neck as well as CTA were obtained x2. Patient was ultimately diagnosed with Guillain-Barre, variant and received 5 days of Intravenous Immune Globulin therapy.  Patient&#39;s small bowel obstruction resolved and ultimately patient required percutaneous tracheostomy tube and gastrostomy tube placement for prolonged respiratory failure and neurologic compromise.  The patient had uneventful ventilatory requirements and ultimately was performing intermittent spontaneous breathing trials; however, still had episodes of apnea, but improved.  He was tolerating tube feeds at goal with resolution of his small bowel obstruction, which was thought secondary to his Guillain-Barre.  The patient did develop abnormal LFTs which were thought secondary to cholecystitis not requiring operative intervention, with improving LFT findings on antibiotics.  The patient had a nonobstructive cholecystitis.  The patient&#39;s mentation was improving to the point where he was able to communicate and open his eyes upon discharge, as well as was working with Physical Therapy for strengthening.  He was able to move his upper extremities and followed commands and lower extremities were improving in strength as well. Patient was discharged via private air flight to acute care ICU facility.

The next Saturday, March 13, 2021, the daughter was at her parents house checking up on them.   Her father was in the bathroom as she passed in the hall.   He came out of the bathroom and proceeded to the living room, she stated dad are you ok?  He said he couldn&#39;t breath.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off. On Sunday, 28 Feb 2021, in the evening, the patient got cold, and within minutes his entire whole body was in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe were in pain. It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.  Results for chest MRI, neck MRI and viral tests were not provided.  The hospital also performed a blood culture for bacteria. Results were not provided.  The patient was unable to move much, his blood pressure and oxygen were a little unstable. On 06 Mar 2021, the hospital did a major blood test which came back negative and the patient was released from a hospital. He stated that he was still weak in terms of walking and coughing. He stated that he recently bled due to taking blood thinner.  Treatment included major antibiotic treatments and steroids for pain during the hospital stay. The patient was still taking prednisone at a tapering dose.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The events of weak in terms of walking, coughing were unresolved, while the outcome of the events of tightening in his throat muscle, unable to move much, unstable blood pressure, unstable oxygen, bled due to blood thinner, Bruising in arm, cold, entire body in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.  Myalgia and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine

In addition, my chest was wheezing and felt as if &#34;bubbles&#34; were in my chest. My arm felt very hot and tender at the injection site. This attack lasted for half an hour. I went back to sleep and awoke the following morning feeling very weak and confused. Feeling extremely fatigued, all I wanted to do was sleep. I also lost my appetite. The next day, I had occasional coughing which subsided with my over the counter cough medicine.

About 3:30 PM on 3/16/2021, started gasping for breath again.  Called my daughter and she transported me to  Hospital.  They tested for covid - results negative.  They did a C-Scan of my chest and saw a blood clot in each lung.  While hooked to the monitors, they found I had Afib.  They also did an ultra-sound of my legs and found a small clot in each leg below the knees in a small vein.  I have never had any record of clots or Afib.  They transferred me to  Medical Center early on 3/17/2021.  They started a heparin drip to soften the clots.  In the afternoon of 3/17/2021, they performed a Suction Thrombectomy to remove the clots from my lungs.  On 3/19/2021, they put me on Eliquis Tab.  I was released from the hospital in the evening of 3/20/2021.

                                                Patient has long standing COPD and asthma. He has been stable on his home medications for years. No hospitalizations for these issues in the past. During Covid times he has been very restricted to his home with no visitors. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, he started having increased difficulty with breathing. Over the next few weeks he continued to get worse and required home oxygen and an adjustment with his medications. He was started on steroids and antibiotics about 3 weeks after the vaccine and then hospitalized on 3/16/2021 with COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. He tested negative for Covid at that time. He was in the hospital for 9 days and discharged home on steroid taper and home oxygen. A few days after being at home, he had gradual onset of subacute dementia/delirium. All workup has been negative. MRI/MRA normal. He is currently continuing on oxygen and again on steroids and mental status may be starting to improve.     The concern here is that patient was stable and had been stable on his medication regimen for years. He was doing well until approx 5 days after his second Covid vaccine when he started having worsening pulmonary complaints and eventually ended up in the hospital. He continues to be on oxygen at home and was recently started back on steroids. There has been no explanation for his subacute onset of Dementia/Delirium. MRI/MRA normal. This has been discussed with both Pulmonology and Neurology specialists.

                                                Pulmonary Fibrosis; Shortness of breath that required oxygen; This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of PULMONARY FIBROSIS (Pulmonary Fibrosis) and DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath that required oxygen) in an 84-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Urothelial carcinoma.    In March 2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath that required oxygen) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 16-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY FIBROSIS (Pulmonary Fibrosis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 12-Apr-2021 due to DYSPNOEA and PULMONARY FIBROSIS. At the time of the report, PULMONARY FIBROSIS (Pulmonary Fibrosis) and DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath that required oxygen) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications included were many medications for underlying urothelial cancer. Treatment included for the events was oxygen high flow nasal cannula.

He was recently hospitalized having developed a fever the day after his Covid vaccine 1 with associated confusion and some ataxia. He was admitted to the hospital overnight where an MRI scan suggested no acute change showing only moderate cerebral atrophy and some small vessel occlusive changes. He tested positive for Covid by PCR in the emergency department on 1/22. His oxygen saturation was stable. He did have a fever and describes falling off the toilet because of some generalized leg weakness and uncoordination. He has had some chronic left greater than right upper extremity sensory loss following prior cervical spine stenosis requiring urgent surgery in 3/2019. He has had some chronic left foot drop as well. He reports being somewhat deconditioned having spent some time in bed to the above episode but is now ambulating with a cane at home and has occupational and physical therapy in place. He has been mildly dyspneic on exertion above baseline but attributes this to some deconditioning. He did have an episode of lower dental pain with ambulation in the office that was more than usual though denies associated chest pain or pressure and has had no jaw or shoulder pain with exertion. Review of systems is negative for headache.

                                                My father passed away on February 10th, 2021. On Monday, January 25th 2021, he said he is feeling very uncomfortable in his chest area. He thought it was severe acid reflux. He took Gas X for Acid Reflux and told us that he does not want to go to the hospital. On Tuyesday, January 26th, he felt that his Acid Reflux symptoms got worse, he still did not want to go to the hospital. He took Tums. On that evening, he started having shortness of breath. We took his BP at home and it was very low. We begged him to go to the hospital, he still did not want to go. On Wednesday, January 27th, his shortness of breath got worse and we convinced him that he has to go to the hospital. We took him to ER. Doctor said that he had a heart attack on Monday morning and that is why he was not feeling well since Monday morning. While at the hospital, while the cardiologists were monitoring him, his heart condition got worse.  By Friday, February 5th, cardiologists said that he is very fragile, his heart condition is very fragile and he won&#39;t survive any procedure. They said that something triggered the heart attack. We told them about the vaccination on 1/13/2021. They sent him home on hospice on Friday, Feburary 5th, 2021. He was on supplemental oxygen when he came home. He passed away due to a heart attack on February 10th, 2021 around 9pm.

This has continued, along with general tiredness,  and I have seen my primary care doctor who referred me to a cardiologist. Both reported low heart rate. I am seeing a Electrophysiologist tomorrow and expect to have pacemaker surgery.      I have heard anecdotally now of a relative who developed low heart rate after 2nd Moderna shot . I wonder if there is a relationship between low heart rate and the vaccine.?

                                                Death Narrative:  Pt passed away ~3 weeks after dose 1 of COVID vaccine (Moderna). Daughter was home with pt and after he went to the bathroom she reports pt was out of breath, however that has been chronic/ongoing for him due to his diagnosis of COPD, pulmonary HTN and metastatic lung cancer. After sitting and resting in a chair, she states patient became unresponsive. She called 911 who told her he had no pulse and was not breathing. She states that they were not able to resuscitate him. Pt had been suspected to be positive for COVID as he had symptoms of increased cough, congestion and rhinitis. Daughter (that is primary caregiver and lives in home with patient) tested positive for COVID on 1/31/21. She started having symptoms on 1/25/21. Patient started having symptoms on 1/31/21. No COVID test confirmed prior to pt&#39;s death. Patient had a definitive diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma in October 2020. History of multimorbidity. He did have a 60 pack year history of smoking. Most likely cause of death from available records is metastatic lung cancer, with other serious diagnoses contributing.
