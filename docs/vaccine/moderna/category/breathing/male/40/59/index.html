I am on day 2 of having to take breathing treatments.  Had fever as high as 102  degrees.  I have been sweating profusely for 3 days.  I had one night of hallucinating dreams and hardly slept at all.  I had all of the general side effects, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills.  I had a rapid heartbeat.

                                                Dose 1 was given to me on 12/30/20. Arm was sore at injection site x2 days which was fine. On 1/12/21 I experienced SOB/labored breathing for approximately 24 hours. O2 sat did not go below 95%. HR was between 80 and 105 for approximately four hours (75 is a typical resting heart rate). No history of asthma, but I felt how people with asthma describe difficulty breathing. Given the length of time between the dose and the SOB, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the vaccine. But I am submitting this just in case you end up with other, similar reports. Thank you.

                                                Normally sore following the vaccine starting around 9:00 PM last night.  Had shivers, nothing terrible.  By 6:00 AM the chills were intense, weakness, having less coordination and depth perception issue.  Closer to 9:00-10:00 AM felt like he had the flu 10 times worse than he should have.  Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

This was followed by body aches pains and chills. It also included heightened skin sensitivity. Physical touch and contact on anywhere but my palms in the pads of my feet was extremely painful. The best example I can give is, taking a shower was like getting shot at by multiple BB gun pellets.   At 1450 PST, I experience shortness of breath and wheezing. Struggled to walk up 12 steps.  Continued with migraine. Weakness in body. Pain and body. Skin sensitive until about 36 hours after the vaccine. Did not try walking up and down stairs again, but breathing was slightly challenged Until about 30 hour mark.  Struggled with migraines from The 24 hour mark until the 48 hour mark.It was the weekend. I did not go in. I just graded it out. Fatigue lasted all the way until the 48 hour mark.  Funny enough? I did not developed a sore arm symptom.

On 20 Jan 2021 early in the morning, the patient had a difficult time breathing.  Around 17:00 the patient was taken to the emergency room and was given 10 liters of oxygen.  The patient was admitted to the hospital.  On 22 Jan 2021 everything cleared suddenly, so the patient was able to leave the hospital.  The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia.  The reporter indicated the patient did not have a history of lung problems, so she was concerned and wanted more information on what happened. Treatment for the event included 10 liters of oxygen.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, having a difficult time breathing and pneumonia, were considered recovered/resolved on 22 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 40 year old male subject, who experienced a serious unexpected event of pneumonia after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown).

                                                Patient received vaccine at 3:15 pm on 3/12/21 and stayed in pharmacy area for 15 min (he left feeling fine). After about an hour 4:15 he showed back up at the pharmacy telling our pharmacy technician that he lost his voice and his throat was closing. She rushed him to the waiting room where I, pharmacist, came out and asked him what was going on. He stated he was with a client and suddenly lost his voice, and felt his throat starting to close. I asked if he was having trouble breathing and he said yes because his throat was closing and his whole arm was tingling. I had him take his mask down and try to take a few deep breaths first. I asked for permission to administer an Epi-pen which he gave verbal consent. 911 was called. Patient stated he did not want 911 called because he was going to refuse service.  After a min or so patient stated his throat was back open and he was feeling good. I informed him paramedics are on their way and he needed to stay in the waiting room because effects of the EpiPen can wear off in 15 min.  I stayed with him and watched until paramedics arrived. Paramedics sat with him and he did refuse service (they did take his blood pressure).  When paramedics asked the patient about when he came in they asked if he was having trouble breathing and he responded &#34;no I could breathe, my voice was just hoarse&#34; (which is the opposite of what he told the technician and myself). He also sounded like it was very hard to breathe. I did information to the paramedics after saying that he told us his throat was closing of which they stated that they figured that was the case and they knew the patient and assumed he would refuse service.   Patient was in contact with his primary care doctor who told him he could go home if his BP was ok but to make sure he had someone to drive him home.  Patient had his wife come to get him and they left.

Pt agreed to this. Transport to ED via EMS was offered and pt declined as he had a driver. Informed pt that I could not make him go via EMS but I did recommend it. Pt expressed understanding but thought that he would be fine with it being as close as it is and him being the passenger, so he again declined transport via EMS. They were instructed to proceed directly to the ED for further Eval.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

Cannot work.  -Mild shortness of breath  -Mild Chills  The last time I felt this type of pain I ended up in the hospital for 3-4 days with extremely high white cell blood counts.  While I realize the vaccine may have side-effects, I&#39;m also aware I have a weak immune system. So I&#39;m taking extra precautions in the case things get worse.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get better but I&#39;d rather say something and be safe. When I get sick I tend to go down quick and I don&#39;t have any family closeby to rely on in case of an emergency.  I&#39;m completely played out on the floor hoping it will pass.  Not an emergency now but it could turn the other way as it has before.  Sorry for any inconveniences.

Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

                                                About 8 minutes after receiving vaccine, patient asked for water and reported that he did not feel well. He reported feeling faint and slight shortness of breath. The pharmacy staff gave him water and advised him that he could remove his mask to assist with breathing and began to observe him closely. The patient began to fee l better almost immediately, and was asked to remain in the observation area a little longer in case of worsening symptoms. During the next several minutes the patient experienced two more brief spells of faintness, which were relieved with more water and deep breathing. The patient reported that he had been working out in the sun earlier in the morning and that he was possibly a little dehydrated when he came in for his vaccine. He said that the symptoms he was experiencing were similar to episodes of dehydration he had experienced in the past. After about 40 minutes of total observation the patient said that he was feeling fine and that he felt fine to leave and drive home on his own. He walked around the store for a few minutes to make sure he would not feel faint while walking, and then left the building. I called and left a message for the patient tonight, and will attempt to call again tomorrow morning.

I was admitted to hospital on April 28.  Echocardiogram diagnosed heart failure, ejection fraction was 25%.  Pulse was also quite high (120-135), and blood oxygen was low (88-90%).  Cardiac catheterization showed no blockages in coronary arteries.  Echocardiogram, EKG, and bloodwork were negative for heart attack.  Ultimate diagnosis from doctor was idiopathic cardiomyopathy.  Currently taking several medications and under care from primary care physician and cardiologist.  At follow up appointment with primary care following discharge, she suggested I report the incident out of an abundance of caution.

                                                After headaches and fatigue following the shot (within 24 hours) I began to notice slight shortness of breath 3-5 days following. I didn&#39;t give it much thought, but, roughly two weeks after my dose I began to experience severe intercostal pain and sharp pain in the lower lobe of my right lung upon inhalation. I thought this was musculoskeletal at first but after it didn&#39;t abate within days, I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with several distal pulmonary emboli.   Luckily I survived and am currently on blood thinners while trying to determine the cause of this, having no history of blood clots personally or in extended family.

                                                Patient had no previous issues with vaccines in the past. Patient went to the post-vaccination chairs and about 2 minutes after giving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, patient&#39;s wife informed me he was not feeling well. Patient was sweating profusely, shaking, light headedness, and difficulty breathing.  Site of injection looked normal.  I brought him back to the immunizing booth, laid him down, gave him something soft to lay his head on and cover- up with.  His sweating and shaking seemed to get worse. He wanted to sit in the chair since the floor was cold.  We sat him up, gave him an ice pack, and gave him some orange juice. We called 911 and instructed EMS where to find us and the patient&#39;s symptoms. While waiting on EMS, his symptoms improved slightly. They arrived quickly and assessed the patient&#39;s blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar. He did not feel as if he needed to go to the hospital. I had the patient wait in the immunization booth a bit longer.  He felt better, and color came back into his face. He went home with his wife. I gave them the V-Safe info, so he can report any issues while at home.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: SUICIDAL IDEATION (pt. reports suicidal thoughts) and FEVER (pt. received 2nd Moderna vaccine approx 1100 yesterday approx 3-4 hours ago developed chills/fever/anxiety/visual hallucinations/generalized body aches) HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: HPI:  Patient is a 41-year-old male who presents to the emergency department from home with his wife for chief complaint of suicidal ideation, anxiety. Nursing noted him to be hyperventilating in triage. Patient states these thoughts started about 4 hours ago after he started feeling unwell.  Patient states that he got his 2nd moderna COVID vaccine at 11:00 a.m. yesterday.  This evening after trying to go to bed he started getting fevers body aches and myalgias.  He took Advil around 8:00 p.m..  After this, he started having increased thoughts of wanting to harm himself.  He states he is having &#34;hallucinations of himself cutting his arms and legs off&#34;.  He called telemedicine who told him he needs to go to the emergency department.  Patient originally did not want to wake his wife up and did not want to go in but he eventually woke his wife and she brought him here.  Patient does have a history of PTSD and depression.  He is on Cymbalta which apparently he has been taking.  He has not been able to see a counselor since the beginning of the year because of his insurance.  He does see physicians through the hospital.  he has never had to be inpatient but has had to come to the ER a few years ago for suicidal ideation. He also tells me that he quit his job yesterday because he doesn&#39;t like seeing people be mean to other people. ED Course as of May 19 0613 Wed May 19, 2021 0339 Patient is a 41-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with suicidal thoughts.  Patient has PTSD.  Suicidal thoughts started about 4 hours ago.  He did get his 2nd moderna COVID vaccine at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and now has a fever and generalized body aches and fatigue.  I do believe this is a normal immune response to the COVID vaccine.  We will give him Toradol.  Patient is very tearful and anxious.  I will give him some Ativan while we are waiting for lab work to return.  Medical social worker will have to evaluate the patient.   0521 MSW is currently talking to the patient.    0611 Medical social worker and wife felt that patient could be discharged home with the safety plan.  He will follow up with the hospital for mental health counseling services.  Patient feels much better after fever subsided.  He will continue to rotate between Motrin and Tylenol.

                                                On 5/2/2021 I woke up with severe shortness of breath. I went to a walk in clinic two times and then I ended up going to the ER two times, and I have seen my primary doctor and a pulmonologist.  Through out all the visits they have done  lab work, chest x-ray, CT scan, Echocardiogram.  At the walk in they thought I had bronchitis so they prescribed an inhaler and another medication, later they prescribed a steroid, my first visit to the ER I was not prescribed nothing, the second time they prescribed oxygen at night and as needed, and from my pulmonologist they prescribed a different inhaled steroid.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

                                                On the first day I had a huge lump underneath my armpit I did not become too concerned with that I read it was something that could happen regarding the lymph node. 10 days later I woke up at 3:30 in the morning and had to dial 911 my throat felt like it was closing and my lips were both swollen. I went in the ambulance they brought me to the emergency room where they gave me Benadryl a steroid and some IV fluids. as soon as I receive the Benadryl my throat started to open up and my lips both started to go down . My lip continue to swell for the next three days on and off often on. Every time it swelled up I took Benadryl and every time sure enough it went away . The day I came home from the hospital I thought I was doing much better until that following night I became severely nauseous. I don?t know if it was something that they had given me in the hospital or still a reaction that was going on in my body, but I had some sort of stomach bug I threw up that whole day, had chills sweats  and a pounding headache that would not go away for over 48 hours .I was unable to eat or drink for 24 hours and had to go to an urgent care where they provided me with some medication for nausea. My concern right now is I am hearing that the second shot hits a lot harder than the first one and if this was a reaction to the shot I am very afraid of what will go on if I get the second one.  I cannot take a chance with my life.  I really want to shot I work in an environment where I am working with the department  which is why I was able to get the vaccine so early I feel safe being vaccinated I am very disappointed that this happened I just cannot take a chance having a family etc. Also I have very bad medical in Sherance so I am dealing with all of the bills from this hospital stay I have a  deductible which I can?t afford and then only 50% is covered afterwards. That is the reason I do not go to the hospital under no circumstance unless I am dying which that night I was that scared I felt the need I had to go.

He was having yellow sputum production and he had chills. Upon arrival to the hospital on 4/18 the patient was tachycardic and chest x-ray that showed cardiomegaly with fluid overload. Progressively became severely hypoxemic and had to be emergently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Patient developed cardiogenic shock which may be acute myocarditis and was placed on an Impella device and norepinephrine drip. The patient continued to worsen and developed acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia and was placed on CRRT. LFTs were also elevated. Patient also went into atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone drip. All of the above mentioned occurred within a 12 hour period.

                                                On 4/22/21, approximately 1 hr after the Moderna COVID-19 first vaccination injection, I started to encounter allergic reactions that I used to suffer about 20 years ago. My air intake decreased, and my skin began to become irritated. I formerly had environmental allergies that would reduce my air intake, and the first place I noticed the effects were on my skin and I would become irritable. Physicians told me that when my oxygen levels were low, the body would channel the air to where it was most needed, which is generally not the skin, so my skin would become irritated. When this used to occur, I would respond involuntarily with facial twitches and pulling at my face and hair. Physicians explained that these twitches and pulling actions would draw air to the surface of my skin where I was air depleted. When I took the Moderna injection, this happened again -- I found myself with low air, my face was twitching, and I was pulling on my face to draw air to the area. The result when I was 19 and dealing with allergies is that I would remove small patches of hair from my head or eyebrows or eyelashes, and this would happen almost unconsciously as I tried to stimulate the areas and draw air to the surface of my skin. I did the same thing on 4/22/21, and found later, when looking into a mirror, that I had removed a section of my eyebrow unconsciously. It all comes back to oxygen depletion. A different and more intense event occurred in the night of Friday, 4/23/21, and the early morning of Saturday, 4/24/21. I went to bed at about 11 p.m. or 11:30 p.m. Between that time and approximately 1:30 a.m., I had difficulty sleeping, and I dreamed of pain in my chest. I finally woke up about 1:30 a.m. and found the pain in my chest was real. I was having difficulty breathing deeply. It felt as if  the lower part of my lungs (at least on one side) was solidifying or inaccessible. What I did was begin forcing myself to breathe as deeply as possible. Over a period of 30 minutes or longer, I was able to gradually reclaim the use of the deepest part of my longs. With every forced deep breath, I was able to chip away at the area that felt like it was freezing up. Finally, I felt that I could access the deepest part of my longs and breath normally. The pain and lack of use in my lower lungs were very concerning.

These symptoms continued to worsen over the next 48 hours.  It got to the point that the only way I could breath and grasp air was laying down on my side.  I went to the ER and was admitted within hours.  They had to put me in a medicated coma and deep lung intubate both lungs.  I had internal bleeding which the doctors could not explain.  They tested me for everything across the medical spectrum looking for some underlying health issue and found none.  Several of the doctors said there is no explanation other than I had an extreme adverse reaction to the vaccine.

He later came back around 12:20 and said he felt a little short of breath.  He did not appear to be in distress and was talking normally.  I had him sit down and remove his mask.  I got him some cold water and his sister asked him if he was just nervous.  He replied no.  She said he had heart issues and that she was going to take him to the urgent care to just make sure he was ok.  He  was able to walk and talk normally and did not appear to be in distress.  I called him later to check on him and he said the urgent care said it was probably an allergic reaction and they gave him prednisone and benadryl and he felt fine now.

Instructed patient to stay in consultation room for observation.  I stayed with the patient and called 911.  EMS arrived on scene about 5-10 minutes later.   Took vitals, oxygen saturation within normal limits, elevated bp, normal heart rate.  EMS monitored patient for about 15 minutes after which patient was still conscious and alert.  EMS advised patient to go to hospital for further evaluation and patient accepted.  EMS took patient to hospital.   Patient generally seemed fine when he left the pharmacy which was about 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

                                                On 12/24, at 8:30a I began to get nauseated  which lasted about 2hrs. Around 1am I woke  up with SOB which continued thru the night, with off and on sleep. I woke back up at 5:45am, went to work with the SOB which lasted until 12N and resolved on its own.  Around 3-330pm I began to feel feverish and had chills and was told I was disoriented.  My temp was 100.5, HR 122 R 34 BP 170/100 O2-93%. I notified the DON of my feelings who advised me those were possible side effects of the vaccine and made me continue to work until I just couldnt take the feelings anymore and went to the ER.  I was there for about 2 hrs and my body began to calm down.  I took taken 100mg of Tylenol on my own just to help with the fever which did break shortly and I have been fine every since. I was positive for COVID 12/14.

He was given 12.5mg of liquid benadryl.  He reported his symptoms slightly improved after five minutes of liquid benadryl.  His vitals were measured again about 20 minutes after his first set of vitals and his vitals were 150/100, HR 105, O2 sats 95%. He was given a second dose of 12.5mg of liquid benadryl.  After another 20 minutes, he reported that his symptoms were much improved.  On examination, his tongue was not swollen and faint expiratory wheezing was heard.  Last set of vitals were 140/95, HR 95, and O2 saturations 96%.  He calm and relaxed and was released.

On 01-23-2021 in the next morning I woke up with heart racing with chest pressure, felt dizzy with SOB. I called an ambulance and they performed an EKG which was normal. I went to the hospital and they did triponine values, EKG and I was released after 24 hours of monitoring. About five days later I went to see my PCP for a physical I had scheduled. He performed another EKG and this time it looked abnormal, showed I had gone into cardiac arrest and other tests, such as stress test, reactive blockages test and heart test were also performed.  I had no blockage nor heart attack. I then drove home and since then I have been going to doctor&#39;s appointments. I have also scheduled a second dose of Moderna vaccine in three to four weeks.

This case describes the occurrence of COVID-19 (covid-19 infection), DYSPNOEA (SOB), COUGH (Cough), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate) and PYREXIA (Fever) in a 43-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.      Concurrent medical conditions included Kidney transplant (11.35 years from  transplant), Pancreatic transplant (11.35 years from  transplant) and Diabetes mellitus (Cause for organ transplants). Concomitant products included BELATACEPT, MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL and PREDNISONE for Immunosuppression.    On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced COVID-19 (covid-19 infection) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), DYSPNOEA (SOB) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), COUGH (Cough) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), PYREXIA (Fever) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and VACCINATION FAILURE (vaccination failure). The patient was hospitalized for 11 days due to COUGH, COVID-19, DYSPNOEA, LUNG INFILTRATION and PYREXIA. At the time of the report, COVID-19 (covid-19 infection), DYSPNOEA (SOB), COUGH (Cough), LUNG INFILTRATION (Bilateral lung infiltrate), PYREXIA (Fever) and VACCINATION FAILURE (vaccination failure) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Blood creatinine: &gt;0.3mg/ml (abnormal) &gt;0.3mg/ml. On an unknown date, Lymphopenia: &lt;900/mcl (abnormal) &lt;900/mcL. On an unknown date, Oxygen saturation: &lt;92% (abnormal) Hypoxia. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) Negative.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patients were comparable to those of solid organ transplant patients (SOTs) who had COVID-19 infection and have not been vaccinated. Antinucleocapside antibody at COVID-19 diagnosis was also negative.  Treatment for COVID-19 was with Bamlanivimab (MAB1), Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, Convalescent Plasma and Tocilizumab. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication Mycophenolate Mofetil (immunosuppression therapy) was withheld during hospitalization. Patient was discharge on 2 liters of oxygen.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However the patient&#39;s concurrent medical conditions of Kidney transplant, Pancreatic transplant, Diabetes mellitus and use of immunosuppressants remains a risk factor.

After the second shot, things got worse, and I started realize that it was sleep apnea. I went to the doctor and I am currently being evaluated for central sleep apnea. My breathing stops, and then I wake when I need to grasp for air. I am healthy guy that works out and in good shape. This came out of nowhere and I am worried it has to do with taking the Moderna vaccine.

On his drive home, at approximately 3:30pm, he started feeling light headed and lost consciousness, striking a telephone pole. He was gasping and struggling to breathe, so the ambulance treated him with oxygen. When he arrived at the ER , the doctor assessed his condition and confirmed that he was experiencing an anaphylactic reaction related to the COVID vaccine and treated him with an epinephrine injection, steroids, benadryl, and nebulized albuterol.to open his airways. He remained at the ER for ~ 6 hours for observation until his blood oxygen levels increased and he was stable to be released. The car accident resulted in PT suffering a fractured sternum as confirmed via Chest CT Scan by his primary doctor. PT has no history of any allergic reaction to any medication or vaccine. Although he does have well-regulated asthma, this incident was not characteristic of any asthma-related reaction he has ever experienced.

Could only get sufficient O2 it seemed when lying on back and laying down on my side. Was every bit of all my energy to just take a shower and nearly blacked out with heart racing as I tried to breath in the shower but steam in air was too much to breathe.  Lasted for 4 days that way.  I still feel like I am constantly winded and I as of today have only regained about half the lung capacity I had prior to incident, and that is just over 1 month mark. I also now have been getting these bad facial breakouts particularly on and around my nose and forehead /;eyes area. I never ever had any acne issues to speak of prior, even as a teen and during puberty. Never had any acne ever and now its bad breakouts some appear to may even leave ling term scarring in certain spots. My day to day diet and normal habits have not been added to or altered in any way either. My heart feels like it beats twice as fast and twice as hard now and I am always short of breath now too. I do not have a family doctor to go and see and I was afraid to call for an e.m.t. or go to the e.r. at the early onset of it all. I truly hought I was a gonner a couple of times though throughout the first 4 days.

I had stopped moving to rearrange some items. While stopped, I started to feel lightheaded, develop tunnel vision, and feel faint, almost to the point of blacking out. I put my head down and legs up and felt somewhat better. I then attempted to return to my car. I could go 100-200 yards at a stretch, before having to purposefully fall down and elevate my legs. I traveled the mile back to my car like this (slowly). I could not check my pulse because my hands were too cold; my respiration rate was elevated. At the car, I drank fluids and warmed up and began to recover enough to get home.

Other symptoms resolved but not startle symptoms and pt now also having cough and nasal congestion. Normal exam other than congestion. EKG NSR w/ no feeling of the startle while here and no CP or SOB. CXR normal. Full lab eval also normal including neg CRP, Trop, BNP, and D dimer. CBC and CMP also normal. TSH mildly elevated but normal T4 so likely c/w pt&#39;s prior minor thyroid abn but unlikely to be source of current symptoms. Given normal exam and w/u do not feel myocarditis, pericarditis, or clots or other significant process associated w/ current symptoms. Pt retested for COVID since not fully immune prior to symptom onset.

Evaluation was positive for bilateral DVT and pulmonary embolism     Bilateral PE, infarction, bilateral DVTs -No obvious precipitating factors -patient underwent first COVID 19 vaccine injection, is actually due for second shot.  Unclear if this is contributed, recommended to hold on getting second dose and discuss this with PCP.  -Also follow-up with PCP for appropriate cancer screening -patient was treated with therapeutic subcutaneous Lovenox, remained hemodynamically stable and is feeling better today.  Upon discharge we&#39;ll prescribe Elocon is 10 mg b.i.d. for another 5 days followed by 5 mg b.i.d. maintenance dose.  He will be provided with coupon for 1 month supply, he was recommended to follow-up with PCP for further recommendations.  He will probably need anticoagulation for at least 6 months or longer depending on further course. -Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction 50-55%, Mild mitral valve prolapse no evidence of RV strain.      Hemoptysis  -Most likely was related to PE and infarction -resolved.   Pleuritic chest pain, h/o Afib -Most likely pain was secondary to PE, improved -Continue Cardizem as prior to admission -Stop aspirin since patient will be on anticoagulation therapy   History of opioid dependence, alcohol abuse Continue suboxone     Ongoing smoking smoking cessation was advised   Disposition: Routine Discharge Home   CONSULTS: Consults Ordered during this Encounter Procedures ?

                                                Around 10am I was feeling a bit hungry and my stomach seemed &#39;sore&#39;.  I air fried some chicken for myself, but still felt hungry.  I was feeling rather irritable, and an hour or two later I was violently vomiting.   I tried to drink some water shortly after, and that did not help.  My stomach was still rather upset and I vomited again an hour later.  I laid down on the couch the rest of the day with my stomach feeling rather upset in way I&#39;ve not really experienced before.   I was able to sleep for a few hours and I was able to drink small amounts of water by midnight.  I felt a bit cold but I don&#39;t remember anyone saying I had a fever.  I was irritable, deep breaths kinda hurt, and I was a tad dizzy most of the day.  I was able to eat and drink the next morning, but my abdomen was sore.  It still is a bit sore, but I feel almost 100%.

                                                Initially, the patient had dizziness, lightheadedness and a syncopal episode within 5 minutes of the vaccine. He returned to normal fairly quickly and went home by report. He presented to the ER shortly after with palpitations and shortness of breath and required a dose of IM epinephrine. Patient since had intermittent fatigue, dizziness, blurred and vision changes as well as tinnitus. On May 31, 2021, patient presented to the ER with headache, lethargy, weakness, diaphoresis and dizziness. Additionally, noted to have slurred speech by his wife. MRI of the brain done at 4 am on 5/31/21 showed  the following  &#34;1. Acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts are seen with a right posterior 4.3  mm focus a left middle cerebellar peduncle 3.2 mm focus and a left superior cerebellar 7.9 mm linear focus. 2. Occlusion of the left vertebral artery extending into the basilar artery with reconstitution of the basilar artery via bilateral posterior communicating arteries. Findings are concerning for acute dissection occlusion. Consider further evaluation with MRA head and neck. 3. Question subtle area of restricted diffusion seen within the left dorsal medulla better appreciated on the maps measuring approximately 4.9 mm. Left lateral pontine 7.3 mm focus of restricted diffusion versus  artifact. These infarcts are not definite and could be artifactual asymmetry.&#39;. He required admission, heparin drip and neurology consult at that time, as well as permissive hypertension. shortly after 1 pm on May 31, he developed chest pain with ischemic changes on EKG requiring cardiology consult with possible intervention, though this was being coordinated with interventional neurology, as he also required basilar angiogram for his MRI findings. as cardiology and interventional neurology were coordinating taking patient for intervention, he became further unresponsive, though maintained his pulse, and required intubation and transfer to ICU, as well as repeat CT of the head to evaluate for continued thrombosis of his basilar system.

                                                Patient  developed episode of diarrhea shortly after 1st shot in series,  this was followed by  lower extremity swelling and mild dyspnea on exertion, that quickly exacerbated after the 2nd shot on 5/15/2021,  that resulted in severe dyspnea on exertion, severe lower extremity swelling with approximately 25 lb weight gain, orthopnea and hemoptysis. Patient reported temperatures of 99.2 F to 99.8 F.   Outside CT chest abdomen pelvis angiogram showed moderate to large acute segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli with trace right heart strain and right lower lobe pulmonary infarction, moderate right pleural effusion, acute splenic vein thrombosis with extension to the proximal portal vein and associated splenic infarcts, bilateral renal infarcts, and evidence of portal hypertension. He was transferred to the Hospital for further management. Upon presentation here he was tachycardic but with stable blood pressures and requiring up to 5 L by nasal cannula. Initial laboratory studies were notable for WBC 21.0, INR 1.8, D-dimer 11653, NT pro-BNP 17684, troponins 603 to 579 to 574, CRP 127. He was started on a heparin infusion. He was admitted to the MICU for further management.   Bedside ultrasound demonstrated reduced biventricular contractility. He was given two doses of 40 mg intravenous furosemide with about 3.5 L of urine output since admission (net negative 3.1 L). His oxygen was weaned to 1 L by nasal cannula. Lower extremity venous and arterial Dopplers were negative.  Subsequent imaging  demonstrated a transperineal inferior infarct with akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior and inferior lateral walls with apical and mid ventricle akinesis secondary to a complete occluded RCA.  moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade noted.  Upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated acute DVT in the lower right IJ, innominate, subclavian and proximal axillary veins.  MRI  venogram was negative for clots, but multiple acute and subacute enhancing infarcts within all 3 vasculature distributions consistent with embolic etiology were noted.  TTE showed of mural thrombus along the septal and inferior walls of the LV apex,  severely enlarged left ventricle with EF of 20%, severe hypokinesis.    Patient was aggressively IV diuresis, with improvement in respiratory status.  Maintained on  high-intensity heparin for pulmonary emboli, DVT, and diffuse arterial and venous thrombosis.  He was bridged to warfarin.  Patient was  prescribed LifeVest for primary prevention. Started on beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor given EF.     Patient planning on discharge 6/5-6/07, outcome pending.

I got dizzy and felt weak at points. I went to the Doctor and it was also determined that I was wheezing when he checked my lungs. He prescribed me a 30 day usage of the Albuterol Sulfate pump to help with the wheezing 3x a day.I saw the doctor January 23rd.3 days after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.

                                                I was feeling cold throughout the day, at about 9:00 pm I took a shower to try to get warmed up, I just kept getting colder and colder until I was severely shaking uncontrollably. Every muscle was so tense and I was shaking so badly I could barely walk or breathe. I went to the bedroom and got under blankets with a heater and in a few minutes the shaking diminished to where I could start breathing normal again. It took about an hour before my shakiness went away completely but I still needed to stay under the blankets and near the heater as I felt I was still cold and on the verge of getting the severe chills again. I had no fever. Next morning (as I&#39;m writing) I&#39;m still worried about getting out of bed as I still don&#39;t feel right and am scared of getting the chills like that again.

                                                Pt received his first Moderna vaccine on 2/25/2021. 3 days later he developed significant oral pain located on the roof of his mouth, back of mouth and throat. He presented to clinic about 1 week later for evaluation. There were no obvious signs of trauma or infection at the time. He followed up with this Dentist and it was suggested he likely had a chemical burn secondary to citrus foods. He followed up with another provider and was treated with a 3 day course of an antiviral medication for herpes without any change in symptoms. He hasn&#39;t had oral herpes before, but has had shingles.  He received his second Moderna vaccine on 3/25/2021 and 3 days later developed significant throat pain and swelling in his neck glands that was visible to him. His symptoms improved slightly, but have never completely resolved. He has had what feels like a dry sore throat for 7-8 weeks and intermittent white patches in the back of his mouth. He has no history of or active allergy symptoms. Was treated for oral candidiasis on 4/19/2021, but it&#39;s unclear if his vaccine triggered these symptoms.

Pt showed photos of lip swelling, and he reported it to his health care provider.  His health care provider sent an email that recommended not receiving the second dose of Moderna. However,  pt was automatically scheduled from his first visit to get second dose, and pt showed up to site to discuss it and showed this vaccinator the email and photos and described this course. This vaccinator did not administer second dose of vaccine and recommended discussing alternatives with MD.

When the paramedics arrived they couldn?t revive him and he died.

I decided to lay down &amp; that seemed to make it worse. I&#39;ve never had any issues like this before so I figured it would eventually go away on its own &amp; continued to try and lay down on my bed but as each hour passed it continued to get harder and harder to breath &amp; each breath I took became increasingly strained &amp; felt as though my lungs weren&#39;t letting me take in large breaths, only short gasps. By 2am May 6th, 2021, I knew something was obviously veryyy wrong! I drove myself to the closest ER (that being Hospital approx 5 minutes away) &amp; was admitted.

                                                For my 2nd dose vaccine, the first night I experienced seizures and was trembling a lot; also developed headaches and fatigue. I also displayed symptoms of dizziness and blacked out. I have trouble breathing and I am now diabetic. I have congestive heart failure. I cannot go outside to the heat because I black out. I am on an albuterol treatment due to coughing spasms. My arms also get stiff, and I feel when I black out, I am out for a couple of minutes. They performed lab work, EKG, stress test and I am following up with a cardiologist. My blood pressure went up to 210/178. I have to follow up with my cardiologist in two months to monitor my heart. For my 1st dose vaccine, I had two seizures the same night. I could not breathe and gurgled. I went to see my PCP who placed me on high blood pressure medications. I lost 67 pounds of fluid in my chest. I swelled up so bad that I could not put on my shoes. I did not have these problems before receiving the MODERNA vaccine, dose 1 and dose 2. I also got lab work down and found out I had type II diabetes.

Jumped out of bed due to anxiety and rapid breathing from feelings of doom. paced the halls of house, attempted to go back to bed but feelings of doom would not go away. finally after an hour my breathing settled down, heart rate returned to normal and sweating dissipated.  symptoms did not return but did wake with severe headache and nausea.

On 01/15/21 in the morning, I felt chest compression, chill, bad headaches, muscle pains, shortness of breath and cough. I went to test for Covid 19 and the result came back on 01/16/21 as positive of Covid 19. My initial symptoms were mild without fever, but it is hard to compare my symptoms since no prior reference. The symptoms are getting better, but I noticed my back (between T8 to T6) has pain. I have consulted medical doctors and health care professionals regarding of being tested as positive after vaccination. No one can answer if I should take the second dose of Moderna vaccine in 4 weeks as scheduled, or I should wait for 90 days and start

I slept most of the day 1/25 except for taking kid to school and monitoring another at home. I had read the side effects and I felt as though things were subsiding  on 1/26 but I was still weak with body pain. I was not 100%. I was home alone with 2 kids (wife out of town). 1/25 I had a cough and was short of breath but didn&#39;t think much of it. The cough persisted. On 1/27/21 I was still short of breath. I went to a nearby fire station and had them put me on a lifepack. I was in atrial fibrillation. I could not do anything because my wife wasn&#39;t due back until 3pm. At 3PM she walked in and I walked out and drove myself to Hospital. I was diagnosed with A-Fib w/ RVR. I was in A-fib until I was cardioverted on 2/1/21 and was given a cryo-ablation.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

He tried to sit up, saw red dots, and &#34;passed out&#34; momentarily.  He had severe headache upon awakening, ringing in ears, and blurry vision.  Went back to bed and slept all day.  Symptoms worsened every time he tried to get up.  Woke up this AM, with symptoms persisting.  Came in for OV, BP noted to be elevated at 150/106.  Patient was sent to hospital via ambulance for further work-up and management.

Around 2:35 he and his family notified me that he was feeling lightheaded/faint and nauseous; he also appeared pale and diaphoretic. It seemed to be a vasovagal reaction until he said he was starting to have trouble breathing so I called 911 and got the Epipen/emergency kit ready, and monitored vitals. Then his breathing trouble resolved without needing to administer medication. EMS arrived at 2:39 pm and confirmed his HR/BP/O2 sat were normal. EMS cleared the patient to go home with his family. The patient had never had a vaccine reaction or vasovagal reaction before.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

                                                Heart palpitations, pounding heart that feels irregular, at times. Felt nausea a couple of morning along with heart symptoms and a sensation of difficulty breathing. However, I am able to take a deep breath when feeling this way and am able to work out with no difficulty. The symptoms continue intermittently, but do not happen constantly. A Kardia Mobile device purchased and I was unable to detect irregular heart rhythms with it. I considered going to the doctor and possibly the emergency room to get it checked out, but decided against as the symptoms would stop. They still continue off and on to this day.

                                                The day after the shot I began having severe abdominal pain, muscle and nerve pain, and shortness of breath. The abdominal, muscle, and nerve pain began at around 10:00am. The shortness of breath began around 2:00-3:00 in the afternoon and lasted for 30-45 mins (longer than the 20mins listed in the attending ER physician&#39;s report), at which point my wife called for an ambulance and I was taken to the emergency room of Hospital. I was prescribed diphenhydrAMINE injection 25 mg, droperidoL injection 1.25 mg, ketorolac injection 15 mg, and another pain killer by the paramedics that I do not see listed in the record.   Although not to the same degree, I have continued to have gastrointestinal cramping since the second vaccination. This is a worsening of a condition (IBS) that I had previously, but which had mostly been in remission since beginning Mirtazapine in Fall 2019 subsequent to a heart attack on 8/7/19. I am meeting with my primary physician, Droctor, on 5/10/21 and contacted, my gastroenterologist, on 5/5/21.

About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

                                                My blood pressure went up to 170/106 and my heart was beating over 100 about 45 minutes or one hour after I was vaccinated, and I also felt nausea. Nurse called 911, and I was transported to emergency. About 1.5 hour later, my heart was even beating more quickly, and I could hardly talked and difficult to breathe. This happened when I walked to the restroom by myself and came back. After they did some medical tests, gave me medication for allergy (the doctor gave me this since he was not sure if it was my allergy reaction to the vaccines), injected 2 IV bags and rest for few hours, my blood pressure went down to about 140/9x and heart beat back to normal. I was released from ER on the next day at 4:00am.

It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

RN #1 called local EMS/Fire Rescue and they arrived to assess him. Vital signs were within normal limits. He was transported to Hospital for further evaluation. He was alert and oriented and able to ambulate to EMS/Fire Rescue vehicle.

EMT gave 20ml of benadryl and assessed patient. Gave another 20ml of Benadryl. EMT asked and reassessed in 5 - 10 minutes. Patient still felt tightness and said it was getting worse. EMT asked if he wanted epi and patient said yes and said his throat was closing more. EMT explained that he would need to go to the hospital then and patient did not want to go to the hospital. Continued assessment and patient stated he was feeling better after EMT had him drink water and do some deep breathing. Patient stated he felt much better and was released from waiting room. Nurse at employer (Clinic was done on site) stated that this is normal for patient to have SOB as he has COPD and commonly has shortness of breath.

                                                Patient was coherent during initial injection, as I removed my gloves and asked he remain in the waiting area for 15 minutes his chin fell to his chest and he began to breath heavily. I spoke to him and there was no response. He then began making snoring type noises and lifted his head but again was unresponsive. Patient then slumped sideways in the chair. I made one last attempt to arouse him with firm strikes to the chest and calling his name. I retrieved the EpiPen from the e-kit and as I removed it from the box he became conscious. He opened his eyes and gasped and tremored slightly. He was not immediately responsive verbally. I observed him carefully to evaluate if he was going to have a seizure, but he then became coherent. He was alert and oriented to time and place but did ask how ling it had been since the vaccine. He admitted to having a problem with needles and stated that was the root of the reaction. He does not remember any reactions to previous vaccines but also could not recall his last vaccination. We brought the patient water and offered snacks while he recovered in the patient care area. Approximately 20-30 minutes after the initial event the patient began vomiting. After a few minutes of vomiting he said he felt a little better and wanted to go to his car to lay down. Multiple times we asked if we could call someone to come pick him up and offered to have him seen by paramedics that happened to be shopping in store. He declined both offers and stated he would lie down in his car and call someone if he did not feel well after awhile. Staff checked on him in his car and he was instructed to call in before leaving. Upon trying to check on him again it was noted his car was gone. I called the patient and he assured me he was ok and he was now at home.

Patient is a previous Covid pnuemonia patient with ground glass nodules from Covid 5 months ago. The lung pains and 02 swings felt as bad as Covid pnuemonia back in October and lasted for about 2 weeks. During this time the patient started Symbicort and Abuterol inhalers again for treatment of the lung issues.

                                                Patient called 4/21/21 at 2:08 pm and said at 6 AM he woke up in a &#34;pool of sweat&#34; and started vomiting &#43; chills. No fever. He vomited once and has been nauseous since. He feels very dizzy. He was walking down hallway, and he &#34;blacked out&#34; and fell down the stairs. He said he did not hit his head, but the right side of body hurts, as well as chest, after the fall. He said this pain is causing some difficulty breathing. He said his dad witnessed the fall. When asked if the pain is severe, he said &#34;yes&#34;. He was told that if he&#39;s experiencing &#34;severe&#34; pain after a fall, accompanied with difficulty breathing, he should seek medical attention. He was told he can contact his Dr. for a second opinion first, if desired. Otherwise, it was suggested he check his BP, if possible, sit with head between knees or lay down with feet propped up and NOT walk around if feeling dizzy. He was advised to stay hydrated and introduce bland foods first to see if he can tolerate solid food. He was told he can take whatever oral pain reliever he normally takes that he&#39;s allowed to take if needed. Patient will report back to me.

                                                Difficulty in breathing; Swelling of face; Swelling of face and tongue; This spontaneous case was reported by a health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of DYSPNOEA (Difficulty in breathing), SWELLING FACE (Swelling of face) and SWOLLEN TONGUE (Swelling of face and tongue) in a 47-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 031A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy (Not sure about the allergy).    On 15-Apr-2021 at 1:52 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-Apr-2021 at 2:22 PM, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty in breathing) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required), SWELLING FACE (Swelling of face) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required) and SWOLLEN TONGUE (Swelling of face and tongue) (seriousness criteria medically significant and intervention required). At the time of the report, DYSPNOEA (Difficulty in breathing), SWELLING FACE (Swelling of face) and SWOLLEN TONGUE (Swelling of face and tongue) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   EpiPen and 50 mg of Benadryl were given intramuscularly as a treatment for the events. 9-1-1 was called for further evaluation. No information on concomitant medications.

                                                Patient was given his 2nd COVID vaccine and was sitting in our waiting area. Around 5 minutes after he received his vaccine he mentioned that he felt his throat was starting to swell and his throat was hurting. I sat him down to evaluate the situation. He was given 50mg of Benadryl and a bottle of water. He said he was starting to feel better, but we continued to monitor him. He seemed very agitated (sweats/clawing at throat). He then mentioned wanting to go across the street to the hospital because of this throat pain. He requested EMT come to check him out, as I would not let him leave alone at this point. EMT came and took the patient by ambulance to Hospital.

I sat down to wait for my 15 minutes to be up as requested by the pharmacist. Within a minute of waiting my tongue started feeling numb on my left side and the left side of my face started tingling (cheek and region just below my eye). I also felt like my throat was tight and felt like I needed to clear my throat. I started researching &#34;face tingling moderna&#34; as I was getting concerned. I waited in the chairs for 20 minutes or so and no one came out of the pharmacy. My symptoms had not worsened but were not all the way gone with the face tingling remaining the longest. I decided to do some shopping as planned and would report my symptoms to the pharmacy if they didn&#39;t go away. All in all my symptoms lasted 25-30 minutes with the most intensity in the first 15 minutes.&#34;

He was seen by me in the emergency department on 5/16/21 and was found to have an elevated troponin.  He was admitted to the hospital and underwent a coronary angiogram which was normal. He has evidence of some global hypokinesis on his echocardiogram and eventually had a cardiac MRI which confirmed that he has myocarditis.  He became ill the day after his 2nd Moderna shot and then more ill the next few days and I saw him on Day #3 after his 2nd shot.  He is otherwise healthy. He was hospitalized for two days. He was discharged on Losartan and Metoprolol and was not on any medications prior to his presentation.

ECG demonstrated diffuse ST elevation, troponins negative. CT without contrast didn&#39;t have much in it. He was found to be COVID rapid test&#43; and IGG negative. He was admitted into isolation, no oxygen needs. DDIMER was over 2000 and friction rub noted on physical exam.   Cardiology ruled out STEMI, thought maybe viral pericarditis - but wanted echo done after out of isolation. CTA was planned for AM on 4-28-21, but patient died 4-27-21 PM after being found down in room. ROSC was not able to be achieved despite aggressive resuscitation efforts

                                                PATIENT WAS NOT NERVOUS ABOUT RECEIVING HIS FIRST DOSE. OUR IMMUNIZATION CERTIFIED PHARMACY TECH ADMINISTERED THE DOSE. ABOUT 2 MINUTES LATER HE STATED HE WAS FEELING TINGLY AND HIS EAR TURNED A WHITE COLOR. THE TECHNICIAN CALLED ME INTO THE ROOM WHERE I EXAMINED THE PATIENT. HE WAS NOT RESPONDING AND HIS EYES WERE DILATED. HE WAS TRYING TO BREATH BUT HE WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY. WE MOVED HIM TO THE GROUND AND PLACED HIM ON HIS SIDE TO MAKE SURE HE DID NOT ASPERATE. AFTER ABOUT 20 SECONDS OF BEING ON THE GROUD HE STARTED BREATHING NORMALLY AND WAS CONSCIOUS. THE ENTIRE EPISODE LASTED ABOUT 1 MINUTE (MAYBE SLIGHLY LONGER). EMS ARRIVED A FEW MINUTES LATER. HIS PULSE WAS LOW (ABOUT 50 BPM PER EMS) BUT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE WAS NORMAL (UNSURE OF THE VALUE). HE SAID HE REMEMBERED TALKING TO US AND THE NEXT THING HE KNEW HE WAS LAYING ON THE GROUND. HE WAS VERY NAUSEOUS AFTERWARDS FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES (HE THREW UP TWICE). WE CONTACTED THE PATIENT THE DAY AFTER AND HE SAID HE WAS FINE AND THAT HE ONLY HAD A SORE ARM. WE BELIEVE THAT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE DROPPED TOO LOW AND CAUSED A VASOVAGAL TYPE RESPONSE.

When the pharmacist came out to check on him, he collapsed. He was shaky, sweating, complaining of being on fire. He was given a bottle of water after asking for water.  The patient then alternately complained of having trouble breathing and feeling better for several cycles. The EMS arrived about 20 minutes after being called and the pharmacist left the patient in the care of the EMT&#39;s.  EMS left about 1/2 an hour later, then the patient&#39;s wife showed up to take him home.  After 6pm, the patient was checked on by the pharmacist and he was doing well at that time.

Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia without fever was made, patient started azithromycin on 1/5 and albuterol treatments every 4-6 hrs. Initially he improved, but then worsened.  chest xray on 1/6 was negative for pneumonia, PCR covid test was negative, albuterol treatment did not bring much relief. He started respiratory distress on 1/10 and was taken by car to the local ER where another covid test was negative and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. The leg US revealed blood clots in both of his legs. He had an emergency catheter-delivered thrombolysis and was discharged home from the ICU on 1/12 on oral anticoagulants. He is gradually improving, but very weak. He tires easily and gets a drop in oxygen to 90- 93%, as well as an increase in the heart rate to 120  when walking less than half a mile. He runs out of breath with exertion.

In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

                                                When I woke up this morning I could feel my throat was swollen and I had slight difficulty ingesting saliva. But I was able to drink water without too much problem. After a while when I was brushing my teeth I realized I could not gargle. I did not pay much attention. When I tried to eat breakfast I realized that I was not able to ingest any solid food at all. Then I realized my voice had become very hoarse. When I told my wife about it (she is a pediatrician) she looked into my mouth to check uvula but could not see it. She pointed out it could be an allergic reaction but was not sure of the reason. I took liquid Benadryl which we had at home and she also gave me a table of famotidine. I also had prednisone but did not take that as as I did not want anything to hurt vaccine&#39;s immunity effect. However, out of caution we drove to an ER and waited in its parking lot for an hour. Slowly I noticed that my swelling had reduced and I was able to see a little bit of uvula. So we decided to come back home. I am feeling much better now though not fully normal.

His O2 level was 98.  He as given EKG, XRAY, tested for pneumonia, heart condition and Covid.  All test came back negative. He was diagnosed w/ Acute Bronchitis and prescribed an Inhaler and Mucinex.  .  On 2/4/2021 pt went to his ENT Dr.  where he was scoped for possible cancer reoccurrence.  The triage of head and neck was negative for any illness.  He was told to continue the Inhaler and Mucinex.  On 2/5/2021 he went to his PCP and was told there was nothing they could do for him.  Told him to wait about 10 days to see if his symptoms subsided, if not he was going to refer him to a Pulmonologist.  From 2/5 to 2/19  the shortness of breath and choking sensation continued but the fatigue had subsided.  On 2/19 pt woke up w/ severe SOB and choking sensation so pt went back to the ER.  They performed another EKG, CT of neck and lungs, Covid Test, blood work, O2 level was 99 with wheezing symptoms. All test were negative but pt still had SOB.  Pt was released and referred to ENT Doctor once again on 2/25 w/ Dr. which they will do another scope where they will go further down.  Pt thinks his next option maybe a referral to a Pulmonologist.

                                                7pm on date of injection I got very sleepy and fell asleep.  I woke up at 12:45am sweating but chilled to the bone.  I felt feverish but was too cold to get out of bed.  When I actually got out of bed I had a very intense headache, and body aches.  I took my temp and it registered 104.  at 8am I took my dogs out but felt very old, chilled to the bone &amp;  lightheaded.  It was chilly outside.  I got back inside and got back into bed as fast as I could. The second I laid down, the sweat just poured out of my body, drenching my shirt, sheets, and blanket.  The fever lasted all day but was slowly improving throughout the day.  My arm was also incredibly sore at the injection site.  It was very sore for shot one too but the pain lasted nearly 2 weeks the first time and is already just about gone now.  Yesterday, or 2 days after dose 2 injection, the fever was gone.  I still had a headache, and body aches but also developed nausea.  I did not vomit but I did have diarrhea.  I also noticed extreme shortness of breath over very minor exertion.  I?m not sure if this was due to extreme dehydration , due to loss of fluids or if it?s associated with the vaccine.  My lungs feel clear and I deny ever suffering from a bronchial spasms..  Day 3 I?m feeling more myself but am still suffering from gastric upset.  Nausea has dissipated.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

Since last seen he initiated AIT in December 2020 and reports he had tolerated his AIT injections without large local or systemic reactions until yesterday, 16 Mar, when he received his first maintenance dose. Within minutes of receiving his dose he developed shortness of breath, dizziness/altered level of consciousness resulting in collapse, and was noted to be hypoxic. He was treated with IM epinephrine with initial improvement but subsequently again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness. He received his second dose of IM epinephrine and a dose of IM Benadryl with transient improvement, but again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness followed by nausea and vomiting. He was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic despite these interventions so a third dose of IM epinephrine and IV fluids were administered. He was transferred by ambulance to ER where he was given IV solumedrol, monitored, and admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. He reports fever (Tmax 101 F) last night in the ICU. He endorses he took his Allegra prior to his AIT dose and did not exercise. Of note, on 15 Mar he received his second mRNA COVID19 vaccine.

                                                11pm same day as shot. Started having chills, fever (101.6). Tired. Slightly winded.  Symptoms lasted until 6PM the next day. fever went back to normal around 4pm next day after shot.   * I NEVER had a fever when I had covid.   I had an Antibody test completed back in January. It was positive for Antibodies.  I had an antibody test back in 2020 BEFORE I had covid. It was negative.  A week late after 1st does of vaccine. My heartrate started to increase and had symptoms of Afib again. same symptoms of the Afib and heartrate and breathing, back after I had covid. Exact same feelings and symptoms.  The Afib/heart symptoms, stopped last week.   I am supposed to get 2nd dose this Thursday, and I am most likely not going to. I don&#39;t want the heart rate to increase again. I am having problems making an appointment to ask my doctor. My PCM changed, so it is all confusing and a pain.   Its best I just don&#39;t it.  I had antibodies as of january. I just had the 1st dose last month. I think I am god to go. Not worth the risk for me. I am sick of having covid symptoms, so why force it upon myself again....

                                                After both the first and second vaccine shots, I had the same reaction.  15 to 20 minutes after the shot, I felt a numbness in my mouth.  I also had a slight throat constriction sensation that I know well given my history with severe allergic reactions to tree nuts.  However, to be clear, the reaction to the vaccine shots was far more mild than my reaction to tree nuts.  If I eat any tree nuts, I have a severe reaction that involves throat closure, hives, vomiting and related symptoms for 6-8 hours.  While the Epipen shot helps with keeping my throat open, it does not reduce all of the other symptoms.  Here, the throat constriction was only approx. 1/100th of the reaction I have when I eat tree nuts.  Further, the slight throat constriction and mouth numbness only lasted 10-15 minutes, as compared to 6-8 hours if I eat tree nuts. I did not need to use an Epipen.

He had been in his usual state of health prior to this evening. He received the COVID Vaccine on 5/12/21. He went out with his wife for dinner and then upon return, started to have some substernal chest discomfort radiating down his arm. This is associated with some SOB and nausea. No vomiting, no diaphoresis. The pain continued for about 2 hours and then he decided to come to the ED. The EKG was consistent with inferolateral wall MI. States that he has been very active without exertional chest pain or dyspnea. He does have a history of HTN and is currently on lisinopril for this. No known history of hypercholesterolemia. Denies any diabetes. No smoking history. No history of PVD. His mother did have a bypass in her early 60s. At age 37, he did have a catherization following an episode of substernal chest discomfort. The patient states this catherization did not show any abnormalities.    Following this, the patient proceeded for PCI stenting with a DES for an occluded OM2 . Patient received Aspirin, Brilinta, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol, and Heparin prior to PCI stenting. Cardiology note confirms acute inferolateral STEMI due to occluded OM@, successfully opened and stented acutely.

                                                Tightness in chest.  Shortness of breath.  Sore jaw. Pain in left arm.  Called 911 and paramedic took EKG and informed me I was having a heart attack on the way to the hospital.  Once at the hospital they measured my TnT-Gen5 and the baseline was 2658 ng/L with another test taken an hour later showing 2873 ng/L which led to additional tests listed in box 19.  Final diagnosis was perimyocarditis and I received a prescription of Colchicine 0.6 MG to be taken twice a day for 6 weeks and then follow up with a cardiologist.

                                                I experienced insidous onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations after approximately 2-3 minutes of inoculation.  This episode lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.    Considering the role of anxiety versus the insidious and nearly immediate onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations and persistent elevated heart rate for more than 12 hours, I feel this event was primarily driven by the vaccine.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                Shortness of breath:  First noted about 18 hours after the dose, along with body aches, headaches and fatigue.  The latter symptoms resolved after 48 hours, however, the shortness of breath has not resolved as of today (77 hours after the dose).  No crackles or wheezes but inhalation and exhalation feels restricted.  I had Covid-19 with symptoms beginning on 11/16/2020 and had shortness of breath along with crackles and chest tightness  during the second week of illness.  The oxygen level declined to 92-93%.  I was treated with steroids and azithromycin at that time and the tightness of the chest resolved by about day 17 of illness.    I am reporting this adverse effect (chest tightness and shortness of breath) because it may be an autoimmune reaction triggered by the response to the vaccine.

                                                Drank fluids around 8pm followed by unusually early fatigue and somnolence 2 hours early, awoke before midnight cold, shivering, aching in larger muscles and joints from neck to ankle including shoulders, back, hips, and thighs, could not get warm wearing many layers and blankets, then headache after 3am with hot dry sore throat and awoke more short of breath than usual, eyes crusted, slightly dizzy on rising, am finding myself with poor attention this morning filling out this form incorrectly needing more corrections than usual.  The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

Personnel took me to observation, my blood pressure jumped up to 204, my heart bit to 190, felt like that for 15 minutes, then my BP started to come down. They called an ambulance took me to the hospital, in the ambulance my BP came down to 170. Go to the ER, blood test ok, after two hours there BP came down to 130 they released me. FYI, 51 year old man, very active, I can run a marathon (26.1 miles) in 3:45, Im not diabetic, I dont take any medication, I dont have high blood pressure. Dont know what that  happened, no insurance, now waiting for a bill from the hospital, not to mention Im scared to death now taking the second dose.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the vaccine, while driving home, my chest area started to feel very warm, then I started to have difficulty breathing.  I was unable to swallow for the first minute or so, then my upper and lower lip got numb. After I was able to swallow   my saliva tasted metallic and a mental fog settled in.  I had difficulty concentrating for the next 2-3 minutes.  All symptoms lasted for  about 5 minutes.  About a week later I developed a skin rash reminiscent to a &#34;zoster.&#34;   It was the size of my palm on my left thigh. Although is almost clear now, the affected skin area lost some sensitivity. Another subcutaneous inflammation persist to present day.

Back pain was significant enough to wake me up in the early morning. The abdominal pain required that I stand up as the pain intensified while laying prone. Abdominal pain resulted in difficulty breathing (unable to take full breaths without the pain intensifying). Abdominal pain subsided after 20 minutes, but the back pain continued into the next morning.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Glaucoma and Hyperlipidemia.    On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Mar-2021, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), ILEUS PARALYTIC (adynamic ileus) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking). The patient was hospitalized from 06-Mar-2021 to 31-Mar-2021 due to ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE, BULBAR PALSY, DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY, ILEUS PARALYTIC, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS, PNEUMONIA and RESPIRATORY FAILURE. At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia), DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy), BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking) outcome was unknown and ILEUS PARALYTIC (a dynamic ileus) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-Mar-2021, Electromyogram: abnormal (abnormal) consistent with demyelinating neuropathy.. On 30-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported by investigator.  Patient was presented to hospital on 3/6/21 with progressive extremity weakness, bulbar weakness, and respiratory failure attributed to AIDP s/p 5days IVIG. He had received his first Moderna COVID vaccination approximately two weeks prior to this and immediately following administration began experiencing weakness and trouble walking. EMG 3/15/21 consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. Hospitalization was  complicated by the development of adynamic ileus which is improving and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (previously requiring O2 support). Patient was also treated for pneumonia with a 5 day course of azithromycin. Once medically stable he was deemed appropriate for inpatient rehabilitation and was transferred from Hospital to rehab on 3/31/21 under care. The patient tested negative COVID-19 on 3/30, and repeat testing since also has been negative.

SOB had been intermittent and ongoing since after receiving 2nd COVID vaccine per patient. He was dx with acute DVT of LLE. Chest CT was not performed to evaluate for PE as patient reported improvement with SOB/breathing over the prior few days. He was started on Xarelto for blood clot. Blood clot was unprovoked, no prior history of clots/bleeding disorders. He is a generally healthy and active 51 year old male. Unclear if there is a correlation between recent COVID vaccination.

                                                2 hours after injection I felt strong pain at the injection site as expected.  10 hours after injection I felt the expected side effects of tiredness, slight headache, sore body, and slight nausea.  I went to bed.  12 hours after injection I woke up in intense pain feeling very sick.  My entire body hurt on a scale of 10 out of 10.  My neck muscles especially were so tight that it was unbearable and beyond a 10 on pain scale.  I had a headache.  I felt very nauseous like I might vomit at any moment.  My breathing became shallow.  I had chills to the point that my teeth were chattering and I was shivering uncontrollably even though it was 76 degrees inside my home.  I considered calling an ambulance, but was hoping this would pass.  There we moments I felt I might die and I left my door unlocked so EMTs could get in as I was still on the verge of calling for help.  I was unable to sleep due to the intensity of pain.  I could not eat and drank very little.  Day 2 I was still in intense pain on a scale of 10 out of 10.  I had a fever for a short time on and off.  I did not eat for two days.  I was able to take naps for one hour at a time, but then would wake up to a crushing headache and intense neck pain.  The second night I was able to sleep, although I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.  I would go from being extremely cold to sweating heavily feeling hot.  I eventually became very hungry but was afraid to eat and was still nauseous.  On day 3, the pain scale of my symptoms went down from 10 to 6.  I felt much better.  I was able to eat and drink well.  Day 4 I was not in pain but was exhausted and depleted.  Day 5 I felt I was recovered.  Please note:  I normally have a high pain threshold and I run up mountains and am used to pain.  I also have always had flu shots with no bad symptoms.  I am pro-vaccine.  But something went horribly wrong with this 2nd Moderna vaccine shot.

I did not go to the hospital because I did not believe what was happening and I did not want to worried my daughter on her special day. This was on Saturday May 1 at about 5:00 pm. I went home and went straight to bed. My wife was in disbelief and thought I was faking it. I have been having shortness of breath ever since. I am a teacher and on Monday I spoke to the school nurse and she had told me she had the same reaction and that it would be over in a month or two. I have had the same issues, but over the weekend of the 22 and 23rd of May, I have not been able to sleep as much. On  Monday, May 24, I went back to the nurse and she had took my blood pressure. It was 176/99 and that same day I went to the ER . I had all the blood work done and the only thing I had according to the doctor was high blood pressure. I had never had my blood pressure so high before.

This is the bad symptom that I want to report.  As soon as the liquid Tylenol hit the back of my throat it felt as if my throat constricted tightly.  I immediately stopped drinking it and was able to spit out some of what was in my mouth.  I was unable to get air in or out.  I stood up  and eventually was able to get a big gulp of air into my lungs before everything closed up again.  Eventually I was able to get another gulp of air in and I began to cough a little.  Once I drank some water, I could feel the liquid Tylenol on the back of my throat get washed down  and I was able to breath normally in about 2 minutes.   The cup of liquid Tylenol still had about 20 ml of fluid in it and I spit out perhaps half of what entered my mouth; I&#39;m estimating that 5 ml of liquid Tylenol went down  my throat.  Note that this is not a case of the liquid Tylenol going down my windpipe by mistake.  I know what that feels like and it is different.  It was all very traumatic.

                                                I waited the 15 minutes required and felt ok. However, about 10 minutes after I left the facility my throat felt like it was constricting. According to the literature this was a known potential side effect so I paid attention. The constriction felt like it worsened for about 15-20 minutes and then finally started to fade approximately 45 minutes after onset. It scared me as I had no idea how bad it would get.  At no time did I have difficultly breathing, but I was alarmed by it and am currently uncertain whether a 2nd dose is recommended.

Move or swallow. It lasted for three weeks until two days after the second dose of the vaccine. I was prescribed two courses of antibiotics , Cephalexin and Doxycycline ,  which only helped a little.  I had gotten an insect bite the week before vaccination. I also had a CT scan after the second dose of vaccination but the pain had gone by then.

As he waited after receiving the vaccine, the patient stated that he did not feel well and was having shortness of breath.  911 was called and the patient was assessed. The patient stated that his throat was not swelling and refused to remove his mask.  He did not appear to be wheezing and remained alert and oriented.  His breathing appeared  as someone who was hyperventilating. He continued to talk until the EMS arrived.  I got a blood pressure cuff and proceeded to check his blood pressure.  EMS arrived shortly and the patient stated he was feeling better.  He was after to stand and get on the stretcher and was transported to the hospital.        The patient was contacted the next day and stated his blood pressure on the ambulance was 140/90.  He said when he got to the hospital the wait was long.  He stated he was feeling better so he left and was not seen by the doctor.  He stated he was feeling fine and had no more shortness of breath.  He also stated he would not be getting the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                The first day I had no arm pain as others suggested but later that day I began to be enervated. After going to sleep early in the afternoon I woke up light headed. I spent the weekend having trouble breathing. On Monday I used a sick day because of shallow breathing. Tuesday my light headedness went away but I was having trouble with my bowels.  That may have been due to snacking on cashews though. Tuesday night I ate some watermelon and drank two 32 ounce bottles of gatorade and I feel a lot better today. Breathing is still shallow but nowhere near what it was. It is back to being indicative of my morbid obesity

                                                54 days after the first vaccination with Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine, and 25 days after the second vaccination, at approximately 0730 on Day 1, a 52 year old male, height 175.2cm, weight 95.5kg, without significant medical history or prodrome, had an acute onset of dyspnea manifesting as a small sigh at intervals of 4-6 minutes, which increased in frequency to intervals of 2-3 minutes over the course of the day. At approximately 1400 he had a one minute episode of tachycardia &gt;120 bpm. At 1515, his forehead became diaphoretic. He had neither chest pain nor a pericardial friction rub at any time. He went directly to the local emergency department. Additional information for Item 18:   Blood pressure at admission was 155/87, pulse 97, respiratory rate 22/minute, SpO2 98%, and Temperature 37.2. ECG at 1539 interpreted as: &#34;NSR at 85, Lateral ST depressions; ST elevations in aVR, ischemia / Posterior wall MI&#34;.  ECG at 1541 showed: NSR at 82, unchanged from prior ECG. ECG at 1552 interpreted as: &#34;Sinus tachycardia at 102, ST depressions remain in lateral leads but now also in V3 and V4; persistent ST elevations in aVR CW evolving posterior wall MI&#34;. PR depression in leads II and V4-6, and reciprocal PR segment elevation in aVR (pericarditis ECG Stage 1) Atypically for pericarditis, ST depression, rather than ST elevation, was present in leads V3-V6.  Owing to a working diagnosis of an evolving posterior wall myocardial infarction,  an emergent cardiac catheterization was performed, which demonstrated non-obstructive CAD and a small myocardial bridge. Initial laboratory values were notable for a white blood cell count of 11.89 K/mm3 (4.5 - 11.5), monocytes 1.1 K/mm3 (0.0 -1.0), 9.4% (2.0 - 9.0),  neutrophils 7.9 K/mm3 (1.5 - 6.6), 66.9% (40.0 - 75.0). Troponin was negative at admission and 18 hours later. D-Dimer was negative. Viral panels including SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV were negative. He was admitted for overnight observation. On Day 2 an echocardiogram was normal with no effusion, and ECG was notable for the absence of PR depression and persistent ST depression in leads (PR segment normalization part of pericarditis ECG Stage 2)... His dyspnea persisted, with a moderate sigh every 1-2 minutes at rest. He was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of coronary vasospasm or a pulmonary etiology, and told to follow up with his pmd. Over the next several days, his dyspnea was continuous and progressively worsened, and he had diaphoresis of the forehead every morning approximately 0900 until Day 20. Sleep remained normal. On Day 5 he was sighing deeply more than once per minute at rest, causing him distress, and ECG showed (?persistent ST depression in V4-6 with reciprocal changes in aVR). On Day 12, ECG showed T-wave inversion in V1-6 and ST depression in V3-6 (ECG Stage 3); a computed tomography of the chest was normal; and blood tests notable for normal monocyte count .57 K/microliter (0.0 - 0.8), normal CRP 2.15 (1.0-3.0), and an ANA titer of 1:80 (elevated) described as a speckled pattern, which is associated with several autoimmune diseases. Repeat echocardiography on Day 26 showed a small, generalized pericardial effusion and was otherwise normal. Cardiac MRI on Day 29 showed delayed gadolinium uptake. Pulmonary function tests on Day 38 were normal. Stress echocardiography on Day 44 was normal. Cardiac CT angiogram on Day 46was normal. The patient was diagnosed with pericarditis of unknown origin and started on aspirin 650 mg p.o. b.i.d. An ECG on Day 80 showed PR depression in II and V4-6, continued ST depression in II and V3-6, without T wave inversion (T wave normalization c/w ECG Stage 4). Symptoms progressively worsened from onset to nadir around Day 12, on which he had continuous moderate dyspnea upon awakening with severe dyspnea with mild exertion. Symptoms then generally improved until after Day 47, he began to have alternating periods of several days without symptoms followed by several days of  mild dyspnea.  Clinical symptoms resolved on Day 85.

                                                Patient report to have been in A-fib for three days after receiving first dose of vaccine; Throat closure; Felt like anaphylaxis; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was a 53-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who developed atrial fibrillation and an anaphylactic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history included heart failure and allergies to butter and NSAIDS.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included metoprolol, diltiazem, apixaban, lisinopril and loratadine.    The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 040A21A) on 11 Mar 2021 in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Mar 2021, the patient reported that he experienced a moderate reaction; throat closure (not complete).  He stated that it felt like anaphylaxis.  He also reported having a numb tongue. He reported that the reaction was not immediate and that  it started about four hours after the vaccine.    Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovered/resolved. The outcome of the event, anaphylactic reaction, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 53-year-old male who experienced a serious anaphylactic reaction with serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation and throat closure.  Event onset occurred the same day as the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment not reported. Atrial fibrillation resolved, and anaphylaxis resolving. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                24 hours after the vaccine my arm started to get sore to a very painful point for over 72 hours where I experimented with sweat, dizziness, and insomnia, after 72 hours the pain when over my body, and I started feeling chest congestion, it remained bad for four more days. 10days after the vaccine I decided to come back to my routinary exercise (bicycle) but the pain in my legs is keeping me from trying. I still feel very tired and sore and I&#39;m seriously concerned about the second dose. I need the advice to know if I should avoid it? Should I go for an anti-bodies test?

                                                At 3 months post second COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna), developed onset of intermittent left sided chest pain, syncopal episodes, intermittent vertigo, intermittent SOB, and lethargy.  All symptoms can be exertional or non-exertional.  Have underwent inpatient hospitalization for the above and undergone multiple testing.   Have had a CT of the chest, CXR, echocardiogram, cardiac stress testing (chemical), EKGs, multiple labs, and heart catheterization.   All testing has been essentially normal including ruling out inflammatory process.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after my second Moderna Vaccine I started experiencing breathing difficulty and shortness of breath. After 58 hours was admitted to emergency room but CT scan of lungs and heart normal. Breathing difficulty continued 24 hours a day until 8 days later in which the breathing difficulty became worse and increased light-headedness occurred On 4/13. A second trip to emergency room happened on 4/13 another CT scan of lungs and heart normal. Breathing difficuly continued until On April 24th I collapsed and blacked out while out for a walk. Was admitted to emergency room on the 24th and remained hospitalized with brain fog, light-headedness, breathing difficulty and sharp pain in right side of chest. Ecco cardio gram test negative. Breathing difficulty, lightleadedness and chest pain have all been steadily increasing since 48 hours after the 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. To date, still no answer as to why this is happening and getting worse.

                                                Patient with no known prior history of coronary artery disease,  woke up early morning between 4 and 5 with severe substernal chest discomfort, associated with some dyspnea. He had the 2nd COVID Moderna shot 2 days prior and has been experiencing mild fever, and chills. He did not get relief with ASA and antacid, and elected to come in . ECG at presentation showed left bundle branch block which was not present on previous ECG done in the hospital and stress test 2 years ago. His initial high sensitivity troponin was markedly elevated around 2500 ng/ml, and second set withint next 60 minutes rose to over 4000 ng/ml, consistent with acute coronary syndrome. Urgent coronary angiography was performed which did not reveal any culprit lesion. A stat echocardiogram showed normal EF and valve function. He was observed for 24 hours and discharged without incident on medical therapy.

                                                As a patient with Asthma, Aspirin is a medicine that makes me short of breath. I do not think it is an allergy as such, but a hypersensitivity to Acetylsalysilic Acid. 1 hour after the application of the vaccine, I felt the same symptoms as when I used any component that contains acetylsalysilic acid. In those cases I must apply inhaler. So I did, in 1 hour, I was already better. I didn&#39;t need to go to a doctor or hospital.

                                                Hospitalized after vaccination with acute submassive PE.  ASSESSMENT / PLAN: Patient is a 53-year-old male in no significant past medical history who presented with complaints of progressively worsening shortness of breath, chest pressure and was found to have acute submassive pulmonary embolism for which he underwent successful mechanical thrombectomy per Interventional Radiology.  Subsequent bilateral lower extremity DVT ultrasound demonstrated acute DVTs in the left popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal veins. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: PRESENTING PROBLEM: Acute pulmonary embolism, unspecified pulmonary embolism type, unspecified whether acute cor pulmonale present (HCC) [I26.99] HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 53-year-old male in no significant past medical history who is admitted for Acute Saddle Pulmonary Embolism. In the ED, the patient was tachycardic, tachypenic requiring 2 L of O2. CT angiogram thorax showed saddle embolus with extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli and evidence for right heart failure. He was immediately started on IV Heparin. PERT Team was activated and the patient underwent a successful mechanical thrombectomy with IR. Dopplers of the lower extremity showed Left lower popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal DVTs. After 24 hours of hemodynamically stable vitals, the patient was transition to Eliquis.  The patient stay was complicated with elevated blood glucose along with Hba1c of 9.7. Endocrinology was consulted and started the patient with Lantus and LDC. The patient will be discharged with diabetic regimen and followed up with PCP/outpatient Endocrine.    The patient was stable, AOx4, without complications and discharged safely to his home with his wife.

                                                Vaccine Received on Wed 3/10/2021. On Saturday - shortness of breath, very elevated resting pulse (by 25 bpm) reduced oxygen saturation (87 on oximeter vs 95), moderate ongoing chest pain.  Primary care doctor advised to go to ER.  ER visit resulted in misdiagnosis of Heart Attack which was later changed to heart inflammation.  Troponin levels elevated and stayed elevated and continue to be elevated 8 weeks later.  AFter 8 weeks Troponin levels still elevated and pain occurs upon anything more than modest exercise.  Patient has a history as an edurance athlete.  All other tests on heart function - stress test/ Ekg, perfusion, echo - show a high peforming heart - no other defects other than heart inflamation.

                                                Patient manifested with flu-like symptoms (myalgias, fatigue, cough, abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath) with high-grade fevers (TMax 103F) approximately 4-6 hours following administration of 2nd Moderna vaccine on 5/4/2021 per patient&#39;s wife. The symptoms progressively worsened to the point that he presented to an outside hospital on 5/12/2021 at which time he was found to be tachycardic and febrile (T 103.1F). Labs at that time were notable for significant thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, elevated procalcitonin. Chest imaging showed bilateral airspace disease. CT of the abdomen noted hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Labs on 5/13/2021 were notable for a markedly elevated ferritin level, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, elevated CRP, elevated transaminase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, markedly elevated CXCL-9 level, markedly elevated IL-18 level, normal natural killer cell function. Of note, while his blood and urine cultures were negative, he was found to have elevated EBV viral load on peripheral blood draw. He had a bone marrow biopsy which reportedly showed rare evidence of cells with what appeared to be erythrocytes within their cytoplasm, concerning for HLH.  Given strong clinical and serological suspicion for HLH, he was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility on 5/18/2021, his inflammatory markers were persistently elevated. He unfortunately developed worsened renal and respiratory failure, and required both hemodialysis and intubation respectively. He was continued on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, however we additionally initiated high-dose steroids as well as anakinra for treatment of HLH. Given EBV viremia, we also began rituximab therapy. He was successfully extubated, however as of 5/26/2021 remains dialysis-dependent with continued improvement in urinary output. His post-intubation course has been complicated by encephalopathy of unknown etiology. We have consulted infectious disease to proceed with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to ascertain potential CNS pathogens explaining the cause of his altered mental status. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of pathology. CNS involvement by HLH remains on our differential.

Insomnia would not allow ANY sleep for days and lasted for over a month. Breathing seemed to be labored and hard to get a full breath. Had to purchase a CPAP to allow enough air to be able to sleep. Still can not get a full nights sleep.  Developed terrible anxiety which I have never had before. Lost appetite and couldn&#39;t eat. Lost 55 pounds in following 3 months. Developed stuffy swollen nose/turbinates which I have never had before. Constantly feel ill and no able to perform daily functions of job or living. Brain fog and fatigue. I continue to deal with this issues to this day, now over 4 months. These all started the same day I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (Seizures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and THROMBOSIS (Bood clots) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 15-May-2021 to 25-May-2021 due to DYSPNOEA, GAIT DISTURBANCE, SEIZURE and THROMBOSIS. The patient died on 25-May-2021. The reported cause of death was Cardiac arrest, Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, ards and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, SEIZURE (Seizures), THROMBOSIS (Bood clots), DYSPNOEA (Stuggling to breathe), GAIT DISTURBANCE (Struggling to walk), INFECTION (Blood infection) and PYREXIA (Fever) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-May-2021, Blood pressure measurement: elevated (High) Twice normal. On 15-May-2021, Glycosylated haemoglobin: elevated (High) High. On 15-May-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Required intubation and was placed on ventilator.. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) 1 negative COVID antibody test. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negatie (Negative) 3 negative COVID antigen tests.         No concomitant medications were provided.  It was reported that within few hours after second dose of vaccine patient was struggling to walk and to breathe. The reporter and her husband went to see the patient and took him to an emergency room (ER). In the ER his blood pressure was markedly elevated (twice normal) and his oxygen level was low and by midnight he required intubation and was placed on a ventilator. His HbgA1c was noted to be elevated. Two days after admission (17-May-2021), he developed seizures which the medical team believed to be due to blood clots and he was anti-coagulated. It was determined that he did not have blood clots on his heart valves as the source of the clots. The source of the blood clots was never identified. He later developed fever and was diagnosed with a blood infection and treated with antibiotics. At one point his oxygen requirement on the ventilator went down to 65% but later returned and remained at 100%. He ultimately died on 25-May-2021 and as per copy of his death certificate he had 4 causes of death as cardiac arrest, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis.  Treatment included, anticoagulants, antibiotics, intubation and ventilator.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

On 26th of January, I had shortness of breath and a little dizzy. It was tolerable but was there. Toe/foot symptoms resolved around January 31st but I did still have shortness of breath up until the 2nd of February. Dr put me on Colchesine and Alloepurinal

                                                I had pain in arm from injection immediately, after injection, which was much different than first dose.  But not unexpected.  But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.    Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 12-Feb-2021, approximately 2 days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    The patient received his vaccine on 12-Feb-2021 and reported that his arm hurt a little for a few days. On 14-Feb2021, he reported that he started feeling sluggish and on 20-Feb-2021 he began to have difficulty breathing and pain in the right lower base of rib cage. He went to urgent care where he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism for which he received treatment. On the evening of the same day, he again started having difficulty breathing with pain upon inhalation. He returned to urgent care and was subsequently admitted at 12:30 AM on 21-Feb-2021. That  Monday, 22-Feb-2021, a doppler ultrasound revealed a deep vein thrombosis in the left calf. Patient was treated with heparin intravenously (IV). He was discharged 22-Feb-2021.    Treatment for the event included Xarelto 20mg twice per day for two weeks and Heparin IV.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis and dyspnea, was considered recovering/resolving as of discharge on 22-Feb-2021.  The outcome of the events, vaccination site pain and sluggishness, were considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                After administration of the vaccine (yesterday), patient began to experience itching at the injection site and slight whelps at the injection site.  He said he wasn&#39;t feeling great and reported having cold sweats and hot flashes.  He also had dry mouth that caused him to have difficulty swallowing.  I administered 50mg of diphenhydramine liquid and observed him for over 30 minutes.  I checked his blood pressure three times; it was elevated but within what he said was a normal range for him.  He had not had anything to eat nor taken his bp meds that am.  After 30 minutes, he was feeling some improvement and he and his wife left.  I spoke with her later and she said they had gotten something to eat and gone home and he was sleeping.  I spoke to him again this morning and he said later in the day he felt like his throat was swelling, but he continued to take diphenhydramine and felt better today.  He and I both reported this event to his primary care provider.

                                                He got his vaccine, had pain on the side of the injection and from there it grew to feeling aches and pains and then the shivers the next day.  He has had chills/sweating, fever that comes and goes, difficulty breathing as his nostrils block up, and has wheezing and when he gets up he&#39;s light headed and feels like he is going to pass out.  At night the symptoms seem to get worse, and thought that he had the flu.  He has bought everything for the flu and nothing has helped.  He then thought that he may have allergies and bought stuff for that and nothing has helped.  He has lost his sense of taste, he is extremely thirsty and could drink a gallon of water and his stomach hurts from drinking but his mouth is extremely dry and his throat is so dry as well.   He also has a nasty bad headache that is persistent and at night it gets to the point that he cannot seen and had lost his vision and could no see anything out of his right eye.  He called 9-1-1 and refused to go to the ER as he has no insurance and could not afford that kind of bill.  Yesterday his headache was so bad that he could not see out of the left eye, he has a fever of 101.5 right now and his head is killing him.  He has taken all of his medications that he has, medicated and nothing is helping the pain.  His nose is also extremely dry and he has no appetite, and ate last at 5:00 PM yesterday.   He also has vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sweats/chills.  He watches his diet carefully due to the diabetes, but has not measured it.     He is very concerned about his vision and his fever and headache was so bad that he could not see, and he&#39;s worried about that.   He also has brain fog as well, and cannot remember things, pounding, pulsating water.

                                                I had pericarditis 2 years ago and 4 days after my 2nd dose of Moderna I felt similar symptoms to when I?d had it. They subsided after a day but came back 3 weeks later. Because of my history of having had Pericarditis I had ultrasound and CT Scan and they showed some inflammation. Blood tests showed  C-reactive Protein levels high (70). On my own I googled if pericarditis was a side effect from vaccine as it was odd to me that my symptoms started so soon after. I read that there have been rare cases reported recently  but mostly in young people and they?ve subsided. Perhaps  because I had it two years ago it triggered a recurrent effect. I was prescribed 600 mg ibuprofen as before by Cardiologist and colchicine as before. My PCP suggested I might want to notify you.  I thought I should report this given what I read and that I&#39;m 55, so it?s different than other reports you?ve received.  I do not know if I have pericarditis again but the symptoms have been identical to when I did and the CRP level increase would suggest so. I had Echo and EKG and heart alright so it&#39;s not Myocarditis. Symptoms included: pain in abdomen chest area, pronounced in URQ this time but it migrated, increased when walking or lying down, difficulty sleeping in side, slightly elevated fever 98.9-95 when I?m usually in  96-98 range, breath hiccups, some nausea. Since taking colchicine and ibuprofen have been feeling better, just concerned that this seemed to have recurred, and started exactly 4 day after my 2nd shot.

                                                In February a few weeks after the vaccine, I started to feel more out of breath. I also noticed a change of  taste and smell. I went to my general physician and regular follow ups with cardiologist and pulmonologist. They did EKG, Cardio sonogram, usual set of breathing tests and lung CT scan. They increased my dose of Trelegy and cardiologist included Aspirin.

The day after he received his second moderna vaccine he developed polydipsia, polyuria and substantial fatigue in addition to muscle aches, nausea, and malaise. His symptoms initially improved but then slowly worsened again, developing shortness of breath, palpitations, heat intolerance, and continued polyuria, polydipsia. Three days prior to presenting to our hospital (which was 3 weeks after his 2nd vaccine dose), pt developed worsening nausea with vomiting and substantial worsening of shortness of breath.  On admission to our hospital, he was found to be in Diabetic ketoacidosis (no prior history of Diabetes, auto-immune Diabetes labs pending) as well has having new pulmonary embolism, Atrial fibrillation with RVR, and hyperthyroidism with anti-tpo abs (other&#39;s thyroid antibodies still pending). Given the time course of his presentation, it seems to us that he developed these conditions as a complication of his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                I started to feel more and more tired kind of lethargic. I went to see my doctor after the first shot because I thought it was stress related from work. I let my doctor know I felt run down. He had some labs done to rule out anything that may be going on. He ultimately ruled everything out as fatigue. After the 2nd shot it was getting harder to sit still my back was bothering me and I was experiencing back pain. I thought it may have been related to a previous back injury from a car accident I had years ago. The tightness got more intense I went to visit my chiropractor and the pain did not get better. I went to see my rheumatologist and I did not need a cortisone shot in my knee for the first time in 3 years. I let him know that I had difficulty standing from my chair. I explained I need to push off in order to stand up. He determined I had myositis. I had an MRI completed and other labs he let me know I had polymyositis. After my first visit Dr. called in a prescription for prednisone and hydroxychloroquine. I went to see Dr. the following business. When I go down the stairs I have to hold the handrail and it is more difficult to walk upstairs.  My doctor asked me if I had recently fallen because polymyositis is normally associated with a fall. But I have not fallen as I have been working from home. I had also experienced shortness of breath which I had checked out on 6/22/2021 at Urgent Care in. They recommended I have a CTA completed to rule out PE in my lungs.

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.

Unlike during the disease, my hips strongly ached 24 hours after recieving the injection.  COVID cough returned though not as bad as when I had the disease, as well as fealing weak and out of breath.  All of this lasted for about 36 hours.  Feeling a bit better now, but still winded and weak.   Still plan to get 2nd shot.

As the day progressed I began to feel body aches, chills, fatigue, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and numbness in my neck, arms, and hands.  These symptoms are still persisting.  The numbness that has since spread throughout my body (from my head to my feet), body joint and muscle pain and burning sensation, muscle cramps and twitching, and continued fatigue.  Additionally, I have had a few of episodes of pressure in my eyes and head resulting in vision issues and issues with my hearing&#34;

                                                Mild case of pneumonia; Tested positive for COVID; Shortness of breath; A spontaneous was received from a healthcare facility staff member concerning 55 years of old, male patient who developed shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID. The patient&#39;s medical history included back issue. The patient had an epidural for bulging disk in back in an unknown date in December. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 29-JAN-2021, eight days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) on left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20-JAN-2021, the patient had COVID symptoms including congestion and cough but tested negative on rapid testing. Since tested negative, the patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled on 29-JAN-2021 at Hospital.  On 06-FEB-2021 after experiencing shortness of breath, the patient was retested by rapid test, which was also negative. However, the patient tested positive for COVID on Polymerase Chain reaction test at Urgent Care. The patient had a mild case of pneumonia  The reporter believes that the patient probably was positive before, as patient had been home since 19-DEC-2020 due to a back issue. Thinks that the patient&#39;s son may have been asymptomatic and all eight members in the household tested positive except the reporter. Treatment for the events included antibiotic azithromycin 5 days z-pack.  The events shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID were considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and high probability of corona infection from the close contacts where all eight members in the household were tested positive except the patient immediately before the vaccination, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

On 4/21/21, the patient&#39;s wife called the pharmacy because she was concerned about his pulse-ox reading.  The wife stated that his pulse-ox was 91 and they were checking because he felt similar to how he felt when he had Covid-19 last year.  The pharmacist reminded the patient that some flu like symptoms were not uncommon within the first day or two, but also asked for more details and specifically asked about his breathing.  The wife stated that his breathing was constricted.  The pharmacist advised the wife that if the patient&#39;s breathing was constricted that they should contact a doctor or seek medical attention.  The wife said she would see how things go but she was not specific on if they were going to seek further help.

                                                My arm was sore. Then I had fatigue and then at about 14 hours after the injection, I started having chills - like I had temperature with hot and cold chills. I got very cold; my blood pressure dropped - I happened to have a doctor appt the day following the vaccine - the bottom level was very low of my blood pressure - it was 45. I couldn&#39;t warm up - my extremities were very cold. I had chest pain and it felt like my heart rate was going in an out of atrial fibulation. I had shortness of breath. I measured my blood oxygen concentration and had dropped down to 90%. I didn&#39;t sleep well because I was so chilled and not feeling well. I felt like I had a bad flu. I rested the next day (10th) the symptoms slowly went away between 10 am and 1:00. At 3:00 pm, I saw my pain doctor and I told him about it but I was feeling much better although blood pressure was low. Fatigue lasted for 3-5 days afterwards but it wasn&#39;t anything last the first 24 hours. I didn&#39;t go to ER because it seemed to resolve itself in the day.

This prompted our staff to look further and it was noted that her spouse, received his first Moderna vaccine on 4/26/2021 at our pharmacy. Friend was not reporting his death due to the belief that the injection was the cause. Only to report, so upcoming appointment for his wife could be canceled.  It was reported to our Medical staff that Patient n has Chronic COPD and had difficulty breathing on the evening of 4/27/2021 and was taken to the hospital where he later passed away.  Patient was on portable oxygen and resembled shortness of breath while ambulating at the time of his vaccination appointment on 4/26/2021. Patient immediately recovered from Shortness of Breath once seated in exam room for injection for a few minutes.

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

Was taken to emergency room, given oxygen and CT was taken of lungs, CT showed numerous blood clots throughout lungs with two larger at the bridge between, one on either side. Was give oxygen to help breathing, given Heparin to stop clot growth and T__ (something) to dissolve clots. Morning 04/05 was taken off oxygen and that evening clot medication was removed. Discharged morning 04/06 and put on Eliquis and to be reevaluated in three months by PCP. Sometime in the spring of 2020 I was asymptomatic for COVID, it was not until June last year until I knew after donating blood and it was test for COVID antibodies and I was positive.

                                                I felt really bad chills; like I was having a fever. After two days, I felt shortness of breath. I had a hard time breathing. I rushed myself to ER  and they checked me to see if I had COVID - negative. I still had shortness of breath. Two days later, I still had shortness of breath - they checked me and they said it was possible pneumonia -Dose was: 5 days/ two days a day. After taking the antibiotic, I felt better. Shortness of breath was better - that was gone but I still felt weak though. I continued to feel weak for a week after that.

Then somewhere between 11-12:00 PM he started having breathing problems, but it was so bad that he was considering having somebody take him to the hospital, but he did not.  This went on for hours until he finally passed out and went to sleep and woke up the next morning and was fine.  He was fatigued the entire next day and had a really bad headache, which he took some Naproxen sodium and took an Excedrin, and the headache did go away, and he seems to be back to normal.

                                                I woke up on Saturday morning with whole body soreness, but this passed by that afternoon.  Saturday night through to Sunday, I had chest pains on my entire left side.  This worsened all of Sunday and I developed dyspnea (shortness of breath) if I tried to lay down on my back or side along with the pain.  I could not sleep or rest Sunday to Monday night so I had to prop myself forward over a bundle of pillows in order to rest.  Monday I still had some pain though less, but the dyspnea was more pronounced with any moderate exertion.  I called the medical director where I work to ask for advice.  He told me it was ok to take an antihistamine.  I had taken nothing from the time I received my second dose Thu until then.  I took over the counter Chlorpheniramine (4mg) one time and that seemed to relieve the symptoms.  The next day I was 85% better (Tue), but it took exactly 7 days (Thu) before I was back to normal. For the 3 - 5 day period following my second dose, it was a little bit scary struggling to breathe and thinking I was having a heart attack.  I almost went to the hospital, but I didn&#39;t because I take care of my elderly father and could not leave him by himself.  If this had happened to me out of the blue, I would have gone to the emergency, but I had read of people having reactions to the vaccine after the second dose so I was mentally prepared to ride it out.  I didn&#39;t read about people having my particular side effect, so I thought I was an outlier of sorts. I am filling this out now because there are reports coming out that the Pfizer vaccine may be tied to myocarditis in men, and from the symptoms explained, it seems to line up with what I experienced.  Although I had Moderna, not Pfizer, I thought maybe I should report it in case it is a generic &#34;mrna vaccine&#34; issue.

Despite the negative results, there was high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and the patient was started on Remdesivir and Decadron.  The  patient&#39;s oxygen requirements continued to worsen and the patient was transferred to another facility for higher level of care.  There  his hypoxia worsened and he required mechanical ventilation.  Patient then developed hypotension and required vasopressors for blood pressure support.  Furthermore, patient developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  Despite mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100%, and for vasopressors, patient clinically deteriorated and family decided to palliatively extubate on 02/05/2021.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

                                                after receiving the vaccine 4/20 and three weeks later I couldn&#39;t breath and called 911 and went to hospital and diagnosed with pericarditis. But the day before I felt like I had a fractured rib and it intensified that evening and I took pain medication, then the pain in the left side intensified and I could not breath it felt like a knife piercing and had to breath with very shallow breath into my upper chest and the pain was so intense.  I called 911 and they did an EKG, my heart rate went down to 30. One doctor gave me morphine to help me, they did test to check for blood clots and EKG&#39;s and blood test. I was also given Oxycodone.  Test showed that there was a virus that got into it that caused pericarditis.  I&#39;m taking Ibuprofen and anti-inflammatories to help. I&#39;m very active and never had health issues and believe this was a response to the vaccine.  First dose was given on 3/23/2021 Lot 047A21A and experienced Molluscum contagion a few days later, and this is a virus. I was prescribe a topical cream, Imiquimod a topical cream to put on it to break down the virus. Triamcinolone Acetonide cream was prescribed later and I&#39;m still taking it now and the site was oozing puss and bleeding.

Went to ER on 5/5/21 where they discovered numerous DVTs in right leg and Pulmonary Embolisms in both lobes of lungs.  Heparin administered in ER and admitted for two nights to regulate dosage and to have echo cardiogram performed which also showed a thrombus in right atrium of heart.  Doctors said no other underlying cause of clotting and attributed it to the vaccine.  Now on maintenance course of Xarelto.

Most intense issues were Tuesday 24 hours post shot when I had more intense headaches and body aches.  SOB remained the same.  Tuesday evening, 35 hours post shot, I had chills and low grade fever 99.3.  Slept for 10 hours and fever was gone and hasn&#39;t returned.  Intensity of arm pain is diminished but still quite sore at actual injection site.  Headaches are not as intense as Tuesday but continue to fluctuate in intensity as they have for the past 3 months.

                                                In a nutshell, patient was fine, got the first shot of the Moderna Vaccine on 3/24/21, then began to exhibit many covid-like symptoms starting around 4 hours later but 3 times nasal swap tested negative for COVID19 including before and after vaccination. Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 &amp; Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He&#39;d never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn&#39;t abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like &#34;covid toes&#34;. Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium &amp; nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs. The ER doctor called in specialists in Nephrology and Cardiology to provide consultations.

They did an EKG they said it looked fine and they sent me on my way regardless of it hurting me real bad (my chest). When I woke up Sunday morning, there was a crushing pain in my chest. On the 25th I woke up, got dressed and went right over to the hospital. I was in so much pain I had to go back to the hospital. I was there from the 25th-29th, they said I needed to have an angiogram with a possible stint in my left artery. On the 28th they put that stint in and I left on the 29th of April in the afternoon at about 4pm. I still am not feeling right, my chest hurts not like it did then, but shortness of breath. I also have to take a blood thinner and a baby aspirin. I have new symptoms in both my arms, from my bicep to my triceps is very achy - it has never done that before. My arms are very stiff. I still have trouble taking deep breathes.
