The EMT&#39;s came, checked my lungs, etc.  and talked me through the episode which lasted about 15 minutes.  Then the swelling subsided.  I suspect it had, because I had dermal fillers approximately a year ago.  I had no other adverse affects, except for tiredness that evening.  People should be warned about this because it is a frightening event.  I have never had an adverse reaction to a vaccine before.

So like immune system symptoms.  I had covid 3/15/20-4/30/20.  I?m a long COVID sufferer, I still have resp pbs, arrhythmia, fatigue. I would like to get the second shot but am concerned about my over reactive immune response

                                                Began to have slight wheezing and coughing on Wed afternoon, the day after getting the shot.  Thursday wheezing and coughing increased and woke me up during the night several times.  Cough was productive with clear sputum.  Friday felt very tired all day and coughing and wheezing increased substantially, producing shortness of breath upon any exertion, like going up and down the stairs.  Very tired.  Began to think I&#39;d have to go to see the Dr. because wheezing was significant with every breath.  Cough was racking, increasing through the day into the evening.  At 10 p.m. I began to wonder if I&#39;d make it through the night without calling the rescue squad.  Couldn&#39;t take a deep breath or speak a whole sentence with out a coughing jag.  Then, suddenly about 11:30, it just ceased.  The tightness in my chest went away, the coughing with every inhalation stopped and I could take a deep breath.  It was a bit stunning.  Because I had pulmonary embollisms about ten years ago, my lungs have been a weak spot in my body with bronchitis occurring frequently.  I hadn&#39;t seen reports of this side effect of the vaccine, so I thought I&#39;d report it.  This morning, Saturday four days after the shot, I am breathing much better, not coughing, and do not have any wheezing.

                                                Almost exactly 24 hours after 2nd shot, my mom was getting her hair done and she started breathing hard.  Hairstylist removed her mask and she then passed out.  Called 911.  They observed my mom sweating, her lips and hands were swollen, she was slack jawed, pale and clammy.   After several minutes she came out of it.  Was given a piece of candy thinking it was a sugar low, but her sugar was high 285 @9:00am.  Her color was still pale and she was still incoherent.  While still on with 911, she became more lucid and said she was feeling better, so ambulance was canceled.   I drove her home and checked her sugar @11:00 - 295 and BP 125/55 pulse 75.  She stayed with me for the rest of Saturday.  Her sugar was still high Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  Upon checking her blood sugar log, her sugar had gone up for a week following the first shot.

                                                Patient has known lymphoma but was on break from chemotherapy. No known lung disease. She developed a very large left pleural effusion and became markedly hypoxia need chest tube drainage. Multiple fluid cultures were negative for infection and fluid sent twice for cytology and flow cytometry were negative for tumor cells. She was too  ?sick? for thoracoscopy. Over the next  7 days the symptoms resolved and the effusion has not returned which speaks against this being from the lymphoma. She had symptoms the night of the vaccine but did not become critically ill for about 36 hours as the effusion was developing. Her oncologist and I both believe this was related to the vaccine and will not give the second dose.

Rapid heart beat followed by afib that was not terminated with normal medications. Dizziness and shortness of breath. Hospitalized with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It resolved after getting two injections of a medication called diltiazem in the emergency department, after which I was monitored overnight in the hospital. Underwent stress test and echocardiogram - results  normal. On the day I write this (March 1) continue to have  shorter periods of rise in blood pressure and heart rate,  diaphragm tightness, insomnia and lethargy.

Next morning after around 11 am patient started to vomit almost a lot, her fever went up to around 38.5C auxiliary, she reported extreme weakness and shakiness, her blood pressure also increased to 160s/high 90s, she complained of extreme shortness of breath. Elevated BP could be related to the fact that she was vomiting so much, she had hard time taking her scheduled medications, included BP medications.   This lasted for 3 days. Patient was taking Ondasentron and that was only reliving nausea for 2 to 3 hours. She was taking Tylenol to bring her fever down. 650 mg Tylenol was only lowering temp to about 37.8.  For about 72 hours she was complaining of extreme generalized pain and weakness and had very hard time getting up to go the bathroom.  She started to fill a little better on March 27, 2021. Shortness of breath disappeared in the morning. Temperature fell to 37.1C. She stopped vomiting and was able to eat.  Generalized weakness and shakiness persisted till March 2, 2021. At the moment of submitting this report, patient is still reporting that she does not feel that she is &#34;100% back to normal&#34;

I had shortness of breath and i still have it. I road a bike 4 to 6 miles every day and now i cant.  i had chills and body pain, i feel like i had the flu. dizziness, just just random spouts of sleepiness and it would last for about an 1 hr and half.  My muscle in my chest just tightens and is hard as a rock. and then it goes away.

They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

                                                With the first dose about 12 hours later I experienced some numbness of my face.  The next day I had a  measles-like rash which went away in a few hours. Pain in my arm went away in 2 days.  With the second dose on the third day after the injection I developed severe itching and noticed a red spreading rash in the area of the injection, just a little below the injection site.  This is very red, sore and feels somewhat warm to the touch.  The area is about 5 inches in size and is still painful.  I have also noticed some shortness of breath but minor.   Some numbness and itching around my face.

By Feb. 10, 2021 I had low fever and difficulty breathing so I went to Urgent Care, after blood work, received chest X-ray, EKG, CT scan. It came back with pneumonia. My biggest quest is can safely take the second one or a different one, with emphysema you need protection. Thank you

                                                I had Covid on 25 Nov. 2020.  I had extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, aching, headaches and abdominal pain. I have IBS which flared up during this time.  It took me December and January to finally get over the fatigue part. When I received my vaccination on Feb. 12, 2021 (Moderna) by that evening I began to run a temp. of 102-103. I had chills, headache, abdominal pain (worse than in Nov.), fatigue, some dizziness, and short of breath. I felt like I had Covid all over again!  I was down for 5 days. On Sunday afternoon, Feb 14 I went to the Clinic to see the doctor on call.  I was told they could not test me since I had Covid November 25 and it hadn&#39;t been 90 days and I would still have the antibodies.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273(Lot number:039K20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient experienced soreness in arm immediately after receiving the shot. The soreness resolved few days later.  On 29 Jan 2021, Lab work done due to her being anemic and on perpetual oxygen therapy. Her hemoglobin level went down from 8.8 to 8.2 and her oxygen level was 82 on exertion.   On 31 Jan 2021, the patient started experiencing shortness of breath. Patient stated that her saturation level was at 82 percent whenever she is standing up or walking and she runs out of breath. When she sits down, the level of the oxygen will go up. She said she is not sure if her medical condition is getting worse or if this is vaccine related  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, sore arm, oxygen level at 82 percent when walking, and hemoglobin went from 8.8 to 8.2 were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information from the source document that the patient is an anemic patient on perpetual oxygen, the events of oxygen saturation decreased, hemoglobin decreased and dyspnea on exertion is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. The event of pain in extremity is possibly related. Further information has been requested.

                                                Shortness of breath and respiratory distress resulting in mechanical ventilation. Some concern for myasthenia crisis due to presentation, started on course of IVIG.  Possible azithromycin (home medication) could have been contributing to this as well.  Also in septic shock with extensive lung infiltrates started on broad spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and Zosyn - Zosyn was transitioned to cefepime. Lactic acidosis secondary to shock (initially 7.2 which has trended down to 2.5 at time of submission).

                                                The patient had her second Moderna shot on Feb 17, 2021. At 3 am the next morning she reported to the ED c/o being &#34;fluish&#34; and short of breath. She was found to be hypoxic to the upper 80&#39;s on RA, and a CXR was consistent with CHF.  She stated she had some off and on chest pain for the last few weeks, especially with exertion. Ultimately it was found that she had an elevated troponin and was felt to have had an MI. She underwent cardiac cath and a stent was placed in a 95% ostial right coronary stenosis.   Although she was reported as having had a &#34;hyperimmune&#34; response to the vaccine, I can only say for certain she had flash pulmonary edema due to cardiac ischemia that was due to a stenosis in her RCA that had been there for quite some time, but possibly just happened to become critical right after her second COVID vaccine. It would be hard to blame the vaccine, but it is also impossible I guess to absolve it from any role in her MI.

Her SOB was significant enough for her to seek Urgent evaluation on 2/8 then ED evaluation on 2/11 then again on 2/20/2021. she continues to have SOB/DOE even now.  She also has dizziness intermittently.  she had chills initially but no fever until she had transient fever for less than 12 hours 2.5 weeks later likely associated w/ unrelated problem( UTI).  so far no causes found regarding her SOB after numerous tests( see below for tests).

I HAD EMBOLISMS IN BOTH LUNGS, FLUID ON THE LUNGS, AND WAS ON OXYGEN FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS, DAILY INITIALLY AND OCCASIONALLY AFTER 4 MONTHS. Treatment: I could not reach my physician despite repeated attempts. My pulmonologist had previously prescribed a protocol of prednisone and a z-pack should those symptoms recur. Day 6 after vaccine I began the protocol. Day 10 saw improvement in breathing and coughing. Day 14 symptoms resolved. Day 14 (Feb. 16) to Present (March 3) no unusual symptoms. Some nasal congestion and mild occasional wheezing, consistent with pollen season and my usual COPD symptoms. Thank you.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

Her breathing continued to decline where she had to be placed on a ventilator. She stayed on that for almost 3 weeks. The doctors had no hope of her recovery and we chose to end life support exactly one month after her second shot.

On 21-Dec-2020, the patient experienced CARDIAC FLUTTER (30 minutes of rapid heart rate and fluttering) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath), SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (supraventricular tachycardia), DIZZINESS (Dizzy), HYPERHIDROSIS (diaphoretic), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations), FATIGUE (Fatigue) and NAUSEA (nauseous). On 21-Dec-2020, CARDIAC FLUTTER (30 minutes of rapid heart rate and fluttering) had resolved. At the time of the report, DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath), SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA (supraventricular tachycardia), DIZZINESS (Dizzy), HYPERHIDROSIS (diaphoretic), PALPITATIONS (Palpitations), FATIGUE (Fatigue) and NAUSEA (nauseous) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 21-Dec-2020, Electrocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) supraventricular tachycardia. On 21-Dec-2020, Heart rate: increased (High) increased.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No relevant concomitant medications were provided. About 3 hours after receiving vaccine, patient had 30 minutes of rapid heart rate, and fluttering. She laid down, went to sleep, and it resolved. She didn&#39;t seek emergency care. Did not have chest pain or shortness of breath.  Continued to have palpitations occasionally, fatigue, tachycardia. She presented to primary care professional on 07 Jan 2021 for symptoms and was transferred to for additional cardiac workup and treatment after capturing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) on electrocardiogram (EKG). Also diaphoretic, dizzy, nauseous, shortness of breath with palpitations. She was given IV metoprolol in ED with conversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). They suspect that the vaccine may have been her trigger. She was able to discharge without escalation of care.

Friend reports that patient complained of &#34;just not feeling right&#34; following vaccine administration. Complained of poor sleep, poor appetite, dyspepsia and began complaining of lower extremity swelling in the weeks following vaccine administration. Was no longer able to line-dance, etc. Was fatigued. Her friends became concerned and encouraged her to seek medical attention, patient reported that she had was prescribed &#34;water pill&#34; and told to &#34;lay off salt,&#34;. Friends later found out that she had lied about doctor&#39;s visit and was self-medicating with over the counter  &#34;water pills&#34; for all of the water weight she was gaining. Eventually developed worsening shortness of breath. Admitted to hospital on 5/4 with shortness of breath and worsening abdominal pain. Found to have systolic heart failure (EF 20-30%) and was in SVT. Also diagnosed with UTI and SMV thrombus. Grossly anasarcic on exam. Treated for heart failure with diuretic and for her UTI with antibiotics, was started on Heparin drip for SMV thrombus. Underwent left heart catheterization at OSH that was negative for significant CAD. Developed worsening septic shock and was transferred to our hospital for higher level of care. Unfortunately had ongoing decline, found to be fungemic. Eventually succumbed to her septic shock, passed away on 5/14/21.  Patient had second dose of vaccine on 3/18/21 according to vaccine card in her purse. Friend states that because of symptoms she developed after first dose of vaccine, she was fearful of getting second dose.  Friends insist that she was well before the vaccine---knee pain was limiting factor for her activity level, never shortness of breath. Of note, several friends tested positive for COVID on 2/11/21, the week prior to patient receiving her vaccine. Patient tested negative and reportedly got tested at frequent intervals and was always negative.

I took Benadryl, Claritin and Pepcid ( these were meds previously recommended for my daughters allergies). It took about 30 mins after the meds to be able to swallow comfortably without coughing. The rash however lasted three weeks. I has a telemedicine consult with my allergist who was hesitant to advise the second shot.

Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Pleasant 78-year-old female with history of lung cancer with remote partial pneumonectomy, some element of COPD and chronic respiratory failure on home oxygen therapy. She presents with worsening shortness of breath, which started rather abruptly the day prior to presentation. On arrival to the ED she was mildly tachypneic and slightly tachycardic and appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. Her O2 had been titrated to 4 L/m nasal cannula in order to sustain SaO2 values in the 90% or above range. Patient also noted to have pallor. No hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, abdominal pain, fever, cough or known exposure to COVID. Patient reports having received her first COVID vaccination just over one 1 week ago. A hypochromic microcytic anemia, progressive, was noted with a hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Patient reported that she was up-to-date on EGD and colonoscopy within the past year without findings of acute pathology or bleeding. A CTA of the chest was conducted with findings of bilateral pulmonary emboli. She denies lower extremity swelling, pain or tenderness. Patient placed in observation in order to provide palliative blood replacement therapy and commence with anticoagulation for venous thromboembolism.  DISCHARGE SUMMARY/OBSERVATION COURSE: Uneventful observation course for this pleasant 78-year-old female who presented with somewhat sudden worsening of her chronic shortness of breath and was found to have CTA evidence of bilateral pulmonary emboli. This in the setting of a progressive iron deficiency anemia without evidence of active clinical gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells in a palliative fashion for her presenting hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL. Posttransfusion hemoglobin was 10.1 g/dL. Concurrently, she was placed on weight-based low molecular weight heparin for full anticoagulation. I examined the patient on the morning of February 12 and found her to be nondistressed. Her SaO2 value was 96% on 4 L/m nasal cannula O2. Recall that her baseline flow rate historically had been 2 L/m his cannula. Etiology of the patient&#39;s thromboembolism uncertain. She had no clinical findings of unilateral or bilateral lower extremity swelling or tenderness. Patient noted to be a survivor of both breast and lung cancers but without known evidence of active persistent malignancy. Of interest, she had received a COVID-19 vaccine just over one week prior to presentation. I contacted pharmacy in this regard and encouraged him to report possible adverse event via VAERS. I recommended a course of rivaroxaban and provided a prescription with a VTE dosing schedule. Patient was advised to followup with Dr in 10 days.  M.D., Hospital Medicine    MD Feb 12, 2021 08:40

(7:07pm) I asked the tech to grab the epi pen and call 911. Within 30 seconds of first event, patient was almost not breathing. (7:08pm) I placed the patient on her back and delivered the contents of one epi pen into her left upper thigh. (7:09pm) Patient started to regain her breathing. (7:10pm) Patient  was breathing better and able to talk. (about 7:13) 911 arrived, accessed the patient, eventually taking the patient to the hospital. Patient was fully aware and breathing at that time.

                                                Admitted to hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure following covid vaccination.  (patient significantly fatigued, slept most of the day after vaccine, not on BIPAP as needed)  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  patient is a 78 y.o. female with a history of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and persistent atrial fibrillation who presents today with general malaise.  She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 04-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown), intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06-Feb-2021, approximately 48 hours after vaccination, the patient developed allergic reaction and had hives all over her body. The patient received diphenhydramine for hives. The patient also stated that inside of her was burning, face swelled up, lips swelled up and throat swelled up. The patient rushed to emergency room (ER). They needed to take the patient to an allergist because they wanted to find out if this was related to the vaccine. The allergist told her that they couldn&#39;t do an allergy testing. The patient asked if there were any reports on people showing allergic reaction 48 hours later after the vaccine. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, allergic reaction, hives all over her body, face swelled up, lips swelled up, throat was swelled up, and burning, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient states she received first COVID vaccination approximately one week ago (not a great historian); she tells me about 4 days later she became shorth of breath that progressively worsened - especially with exertion.  She went to ER and was sent home on steroids and antibiotics.  Shortness of breath became worsened so she presented back to ER and CTA was performed.  There is no evidence of PE but patient has what looks to be a chronic DVT of left subclavian vein extending up to IJ junction.  I do not believe this is for sure vaccine related but felt it was important to report it anyway.  She cannot tell me why she takes warfarin at home but I do assume it is for this known chronic DVT.  Unsure of Vaccine brand name.  Most vaccines in this area have been Moderna.

On an unknown date, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY ARREST (Respiratory arrest and was out) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), DYSPNOEA (Diaphragmatic breathing (could not breathe) was on vent mask that delivered oxygen) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COUGH (Cough that felt like coming from another human being) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt crappy) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ERYTHEMA (Covid red arm) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CHILLS (Intermittent Chills) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY ARREST (Respiratory arrest and was out), DYSPNOEA (Diaphragmatic breathing (could not breathe) was on vent mask that delivered oxygen), COUGH (Cough that felt like coming from another human being), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt crappy) and ERYTHEMA (Covid red arm) outcome was unknown and CHILLS (Intermittent Chills) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In February 2021, Erythema: (abnormal) (big - diameter 3.5 X 6 inches). In February 2021, White blood cell count: 15.5 (High) Her white blood cells were 15.5. In February 2021, X-ray abnormal: (abnormal) lung X-rays were horrible and was &#34;tanked&#34; due to all the diaphragmatic breathing (could not breathe).     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received treatment with 3 antibiotics, steroids and oxygen. Patient reported that they wanted to intubate her and ativan was pushed by RN. Patient was on &#34;vent mask&#34; that delivered oxygen and was in cardiac intensive unit for 4 days and then the doctor decided it was not covid or pneumonia and were looking at cardiac issues.They had to give Narcan to reverse the effects of Ativan. Patient stated in the call that Moderna pushed her off the end of the cliff and reports that prior to this she was healthy and walked daily on regular basis.

Hospital ruled out acute stroke but could not entirely exclude a cerebellar stroke due to her dizziness with vertigo and nystagmus (per hospital report). Client was in hospital 2.5 days, per hospitalist. note-all work up including MRI and tte were negative for acute findings- symptoms have resolved. Hospitalist noted symptoms may be worse following second shot. Spoke with client 1/19/21 and she reported feeling weak and tired only.

                                                6:13 pm - 9 pm   Extreme shooting pain, right shoulder, clavicle and neck causing my arm to jerk and sometimes my body spasmed. Pain was intermittent, coming and going but taking my breath away. I called CVS about aspirin and took 5 Baby Bayer aspirins. Pain went away at around 9 pm. Never returned. NO  other adverse effects  Surprising result is diminished pain in knees! When it gets cold, rainy, my knees have been extremely painful so I&#39;d have to lift myself up from sitting but since then the pain is at 1 to 2 on the scale rather than 10 ! It sounds strange but it has happened and that&#39;s why I felt I needed to report this.  Rainy days this week with no debilitating pain and I waited to report this for a week since the pain usually began days before.

Severe pain symptoms returned early morning on 1/30/2021 and resulted in my going to the ER at the local hospital around 10:00 a.m.  An EKG , CT scan, and blood tests determined no heart attack or other life threatening conditions and I was released from the hospital around 4:00 p.m., still experiencing pain without a cause being determined.  Pain and painful area were no longer present on 1/31/2021.

She developed a &#34;bronchial cough&#34; about 48 hours after receiving vaccine. She wanted antibiotics for cough from her primary care because her husband is having surgery on 3/15/21 and wanted to make sure she could go into the hospital with him. Her primary care provider prescribed her Ceftin 500 mg. She has taken Ceftin before without any allergic reaction. She said as soon as she started taking the Ceftin her entire body became itchy &#34;down to her fingers&#34; and had hives from head to toe. Also reports mild shortness of breath. Her provider was unsure whether the reaction was from the Ceftin with the vaccine or the Ceftin itself. Patient said her primary care may do some testing to find out if she is allergic to Ceftin.

Was dizzy walking into kitchen getting a Sprite.  Set in recliner with heavy covers.  Took my blood pressure at 5AM &amp; it had dropped to 104 /44 which was apparently why I was so dizzy.   I then took a Tylenol and felt fine after 9AM.  I still feel fine but wanted to report my extremely low blood pressure which usually is 135/65 in mornings.    I&#39; m thankful for the vaccine.

                                                shortness of breath, pain in chest increasingly more severe as time went on. Noticed shortness of breath about 12 days after the vaccine was given. I am a 2 mile a day walker and very healthy. It was below freezing and I attributed the shortness of breath to weather. I went to an ER on March 8, 2021  after realizing symptoms were worse. I was admitted with Pulmonary embolism in both lungs and pneumonia in both lungs. The hospitalist could  not give me a reason why this happened. He encouraged me to report this incident. You would need to contact him for tests and such. I am a patient. I live where medical help is limited. The vaccine was administered at a clinic but the ER I went to was a different system.

                                                The patient stated that she gets paralyzed after getting vaccines.  I asked her if she had someone in the pharmacy to help her. She said she came alone.  I told her I would have her wait 30mins after dose to make sure there were no issues. After I gave her the shot, she looked at me and said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. Then she looked and said my neck hurts. So I had her take deep breaths with me to get her to calm down as she appeared anxious. She was doing great then she went limp. I held her head up and asked her is she was ok.   She said she was, but then her breathing become shallow. She was un responsive at this time with her tongue pushing her mask off her mouth.  So I lowered her mask and her tongue appeared to be enlarged.  I had my technician call 911 and I gave her a dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg.   She was unresponsive, but breathing on her own.  The paramedics came and got her vitals, placed her on stretcher, and put in a medicine line to give her medications if need be.  She left somewhat unresponsive. They said she should be fine  and took her to ER.

Treatment team Severe sepsis (CMS/HCC) Principal problem Discharge Summary Internal Medicine    Inpatient DeathSummary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admission Date: 4/6/2021     Discharge Date: 4/17/2021  DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Patient is an 79 y.o. female morbidly obese with past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia follow-up that was initially scheduled oncology follow-up for April 7 now postponed to the next 2 weeks, COPD on 2 L oxygen support at home, GERD, depression and anxiety.  She was recently seen in the ED on April 4, 2021 with complaint of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills, nonbloody diarrhea, vomiting and weakness and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.  She had however received a second dose of COVID-19 a week before and was  discharged home due to lack of significant findings on imaging chest x-ray and lack of requirement for higher  oxygen support. She presented to the emergency via EMS for evaluation of progressive shortness of breath with associated with fever, chills, headache, persistent shortness of breath, cough productive of thick clear sputum, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or dizziness.  Denies recent antibiotic usage or recent travel.  Apparently, she thought she was getting better upon discharge after being kept for about 12 hours in the last ED visit, however she was not feeling well after going to bed last night and asked the husband to call 911.  Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

She had even gotten her annual labs done recently which came back all with in normal range, she as far as we knew did not have any issues with her heart.  After her first vaccination in March she started to lose interest in things and didn&#39;t have energy to be as active as she was.  After the second shot with in two days she started to report pain in chest and head and trouble breathing,  She went to her PCP on 5/12 and he wanted her to go to a cardiologist, this referral was made but by the 16th she was in the ER due to extreme chest pain and trouble breathing, a stent was placed in her heart on 4/17/21 my mom&#39;s 80th birthday.   with in 4 days she died.  Her heart just deteriorated. i feel that if she didn&#39;t get this shot she would be alive today, she was healthy, now she is dead.

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

I understand that there may or may not be a link between my mother&#39;s symptoms and the vaccine, but I want to make sure that it is looked into.  Three days after dose, my mother woke up with shortness of breath.  Over the last week, the shortness of breath has lingered and she has also had stomach issues.   She has now been hospitalized since yesterday.  These are not uncommon symptoms with her, but she  has definitely been worse since the vaccine.  Assuming she recovers, I am concerned about her taking the second dose, scheduled in two weeks.  Her symptoms are very similar to those of a Physician in an article I read today.

                                                Cerebral occlusion in middle cerebral artery; Developed SOB which lingered; This spontaneous case was reported by a health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of CEREBRAL ARTERY OCCLUSION (Cerebral occlusion in middle cerebral artery) in an 81-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia.    On 10-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 10-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Developed SOB which lingered). On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBRAL ARTERY OCCLUSION (Cerebral occlusion in middle cerebral artery) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to CEREBRAL ARTERY OCCLUSION. At the time of the report, CEREBRAL ARTERY OCCLUSION (Cerebral occlusion in middle cerebral artery) and DYSPNOEA (Developed SOB which lingered) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, Patient&#39;s advanced age, hypertension, diabetes Miletus, hyperlipidemia may remain as risk factors for this event. Further information is requested.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

I developed a swollen and itchy arm. I developed dark bags under my eyes that made me look like I had &#34;black eyes&#34;. My fingers turned purple. my veins in my hands and feet enlarged and looked green to me. I feel fine, I just have these funny things happening. everything started to go away after about 3 days and are almost normal except for the veins. I felt fine. then 3 days later on 2/15 I felt like I was going to faint, I felt a rush of heat like a fever and nausea. I felt fine by the end of the day. I am sleeping a lot. I also have a strange feeling in my foot that comes and goes for a few seconds.

She said within 3 days her legs started to go numb and especially her thigh muscles and her veins in her left foot were engorged. She said she went to the ER and they rxed 40mg prednisone for 4 days and her papers from the ER read &#34;allergy.&#34;  When I spoke to her for the second time and advised her she does not qualify for a second moderna vaccine, patient said that when she went to the ER she went for abdominal swelling, leg swelling, leg numbness, and swelling of the left ankle and foot. I confirmed with her that her symptoms have all improved and she said &#34;yes, tremendously.&#34; She said she spoke to her PCP and at least one additional doctor yesterday.

AFTER A WEEK OF FEELING UNWELL SHE DECIDED TO GO TO LOCAL CLINIC. THEY DID AN EKG AND SENT FOR A HEART MONITOR. SHE WAS SENT HOME AND WAITED FOR THE MONITOR TO ARRIVE BY MAIL. IN ABOUT ANOTHER  WEEKS TIME SHE WAS RUSHED TO EMERGENCY AND WAS HAVING A MASSIVE HEART ATTACK. SHE PASSED AWAY MARCH 2, 2 1/2 WEEKS AFTER HER FIRST MODERNA VACCINE. I BELIEVE IT WAS THE VACCINE THAT CAUSED THE HEAT ATTACK.

                                                The patient received her FIRST dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/26/21 and SECOND dose on 2/23/21. On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

I (foolishly) did not do anything but suffered through these symptoms at varying degrees of pain/discomfort for about an hour and a half.  Recently on 4/9/21, I experienced these same symptoms.  My heart felt like it was pounding out of my chest; pulse rate was up to 170 and BP was 190/86.  I also had intermittent chest pains at different levels of severity.   Called 911, ambulance took me to healthcare facility where I was advised that I had Atrial Fibrillation.  I don&#39;t know if this is related to the Covid shots but I feel it should be documented.  While I have had high blood pressure for years and I am an older adult, I have never had any heart problems, per se.  I also know it would not be unusual for someone with my characteristics to develop- Atrisl Fibrillation, however, it is suspicious that this occurred only after the covid vaccines were administered.

This continued for over 2 weeks and then started having chest pain.  Went to ER and admitted with pericarditis.  2 days later I went into Atrial fib.  The next day I had a cardioversion.  Home the following day.  One week at home not feeling well, I was readmitted with increased chest pain and shortness of breath.  Pulse very low and needed a pacemaker which was inserted Easter Sunday.  Home now and still not feeling well.

                                                Bad headache, very stuffy nose, I couldn&#39;t breathe and almost went to the hospital. Ears were ringing, my eyes were ready to pop out of my head. Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

I am not sure if it was related to the vaccine, but the rapid antigen for Sars-CoV2 was positive and the PCR was negative.  I am reporting this event because of the lack of clarity on this issue and the positivity of the Sars-CoV2 was beyond the parameters of 14 days in the phase three trials.

We called 911 right away but, by the time EMS arrived, she was unconscious and didn&#39;t appear to be breathing. Patient was not sick at the time this occurred but she was hospitalized in December of 2019 and was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension which required her to go home with and continue on supplemental oxygen. However, she never experienced pulmonary distress after coming home and her SPO2 levels consistently ranged between 96 and 99% with supplemental oxygen. Patient&#39;s death was very sudden and unexpected.

In addition, I had wheezing and a feeling of &#34;bubbles&#34; in my chest. My arm was very hot and tender at the injection site.  I slept through the rest of the night but awoke feeling extremely weak and confused. As a result, I spent the day in bed. I had no appetite, as well. The next day, I had coughing bouts off and on and still don&#39;t feel myself.

                                                Within a few days, my mother started reporting profound fatigue and shortness of breath while conducting routine household activities. She no longer had to energy for her daily exercise walks and became increasingly lethargic. She died in her sleep while taking an afternoon nap on Thursday, February 4th. I am highly concerned this could be a vaccine related.

The pt reported 2 episodes of SOB and lightheadedness, with the second one as the more severe. On her second episode, she felt severe shortness of breath, tried to walk quickly to her bed with her walker, and fell into her bed. CT angio demonstrated acute saddle PE, mild right heart strain, RUL pulmonary infarct, and mild multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID; IR was consulted and suggested thrombectomy due to the severity of the embolism. In the ED, she was started on heparin drip and put on low-flow NC oxygen without distress. Upon arrival to the emergency department her vital signs were significant for T 36.4, SBP 120/81, HR 95 bpm, NSR, RR 18, FiO2 94% on room air.  Her oxygen increased to 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.  Her laboratory values revealed WBCs 15.1, Hb 14.4, HCT 43.4, PLT 321, neutrophils 68.8%, D-dimer 4642, NA 134, K3.4, anion gap 9, BUN 17, creatinine 1.00, glucose 163, troponin elevated 0.12, 0.25, and 0.41, urinalysis is unremarkable, COVID-19 swab is positive. A thrombectomy was performed 2/16/2021.  She tested COVID positive on 2/16/2021 and her SpO2 remains in the high 90s with dips to mid 80s while talking, but she does not currently experience any SOB.

                                                Following the vaccine the next day she had the normal discomfort, tiredness and the arm was sore for about a week.  Then on 2/11/21 she had an ocular migraine, and as that ended she was hit with an intense pain in her head that she had never experienced before.  It lasted for hours, for the rest of the day.  She took Ibuprofen which did not do anything.  She looked up online and the  clinic had a report on what to do for the migraines, and she took Ibuprofen and strong coffee.  She does that and was able to ward it off and stop it some.  Then it continued to happen during the day and the pain is so intense.  The day before yesterday, 3/9/21 the regimen of coffee and ibuprofen did not improve.  It goes from the top of her head, down to her neck and sore to touch behind her ears.  It is now a dull headache around her whole upper skull.  She lives alone and her children do not live anywhere close to her.  She is also having horrendous fatigue and is not able to get much done such as shopping, also shortness of breath and pounding heart beat generally is very active and some days she is not able to get dressed due to the symptoms.   She went to UC and she had them do a COVID test, which was negative and sent to the ER at and her BP was 191/75, and was told to FU with her neurologist and internist and had no answers for her headaches.

The patient states she was just eating and suddenly started having sharp pain on the left side of her chest.  There was a little bit of associated shortness of breath, but not much.  She states it was sharp in nature and seem to stay about the same for about 40 min.  She states that she does seem to get chest pain sometimes when she vacuums, but usually if she sits down it immediately goes away.  She reports that she saw PAC about a week ago and was thought to be a little bit fluid overloaded.  She was started on a little bit of oral Lasix and was supposed to come see provider later in the week.  She states she has diuresed very aggressively the last few days and is feeling quite a bit less short of breath.  In the ER, her EKG did not show anything acute.  Troponin was normal.  BNP was mildly elevated, but her imaging did not show any signs of acute congestive heart failure.  Her D-dimer was elevated.  However, she was not having any pain while she was in the emergency room.  Her pulse was normal and her oxygen saturations were in the high 90s.

                                                Patient  seen and evaluated by PA-C. with myself.  We agreed on the clinical findings and implemented our plan together.  Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time.

                                                While working at my desk @ 10:00 April 1st,  felt a severe jaw pain, radiated around to back of neck, down back, around to chest. Became very SOB.  Called 911.  Ambulance took me to hospital ER then ICU.  Developed exquisite headache.  Given pain meds and slept. Dr saw me the next morning.  I had not had a heart attack. They had no DX.  I think I had a 23 day delayed reaction to shot #2.
