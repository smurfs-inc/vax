                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                The 12:20 pm appointment today (4/20/21) had an adverse reaction to the IMZ. Patient was done receiving the vaccine at about 12:30 pm and I stated she would have to wait until 12:45 pm. Around 12:38 pm I noticed she looked a little pale and went to her side to check on her. The patient stated she was feeling light-headed, dizzy, nauseous, and had trouble with her vision. I had the patient lay down and elevate her feet. The technician also grabbed an ice pack to place behind her neck. Asked if she would like water. The patient then stated she was having trouble breathing/short of breath and her ears were ringing. Once the patient stated issues with breathing 911 was called. A code white had been called and management was in the pharmacy. The 911 operator continued to ask questions about the patient&#39;s status and stated to not give any water or medications. I continued to assess the patient&#39;s symptoms. Her vision improved; however, she continued to feel light-headed, nauseous, and having trouble breathing. A member of EMS was in the store and came over to assess the patient. He had the patient sit up but she continued to have the same symptoms. He assessed her IMZ site. She was not feeling itchy and had not developed any hives. The ambulance arrived. EMS evaluated the patient and then took her out of the store on the stretcher.

Patient also lost control of her bladder and urinated while sitting in the chair. We immediately called 911 who stated not to move her our of the chair. Patient went in and out of consciousness several times (2-3) for short intervals (15-30 seconds). EMS arrived within 10 minutes of symptom onset and took her to the local hospital. While EMS was evaluating the patient in the pharmacy, she stated that she was beginning to have trouble breathing; but those symptoms quickly resolved without the administration of epinephrine. We received a phone call from the patient within 2 hours stating that she was being discharged from the hospital and was feeling much better.

Immunizer then turned around to give her brother vaccination. When he was turned around, he heard the patient&#39;s phone that she was holding dropped and that she had jerked her arm, which caused her phone to drop. When I went to the patient, she was crying and hyperventilating. I told her to put her head down and take deep breaths. I checked on pt in 15 min, was doing better but had burning sensation at injection site. Kept pt at pharmacy for 30 minutes.

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.  We attempted to find an open Urgent Care unsuccessfully and tried to go to an ER but they were full. Fever began to come down around 2230, so we returned home. Continued with ibuprofen every six hours and cooling measures.

We called 911 and she continued to have those symptoms for another 20 minutes.  She no longer needed oxygen after that and her symptoms started to subside.  The hospital ran tests and concluded the symptoms were related to the vaccination since they did not discover anything wrong with her heart or lungs.  Bloodwork only showed low potassium.  Patient had a fever and still does which we are treating with Tylenol.

                                                The very next morning after the vaccination around 7:00 AM , my right arm was hurting, it was not red, or there wasn&#39;t any bruising.  I had tightness in my throat, it was pretty much like an anaphylactic  shock is how the doctors described it. I had white bumps, like welts,   on the back of my throat and tongue. And the roof of my mouth and my tongue, my lips everything in my mouth was swollen. My eyes were almost swollen shut. On 12/27/2021,  I had a doctor video visit. He advised me to take Benadryl, and Tylenol,  I used my albuterol  inhaler several times because I couldn&#39;t breath. So around 3:00 pm I went to the Emergency Room because I was still having a hard time breathing and the swelling wasn&#39;t going down.  The doctor immediately gave me an Epi pen. and told me i had an allergic reaction to the vaccination. The doctor advised me that it was up to me to take the 2nd vaccination . He said it was up to me.

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

                                                Localized super infection occurred 11 days after first receiving vaccine. Diagnosed with asthma soon after and hospitalized for the first time on 2/13 for severe respiratory complications. Prescribed nebulizer treatment at home with albuteral, montekulast, prednisone, and qvar inhaler. Went to urgent care today  in hopes to avoid hospital bills. Chest xray showed some fluid. Prescribed iputropium for my nebulizer treatment and also azithromyacin to stall any infection. Lets hope no more hospital visits. Waiting to hear back from pulmonologist to schedule appt.

                                                Patient complained about chest tightness 15 minutes after vaccination, with no breathing problems. Asked patient to sit by me so that I could observe her. Checked blood pressure and was elevated. Administered Benadryl 50 mg one time by mouth to patient. Checked patient blood pressure a 2nd time and was 138/88 mmHg and patient was starting to feel a little wheezy. Decided that since patient seemed to be having an asthmatic episode that we would call EMS to pick her up and they arrived.

                                                Essentially I experienced flu-like symptoms the next day after I took my first vaccine dose. My first symptom was my throbbing headache that lasted longer as well. My other symptoms were high fever, fatigue, chills, sweating, and sudden rapid heartbeat, a little chest pain in my left part of the chest, and muscle and body aches, and a little difficulty breathing. My fever also lasted for a couple of days and symptoms subsided at the end of the second day after the vaccination day. I would please, please like to know if it&#39;s safe for me to take the second dose? I know I would be able to handle the side effects but expected to encounter them on the second dose and not the first dose, so please let me know as my second dose date will be this  Wednesday on the 21st of April.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

                                                I got my depo shot a week and a day after I got my 2nd dose of the vaccine. Shortly after I was driving home and I felt like there was an elephant sitting on my chest. I couldn?t get my air in I was freaking out. I drove home  and was so weak walking into my house I thought I was going to pass out. I told my mom I think I need to go to the hospital. I sat down. Ate some food and tried to relax. It eventually went away and I started getting ready to go to school. Just as I was getting ready to leave I got a huge migraine and started feeling really shakey. That?s when I decided to go to the doctors. They made me take some bloodwork, EKG, X-ray. They suspected from my white blood count that I might have a blood clot so they ordered an emergency cat scan. I got one done and they told me no blood clot. Then today I came in for more bloodwork and they told me that some of my waves from my EKG were slightly abnormal which meant I wasn?t getting enough oxygen into my heart. They want me to take an echo which in that they put me out and shove a scope down my throat and look at my heart. They think it was a reaction from taking my depo so soon after my covid vaccine.

That passed and I started getting really dizzy and was unable to hear or see anything. I pulled over and my throat started to close up and I was having a hard time breathing. It passed in about 2 minutes and an hour later I felt fine but my brain felt tingly like I was on the verge of passing out but no other side effects.  My brain still feels tingly as well.

                                                The patient called an hour after receiving the shot stating she could feel her throat swelling slightly and having a feeling of numbness throughout her throat and tongue. She said she had no trouble breathing, swallowing fluids or any chest pain. It was recommended to take 2 benadryl tablets now (4:45pm) and 2 tablets before she goes to bed. I had the father get on the phone as well, tell educate him on monitoring her breathing. She was urged to see a doctor or call 911 if breathing issues start or swelling gets worse. I asked her to call the store first thing tomorrow morning when we open to see if there was any relief from the benadryl or if symptoms got worse.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                On the night I received the COVID-19 vaccine, I had a fever that went up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In the morning 24 hours after I had the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I felt a little better from the night&#39;s fever and ate instant ramen, oranges, acetaminophen, and a vitamin C tablet. This was at about 8:45 AM. A few minutes or a minute after I swallowed the acetaminophen and vitamin C, I got a severe allergic reaction that led to me going to the Emergency Room. I have eaten these things before and am not allergic to acetaminophen, vitamin C, or anything in the instant ramen. The reaction was first felt by a shortness of breath and I could barely breath. Then, hives started to form on my face and my lips and face became extremely swollen. I then ended up throwing up after my mom gave be a Benadryl pill and I drank another Benadryl after.  My face had become less swollen but it was still difficult to breath and hives started to form all over my body so we decided to rush to the Emergency Room. We got to the Emergency Room at about 9:30 AM and the hives on my body were worse. They were able to calm down the reaction by giving me more Benadryl through an IV and steroids. They knew I had the second dose of the vaccine so they did not give me anything that would suppress my immune system. Timewise, it could be the acetaminophen, but I have taken acetaminophen in the past many times before without a reaction.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I became extremely dizzy, nauseous, my lips went numb, shortness of breath, weakness, slow reaction times, the inability to operate at my normal speed in thought and action, and I became very lethargic.  I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

When I woke up the next morning I was short of breath and it felt like there was a lot of pressure on your chest. I called the hospital that gave me the vaccine and they recommended I go to the ER. I was discharged after 3 hours. I still felt short of breath and had the feeling of pressure on my chest for 48-56 hours. It just got better gradually. I was unable to work because I felt bad and because I also had to quarantine until my test results came back negative for Covid-19.

                                                Around 11:00 in the morning I was starting to feel weak and hard of breathing with a sore arm where the injection site was. As the day went on it progressed to muscle aches and a low fever, I went to bed with chills, muscle pain, heavy breathing, and a 100.8 fever. I work up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and felt nauseous, I don?t remember much but I remember waking up on the floor in a cold sweat, so I assume I passed out from the nausea. I went back to bed and I woke up with a 101.8 fever and weakness and muscle pains. My mother told me to take Tylenol every 4 hours and be on top of things, my symptoms have been decreasing since this morning but as I am filling this out at 11:00 at night I?m slowly getting my fever back. I will add this is exactly how I felt when I got covid back in November of 2020.

Shortly after it became hard to swallow as my throat was closing. I went to Emergency Department around 10p. The doctors administered Epinephrine (via Epi Pen) and Pepcid through an IV. I was prescribed an Epi Pen as well as Claritin and Omeprazole for 14 days.

Once I got home I sat down and started to get very anxious and my chest felt heavy and my tongue and throat started to swell. I say and tried to relax and was going to call 911 if it got worse. They swelling maintained so I took one benadryl, followed by another one 30 minutes later. When I woke up the swelling was still there but had gotten better. I took another benadryl that night. The swelling continued to go down over the next couple of days. After about 5 days I felt back to normal.

                                                At 1712 pt complained of tinging in her throat and numbness in her RA. She stated she was able to swallow. Benadryl 50mg PO given at 1712. O2 99%, HR 82, and BP 140/82. Pt told to stay for further monitoring. Pt then c/o &#34; throat tightening&#34; at 1726 and 0.3mg epi pen given in RT at 1727 after pt was laid supine with legs elevated. Vitals taken again at 1732: BP 170/100, O2 99%, and HR 105. Pt stated her throat felt &#34;much better&#34;. EMS was called at 1727 when Epi was administered. Pt called her mother to notify her of situation. Pt also called father and he did not want pt assessed by EMS or taken to hospital in ambulance. When EMS arrived, father was not present and pt did not refuse treatment, so they did perform an assessment. After that, pt refused tx and continued to feel &#34;well&#34; with no other complaints other than &#34;shakiness&#34;, which is a common side-effect of epinephrine. EMS left and pt&#39;s father arrived. Pt was able to sit and stand on her own. Before she left, she complained of &#34;tightening&#34; and &#34;tingling&#34; again in her throat. Told her she should receive another epipen. Pt&#39;s father said he had one in the car and that he would give it to her and drive her to the hospital.  Pt nodded in understanding. Pt vitals taken at 1750, BP 162/84, HR 113, O2 99%.

While filling out VAR, she noted that she did have an adverse reaction to the last dose. When asked, she stated she developed a red, bumpy rash all over the side of her body about 4-5 hours after receiving the vaccine. She declined itching, noting that it was just red and swollen, and took ~5 days to go away. She declined shortness of breath or difficulties breathing, but did note her throat felt tight. She did not take any medications and had not mentioned it to anyone until now. Due to the non-severe immediate allergic reaction, the CDC recommends not giving the second dose. Recommended the patient does not receive another dose.

                                                On 5/17/21 the Patient received the Moderna Covid Vaccine. She presented with a known allergy to PCN and Augmentin. This was not a reason for the patient not to get her vaccine today so Pharmacist proceeded to give her the shot. We asked for the patient to sit down and since she had some allergies we asked for her to wait for 30 min. Roughly ten minutes into her wait the patient started to complain of numbness of the face, so we went ahead and gave her a cold bottle of water. About two minutes later the patient began to complain of numbness in the arm along with hives on both arms and neck. At this point the patient looked very flush, disorientated, and acted as if she was going to pass out. I went and sat down with her and I could tell she was uncomfortable for which I got her some ice packs and started asking more questions about her reaction. I could tell the patient was very disorientated and she began to complain of swelling and tightness of the throat.  Once the patient began to complain of throat swelling/tightness. I had call code white and 911 due to the concern of anaphylaxis and pharmacy protocol.

Saturday AM It was hard to breath and I was unable to take deep breaths since I felt like my inside were really swollen/Inflamed. Sunday AM the swollen had got down leaving a bruise as big as the inflammation had been.

                                                After waiting for about 15 minutes after her second dose, the patient complained of tongue swelling and difficulty breathing.  The Pharmacist on duty looked in the patient&#39;s mouth and did not notice any tongue swelling but suggested to call 911 because of the breathing issue.  The patient agreed and 911 was called. The local Fire Dept. came and checked the patient&#39;s blood pressure and examined her.  She checked out ok according to the Fire Dept.  The Fire Dept. left  the pharmacy and the patient called her boyfriend to come and pick her up.  The patient walked away on her own power after her boyfriend came to get her at the pharmacy.

It hurts when I breathe but it also hurts while I&#39;m just sitting here. I&#39;ve taken a hot shower and right now I&#39;m breathing in steam. I&#39;ve been hacking up phlegm. It&#39;s a very sharp stabbing pain.

                                                Vaccinated Tuesday  07/06/2021 at 12:00pm. At 12:15 I was having palpitations, and my throat felt tight, I attribute this to anxiety, I was nervous to get the shot but think it should still be noted. At 1:00 or 2:00 that afternoon, I noticed about an inch around where the shot was injected I had small white head like bumps, that if scratched or pressured drained white puss. At 3:00pm that afternoon, I stood up from my bed and felt pressure in my head similar to sinus pressure you can get from a cold. I had no congestion.   On Wednesday 07/07/2021 I woke up and my upper L arm was in significant pain. The area that was vaccinated had a 2-3 inch radius that was bright red in color. The area where I was injected had a 0.5-1 inch radius that was dark purple. This area was hot to the touch, firm, and swollen. The pain was constant but worse when touched.    On Thursday 07/08/2021 there was no new symptoms and the skin reaction started to go away but was still present.   Today Friday 07/09/2021 the skin reaction is still present but improved.  It is still painful to the touch. The redness is gone but the dark purple circle is still pressent. It is still slightly firm, and is no longer hot to touch. It is still slightly painful to touch but not bothersome when left alone. Today I had to leave work early due to a drop in blood pressure at 12:00pm. Around 10-11am I was standing and typing when I felt like I had come down with the flu. This happened rapidly within 2 minutes. I felt feverish, I was sweating, I felt nauseous, but I did not vommit, I felt as though I was going to faint. I had one of the nurses at my workplace check my blood pressure. It was 107/72. Within an hour it rose to 108/72 so I decided to go home.  It should be noted I do not normally eat breakfast. I stay well hydrated.  I had only had my medication, and water at the time of this event which is normal for me. I was given crackers, and juice that did not help. I am unsure if this is related to the vaccination but think it should be noted.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                Pt reported that at about 7pm the day of her vaccine she developed a rash on her left arm/leg. It was itchy and so she took a Benadryl. She said her &#34;throat felt thicker&#34; but the Benadryl helped. She went to sleep and was fine. When she woke up the next morning on 1-6-2021 she reported the rash had spread. When she got to work and found me about 9:30 am to ask if that was normal I encouraged her to call her PCP and take a Benadryl. At that time she was having no difficulty breathing. She chose to call her PCP and not take a Benadryl as it makes her sleepy.  After she called her PCP she ended up leaving work. I found out later that her breathing had become labored and her neck/throat was starting to swell. Per her report, her PCP gave her epi and steroids, and R/X her an epi pen. She took her medicine and Benadryl around the clock and returned to work on 1-8-2021. When I spoke to her on that day she stated all of her symptoms had resolved, but her lymph nodes in her neck were still a little swollen.

I was barely able to speak, calling out for my brothers to get my mom. I was continuing gasping for air while they called an ambulance. The paramedics arrived and checked my lungs and oxygen. By the time they arrived I was back to normal. I didn?t go to the hospital as they didn?t seem it was necessary and I was feeling okay. Later on in the day I just had some slight chest pain and some shortness of breath but it was gone by the end of the night. I?m completely fine now. I had no other symptoms or side effects.

She was breathing rapidly. She whispered that she was scared. I told her to take deep breaths to try and calm her. I asked if she felt hurt or if she has any trouble breathing. After about 3-5 minutes of lying on their ground, she became more alert and asked me if she fell from her chair. She didn&#39;t recall falling or that she said she was scared. I had her sit up and asked how she felt and if she had any symptoms of an allergic reaction--she said no. after another minute or 2, she was able to stand up on her own with no lightheadedness nor dizziness. I walked alongside her to another seat and she sat for another 25 to 30 minutes--she said she was completely fine before leaving with her sister

I slept with my mom in fear of having episode again. Around 2:45 am, my mom woke to me shaking like I was having a seizure. it lasted about 30 secs. she called 911 and i was checked out by paramedics, who said my vitals were fine and I should flollow up with medical care. My mom and I agreed that perhaps I needed stress dosing of Cortef. I took stress dosage and have been taking stress dosage all day and so far no more episodes.  Now waiting for Doctor to call me back and advise.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

Client was informed that the health department would get in touch with her at a later time to determine if she was eligible to get second dose.  Client verbalized understanding.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the event, I had throat swelling, chills, sweats, temperature of 102.5, headache, muscle soreness, dizziness, lightheadedness. Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

I self recovered after about 5-10 min. About 20-30 minutes after that my legs started feeling tingling like they were going numb and I was experiencing hot flashes. This self recovered after 5 min. I was admitted to the ER and monitored for another hour but was stable.

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

Within the next hour, my jaw began to lock and my throat began to burn/tighten. Within this timespan, my body, especially my back began to ache as well as my chest feeling tight.  After three hours, I went to the on-campus clinic and they gave me 50mg of Benadryl.

I got it checked out by a covid reaction physician who said it was a mild allergic reaction. The second dose my left eye swelled shut and both lips swelled up about 24 hours after administration. My throat started to close and I couldn?t breathe. I ended up having to go to the emergency room where they were able to control the allergic reaction. They said it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine and have recommended not getting any more covid vaccines in the future if there were more produced.

While waiting for EMT patient reported that she was feeling better and suspected it may be anxiety. at no point did she report, or did I notice swelling of her lips, tongue, mouth or throat. She also never reported difficulty swallowing. I sat and talked with her while waiting for EMT to monitor breathing or any changes in difficulty speaking. At no time did the patient have any difficulty speaking or have any signs that she was having breathing difficulty. by the time EMT arrived she was still alert speaking and had no signs of a true allergic reaction. EMT agreed. Pt still elected to go to the hospital to confirm that it was a panic attack.

By 48 hours, soreness peaked and the lump remained with warmth and itching when the area was touched with slight pressure. Between the 2nd and 14th day, the lump was still present (still 1.5 inches in diameter) with mild itching. I began to develop a dry cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue, and muscle fatigue that lasted from day 5 to day 11 following the Moderna injection. I went to get a COVID test and the results came back negative. After the 14th day the lump went down but now there is a discoloration of the skin where the lump was located that is still present 23 days after the first injection.   I did not use any medications or treatments to heal the adverse event nor sickness symptoms following the injection.

After she got her first dose vaccine, Pharmacist went over all the potential side effects, app and told her to wait in the waiting area for 15 minutes for adverse reaction observation.  Within 3 to 5 minutes, patient came to the pharmacy counter complaint that her toungue feel heavy, hard to talk and her throat feeling swollen.  She was able to breath but worried.  She had no sign of rash or itching.  Patient was fully alert and awared.  She said she had the same issue when she had nuts when she was younger and did not happened again since then .  On Patient&#39;s Var form she did not indicate that she has any history of allergic reaction.  Pharmacist gave her Epinephrine 0.3mg injection to her thigh and within 5 to 10 seconds she felt release from throat swollen and toungue heavy.  Pharmacist took her BP 117/74 and Pulse 85 (within normal range) and told patient that we are going to call paramedic to check on her and she agreed.   Pharmacist told shift lead who was happened right next to the vaccine room to call emergency number.  Paramedic arrived, took her vitals and said that she needs to go to the hospital for observation.  She refused at first but then agreed when the paramedic told her she need to stay in the pharmacy for 1 hour for observation if she does not want to go to the hospital for observation.  Patient is able to walk out with the paramedic to the hospital.

She said that she tolerated the first vaccine well except for a &#34;dry throat&#34; that was relieved with sips of liquid.  Fourteen minutes after the vaccine her grandmother reported that the patient was distressed.  I observed that the patient was conscious, able to talk, and panting.  She didn&#39;t appear pale or sweaty.  I offered to call an ambulance and the patient and grandmother agreed.  The patient complained of swelling and difficulty breathing.  She did not wheeze or complain of dizziness or nausea.  The patient&#39;s grandmother refused an EpiPen injection.  The ambulance arrived and the patient was taken to the ER.

Some heaviness in her chest  which progressed over next 10 minutes to feeling difficulty breathing - &#34;like a rock on her chest&#34; . At 09:04 AM She used her Albuterol asthma inhaler to see if it would help her breathing. No improvement in breathing, then complained at 0911 of some vision changes, felt like she was having to concentrate to breath - like breathing through a straw and at this time I started to hear her audibly wheezing - Squad was called. When they arrived around 9:18 AM she was having heaviness, closed her eyes - complaining of a little bit light headed, still having difficulty breathing.  She left with squad at 9:24 AM

Then 2 days later her primary did a telehealth and called steroids in and symptoms relieved for a few days then pain came back so we called the primary again and was given more steroids with no relief. On June 7 i took her in to primary and when they listened to her heart they heard something and did a echocardiogram and discovered she has pericarditis and was sent to cardiologist immediately  and the diagnosis was confirmed by cardiologist.  He is trying my daughter on medication first before having to drain it from her heart.

Unable to move till the pain passes through (around 20 minutes). Painful periods started on June 11, 2021 during the middle of the night around 3:00am when i was woken up by the ability unable to breathe due to chest pain and unable to move till the pain passed through. Then again on June 13, 2021 while i was watching t.v. around 9pm. I had difficulty breathing and had to focus on my heart beat to slow down. However, i am constantly out of breathe and easily fatigued.

                                                The date of the second dose was 05/25/2021, which is when the side effects started. I had the normal and expected effects, such as a sore arm and fatigue. I began my period that morning, before I went in for the shot. I would like to be as detailed as possible, so I will likely include some graphic details in this description. My apologies in advance.  My period normally lasts 3-4 days and is moderate (as far as I know) regarding blood loss. After the second dose, the flow was extremely heavy and my period lasted for almost an entire week (7 days). It was miserable. I was bloated and tender in that area, and extremely tired. I was also cramping, which is unusual for me nowadays.  About two weeks after that, I felt a stabbing or ripping pain in the uterus area. It stayed for about two days, throbbing every minute or so. I could not sleep those days. It was not so unbearable that I could not perform everyday actions, but it was taking up a good portion of my thoughts that weekend. After that, it went away and I thought it was over.  About three days ago from today (today is June 22nd, or 06/22/2021), the pain returned and I knew it meant the start of my period. The timing was normal. The next day I began bleeding, but the flow is again much heavier than normal. The pain is back and much worse than before. I am going through many more pads than usual and it is, for me, a worrying amount of blood. Since this is the second period in a row I am experiencing this, I felt it was necessary to report it in. I hope this is okay and not taking resources from those with worse issues.  I would also like to note that I experienced my first panic attack in 5 years the night of my second dose (for no reason- they&#39;ve always had a concrete reason for occurring) and my anxiety was notably worse that week (I am on medication and was otherwise doing very well managing the anxiety). During the attack I experienced the usual symptoms: my throat closing up and making it harder to breathe, and uncontrollable shaking and crying.  I was not thinking of anything that would make me nervous at the time of the attack. I had just finished an online gaming session with a friend and was showering to prepare for bed, so I was fully relaxed.  Additionally, my mental health has notably dipped a bit over the last month, though there are a number of factors at play and I don&#39;t want to blame the vaccine for that. However, I was told to at least make note of it here just in case there does end up being a correlation.

                                                I expected fever and tiredness but no where online or in person has anyone said anything about throat and lung pain. Ever since I woke up the next morning after receiving the vaccine my throat burns and my lungs ache with each breath I take. Hot beverages stop it for a short amount of time and ibuprofen (though it is child ibuprofen but I am not good at taking pills) worked at first and hasn&#39;t really since the first time. In theory my brother has also been experiencing this sort of pain but all he is saying in regards to it is that his chest hurts.

My chest felt heavy and I was having labored breathing, My heart was racing at 160bpm and my blood pressure was 180/90, both of which are very high and abnormal for me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

                                                1/14/21- 10:30am Noticed some fullness/swelling in throat. Was still able to breath fine, but definitely noticed a difference. This lasted a few hours.  1/15/21- 3:45am I got up to use bathroom and noticed I was very lightheaded. I thought maybe I just stood up too fast. I got back in bed and my arm was 8/10 pain so I also thought faintness could possibly due to pain.  7:15am I got up to go to work and quickly felt very warm and my vision started to go black. I laid back down for a few minutes until this resolved. I took my temperature and it was 99.0. I got up again and started to get ready but began feeling light headed again. I ended up getting ready while sitting down because I kept feeling too much like I was going to pass out. I ate breakfast and felt fine. 8:00am I left for work and after driving for about 5 minutes I felt myself getting very warm again and light-headed. I ended up pulling over and calling for someone to come pick me up.  9:00am My temperature was 99.5. My blood pressure laying down was 110/74 and HR was 74. After standing for 5 minutes my BP was 90/70 and my HR was 92. During this 5 minutes of standing I felt myself getting warm again but my vision did not start to go black and I was able to stand for the full 5 minutes.  At various times throughout the day I would feel faint if I was standing or sitting upright for too long. The last time I felt this was was probably 11:30pm on 1/15/21. 1/16/21 - No light-headedness or warmth. Did feel some slight chest pressure, but nothing crazy and it only lasted maybe half of the day.

My through felt weird like it was a bit difficult to swallow. On 1/20/2021, I woke up around 10 am with the injection site swollen, hot, hard, and extremely painful. A dull headache and difficulty to swallow continued. I also had tightness in my chest and shortness of breathe off and on.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

                                                About 2m after second COVID shot patient began feeling burning eyes and slight difficulty breathing. Paramedic onsite immediately listened to lungs and heard diffuse wheezing bilaterally. Within 1m minute patient felt throat tickling and then tightening and breathing was more difficult.

I developed hives on my forehead, cheeks, neck, chest, and arms. The fingers on both my hands and my lips were tingling.  Treatment: I was rushed to the ER and given an IV steroid, IV fluids (2 bags), and IV benadryl.   Outcome: All the reactions went away within 4 hours and I was discharged from the ER. I was advised to take benadryl for 48 hours afterwards as needed and given a 5 day course of prednisone; 2 tablets taken daily.

Symptoms would come and go throughout day, but were worse in the mornings. Wednesday (2/10) - Present (2/13) - same symptoms as Tuesday (2/9). Symptoms worse in the mornings and after physical exertion (going to school, walking stairs), and at night as well. Symptoms are not severe, but I am concerned that they have lasted a full week. I have been taking Day-Quil severe every 4 hours. I was also on my period, which just ended yesterday (2/12). I believe my period started the day of the vaccine.  I plan on going to a doctor&#39;s office, but have been too tired to move from my apartment.

                                                received her COVID Moderna 1st dose vaccine on 3/15/21 in the late afternoon. After she had her vaccine she sat down in a chair and waited out her 15 minutes. During this time she said her ears were ringing and she felt faint. We switched her chair to one with larger arms to sit. She asked for water, we provided her a bottle of water and she started to breathe heavily. Her mom was with her and also was vaccinated waiting for 15 minutes. During this time her breathing became labored and she was feeling very faint. I called 911 and EMS arrived about 10 minutes later to see how she was doing. At no point did Taylor pass out or lose consciousness. She was cleared by EMS who checked her blood pressure which was normal and she did not have labored breathing after their visit. During the EMS check they asked the last time she ate and that was at 11 am. She declined medical transport to the hospital and was able to walk out of the facility.

She said on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe , her lip tingling was a 2. I stayed with her and kept monitoring her and continued to communicate with her. I informed her that she will have to stay for another 15 minutes due to the tingling of her lips. She consented to stay. A few minutes later, she stated that her throat felt as if it was closing. I informed her that due to her symptoms i will have to administer Epipen with her consent. She consented to the use of Epipen Auto injection. I asked the technician to call 911 immediately while I administered Epipen Auto Injection 0.3mg/0.3ml. The EMS team arrived a few minutes after that and took her via ambulance to the hospital. I called her today 4/4/21 and she said she felt much butter and was fine. She said she did not receive any treatment while at the hospital and was discharged on the same day 4/3/21

                                                At about 06:15 PM after receiving the Moderna vaccine, patient left hand (the same arm the shot was given) began to turn blue-grey. The nurses there kept her in a room for about an hour, and monitored her vital signs. Everything seemed to be normal except for the discoloration in the skin. She had trouble breathing and some lightheadedness, but it was ruled to be an anxiety response as everything looked normal. Over the time spent in the clinic, the color began to become less intensely blue and fade back to a normal skin color -- but not completely. At about 7:30 PM, she got up to walk and started feeling pins and needles in her arm and upper chest, but this may be due to anxiety.   The feeling disappeared not long after, and we were able to make it home and eat. Everything else that night went OK, except for the fact that her hand is, at the time of this report, still blue-ish in color.

                                                - 22 year-old female  - Tested positive for COVID-19 on January 31, 2021. My symptoms lasted 21 days and started with major gastrointestinal issues, headache, and cough.  - Had a negative COVID-19 PCR test on February 25, 2021  - this negative PCR was needed to travel back. - Landed on February 28, 2021 and completed my quarantine at my parents house.  - I returned to work on the 15th of March, 2021.  - Over the weekend I traveled and flew back on April 5, 2021. Because I had flown, I was doing a courtesy and went to the local store to get a rapid antigen test.  APRIL 8, 2021 - left work at 12:30 and went to the store to get the rapid antigen test which came back positive. I was told by the nurses that it only came back positive because it has been less than 90 days since I initially tested positive. I was told I did not need to self-isolate and could go about as normal. I had my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on this day at 2:00 p.m. I went to get my second jab. Just to be safe, after my jab I went to the local urgent care where they took a nasal swab for a PCR test. The results of the PCR test came back Saturday, April 10 about 7:30 that evening and the result was &#34;NOT DETECTED&#34;.  SYMPTOMS: Thursday, April 8th  about 8:00 pm I started to have difficulty breathing and taking a deep breath was difficult. I put it down to anxiety about the initial positive test. Saturday, the difficulty breathing continued, along with new pressure in my chest. I was unable to sleep Saturday night - as soon as I was nearly sleep, I would wake up gasping for a breath. Sunday, the pressure in my chest continued and so did the difficulty breathing. I went to the Emergency Room on Sunday, April 11 about 4:15 pm - they took a chest x-ray, ran blood tests, and did an EKG which all came back completely normal - no pneumonia, heart attack, or blood clots. The doctor gave me a 1 mg dose of an anti-anxiety medicine because he could tell I was very stressed. He later prescribed me Prednisone (3 tablets a day for 4 days). As of today, I am still having a very hard time taking a full, deep breath and continue to have pressure in my chest.

                                                Was fine until I stood up at approximately 9:30pm. Immediately got very fatigued, head started hurting. Bent over to pick something up and my back hurt around where my lungs are; it hurt to breathe. Within 15 minutes I could barely stand up. After about an hour of the symptoms intensifying, I started to get a low grade fever. I took something for the symptoms (alka seltzer daytime pill), but went to bed shortly. I started waking up off and on around 6 (I normally sleep in until noon). At 7am, I woke up feeling like I was on fire. I grabbed my thermometer from my nightstand- it read 104 degrees Fahrenheit. I tried to open my medicine but I was so weak I couldn?t do it myself. I walked downstairs and woke my mom up. She took my temperature and it read 103 since I was no longer in my bed warmed by my body heat. She opened my nighttime alka seltzer and gave it to me along with 800 mg ibuprofen. I went to bed with nothing but a sheet and a cooling pillow. At some point my mom came in and handed me my water but I don?t remember it, however it helped cool me down when I fell asleep with it in my bed. When I woke up at 11, my fever was only 100 and it was the only symptom I had. When I got out of bed at 1, I was fever free. I?ve been fatigued the rest of the day but the fever hasn?t returned and I?ve been taking 325 acetaminophen every 4 hrs.

Experiencing loose stools that are orange since the vaccine in April and now have a nerve triggered my body to make me feel faint whenever I go to bathroom. A colonoscopy is scheduled to make sure nothing else is going on. Overall, I have developed many adverse events that have left me incapable of doing anything. I cannot get a job because I feel awful still and would not be able to withstand a workday. It has also given me horrible anxiety that I NEVER had before that coincidentally appeared when I got the shot and hasn?t left. I still feel these symptoms mentioned above.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

The following morning I woke up and got dressed and used the restroom. I proceeded downstairs to make my coffee.  As I was doing so I became dizzy and nauseous. I sat down on the floor and then I lost my vision and hearing. I broke out in a profuse sweat and had no concept of time. My boyfriend was with me and said it took 5-10 minutes before I began to normalize. I apparently had shallow breathing and turned pale white including my lips, I slowly regained awareness although I never fully lost consciousness. 911 was called and paramedics arrived. by this time I had begun to normalize with most of my vision returning. I ended up declining to see medical attention because I normalized and told the paramedics I would seek attention if it came back.  * please note the physician listed is my PCP but I was not seen for this reaction.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

Over the next few days, I became incredibly itchy and developed a rash on both of my arms. I now have what I think is considered, &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. There is a red circle around the injection site that is swollen, red, and tender. I then noticed the inside of my mouth was sore and I had blisters developing on the roof of my mouth near my gums. My throat is super sore and swollen and has a yellow pocket on the back of my throat. I am also having body aches under my arms near my ribs and back.

Afterwards, they put an oximeter in my index finger and I think it was a little high (I am not sure). They took me to a separate room and checked my breathing. It got better several minutes later and they gave me 15 mg of Benadryl. Then, the EMT took me to the hospital for observation. At 4:36, they gave me prednisone in the hospital and at 4:49, they gave me famotidine. I was still feeling the tightness in the throat and chest, accompanied with mild pain, but it was better than before. They kept me in the ER for observation until around 7:30 pm.

                                                Received her Moderna vaccine on March 12 at approximately 5pm.  Within moments her arm and face began to itch.  The nurse administered Benadryl.  The symptoms did not go away or worsen so she left when released.  Around 7 the symptoms had progressed to tongue feeling heavy, sore throat, and some difficulty breathing (although her O2 fluctuated between 96-99).  She went to the ER, they administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroids.  Within a couple hours the symptoms had subsided.  As directed, we continued Benadryl and Pepcid for 24 hours.  After being off the Benadryl and Pepcid for 12 -15 hours the symptoms returned, she took one dose of both and now seems to be fine.

                                                I got the injection at 2:50PM. At 5PM, I did an allergic reaction to it: it started tickling in my mouth, I felt my lips and tongue were swelling, my throat was swelling too and I couldn&#39;t swallow anymore and started having difficulty breathing. As I am allergic to peanuts and already did similar reactions, I took my medication: 2 pills 10mg antihistamine and 2 pills of 20mg cortisone. The reaction stopped after I took the pills but by tongue remained a bit swollen for around 2-3 hours.

She starts to fill better. she says she is itching and her chest is a little read and has some bumps so I gave her some Benadryl.

Manifested no additional or worsening symptoms so she went home and 8 hours after felt flu like symptoms for 79 hours.

                                                Within 30 seconds of the injection of my second dose of Moderna, I experienced extreme nausea unlike any that I have experienced before. Within 1 minute of the injection, my face, arms, chest, and neck flushed and I turned completely red. I felt hot and started to sweat. At the same time, I began having trouble breathing with the sensation that my throat was beginning to close. My eyes filled with tears and I was not able to talk to communicate what was happening. My mom, who was with me at the time of vaccination, asked the administering pharmacist if I could remove my mask because I was having trouble breathing. Throughout this reaction, the pharmacist froze and was visibly in shock of what was happening. Because of this, my mom began asking me questions to figure out what else I was experiencing. Once I was able to remove the mask and breathe deeply, the reaction subsided after two minutes. The pharmacist, after my reaction began to subside, stated that they had an epipen ready to administer if needed. I was never administered the epipen. The pharmacist asked me to wait 30 minutes instead of the general 15 minutes before leaving the site. Because the symptoms went away and did not return within the 30 minutes, I left the site. After the vaccination, I experienced a low-grade fever for 79 hours, chills, a headache, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue. After realizing my reaction was not considered ?normal,? I began to research and realized these symptoms align with anaphylaxis, even though they subsided quickly after experiencing them.

This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on 4/25/2021 at 2:50pm. Patient was in observation area chair 1 and technician noticed she was pale in color and patient waved technician over to her.  Technician went to her and then alerted Pharmacist that patient was feeling light headed and was pale.  I went to patient and asked her how she was feeling and if she was having any trouble breathing. Patient was starting to slouch in her chair and I asked her if I could lower her to the ground.  At that time, she passed out and was unresponsive.  I lowered her to the floor and supported her head with my hand.  She was unresponsive for about 5-10 seconds but then her eyes popped open wide and she made a large gasping breath.  She was very disoriented and asked what happened.  As I talked to her and asked her questions, she became oriented with her surroundings and was able to verbally communicate with me how she was feeling.  Patient was reporting tingling in hands, heart racing, and was visually shaky.  I asked her if she wanted me to call EMS and she responded yes.  At this time, patient was beyond the 15 minutes post observation waiting period.   Technician called emergency number, I stayed on the ground with the patient and continued to assess her symptoms and her breathing.  The color in her face resumed to normal and she was able to use her cell phone to contact her father.  While sitting on the ground with her, she reported she was beginning to feel better, but was still feeling weird in her head.  At that time, EMS arrived and took over.

                                                Patient appeared to be having a pseudo-seizure according to family report. She was found upright in her wheelchair, and appeared to have difficulty breathing. She was maintaining her airway, and did not have any oral secretions present. She appeared to be unresponsive with verbal communication, in addition to making eye contact. EMS called per family and nursing decision. Bilateral feet were placed on a nearby chair, and the patient remained upright in her wheelchair. Upon EMS arrival, patient was assisted into gurney with nursing assistance. All patient belongings were presented to the paramedics at this time. Family states that a similar event had occurred earlier during the day of receiving her vaccine around 10 am, and reported that she was able to &#34;get through it&#34;, and were on their way to obtain assistance for the event. The family suspects the event experienced today was not related to her receiving her second dose of the moderna vaccine today.

Due to her breathing, 911 was called and arrived within 10 minutes.  By the time they arrived, the patient was breathing normally and the nausea and dizziness were subsiding.  They monitored her vital signs which were within normal limits.  She was feeling much better and left with her  brother who was driving.  I spoke by phone with patient about 3 hours later.  She stated that she was feeling back to normal and that she thought it was an anxiety attack (which she stated that she has a history of).

The following morning I felt better, but I am still experiencing headaches and body aches, in addition to chest pain.

                                                Three hours after the second vaccine there was a soreness in my left arm, followed by a headache. The next day around 12:00pm, I started to experience swelling in my throat. The swelling made it difficult to breathe. About an hour later I experienced tightness in my chest, making it difficult to breathe again. I experienced shortness of breath and the tightening in my chest did not leave. I was able to make it more bearable by taking my inhaler, used for my asthma. Today (5/17), I am still experiencing tightness in my chest, although it is not as severe as it was yesterday. The swelling in my throat as disappeared today (5/17).

I made sure my blood pressure was stable (usually reading 128-135 systolic) and tried taking my propranolol for anxiety to stop the effect. Nothing really made it go away. This is not normal for me, but unfortunately I had to work so I worked through it. Would cause me to feel out of breath at times. It finally went away for the most part on the Monday of the next week, but it comes back occasionally.

                                                Obese female patient with history of diabetes and seizure came to our pharmacy for second Moderna  covid dose.  A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, she was feeling lightheaded and nausea. I asked the patient to come back in to the consultation room where she could sit or lay down on the floor. The patient was able to walk back into the room with a little assistance from her mother. She sat on the floor for a bit, still breathing fine, and said she wanted to throw up. I grabbed a trash can, napkins, and a pedialyte bottle for her. She did not throw up but started breathing a little heavier and said she was about to faint. I got the epi pen ready and told her please lay down if she has to. At this point she fell to her right side and slightly hit her head against the wall. It appeared that she stopped breathing for few seconds, but  I still felt a pulse on her wrist. It also appeared that she went into a seizure, her upper body stiffened up and her arms were slightly flailing. I immediately called 911  and about 1 minute later, both the mother and I could clearly see the patient breathing as indicative by the rising/lowering chest. I also felt a stronger pulse on her wrist. I did not inject the epi pen. Paramedics arrived shortly and after about 5-10 minutes of talking to her, the patient began to gain conscious but looked exhausted. They transported her to the hospital. Per the mother, patient was completely fine after the first dose of Moderna;  also just had a seizure a few days before the second Moderna dose. The whole incident was about 20 minutes from administering the vaccine to paramedics transporting her away.

Felt as if I had 30 bricks on my chest causing SOB.   6/10 I was transported to the ER where an EKG was performed resulting in having a combination of Peri and Myocarditis.  Various test and CBC was perfomed resulting in  my troponin levels being very elevated and never went down so I was admitted and more test were performed.  My BP was low during the entire stay but there wasnt much treatment d/t me being pregnant so I was monitored to ensure the symptoms didnt worsen and was released after 2 days.  EDD-1/27/2022

                                                10 minutes after vaccine was given, patient had onset of throat tightness, difficulty breathing, flushing, and rash.  Patient was immediately treated with 0.3 mg of epinephrine and within approximately 60 seconds began having improvement in her symptoms.  EMS was called and patient was taken to the ER via EMS for ongoing observation.  Patient was feeling improved but not back to baseline prior to leaving the clinic.

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                Pt c/o itching and tingling at site of injection.  Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

My throat began to swell and became very short of breath. My chest was tight and felt as if it was being crushed. A nurse walked by me and noticed me grabbing my chest and immediately put me on a gurney. They took my mask off and discovered my lips were swelling and turned blue. My vitals were taken and was was given epinephrine in my left thigh. EMS was called and on board was given an IV Benadryl and steroids. Once at the hospital I was given Ativan, Pepsid and more Benadryl. I was discharged around 4pm and was back at the ED 3/13/21 early morning when I woke up with not being able to breathe, my throat swelling and crushing feeling in my chest. I was given more Benadryl and fluids, and was released 8am. 3/16/21 I came back to the ED as advised by a triage nurse on the phone, as I was having trouble breathing and the same crushing feeling in my chest.

                                                One week after the injection I started developing a rash that started out the size of a quarter and has been getting increasingly worse since it developed 4 days ago.  The rash is now larger than a softball and is swollen, red and itchy. Along with the rash I have been increasingly experiencing shortness of breath when talking, clammy skin, excessive sweating, body aches, and fatigue. The bottoms of my feet have also been itchy. I have been taking Pepcid and Benadryl which have helped to alleviate symptoms. I contacted my primary care doctor and hope to speak with her in the next 24-48 hours.

This went away after an hour. Then a few hours later the same thing happen in my left arm. That also resolved in a few hours. 26 hours after my shot, at just before 1:00pm the following day, I felt the subtle cramping at the base of my pinky and ringer finger on my left hand. This has lasted for a half an hour.   Other than the above, I have experienced fatigue, pain at injection site, slight nose congestion, and dry throat/slight throat discomfort (i.e. feeling dry and only slightly swollen or congested)

                                                That evening my arm swelled up and became very painful - not as much as the first vaccine. I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

She took some Benadryl and passed out for the rest of the day.  Then about a week later the injection site started getting puffier and the whelp is now the size of her fist and is red and purple.   She saw her PCP who is calling her in something stronger than Benadryl.

                                                I had pain in my left arm, and within an hour or two I was pretty exhausted and out of it. I figured it would go away, it got worse the next day, and finally on Saturday when I woke up it was hard for me to breathe and I had pain/tightness in my chest. I went into the ER on Sunday morning and after a day of testing was diagnosed with: - Deep vein thrombosis of bilateral lower extremities - Pulmonary embolism, bilateral - DVT, bilateral lower limbs  I had at least 5 clots in my legs and several more in my lungs but they said there was no way to know the full amount. I had been on HRT for over two and a half years and had no problems, then 4 days after I received my first shot I was informed that I had almost died several times due to the clots. When I explained to my doctor that I thought the clots were related to my shot he shrugged it off, said it was impossible, told it was just my hormones, and said that &#34;Covid is no big deal and we&#39;re overexaggerating how bad it is compared to other things...&#34;. So I don&#39;t think any of this was reported.   Later I saw a blood specialist who told me it was impossible for hormones to do this much damage in the span of a few days without something else effecting it, and told me to cancel my next shot even after we learned I had APS. All and all I would really appreciate someone looking into this to at least make sure there isn&#39;t something else going on, as the timing of this is was too close and I know Covid shots have had the rare chance of causing the exact kind of thing I went through.

I went to the urgent care and they did a EKG.  The advised me to go to my PCP.  My PCP advised me to wear a halter monitor.  They noticed I was having a lot of PCV&#39;s which they now have me going to see a cardiologist for on July 21st.   When I started having the symptoms I was having it everyday, now I am having it every 3 to 4 days.  I am still having shortness of breath and a painless chest pressure.  My heart rate is also elevated like I am exercising when I am sitting still.

On the morning of 4/19, I woke up with sharp and stabbing chest pain which radiated to my back. I was unable to take full breaths. This chest pain continued for two weeks. In addition to the chest pain and inability to take a full breath, I also felt chest discomfort, like my chest was full of something. Wooziness (feeling like I?m going to faint), weakness, and heart palpitations also accompanied my symptoms. Sometimes, my heart palpitations s are so bad that it shocks my body. These symptoms are still here, 2 months after getting my first shot.

Breath sounds were reported to be CTA bilaterally (conducted by RN &amp; director of clinical operations).  Patient&#39;s legs were evaluated, cold compress applied to back of neck, &amp; she was instructed to take slow, deep breaths (in through nose, out through mouth to prevent hyperventilation).

She took a photo of this and showed it to me today and well. The swelling around the eyes seemed minimal. Her lips were swollen. She also notes that she felt tired and had a mild shortness of breath where she felt more comfortable sitting up. She states these symptoms have somewhat improved, though she has been experiencing increasing nausea since yesterday and continues to feel that way. She states that she does not believe she is pregnant, she has an IUD. She also noticed some body aches yesterday, continuing this morning, but they seem to be improving. They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

                                                I received my vaccine around 12:45pm. They had me go to waiting room and wait for 10 mins. I sat down and was waiting for a few minutes when I started to get dizzy. I looked up and told the lady checking people in ?hey I?m getting really dizzy can I lay down? she said yes come in the room. When I stood up my heart started beating really fast. I sat on the table and my chest started feeling tight and heavy. There were 2 ladies in the room at this point so I asked one of them if they had an epipen on hand just in case. My throat wasn?t swelling but it was getting harder to breath from the tightness in my chest. She said they didn?t have an epipen and would have to call emergency services if I needed one. I told her I didn?t know what was going on, that I didn?t need one yet but she should probably call emergency services if they can?t do anything to help me. (ER is right across the street) my symptoms went away shortly after they called. But came on a couple more times but much milder over the next 30 minutes or so. The EMT gave me Benadryl and the ER ran some tests.

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

She was placed in a recumbent position on the exam twith legs elevated and vital signs were obtained, they were within normal limits. Pt then reported that it felt like she had something in the right side of her throat - she declined epinephrine injection. RN and LVN stayed at bedside. Pt then stated that both sides of her throat felt blocked and gave consent for epinephrine injection. RN administered 0.3 mg epinephrine and activated EMS. Vitals signs, breathing and circulation monitored closely until EMS arrival. Pt was transported by ambulance to the hospital emergency department for evaluation.

BS was checked and was low so I was given crackers and a sprite. I was severly nauseaed and HR elevated to 150 with SOB associated and was like that off and on for about 30 minutes which prompted EMS to be called to come check me out and was transported to the ED.  I was given fluids and my lab work showed I was deydrated. UA neg, Triponin-neg, EKG-tackycardia and they symptoms deminished on its on after about 4-5 hours and I was released from the ED.

I took a Zyrtec because I thought my friends dog was giving me a little allergies. 20 minutes later my throat itch got progressively worse to where I started to feel a little wheezy and harder to breathe. My arm where the vaccine was felt itchy. I had a rash all on my left arm and upper chest where I had received the vaccine. Immediately, I took a benadryl then went to sleep. Around 3 AM I woke up uncontrollably shivering. My fiance was able to get me a heater because I was so chilled with shivers but was sweating profusely. These shivers lasted about an hour to where I finally just went to sleep. I woke up around 7 AM with a pounding headache so I finally decided to take my temperature. It was 102 F. I ran a fever all day and brought it down to 100 with ibuprofen.  I ran a slight fever the next day as well with extreme fatigue.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

                                                I began to  have shortness of breath two days  after receiving the first dose of COVID. This lasted a week. I went to the doctors and they did not have any other answer except &#34;anxiety&#34;. I was given Propranolol for anxiety but it did not help with my breathing at all.  After a week, I was back to feeling like myself. However, I just got the 2nd dose of vaccine and the shortness of breath is back and shows no signs of stopping. It has been over a week since I&#39;ve had these symptoms. I know for a fact this is not anxiety, it is something physical.

                                                I was hurting a lot. 8 out of 10 - the pain. My arm was so but my chest was in pain. I couldn&#39;t breathe. I was so light headed I thought I would pass out if I stood up. I went to ER - Dr thought it was  from my wearing personal protection equipment - mask and goggles for work after receiving the vaccine. He told me I was fine but I was so much in  pain that I was too out of it to ask for tests. I was in pain for two week. Chest was in pain.  I had to use my inhaler once a day at least - sometimes more.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

                                                Received Moderna COVID vaccine at 2pm on 3/4/2021. At 5pm of the same day, developed a fever of 101 degrees. At around 6pm of the same day, I had slight heart palpitations. At 9pm (same day) while sitting in bed, I developed tachycardia (Heart Rate 170) and shortness of breath. I laid down and also breathed in a brown paper bag, got my heart rate down to 150. Then, my parents took me to the Emergency Department. Today is 3/12/21 (8 days after receiving vaccine), but my tachycardia, palpitations, and shortness of breath has continued. Heart rate continues to be anywhere from 85-135 bpm while I am at rest. Palpitations have also continued and are worse at night. Shortness of breath has also continued, but is not as bad as before.

It felt like my heart is overworking itself even though I am just sitting still on the computer. Other side effects were headache, nausea, and chills. Noticed my heart rate was fast during the 15 minute observatory period at the facility but assumed it was from the adrenaline &#43; fear of needles. By the twelve hour mark, heart &#43; chest no longer hurt and most side effects were gone.

                                                Pt received 2nd COVID vaccination at 1024. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have dropped her water bottle and become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, she was noted to have moderate pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. Her head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. Pt noted to have some muscular rigidity and not verbally responsive. Another provider advised to call 911 due to unresponsiveness and seizure-like activity. 911 called @1027, meanwhile pt lifted and placed into a wheelchair and moved to treatment area where vitals were obtained, patient became verbally responsive @1034, responses/speech was clear but slow, pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Oxygen applied via facemask @4L. Pt provided staff with phone number to call her mother who was notified of daughter&#39;s condition @1032. FD Engine arrival @1033 report given and pt also became more responsive, eyes opened and stated clearly that she was feeling better. Pt color also improved. Pt denied any allergies, PMH or hx of seizure activity. Pt only reported a syncope many years ago. Ambulance arrival @1036, report provided to emergency staff and pt taken to ambulance for further evaluation @1039. Pt returned to vaccine clinic @1052, having declined ambulance transport. When asked about events, pt stated that upon sitting down she felt a sudden onset of moderate nausea and reached for her water bottle in her bookbag, pt states she could not recall or hear anything until she was moved to wheelchair, and did not recall how she came to be in the observation area (based on this information, suspected time unconscious was approx 6-12 seconds). Pt was educated regarding the many causes of syncope and the neccesity for further evaluation in the Emergency department. Pt discouraged from driving herself from the clinic and was able to obtain ride from her roommate. Pt urged again to obtain a ride to the hospital for further evaluation, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.

                                                I was Vaccinated on Friday March 26, on Sunday night March 28 I had a sudden episode of uncontrollable shortness of breath while sitting having and not strenuous activity. Immediately went to emergency room. First blood pressure on examination was 180/100, also experienced tachycardia with heart rate fluctuating between 100-120s while sitting on stretcher SPO2 remained normal at all times between 98-100%. All exams performed (Labs, Ekg, CTA, UA) showed normal results per MD. Symptoms began to subside on their own and was give small dose of Ativan to continue to help symptoms subside and was discharged with a diagnosis of &#34;anxiety&#34;. Today is March 31st nearing April 1st and I have had intermittent shortness of breath at times just sitting down and other times when performing light activity tachycardia and shortness of breath. I do not agree with the diagnosis of &#34;anxiety&#34; as today I had an episode of shortness of breath and tachycardia after conversation and laughing with my spouse without anything on my mind completely distracted the symptoms began. I am a healthy 25 year old woman with no serious past medical history the only change that occurred before my sudden symptoms was receiving the vaccine just 2 days prior and I truly believe this was the cause.

I (the pharmacist) administered an EpiPen once, then 50mg diphenhydramine IM, and called 911. Patient was evaluated by EMS and brought to the hospital for observation.

It felt like my heart was beating irregular, vision went blury, full body flush, skin was hot,  my chest was heavy and I had shortness of breath. I told the staff that I was having a reaction so they had me sit in a private room and watched me. After sitting for a few minutes the feeling went away. I have not had any side effects since.

                                                I got the shot and waited the 30 minutes since I tend to have adverse reactions, but nothing noticeable happened. I went to get a donut, drop something off with my partner&#39;s sister, then home to take a nap. All I had that day was a donut and water. When I woke up about 4-5 hours later my throat felt tight and like a more mild anaphylactic reaction than my really severe hospital one to triptans. I calmly went downstairs and took benadryl and waited around my partner a to see if it would improve which it did.  It ended up going away and I though nothing of it the rest of the day. I just had a sore arm for the next two days.  I also ate the rest of the donuts the following days and didn&#39;t have any reactions.

                                                Patient presented for a 1st dose of Moderna vaccine and while being monitored in post-vaccination observation, began hyperventilating. She reported dizziness and anxiety. Onsite EMTs were called for support. Patient was helped to lie down on cot by EMTs. Patient began to feel better and was helped to sit in a chair by EMTs. Patient called a rideshare to get her home rather than driving. EMTs approved patient departure from clinic.

                                                Arm pain, arm swelling, bruising at the site of the injection, loss of grip strength in injection arm, all within 10 minutes of vaccination. Within a few hours, tiredness set in, additional loss of grip strength in both hands, but especially in the arm that received the vaccination. 9 hours after the shot, severe fatigue set in, as well as hot and cold flashes, switching between fever and chills, headache, excessive sweating, weakness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, body aches, skin pain, and flare-ups of old injuries. I woke with tremendous, debilitating neck pain as well, which was the site of previous whiplash injuries, in both my neck and lower back, and my knees hurt as well. Woke every hour or so throughout the night, severe symptoms. By the next morning after the shot, the fever and chills had stopped, as well as the nausea and vomiting. Fatigue remained, headache on and off, and body aches. By day 3 most symptoms had gone away except for tiredness. By day 4 I started to notice sun sensitivity, and on day 6 have developed what seems to be a heat rash? My forearms are hot, red, sensitive, and reactive as well. Every day since the shot I have gotten tired in the afternoon as well, even if earlier in the day I felt OK. Have had mild shortness of breath in addition, but nothing that has stopped me from regular activity. As a 25 year old, I experienced incredibly severe symptoms, and this was my first shot of Moderna. No known previous exposure to Covid, either. Noticed that symptoms started worsening rapidly around 6 p.m. the day of my shot after taking my borth control pill as well. Wondering if related, or possibly coincidence.

I was nauseous and threw up twice. I had a low grade fever of around 99 degrees but at one point it did go up to 101.3. My entire body hurt including my head and Tylenol and ibuprofen did not help. On February 5 I was feeling a little better, I still had body aches but could eat a little.   On February 6 at around 0500 I woke up with chest pain. I waited a little while to see if it would go away but it had gotten more intense. I am a cardiac ICU nurse so I knew what chest pain could mean. I got out of bed and at that time my chest pain was a 10/10 and I was having shortness of breath. I woke my fiancé up and told him I needed to go to the ER.  At the ER they ran test and admitted me to the hospital. They later diagnosed with myopericarditis with a small pericardial effusion.

This reaction is still continuing today 4/30, and I do  not know when it will end. I have been to urgent care twice for steroids, I have taken Benadryl, and Zyrtec but nothing will fully get rid of the reaction. I visited an allergist on 4/29 and she believes that I am having an adverse reaction to the vaccine. She prescribed several antihistamines to counter my reaction to the vaccine, including bendaryl, famotidine, fexofenadine, zyrtec, and an epipen incase my throat starts to close.

On Wednesday morning, around 8:30, April 28, I collapsed at at kickboxing class and was sent by ambulance to Hospital Emergency Room as my heart rate was very high and my oxygen was low.  In the ER I was diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs, pulmonary embolism, and was sent by ambulance to another facility where I had a procedure to try to break up the clots (catheter directed thrombolysis).  I spent 24 hours in the ICU, and another 24 hours in Cardiac Care.  I was released on Friday, April 30 at around 2:30 pm.  I am now prescribed Eliquis, have a follow up with my PCP on Monday, , May 10, a follow up with cardiology on May 24, and a follow up on June 14 with the Pulmonary Embolism group.

I administered a 2nd epipen.  Patient was violantly shivering. A  3rd epipen was administered with no relief.  At this time the paramedics arrived and she was transported to the hospital.

About 2 days after, I started to notice tingling in my throat and difficulty breathing.  I could see my throat was swollen and started to close up.  I went to doctor&#39;s office and they prescribed me antibiotics (amoxicillin) and steroids (methylprednisone).  I took the medications but the tonsils are still swollen. At this time, I decided to go to ENT specialist.  I was then diagnosed with Mono.

                                                Around 3pm on 6/18 I noticed a red rash on my upper left arm a good 3-4 inches away from injection sight so I thought I may have been bit by a spider. The rash was itchy and raised and my throat felt tight. I applied a cold pack, put on equate triple antibiotic ointment plus to sooth the itchiness. The area of the rash was hot to touch, no pain. Today, 6/19, I woke up around 5 am and realized the redness got bigger and the area around my injection is a light pink. Still itchy but throat was scratchy. I went to walk in and they noticed there&#39;s a little bruising around the rash area. It was suggested to me to take an allergy pill and I got a prescription for an ointment to help the itching (don&#39;t know the name). The allergy pill has helped a little (took around 11 am) still waiting for the pharmacy to call about my ointment to help with the itchiness. Was told by the walk in if symptoms  escalate then to come back in and they&#39;ll try prednisone or if I feel as though I need further medical help to go to the ER.

                                                Roughly an hour after my first vaccine, I nearly passed out and felt incredibly weak. I could not walk or speak, I could only moan and I ran a fever of around 100 for about twelve hours. A few days later, I started my period a couple weeks earlier than usual but it was incredibly light and was only for two days. Then when I was supposed to get my period I never did, then I never got my next period that following month. I have had my period consistently since I was eleven years old. This is the first time I?ve skipped and nothing has changed, I am not sexually active or on any contraception and never have been.  After my second dose of the vaccine, about an hour after I received the last shot, I began to get a headache and layer down. I woke up in the morning and was shaking, sweating, I could not move due to a burning and tingling pain throughout my body, and I had a terrible headache. I could not take a deep breath without feeling tight in my chest and a sharp pain shooting from chest around to my back and up my neck. My heart has been feeling like it is bubbling and racing. The slightest raising of my voice or active movement causes me to lose my breath and the pain gets worse. This has been going on since receiving my last does and it is currently about three days later.

                                                May 2- Urgent Care. Presents today with a shooting pain behind the left ear that radiates down her neck since 0200 today. June 12- ER. Outcome: Diagnosed with Epicardial Fat Necrosis. Presenting with sudden onset, sharp left-sided chest pain radiating to the left shoulder since 1100. Pain rated 9/10. Pain improved by leaning forward.  Pain is worse lying supine.  Pain is worse with deep inspiration. Tried ibuprofen and Tylenol with minimal symptomatic improvement.  No history of similar symptoms. Patient&#39;s presentation consistent with epicardial fat necrosis given increased attenuation of pericardial fat on CT, trace pleural effusion, and left-sided pleuritic chest pain worse with postural changes. Pericarditis considered given postural component of patient&#39;s symptoms EKG without evidence of pericarditis, ACS unlikely given no ischemic changes on EKG and negative troponin.  Pulmonary embolism considered given sinus tachycardia, pleuritic chest pain, and mildly elevated D-dimer, but unlikely given no clinical signs of DVT, dyspnea, or pulmonary embolism on CT.   6/13 ER This is a 25 year old patient who presents with chest pain.    Considered the possibility of pericarditis given patient&#39;s pleuritic and positional chest pain.  However, her EKG continues to show no signs of such.  Patient&#39;s troponin is not elevated making myocarditis less likely. Dissection were considered but felt to be extremely unlikely given overall presentation and imaging deferred.  PE highly unlikely given negative CT PE study yesterday.  No vomiting to suggest esophageal perforation.  No cancer history to suggest pericardial effusion.  History and exam not suggestive of pneumonia or pneumothorax.    Suspect patient&#39;s symptoms are due to the epicardial fat necrosis seen on previous CT chest.  Patient was treated with 15 mg of ketorolac with minimal improvement and pain.  She was then given 10 mg p.o. oxycodone, 1 g acetaminophen, a L of IV fluid and ondansetron with some improvement in symptoms.  Patient was discharged home with a prescription for oxycodone and ondansetron. Patient was provided with return precautions prior to discharge.  Impression:  Chest pain, epicardial fat necrosis
