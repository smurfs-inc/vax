                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

When RN and I reached patient she was very weak, she was sitting in a chair. I instructed her colleauges to call 911 immediately. Patient was having a little trouble breathing. I think she was scared. I gave her 10 mlL of benedryl and RN administered a 0.5 mL dose of epinephine in her left arm. Patient was helped to the  floor and her feet were elevated.  RN put on a blood pressure cuff. Before she could get a reading, the paramedics were there and took over. Patient was transported to Hospital.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

                                                Localized super infection occurred 11 days after first receiving vaccine. Diagnosed with asthma soon after and hospitalized for the first time on 2/13 for severe respiratory complications. Prescribed nebulizer treatment at home with albuteral, montekulast, prednisone, and qvar inhaler. Went to urgent care today  in hopes to avoid hospital bills. Chest xray showed some fluid. Prescribed iputropium for my nebulizer treatment and also azithromyacin to stall any infection. Lets hope no more hospital visits. Waiting to hear back from pulmonologist to schedule appt.

                                                Patient complained about chest tightness 15 minutes after vaccination, with no breathing problems. Asked patient to sit by me so that I could observe her. Checked blood pressure and was elevated. Administered Benadryl 50 mg one time by mouth to patient. Checked patient blood pressure a 2nd time and was 138/88 mmHg and patient was starting to feel a little wheezy. Decided that since patient seemed to be having an asthmatic episode that we would call EMS to pick her up and they arrived.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

Tonight, I now have extremely flushed cheeks, and they are warm to the touch. It is like a sunburn, but I have not been outside in the sun the past few days.

                                                On the night I received the COVID-19 vaccine, I had a fever that went up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In the morning 24 hours after I had the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I felt a little better from the night&#39;s fever and ate instant ramen, oranges, acetaminophen, and a vitamin C tablet. This was at about 8:45 AM. A few minutes or a minute after I swallowed the acetaminophen and vitamin C, I got a severe allergic reaction that led to me going to the Emergency Room. I have eaten these things before and am not allergic to acetaminophen, vitamin C, or anything in the instant ramen. The reaction was first felt by a shortness of breath and I could barely breath. Then, hives started to form on my face and my lips and face became extremely swollen. I then ended up throwing up after my mom gave be a Benadryl pill and I drank another Benadryl after.  My face had become less swollen but it was still difficult to breath and hives started to form all over my body so we decided to rush to the Emergency Room. We got to the Emergency Room at about 9:30 AM and the hives on my body were worse. They were able to calm down the reaction by giving me more Benadryl through an IV and steroids. They knew I had the second dose of the vaccine so they did not give me anything that would suppress my immune system. Timewise, it could be the acetaminophen, but I have taken acetaminophen in the past many times before without a reaction.

I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                Pt reported that at about 7pm the day of her vaccine she developed a rash on her left arm/leg. It was itchy and so she took a Benadryl. She said her &#34;throat felt thicker&#34; but the Benadryl helped. She went to sleep and was fine. When she woke up the next morning on 1-6-2021 she reported the rash had spread. When she got to work and found me about 9:30 am to ask if that was normal I encouraged her to call her PCP and take a Benadryl. At that time she was having no difficulty breathing. She chose to call her PCP and not take a Benadryl as it makes her sleepy.  After she called her PCP she ended up leaving work. I found out later that her breathing had become labored and her neck/throat was starting to swell. Per her report, her PCP gave her epi and steroids, and R/X her an epi pen. She took her medicine and Benadryl around the clock and returned to work on 1-8-2021. When I spoke to her on that day she stated all of her symptoms had resolved, but her lymph nodes in her neck were still a little swollen.

I was barely able to speak, calling out for my brothers to get my mom. I was continuing gasping for air while they called an ambulance. The paramedics arrived and checked my lungs and oxygen. By the time they arrived I was back to normal. I didn?t go to the hospital as they didn?t seem it was necessary and I was feeling okay. Later on in the day I just had some slight chest pain and some shortness of breath but it was gone by the end of the night. I?m completely fine now. I had no other symptoms or side effects.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, she started to faint, slumping over her chair and fell to the floor. Her eyes were blinking quickly. She was breathing rapidly. She whispered that she was scared. I told her to take deep breaths to try and calm her. I asked if she felt hurt or if she has any trouble breathing. After about 3-5 minutes of lying on their ground, she became more alert and asked me if she fell from her chair. She didn&#39;t recall falling or that she said she was scared. I had her sit up and asked how she felt and if she had any symptoms of an allergic reaction--she said no. after another minute or 2, she was able to stand up on her own with no lightheadedness nor dizziness. I walked alongside her to another seat and she sat for another 25 to 30 minutes--she said she was completely fine before leaving with her sister

I went back into the room and still couldn&#39;t breathe so they sat me down and told me my whole body was bright red and they stuck me with an epipen. The whole reaction probably lasted a  little less than a minute from the time it happened to when they stuck me with the epipen.

                                                immediately felt sore on site of injection and within minutes of leaving clinic, i felt sharp pain in my upper left back (still have that discomfort and I looked at my back this a.m. and i have a red bruise like mark)  I took advil and laid down, fell asleep and when I tried waking up, I couldn&#39;t wake up and when I did wake, I was breathing hard and disoriented.  I slept with my mom in fear of having episode again. Around 2:45 am, my mom woke to me shaking like I was having a seizure. it lasted about 30 secs. she called 911 and i was checked out by paramedics, who said my vitals were fine and I should flollow up with medical care. My mom and I agreed that perhaps I needed stress dosing of Cortef. I took stress dosage and have been taking stress dosage all day and so far no more episodes.  Now waiting for Doctor to call me back and advise.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

She stated she did not require any medical assistance. She stated it slowly resolved itself. Client presented to get her second Moderna vaccine on 3/05/2021 and informed staff at that time of reaction post first vaccine. Client stated she had informed her PCP. Who felt it was alright for her to get her second shot.  Client was informed at the time of her second shot, that she would  not be receiving it that day.  The clinic that day was as a POD site. Client was informed that the health department would get in touch with her at a later time to determine if she was eligible to get second dose.  Client verbalized understanding. It was determined that due to client having an immediate reaction after the first vaccine, that she would not be eligible to receive the second vaccine at the health department. Client was called to inform her of this the following week and the client did not answer the phone.

Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

I self recovered after about 5-10 min. About 20-30 minutes after that my legs started feeling tingling like they were going numb and I was experiencing hot flashes. This self recovered after 5 min. I was admitted to the ER and monitored for another hour but was stable.

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

Within the next hour, my jaw began to lock and my throat began to burn/tighten. Within this timespan, my body, especially my back began to ache as well as my chest feeling tight.  After three hours, I went to the on-campus clinic and they gave me 50mg of Benadryl.

This lasted a few hours.  1/15/21- 3:45am I got up to use bathroom and noticed I was very lightheaded. I thought maybe I just stood up too fast. I got back in bed and my arm was 8/10 pain so I also thought faintness could possibly due to pain.  7:15am I got up to go to work and quickly felt very warm and my vision started to go black. I laid back down for a few minutes until this resolved. I took my temperature and it was 99.0. I got up again and started to get ready but began feeling light headed again. I ended up getting ready while sitting down because I kept feeling too much like I was going to pass out. I ate breakfast and felt fine. 8:00am I left for work and after driving for about 5 minutes I felt myself getting very warm again and light-headed. I ended up pulling over and calling for someone to come pick me up.  9:00am My temperature was 99.5. My blood pressure laying down was 110/74 and HR was 74. After standing for 5 minutes my BP was 90/70 and my HR was 92. During this 5 minutes of standing I felt myself getting warm again but my vision did not start to go black and I was able to stand for the full 5 minutes.  At various times throughout the day I would feel faint if I was standing or sitting upright for too long. The last time I felt this was was probably 11:30pm on 1/15/21. 1/16/21 - No light-headedness or warmth. Did feel some slight chest pressure, but nothing crazy and it only lasted maybe half of the day.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

                                                received her COVID Moderna 1st dose vaccine on 3/15/21 in the late afternoon. After she had her vaccine she sat down in a chair and waited out her 15 minutes. During this time she said her ears were ringing and she felt faint. We switched her chair to one with larger arms to sit. She asked for water, we provided her a bottle of water and she started to breathe heavily. Her mom was with her and also was vaccinated waiting for 15 minutes. During this time her breathing became labored and she was feeling very faint. I called 911 and EMS arrived about 10 minutes later to see how she was doing. At no point did Taylor pass out or lose consciousness. She was cleared by EMS who checked her blood pressure which was normal and she did not have labored breathing after their visit. During the EMS check they asked the last time she ate and that was at 11 am. She declined medical transport to the hospital and was able to walk out of the facility.

                                                Fast Heart rate after an hour and half of injection and shortness of breath . Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

Almost 1 hour post vaccine I started to feel a lump in my throat, as the minutes passed my throat started to feel tighter and fight and flight mode kicked in.  It was hard to swallow, my tongue was swelling and I called EMS at 2:40 pm 1/13/2021.  EMS noticed hives on my chest and left arm where I got the first dose of Moderna.  I received epinephrine IM and IV benadryl in the ambulance.  I was sinus tachycardic with heart rate in the 140s oxygen was 99% room air, lungs clear..  I was taken to ER where I was on observation for 2 hours. I was discharged around 5:10 pm on 1/13/2021.  On my car ride home around 5:40pm I again started to feel my throat tighten, tongue swell, and heart race.  I called EMS again, and was treated with IV benadryl, and epinephrine IM.  I was taken to Medical Center where I was given IV solu-medrol and got blood taken and a pregnancy test done.  My potassium was 3.1 and I took 2 potassium tablets to supplement.  My EKG was normal sinus tach, oxygen 100% room air, blood pressure 140s/90s and got down to 120/80s.  I was transported to another Medical Center for overnight observation because first Medical Center was full.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

She then went home, where she did a nebulizer treatment and reported that it was helpful and was in and out of a deep sleep. Following day she reports &#34;the worst headache,&#34; body aches and a low grade fever.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

Over the next few days, I became incredibly itchy and developed a rash on both of my arms. I now have what I think is considered, &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. There is a red circle around the injection site that is swollen, red, and tender. I then noticed the inside of my mouth was sore and I had blisters developing on the roof of my mouth near my gums. My throat is super sore and swollen and has a yellow pocket on the back of my throat. I am also having body aches under my arms near my ribs and back.

                                                Received her Moderna vaccine on March 12 at approximately 5pm.  Within moments her arm and face began to itch.  The nurse administered Benadryl.  The symptoms did not go away or worsen so she left when released.  Around 7 the symptoms had progressed to tongue feeling heavy, sore throat, and some difficulty breathing (although her O2 fluctuated between 96-99).  She went to the ER, they administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroids.  Within a couple hours the symptoms had subsided.  As directed, we continued Benadryl and Pepcid for 24 hours.  After being off the Benadryl and Pepcid for 12 -15 hours the symptoms returned, she took one dose of both and now seems to be fine.

                                                I got the injection at 2:50PM. At 5PM, I did an allergic reaction to it: it started tickling in my mouth, I felt my lips and tongue were swelling, my throat was swelling too and I couldn&#39;t swallow anymore and started having difficulty breathing. As I am allergic to peanuts and already did similar reactions, I took my medication: 2 pills 10mg antihistamine and 2 pills of 20mg cortisone. The reaction stopped after I took the pills but by tongue remained a bit swollen for around 2-3 hours.

Muscle stiffness - started an hour after vaccine and lasted about 48 hours, no pain medication or stretching helped, caused sleep issues due to not being able to get comfortable. Difficulty breathing - chest felt tight and felt like I wasn&#39;t getting enough oxygen in each breath so I had to pause to take deeper breaths.

This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

Patient was immediately treated with 0.3 mg of epinephrine and within approximately 60 seconds began having improvement in her symptoms.  EMS was called and patient was taken to the ER via EMS for ongoing observation.  Patient was feeling improved but not back to baseline prior to leaving the clinic.

                                                ?Within the first 15 minutes - injection site felt hot (right arm).   ?Within the first hour - right arm felt heavy with some numbness/tingling that lasted less than 10 minutes.   ?3 hours post vaccine - mild arm soreness with ROM, but not to the touch.   ?7 hours post vaccine - I felt very fatigued. I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                Friday, March 12th, 2021 at 11am I had a severe anaphylactic reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. My throat began to swell and became very short of breath. My chest was tight and felt as if it was being crushed. A nurse walked by me and noticed me grabbing my chest and immediately put me on a gurney. They took my mask off and discovered my lips were swelling and turned blue. My vitals were taken and was was given epinephrine in my left thigh. EMS was called and on board was given an IV Benadryl and steroids. Once at the hospital I was given Ativan, Pepsid and more Benadryl. I was discharged around 4pm and was back at the ED 3/13/21 early morning when I woke up with not being able to breathe, my throat swelling and crushing feeling in my chest. I was given more Benadryl and fluids, and was released 8am. 3/16/21 I came back to the ED as advised by a triage nurse on the phone, as I was having trouble breathing and the same crushing feeling in my chest.

She took a photo of this and showed it to me today and well. The swelling around the eyes seemed minimal. Her lips were swollen. She also notes that she felt tired and had a mild shortness of breath where she felt more comfortable sitting up. She states these symptoms have somewhat improved, though she has been experiencing increasing nausea since yesterday and continues to feel that way. She states that she does not believe she is pregnant, she has an IUD. She also noticed some body aches yesterday, continuing this morning, but they seem to be improving. They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

                                                I received my vaccine around 12:45pm. They had me go to waiting room and wait for 10 mins. I sat down and was waiting for a few minutes when I started to get dizzy. I looked up and told the lady checking people in ?hey I?m getting really dizzy can I lay down? she said yes come in the room. When I stood up my heart started beating really fast. I sat on the table and my chest started feeling tight and heavy. There were 2 ladies in the room at this point so I asked one of them if they had an epipen on hand just in case. My throat wasn?t swelling but it was getting harder to breath from the tightness in my chest. She said they didn?t have an epipen and would have to call emergency services if I needed one. I told her I didn?t know what was going on, that I didn?t need one yet but she should probably call emergency services if they can?t do anything to help me. (ER is right across the street) my symptoms went away shortly after they called. But came on a couple more times but much milder over the next 30 minutes or so. The EMT gave me Benadryl and the ER ran some tests.

                                                Several minutes after the vaccine she became light headed, EMT evaluated her and stated she was tachycardic (did not give a pulse) and was initially unable to find a BP.  She appeared pale and was crying and hyperventilating.  She stated she had a funny feeling in her throat and numbness in her fingers.  We prepared to administer an epi-pen but she was increasingly anxious so we had to place her in a supine position first.  Immediately she started to feel better, her color was normal and her blood pressure was 110/70 with a pulse of 67.  Her throat no longer felt ?funny.?  We continued to monitor her and did NOT administer epinephrine.  An ambulance arrived and she was ambulatory and feeling normal so declined transport. Follow-up with patient 1/18/21, she states she is feeling good. She said she and her mother both have a history of passing out with any procedure involving needles and she does not feel her symptoms were caused by the vaccine itself. She plans to receive her scheduled 2nd dose from us.

She was placed in a recumbent position on the exam twith legs elevated and vital signs were obtained, they were within normal limits. Pt then reported that it felt like she had something in the right side of her throat - she declined epinephrine injection. RN and LVN stayed at bedside. Pt then stated that both sides of her throat felt blocked and gave consent for epinephrine injection. RN administered 0.3 mg epinephrine and activated EMS. Vitals signs, breathing and circulation monitored closely until EMS arrival. Pt was transported by ambulance to the hospital emergency department for evaluation.

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

BS was checked and was low so I was given crackers and a sprite. I was severly nauseaed and HR elevated to 150 with SOB associated and was like that off and on for about 30 minutes which prompted EMS to be called to come check me out and was transported to the ED.  I was given fluids and my lab work showed I was deydrated. UA neg, Triponin-neg, EKG-tackycardia and they symptoms deminished on its on after about 4-5 hours and I was released from the ED.

                                                I received the vaccine around 2:30/3 PM. The same night I began feeling as if my throat was itchy around 11 PM. I took a Zyrtec because I thought my friends dog was giving me a little allergies. 20 minutes later my throat itch got progressively worse to where I started to feel a little wheezy and harder to breathe. My arm where the vaccine was felt itchy. I had a rash all on my left arm and upper chest where I had received the vaccine. Immediately, I took a benadryl then went to sleep. Around 3 AM I woke up uncontrollably shivering. My fiance was able to get me a heater because I was so chilled with shivers but was sweating profusely. These shivers lasted about an hour to where I finally just went to sleep. I woke up around 7 AM with a pounding headache so I finally decided to take my temperature. It was 102 F. I ran a fever all day and brought it down to 100 with ibuprofen.  I ran a slight fever the next day as well with extreme fatigue.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was able to taste the vaccine,. Within 5 minutes I felt dizzy and within 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t feel my arm.  I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

                                                I was hurting a lot. 8 out of 10 - the pain. My arm was so but my chest was in pain. I couldn&#39;t breathe. I was so light headed I thought I would pass out if I stood up. I went to ER - Dr thought it was  from my wearing personal protection equipment - mask and goggles for work after receiving the vaccine. He told me I was fine but I was so much in  pain that I was too out of it to ask for tests. I was in pain for two week. Chest was in pain.  I had to use my inhaler once a day at least - sometimes more.

Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

At around 6pm of the same day, I had slight heart palpitations. At 9pm (same day) while sitting in bed, I developed tachycardia (Heart Rate 170) and shortness of breath. I laid down and also breathed in a brown paper bag, got my heart rate down to 150. Then, my parents took me to the Emergency Department. Today is 3/12/21 (8 days after receiving vaccine), but my tachycardia, palpitations, and shortness of breath has continued. Heart rate continues to be anywhere from 85-135 bpm while I am at rest. Palpitations have also continued and are worse at night. Shortness of breath has also continued, but is not as bad as before.

It felt like my heart is overworking itself even though I am just sitting still on the computer. Other side effects were headache, nausea, and chills. Noticed my heart rate was fast during the 15 minute observatory period at the facility but assumed it was from the adrenaline &#43; fear of needles. By the twelve hour mark, heart &#43; chest no longer hurt and most side effects were gone.

                                                Pt received 2nd COVID vaccination at 1024. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have dropped her water bottle and become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, she was noted to have moderate pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. Her head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. Pt noted to have some muscular rigidity and not verbally responsive. Another provider advised to call 911 due to unresponsiveness and seizure-like activity. 911 called @1027, meanwhile pt lifted and placed into a wheelchair and moved to treatment area where vitals were obtained, patient became verbally responsive @1034, responses/speech was clear but slow, pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Oxygen applied via facemask @4L. Pt provided staff with phone number to call her mother who was notified of daughter&#39;s condition @1032. FD Engine arrival @1033 report given and pt also became more responsive, eyes opened and stated clearly that she was feeling better. Pt color also improved. Pt denied any allergies, PMH or hx of seizure activity. Pt only reported a syncope many years ago. Ambulance arrival @1036, report provided to emergency staff and pt taken to ambulance for further evaluation @1039. Pt returned to vaccine clinic @1052, having declined ambulance transport. When asked about events, pt stated that upon sitting down she felt a sudden onset of moderate nausea and reached for her water bottle in her bookbag, pt states she could not recall or hear anything until she was moved to wheelchair, and did not recall how she came to be in the observation area (based on this information, suspected time unconscious was approx 6-12 seconds). Pt was educated regarding the many causes of syncope and the neccesity for further evaluation in the Emergency department. Pt discouraged from driving herself from the clinic and was able to obtain ride from her roommate. Pt urged again to obtain a ride to the hospital for further evaluation, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.
