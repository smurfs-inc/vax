                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at her place of employment as a phase 1A essential frontline healthcare worker in a skilled nursing LTC facility on January 6 2021. The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

                                                1-8-2021:  9:25 body shaking, nostrils constricting, throat tightening and legs weak.  Happen while I was heading home.  Returned to HD.  EMT administered 50ml benedryl and pushed 125ml saline.  No response.  Throat felt tight, not closed but tight.  Offered EpiPen .3 agreed.  Body reaction - shaking.  Went to Hospital ER via ambulance (~11am).  ER administered 50mg steroid and had 2 puffs of albuterol inhaler twice.  Became very tired but felt heart raced - assumed reaction to steroid/albuterol.  2:30pm started to finally feel relief.  Discharged 4pm with rx for prednisone 50mg 1/day-10 days and benedryl 25mg for that night and am/pm next day.  O2 dropped to 94 that evening.  Administered 3 rounds of 2 liters/minute before saturation held at 97. 1-9-2021:  9am took benedryl and prednisone doses.  10am both nostrils still feel &#34;swollen,&#34; legs are weak and very tired (benedryl?).  Oxygen saturation is good - 97.  Starting to feel slight sensitivity at injection site.  4pm able to shower and move around.  Breathing is better.  Elected not to take benedryl as I&#39;m not getting an positive response from it, only fatigue.  Nostrils still feel swollen - tried lubricated nasal spray, not much help. 1-10-2021:  8:30 prednisone dose  Oxygen saturation good - 98% pulse 72.  Nostrils still feel swollen.  Injected site sore,  Started around 4pm (similar to shingles vaccine - expected).

She was assisted by EMS (who was on site).  Her blood pressure was 249/149 per the patient.  She also experienced some lightheadedness.  It was strongly suggested by EMS &amp; nursing staff that she be transported to the ER but she refused stating she had to work the next day.  She continued to be monitored by EMS until her blood pressure stabilized &amp; she felt better.  She continued to refuse ER.  She was driven home by her companion.   On 1/28/2021 she sent an email to the health department showing a picture of her left arm showing redness from the injection site down to above the bend in her left arm.  She reported that on 1/26/2021 her physician  recommended that she not receive the second dose of Moderna.  She continues to complain of high blood pressure.  It is unkown if she takes medication for high blood pressure.

                                                About 3 PM she received her second vaccination for Covid.  She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

Later in the day, left upper arm sore, itchy as expected and started breathing faster, tired, laid down in bed about 8pm. About 1030pm, that Friday night 02/05/21 woke up stretching alot, was weak, had major aches, lots of stretching, fever 102.5, headache, shivering, very thirsty, was delirious for a couple hours, no appetite. I took tylenol a couple times during the reaction, started to break the fever early Sunday morning 02/06/21 about 1am. My clothes, sheets and blankets, even my pillow was soaked where my head and neck laid. I was so startled, I thought I peed on myself in bed at first, got up and changed clothes. Then just just laid a big towel on the mattress and got another blanket fell asleep again. About 2 hours later, I woke up shivering, was soaked again. I changed clothes once again and laid on the couch, had a terrible headache but fever went down. Headache was worse than earlier. Suddenly woke up and felt fine breathed better in months even, no fever. Got up, tried to work in the yard the last couple days but was too weak, just laid around, finally ate, found I had a mild fever of 99.9. It&#39;s normally like a 96.4. But Tuesday the 02/09 but went back to work 02/09/21 still had mild fever. I feel tons better today 02/10/21. No fever this am 97.1

                                                Approx 1 hour after receiving vaccine, I began to have stomach or abdominal pain, followed by nausea (did not vomit), light-headedness, headache, very noticeable sweats, &amp; overall discomfort. The symptoms were bad enough I went to lie down, but the discomfort was bad enough that it was difficult to find a position to lie down in. I had some shortness of breath but I believe that was caused by discomfort (&amp; possibly also worry). I did not experience difficulty getting breath in or out. I had pain in my neck &amp; stiffness (&amp; mild numbness) in my arms. My son (11 years old) said I felt hot but I did not feel hot myself. No fever found with thermometer. About 1 &amp; 1/4 hours later the symptoms went away leaving me fatigued &amp; light-headed, &amp; a little uncomfortable but nothing I would remark upon. The following day I was fatigued, &amp; got light-headed as I got more tired. This continued but also lessened the two days thereafter.

Second dose woke up at 11:00 pm with fever chills, blinding headache, nausea, sever coughing, SOB and chest tightness. Called caregiver hotline the next day and they sent me to the Care where it was found my BP to be 225/120 and pulse 100. They sent me to the emergency department at Hospital where I was treated for hypertensive urgency and immunization reaction. Still suffering from elevated BP and pulse beyond what was normal prior to vaccine. Still experiencing fatigue and weakness that was not present prior to vaccine.

                                                A few minutes after vaccine administered, shortness of breath and weakness started. Because of my ALS, I have spasms at night. I also had involuntary contractions (spasms) in arms (forearms moved repeatedly and violently). These never happen during the day like this but can at night. Between contractions and early in the event,DR took vitals. Blood pressure 160/96 (usually 100/60) and heart rate 102 (usually 60?s). I felt odd before the contractions started that I attribute to the elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Entire episode lasted 30 minutes (estimate).

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

She has had a previous reaction to flu so the nurses were already checking on her periodically. She was given some water, something cool to put on the injection site, and then asked to wait a little longer to see if she felt better. After about 20 minutes she was feeling well enough that everyone felt comfortable letting her go. We saw her later that day and she was completely fine.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

                                                On Saturday February 6 2021, I experienced some some mild shortness of breath and a cough for approximately 3 hours after receiving Moderna vaccine Thursday February 4. Cough, SOB completely resolved after approximately 3 hours. Looking over vaccination information, this is not an expected side effect.

She said that she felt that if she had to stand up that she would fall over. patient has felt this prior when she over took her seizure medication or when she takes her medication early in the morning. We gave the patient orange juice and water. We checked her blood pressure, oxygen, and heart rate. Patient then stated her throat felt like it was getting tight. We then gave the patient 25 mg of chewable benadryl. Patient did not have difficulty breathing. Patient was monitored for over an hour after vaccine administration

Days 2, 3, 4  muscle fatigue  and sensation of unusually elevated heart rate during stenuous exercise significant enough for me to take ?breathing breaks? to allow my heart to slow - like enforced interval training.  Days 5, 6, 7, 8 no noticeable side effects.  Day 9 slightly stiff sensation and itching at injection site, no rash,  no swelling. Day 10 (today) itching at injection site significant enough for me to stretch in my sleep.  Injection site visably swollen, warmer to the touch than surrounding area,  no rash.

Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

                                                On Friday, March 12th, 2021 approximately 10:35 am, 60-year-old female received her first dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot Number: 003A21A) in her left deltoid at the facility.  Patient received the Moderna Vaccine. After which she sat in the designated medical observation area for her allotted 15 minutes. Approximately nine minutes post-injection around 10:44 am, she felt a bit ?wobbly? when standing up. A medical assistant called Emergency Medical Services (EMS) immediately and the Physicians Assistant went over to assess patient&#39;s symptoms.   During the wait time for EMS?s arrival, the physicians assistant performed an assessment. Patient states to have experienced lightheaded-ness, mouth/tongue tingling, shortness of breath and palpitations. She denied throat constriction, denied itching, redness or pain at the site of injection. She said the tingling she did experience resolved around 20 mins post-injection.   During the assessment, the physicians assistant noted clear breath sounds, irregular health rhythm, increased heart rate, extra-ocular movements intact with no nystagmus, no redness or swelling on the injection site and good grip strength.   Upon EMS arrival at approximately 10:48 pm, the firefighters triaged as per their assessment. She expressed that she is taking ?Lexapro? and allergic to sulfa-drugs. She claims to be ?borderline diabetic? and that the lightheaded-ness has ?never happened before?  The EMS took her to a separate room in the building and assessed her further. After approximately 20 minutes she left and did not leave in an ambulance against medical advice.  She left with her husband and went home. She was made aware that she should go to the hospital immediately if she felt her health was compromised.

Throat started to swell up, and dry, very nauseous, shaking while no fever, eliminated all stools, and my heart staryed to beat fast mixed up with irregularity. It settled a bit after 1 hour after i did Therapy, a tapping method to support the immune system and help with adverse reactions. Stayed nauseous for days, and as of today 3/14/2021 i still don&#39;t feel like myself yet. Still tired, weak, a bit shaky, just off.

                                                Got her vaccine with no problem, got her vaccine and felt dazed as she was going to the waiting area.  She was anxious and then started feeling heaviness in her chest.  She felt dazed, nothing registered and was not focused on anything, and sat for 25 minutes.    She then got up and walked to the car, felt like she was in the clouds and her right lung was really, really bothering her by the time she got home and tired.   Her heart rate was 140 and very fast.  She didn&#39;t feel as if she was anxious but just blaise.   She was really winded and exhausted by the time she got home.  She had not eaten before she got the vaccine, made herself a sandwich and fell asleep and slept for about 3 hours.  When she woke up she had a very, very sore arm.  Then on Saturday, she woke up around 3:00 AM, and could not go back to sleep as she was wide awake.  Then every task that she did just exhausted her and still felt heaviness in her chest and back and the right lung was really bothering her like she had worked like an animal for a period of time.  She has a small apartment and it doesn&#39;t take any energy to walk to the kitchen.  Saturday she felt fine, was cleaning and felt good.  Sunday she slept all day and her right lung was still hurting her.  Yesterday was still exhausted and winded feeling.  Today, 3/16/21 she is still feeling the same way and exhausted doing simple tasks.  She has a nodule in her right lung and several spots in her left lung but nothing is being done for them.  The vaccine seems to have exacerbated the symptoms and made them worse.  The injection site is a little sore but nothing out of the ordinary for a vaccine.  She took two Advil for her symptoms which did help as she had pain in her head with this which will last for 5-10 minutes and then goes away.  She has notified her doctor and she has an appointment on Friday at 11:00 AM.

                                                I was feeling very flush and couldn&#39;t get cooled down when all of a sudden I got very light headed, couldn&#39;t breath very good. Then the pounding in my chest started with pressure in my neck and head. After an hour I ended up in the ER with SVT. My heart was beating close to 200 beats a minute. My heart slowed down on its own to 114 beats a minute.

                                                Pt was doing fine after receiving the vaccine.  That following day, she reported having flu-like symptoms.  She had covid-19 about 9 months prior and knew that she may have more severe symptoms.  Later that day, she reported having shortness of breath and could not talk without taking breaks in-between.  She also had a difficult time walking.  Pt was seen and treated in the emergency department.  I feel this was more patient issues since she has had a history rather than direct effect of the vaccine.

                                                Not being able to breathe; Could not smell; Positive covid test; A spontaneous report  was received from a consumer concerning a 60 years old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and could not smell, positive COVID test, and not being able to breathe.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported by the reporter. Concomitant medications taken by the patient included blood thinner.  On 4 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received first of their two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 002a21a) through intramuscular route at unspecified site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 6 Mar 2021, the patient was tested positive for COVID and could not smell. On 9 Mar 2021, the patient was hospitalized because of her not being able to breathe. On 15 Mar 2021, patient was released from the hospital.   Treatment activities for event was done with regeneron, dexamethasone, remdesivir.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of event could not smell, positive COVID test, not being able to breathe was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: COVID-19 In this patient is unlikely to be due to Moderna&#39;s mRNA-1273 vaccine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                She got her vaccine and within 15 minutes she was having a hard time breathing.  She told her husband that she needed to go to the bathroom and see if she could get the feeling to stop.  She went into the bathroom and she was gasping and choking for breathe.  They got her into the ambulance and her BP was extremely high 128/90 and her BP normally is 98/60.  They started an IV, breathing treatments and oxygen.  She was gagging up saliva and having a hard time breathing.  They got her to where she was calm.  Her body when it is under extreme amounts of stress goes into seizures, which it did.  She then was transferred to  in  for observation.  By the time she arrived her BP had come down and was starting to stabilize.  She was given steroids, discharged home.  She has had problems breathing, extreme/sharp pain on the left side of her head  behind the eye, which has been going on for over a week.  By the end of the day she is exhausted.  She has never had a hard time breathing at high altitudes and  now she can walk up the stairs and be winded.  This has all happened since receiving the vaccine.   She sent a message to her doctor who did seem concerned.   The pharmacist at the facility at the time said that she was fine, to leave her alone.  The EMT&#39;s said that there was something wrong with her and took her to the hospital.  The hospital did not give her any long-term medications to take.  She does have a routine APT with her PCP on 4/6/21.   On Thursday she woke up and asked her husband if her face was swollen, and he asked why, she stated that her face was numb, and some spots so sensitive that she could not brush her hair.  This was on the left side.  The sensitivity is still there, but not as intense.

Tuesday:  Arm looks fine, can&#39;t tell if any swelling, but I have headaches, shortness of breath, dizziness while driving.  No fever. Wednesday: Felt worse than Tuesday, hard to get out of bed.  More dizziness and headaches.  Hard to concentrate on work.  No fever. Thursday: Felt better than Wednesday but still wobbly.   Occasional headache.  Runny nose.  Some nausea.   Emailed my doctor to ask if I should get a covid test.  She said to wait a day or two as my symptoms were probably just a bad reaction. Friday:  feel better today but still thought I should document this when I saw there was a place to do so.

I went to lay down and was not able to.  It was hard to breath.  I got up, went to another room where there was a recliner and sat in it trying to catch my breath.  It got harder to breathe.  I had my husband call 911. I went to the ER, had a CT scan of my chest and was found to have ?extensive PE?s?, ground glass and signs of pneumonitis.   I was admitted to the CICU for two days and was transferred for two days.  I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that there was a high unlikelihood of PE?s developing from my ankle fracture 3 months later.  I had home health care for approximately one month.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine I started having difficulty breathing and it went into an asthma attack. I used my rescue inhaler which I keep on hand due to allergies. I used it 3 times that afternoon and evening. I felt nauseated but did not vomit. I had watery diarrhea twice. Nausea continued for 24 hours with loss of appetite. That has now abated. The injection site did not hurt until the next day when it started with tenderness then quickly turned red and painful and hot to the touch. Wednesday and Thursday the arm started getting a rash and it has spread up to the neck and face.  Headache started the night of the injection and became intense (near migraine level) and stayed painful for 24&#43; hours. Fatigue began the night of the injection and has gradually gotten better over Wednesday and Thursday. Treated with Tylenol, rescue inhaler, Benadryl and hydrocortisone creams, rest, drinking lots of water, and notified my family doctor. Although I still have a rash and the injection site is hot and sore, I am considering myself recovered from the side effects.

Unk and unk) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Latex allergy. Concurrent medical conditions included Environmental allergy (dust mites).   On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In February 2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction/she had symptoms of lightheadedness and sensation of throat closure) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (lightheadedness) and THROAT TIGHTNESS (throat closure). At the time of the report, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction/she had symptoms of lightheadedness and sensation of throat closure), DIZZINESS (lightheadedness) and THROAT TIGHTNESS (throat closure) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In February 2021, Tryptase: elevated (High) Elevation persisted 3 weeks.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Before her 2nd dose, she pre-treated with Motrin and Claritin.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. Treatment for the event anaphylactic reaction included EpiPen and intravenous Benadryl.

She was diagnosed with hearing loss of 60 percent in left ear for word recognition. Her speech reception threshold in left ear was AIR 30 decibels (dB), pure tone average left Air 28 decibels Hearing Level (dB HL), bone 25 dB HL. Her right ear was normal at Air 17 dB HL. She saw a specialist the same day and was examined. He gave her 60 mg/day of prednisone for 7 days. She went back a week later, and her results were word recognition at 100%, but she still has clicking and white noise in the ear. Speech recognition air 20dB pure tone average air was 18 dB HL, bone 17 dB HL. Tympanogram diagnostics done on 17/Mar/2021 showed ear canal volume left 1.25, right 2.27. A week later it was 1.66 in left, right was 1.43.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not Applicable.

                                                After the first dose of the vaccine I was very tired. After the second dose I was extremely tired. I started to have trouble breathing at night and I developed a cough one week after the second dose. After two weeks I went to an Urgent Care and they did not find anything on X-Ray. Two weeks later I was not improving so I went back because my breathing was worse. X-Ray showed Pneumonia in both lower lungs. I recovered a little over two weeks after antibiotics. I had Covid-19 in July of 2020 and I had not felt well since then. I was only working two days a week up until the time of the first dose of the vaccine. I was originally given a Benzoate capsules but those did not help. My breathing seems to better than it was for the time period since I got the Covid-19 last year. I still have a dry cough and I get short of breath on occasion. I use Flonase currently and I am able to work more now.

All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

It was difficult to take deep breath?s. It felt like I had pulled a muscle there. Moving positions from sitting to standing or raising my right arm to scratch or reach for something caused the muscle pain to occur. After taking ibuprofen, water and rest the pain subsided a lot, but still continues. There was no increase in my temperature.

                                                On 1/29/2021 at 10:10 am about 40 minute period of breathlessness/shortness of breath as if asthma attack were coming on. Have not had asthma in 15 years. Later, around 12 noon large red, hot, painful swollen rash came up around 3 inches injection site.  Called primary Dr, and allergist, who said to take antihistamine and pain reliever. Took Claritin and Tylenol. 1/30/2021 awoke and rash was more red,  painful, and swollen, and had spread to 6 inches in diameter. Returned to Vaccination Center, saw Dr on duty who looked at rash and recommended I call my primary for an antibiotic for a skin infection. My primary, prescribed Clindamycin began prescription on 1/31/2021. Night of 1/31/2021 awoke to pain on inner side of left arm, and intense itching in left underarm left chest, and left breast. Took Benadryl. I am still taking clindamycin for 10 days. Redness, swelling, pain reduce each day.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the Moderna vaccine, I experienced an odd sensation in my stomach increased breathing, HR, lightheadedness, and dizziness. (I  experienced a similar reaction years ago but more severe, after having a breast MRI   with Gadolinium . I will consult my primary physician by email today. Per consult with a family physician, the recommendation has been advised for possible prophylactic treatment prior to obtaining the second Moderna vaccine. On rereading the composition of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, I noted that polyethylene glycol(PEG) is a component in both the Pzifer and Moderna vaccines. I also discovered that PEG is also used with Gadolinium particles in contrast dye. Gadolinium-containing copolymeric chelates. A new potential MR contrast agent. Solvothermal synthesis and functionalization of polyethylene glycol.  It leads me to consider whether contrast dye should now be listed as one of the allergens on the vaccination registration forms, in order for persons with this allergy to report this information to their primary physicians prior to obtaining this vaccine.

New symptoms developed as I am now feeling like I have tightness in my lungs when I breathe with mild difficulty. (kind of like when I have a chest cold). Also my throat feels funny like my trachea hurts.I have been reporting daily with the CDC app as suggested and have reported these symptoms as well.&#34;

Than came body aches, especially my arthritic hand and ankle. Weakness, fatigue, SOB just walking to the bathroom. My temperature during the chills was 99.2, and after the chills subsided, about 3 hours, my temperature went up to 100.6 but never got higher than that.

                                                on 2/16/21 PM home health nurse administered 1st COVID vaccine Moderna dose to the patient - patient had no immediate reaction in the first 30 minutes after the vaccination.  on 2/17/21 AM visit (about 8:50am) - same nurse - patient was found confused, unable to speak in full sentences, repeating herself , &#34;really off&#34;. Patient had tremors throughout her body, had abnormal vital signs - temp 98.8, HR 112, RR 24 and labored breathing, BP 88/42, O2 saturation variating constantly between 88-96% on 4 liters O2. Patient initially refused to have 911 called. Nurse has called patient&#39;s PCP and PCP spoke with patient who then agreed to call 911 to go to a hospital. 911 was called, report given to paramedics, the patient taken to local ER.  Per patient and family - some tests were done in ER (?including CT of head from patient&#39;s description). Patient&#39;s cognitive status and vital signs have improved and patient was sent home. Per ER, they think this was a reaction to the COVID vaccine.  Today 2/18/21 AM visit, same nurse - patient&#39;s cognition is at baseline. Patient seems very tired but vital signs are better.

Then on Thursday, every joint in her body hurt and this continued until Saturday.  On Saturday she had a big red whelt on the arm that progressively got larger.  She still has some aches in her joints, but not as severe.  The rash is deep red today, swollen with hard ridges, very itchy and very hot to touch.  She has not taken anything for it.  She has been having a harder time than usual breathing, but not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.  She has less than 20% of her lungs.

The allergic symptoms have not come back as of this reporting.

Honked  horn physician came over, performed simple neurologic test and advised allergic reaction.  Had me roll down windows and sip water and to wait another 10-15 minutes. After 5 minutes throat and nose felt like they were closing. Paramedics came over and checked BP, which was elevated, and blood sugar which was very low. They continued to monitor me until symptoms started subsiding.  Asked if I wanted to go to ER, declined.  They recommended me to take 50 mg of Benadryl and to go to ER or call 911 if symptoms persisted or worsened.  Took Benadryl within 15 minutes of leaving and about 10 minutes afterwards all symptoms were gone.

                                                After 45 minutes of receiving vaccination , the knuckles in my left hand, the arm I received the shot in, began to hurt very badly.  Before I was able to get home,  7 minutes away, both hands hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t hole the steering wheel and I was having cramps in my legs.  I could hardly walk up the steps to my house because my ankle joints hurt so badly.  I went to bed  right away and slept .  My hands hurt really badly, but I knew the vaccination caused an inflammatory response so I figured just  rest.  By the end of the day Tuesday, I couldn&#39;t type and could not hold the steering wheel to drive home.  I felt out of breath, I hurt all over, my muscles ached and were cramping.  I was nauseated, very emotional.  I had a fever that spiked at over 101 degrees.  I was so chilled that I was shaking violently. I hurt in every joint, my lymph nodes were painfully swollen, my heart was racing, normal pulse for me is 68 to 72, it was 88 to 90.  Halfway up our stairs, I just stopped, couldn&#39;t make my legs work.  Day 3 I called my doctor, had a virtual appointment I knew I couldn&#39;t drive or ride 45 minutes away.  I missed 3 days of work, stayed home all weekend and was better by Monday.  It was 3 weeks before my hands quit aching.  The pain came and went in my ankles, wrist, knuckles, hips and knees.    Food still nauseates me.

                                                The patient received her second Moderna inoculation January 20, 2021 at 8 a.m.  At around 7:30 p.m., she had a sudden onset of myalgias and chills.  Within 30 minutes, she had a fever at 99.9° F.  She went to bed without taking acetaminophen or NSAIDs based on new CDC recommendations of how to treat symptoms due to the COVID-19 vaccine.  The patient hydrated and went to bed around 9 p.m.  By 11 p.m., the patient?s fever was 100.4° F., accompanied by intense myalgias, chills and a migraine headache.  She woke again at 1 a.m. with a fever of 101° F.  At 2 a.m., she woke with right-sided pleuritic chest pain (severe pain with inspiration, some pain with expiration and no pain with holding of the breath), with her fever persisting at 101° F. And tachycardia to 109.   By 7:30 a.m., her fever dropped to 100.4° F. But still tachycardia at 101.   At this time, she took ubrogepant 50 mg, with resolution of her headache within about 30 minutes.  Because she had rhinorrhea at this time, she decided to get tested for COVID-19 that day.

The symptoms kept getting worse so I went to urgent care and received an inhaler. I&#39;m one week out and all but the SOB have resoled. The SOB seems to be improving but I feel like I&#39;m still somewhat in a fog. I had lesions in my mouth for 5 days.  I developed left sided enlarged lymph nodes, TMJ and ear pain for 2 days with discomfort in the left breast and axillary. This has resolved.  I had a follow up appt today (3/3/21) and was prescribed an Epi-Pen.

I had confusion, reporting? Epipen?  Tell anyone.  I was not aware of my surroundings otherwise during the episode. Afterwards, I was breathing ok? and went home.  I later called Moderna, and reported this issue. I called the pharmacist, and reported the problem. I called many other pharmacies, asking for advise - ranging from NO do not take the 2nd vaccine (matter of life/death) due to serious reaction to take it &amp; wait longer.

                                                I started to feel unwell soon after receiving the vaccination.  I was tired and had a sore arm the first day.  By the second day, I began having heart arrhythmia and shortness of breath, which was confirmed at my physician&#39;s office by EKG.  I was referred to a cardiologist. Today (day three), I am still feeling less energetic and have a higher than usual amount of skipped beats. I get short of breath easily.  This afternoon I have a bad headache. My cardiologist has ordered heart ultrasound and monitoring out of an abundance of caution.  He says it could be that the inflammation from the vaccine might be causing heart irritation.

                                                An immediate funny taste in my mouth but so I left after sitting for 20 minutes. About 5 min later, my voice started to get hoarse like it does when I&#39;m having an allergic reaction, began coughing and trying to clear throat.  I pulled over and used my inhaler as first line of defense before trying epi pen.  The inhaler got me home, I continued to have the build up in my lungs and breathing issues, wheezing.  I continued to use my inhaler and gave myself a neb treatment.  My arm got hot and it was swollen with bumps and very itchy.  I treated with cool compress, cream and took Benadryl.  I took Benadryl and Loratadine the remainder of that day/evening and into Saturday evening.  Saturday evening, I used my inhaler 1 more time because I felt my lungs filling with phlegm (all clear) and was still coughing.  This last use made me throw up all the clear fluid that was gathering in my lungs and I felt much better and breathing went back to normal.  I used my inhaler once on Sunday and Monday and I haven&#39;t needed it since.  Funny thing, my right arm began to itch and got red and hot in the same area as my left but I got the injection in my left not my right arm.

My right ear made a strange pop sound and then my left ear began to ring.  The ringing was pretty loud at first and then settled into a steady low ringing.  I have had occurrences over the past couple of years of one ear ringing for a few seconds and then it going away, but never has the ringing kept going 24/7 as it has now.  My left ear (where the ringing is) feels full and my right ear drum hurts.  My head feels clogged, but I have no symptoms of a cold.

Then she started aching, joint pain, muscle pain, chills, fever.  Friday she started wheezing, and sat in the bed sleeping sitting up.  The highest the fever went was 102.  She took Tylenol, Benadryl sinus congestion, Tylenol cold/flu.  Also had coughing with a lot of mucous thinking she was having a cold.  Fatigue as well.  She did have a flu shot in October, and then diagnosed with the COVID virus on 10/14/20, tested negative on 10/30/20, she got the COVID rash in November that did not go away.  She had similar symptoms to when she had the virus.  Believes she may have had the virus in December 2019 as well as she was in the bed for 22 days.   She feels that she is now completely recovered from the vaccine.

I took Benadryl for 2 days and it was gone in 2 to 3 days.  Then, exactly 2 weeks following the vaccine, I experienced a severe asthma attack at 4:00 am in the morning.  This was extremely unusual, and has not occurred since childhood. My usual meds, ProAir RespiClick &amp; Adair did not appear to work as they normally do and gave me little relief. I saw my doctor the next day and he prescribed ZPAC &amp; Prednisone which improved my breathing within a couple days.

When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

Worsened, so went to lie down, whole-body chills every few minutes; sharp, sudden, intense stabbing pains in head, as if a sharp large knife was jammed into my head, at left temple, and behind my right lower ear - super intense pain, repeatedly. Occasional shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. All Sunday day and night. Since I couldn&#39;t even fall asleep due to the sharp, sudden stabs of pain, I tried a naproxen (Aleve).  By Monday, the sudden sharp stabs in Head had lessened, (less frequent, and not as painful), and a deeper, constant headache filled the whole left side of my head.  Whole left arm still very painful, and super sensitive to touch.  Deep, sometimes throbbing, constant headache on left side, arm pain, and occasional difficulty breathing continue this whole week. (Today, Saturday, is Day 8 from first vaccine shot.  ). Still.  Also note: I have no smell or taste, since Jan.1,2021.

                                                Two days after taking the 1st vaccination, I developed a cough. As the days have passed, the cough got worse and has leveled off to a lingering productive cough with a dull ache on the left side of my back. I have suffered from pneumonia several times in my life and this feels similar to the early stages, however, I have no other symptoms and have nor felt as though I had an elevated temperature.   I work as a technical support rep and have to talk on the phone eight hours a day and I have found it difficult over the last three days to talk for extended periods of time. I get mild shortness of breath and as the day progresses, the coughing gets worse and I am awakened several times during the night coughing.

                                                Almost immediately yesterday post inoculation, I experienced shooting pain in my left temple (initially not so severe that I couldn&#39;t drive, but the sharp pains still make me wince). It has migrated to include my right side today. Other effects: lower back pain, chills, fatigue, slight breath shortness, neck lymph nodes feel swollen and slightly sore, and my skin and eyes are much more sensitive than normal.   Hopefully tomorrow will be a brand new healthy day, and I can run in the morning.

The EMT on duty took my vitals with extremely high BP. he had another EMT confirm. They transferred me via ambulance to hospital ER for anaphalaxis. I was given benedryl on the way in  iv.  At the hospital, dr gave steroid and epinepherine in iv port. this helped me swallow and my vitals stabilized and i was released hours later with scrips for prednisone, pepsid and benedryl. Follow up with my primary care dr.

After about 5 minutes, she experienced a mild headache that then became sharp and severe. It quickly went away. She described no other symptoms. The pharmacist counseled the patient to watch and wait and that if her symptoms came back, did not improve, or worsen, that she should go to an urgent care. The patient left the pharmacy. A few hours later, the patient called the pharmacist and informed him that she went to the emergency room because she felt that her throat was closing. They administered a diphenhydramine drip and treated the patient&#39;s allergic reaction. The ER doctor stated to the patient that she had an allergy to come component of the Moderna and advised her not to receive the second dose. The patient was discharged.

                                                Within 5-7 minutes after injection, throat started to close up and heart started to race (elevated from upper 60?s to about 135-140 - checked on Apple Watch).  Having reaction Reported to pharmacist who offered ambulance and inquired if I was anxious (wasn?t until my throat started to close). It didn?t close further but stayed very scratchy and uncomfortable, HR remained elevated 90?s ish). Finally one hour after shot, I purchased and took a dose of Benadryl which helped; at 530 PM took another dose of Benadryl as throat became increasingly scratchy /uncomfortable which again helped. Woke at 230 am finally feeling that reaction had passed. Pharmacist encouraged returning for next shot despite reaction. I participated in V-safe and reported reaction same day as vaccine. Researched on own to try and figure out 2nd dose or no as did not feel pharmacy was equipped for anaphylaxis. Finally called and spoke with Moderna on 4/5/21 and they indicated this was definitely an acute allergic reaction and should be reported to VAERS and 2nd dose was contraindicated     Spoke with pharmacist on 4/6 (date scheduled for 2nd dose - my husband was getting his 2nd dose) and she did not discourage 2nd dose but I elected to follow up with my allergy testing as recommended by CDC which is now pending

                                                Patient was receiving second moderna covid vaccination when her tongue felt tingly and started to swell. She waiting 15 minutes and then brought the reaction up to the pharmacist. The pt was brought into the immunization room and monitored by. With no improvement 5ml of 12.5mg/5ml benadryl was given to the patient at 345pm. Patient bp and pulse was taken. Blood pressure was 154/94 which was typical for her and pulse was 69. Patient then started to complain of her throat feeling tight and having difficulty breathing. Pt had albuterol inhaler on her due to history of copd. She took two puffs of albuterol at 353pm. Patient had audible wheezing and was still having difficulty breathing. A 0.3mg epi pen was administered to her right thigh at 354pm. Code white was called and as we were calling 911 she adamantly refused medical attention and did not want the paramedics to come.  , a co manager came back to check on the pt and she was still refusing medical attention. Pt was continually monitored as her pcp was called. called the pt to urge her to go to the ER to be monitored but she again refused. At this time I had a pulse oximeter measuring her blood oxygen level which was at 96%. The patients symptoms were improving. The patient stated she did not have an epi pen at home so sent an epi pen script to the pharmacy which was filled and sold to the patient.  Pt was thoroughly counseled on the how to use the epi pen and was told by the dr and the pharmacist if she had to use the epi pen again she needed to head straight to the er. Patient was monitored from 3:20pm roughly the time of injection until around 4:50pm. Pt was contacted at 630pm to check up and she stated she was feeling much better and all symptoms had improved.

I spent 4 days in the PPC ward and now home trying to recover from this... I was told my condition was very serious and was lucky I came in... Of course the doctors will not say this was a direct link to the shot ... i never had any problems before and never any blood clots.  The doctor who did the procedure told me to make sure I REPORTED IT.... I was released from the hospital on the afternoon of the 21st.. 4 days!

                                                Had right chest and lower back pain and sweating during night of April 15, 2021. Also had unexplained cough for one month prior to vaccine. Pain was gone by morning. Did regular exercise of walking 4 miles in morning. Same pains came back afternoon of April 16. Went to ER at 4pm on 4/16. D-Dimer and Troponin were elevated and CT scan showed pulmonary embolism in right lung.  Was given Lovenox and was admitted to hospital for 2 days. Was released on Eliquis 2x per day for at least 3 months. Had two plane rides lasting for 2 hours each on 3/21 and 3/31 where I walked to bathroom once so it is unlikely these plane rides caused embolism. I am active and walk about 20 miles per week. Doctors so far have not found likely cause for this event.

                                                Sore arm beginning in the evening which got progressively worse for a couple of days then subsided completely.  Some heart fluttering and some slight shortness of breath beginning a couple of days after.  More a nuisance.  No other symptoms I&#39;m aware of although every little thing I feel now I think may or may not be a symptom like slight head throb but not consistent pain.  Not sure because of vaccine.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

I was monitored by EMS and given 50 mg IM Benadryl. After 30 - 40 min. symptoms cleared.

                                                My right arm was painful at the injection site for 3 days after the vaccination.  Then on Wednesday, February 3, 2021 about 3:45pm I experienced shortness of breath and some chest discomfort.  At approximately 6:00pm, I felt a strong pulsating at my left temple which continued through the night.  I took my blood pressure and it was 150/90 and pulse was 103 which is the highest reading I have ever had because I am on blood pressure medication.  I took 2 aspirin, my Proventil Inhaler, and another Losartan 50 mg even though I had already taken my daily dose in the morning.  I rested and continued to monitor my vitals.  At about 11:30pm, I took my blood pressure and it was 160/110 and pulse was 109.  I then took 2 more aspirin and my Clonazapem and fell asleep.  In the morning on February 4, 2021, I tried to get in to see my doctor, but she advised to go to the emergency room.  I went to an Urgent Care facility and the checked me and did an EKG and that was normal.  But they also advised me to go to the emergency room.  So I did go and they did another EKG, chest x-ray, and several blood tests.  They came back normal but they wanted me to stay overnight for observation.  On February 5, 2021 they did an echocardiogram and a stress test, which were normal.  I was released from the hospital that afternoon.  I have a follow up appointment with my Primary Care Physician on February 12, 2021.  My blood pressure and pulse continue to be a little higher than normal.  At this point, the pulsating, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort have improved.  On Saturday, February 6, 2021, I noticed felt itchiness, redness and swelling at the injection site on my right arm.  It is still itchy, red and swollen as of February 8, 2021.  I am putting hydrocortisone cream on it.

Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

The initial reaction occurred during monitoring after the vaccine, her heart was racing and she had a hard time catching her breath. After nourishment and the end of the monitoring she felt better and was able to drive home.   On 1/11/2021, 4 days later, she was sitting and started feeling hot inside. Her left chest and left arm became numb and tingly. She went to the ER within 30 minutes of onset. After the examination she was told the reaction was likely a side effect from the vaccine. The numbness and tingling remained most of the day and she felt better the next morning and has had no other episodes.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

At no time did I have difficulty breathing, chest tightness, wheezing or any other anaphylaxis symptoms other than the ones described.

                                                Within 45 minutes, I got dizzy, then 2 hours later I got a severe splitting Headache (migraine type without the aura) , fatigue, and nausea lasting 8-10 hours. Fatigue and Headaches continue daily in the afternoons and evenings.  Then 2 days later my lips started to swell, which progressed in intensity for 3 more days until my lips and tongue split, blistered, developed more asthma and difficulty breathing but not enough to use EpiPen or go to ER, and also my tongue felt thicker.  Called Immunologist on day 6 (Monday morning).  He ordered blood work.  The symptoms started to decrease on day 10 -16 but continue to have to use Symbicort 2x/day vs 1x/day and still get very fatigued as the day progresses and daily headaches.  My lips will swell easily with allergens and an increase in asthma.

After examining the patient, she stated that she had a history of MACs and was being treated for that at Clinic.

On 03/27/2021, her nausea continued and she complained of shortness of breath while walking. On 03/28/2021, she was short of breath before vomiting a small amount. She then became unresponsive. Death was pronounced a short time later.  Per her treating physician who signed the death certificate, the cause of death is felt to be probable myocardial infarction due to electrolyte abnormalities due to complications of her diabetes mellitus.

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine my arm was swollen up and started itching and I walked around the store 15 minutes. I told them that it was mildly itching after 30 minutes, they said it would go away. The itch progressively  got worse and started itching in different places, by Sunday it was really worse and the hives started breaking out on me. I went back to the pharmacy and they told me to take some Benadryl and the bumps went away but the itching didn&#39;t stop. On Monday I went to the doctor and he gave me a shot of steroids in right hip and after a while it stopped and I got a prescription for the itching. The pharmacist said they would not give me the next dose because of the reaction.  I am short of breath as well and will see the doctor on Friday for the SOB

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                At the time of first vaccination shot, I experienced an anaphylaxis reaction including constriction of throat, difficulty swallowing, inside of cheeks swelling, lips numb and inability to take a deep breath.  I waited at the vaccination site for 30 minutes.  No treatment was requested since I began to feel a little bit better after 30 minutes.  It took approximately 4-1/2 hours to 5 hours to completely be able to swallow without difficulty and feel that I could actually take a deep breath.  I contacted my Primary Care Physician and she advised that she is &#34;not comfortable with my receiving the second shot&#34; and told me to cancel my second shot.

                                                I received my second dose of the Modern vaccine about 3:15 pm on April 22. That night I went to bed experiencing the same symptoms as I had after my first dose of the vaccine: soreness in vaccine site, stiffness in my arm, headache, stiff neck, body aches and feeling lethargic.  At about 5:30 am, I was awaken with a strange, unexplainable heaviness in my muscles and chest, my breathing felt shallow and I had a strong urge for a bowel movement.  I got up, had a bowel movement (not diarrhea), began to sweat and shake, and then began to have the dry heaves, but did not expel any fluid, not even bile. At this point my husband said he heard strange sounds coming out of the bathroom and came to check on me.  He found me passed out and said I was making strange snoring sounds and thought I was having difficulty breathing.  The next thing I remember is him calling my name and struggling to gain consciousness.  At this point, I was very dizzy and nauseous and lay down on the floor.  My legs starting shaking sporadically and my breathing felt shallow.  When I felt stable enough, my husband helped me back to bed and I fell asleep immediately and slept for about an hour and half.  I was awakened by the same symptoms and proceeded to repeat the previous episode.  After I passed out for the second time, my husband insisted that I go to the emergency room.  In the emergency room, I underwent bloodwork, an EKG and they began administering IV fluids and 4 mg of Zoran.  All test results came back normal.   I was discharged and went home.  After being released, I did not have any further episodes.  The only symptoms I experienced after the episodes were a headache and backache, which were not relieved by Tylenol, lethargic and slept for the better part of the next two days.  I did not at any time during these episodes or after or prior to the vaccine experience a fever, sore throat, cough, vomiting or diarrhea. I am not at this time, nor have I for many years been on any medication.  In the past, I have been highly sensitive to medications and anesthesia and have experienced adverse reactions, even to some over-the-counter medications.

Had chemical taste in mouth within 30 minutes after shot; urine had chemical odor after shot. May 21, 2021 (Fri) injection site right arm more sore and could not turn my head to the right as my right neck (lymph nodes) were all swollen. Had chills, headache, fatigued and threw up after eating light breakfast. I iced and took Advil. PM/Bedtime-could not get deep breaths through nose breathing/had to mouth breath-hardly slept. May 22, 2021 (Sat) called emergency room and Pharmacist (primary Pharmacist still on vacation) was told to switch to HEAT pad on my neck, take Advil. Right arm injection site, up the arm, across collar bone, up the right neck to ear lobe all swollen and painful since Friday-hardly any change.  May 23, 2021 (Sun) so tired from not sleeping well (could not lay on right side since the shot) and slept mostly all day.  May 24, 2021 (Mon) feel a little better but neck is still swollen and sore. 50% motion back to turn my head to the right. Breathing better when laying down through my nose as well.  I would like to talk with a Doctor at the CDC as I do not have a Primary Doctor, and was just referred to one, but cannot schedule to see him until mid June. I am nervous if the 1st Moderna shot is causing internal swelling, bleeding, etc. ? And I am not planning on getting a 2nd Moderna shot after this severe reaction caused by the 1st shot.   I am healthy, never take drugs, get flu shots, etc. and my body felt like it was fighting a battle...and I am not 100% myself. I want to know WHEN my neck will heal, WHEN my motion will be back to 100%  as it is making driving challenging, and what next steps you recommend.  Please advise.

                                                She got her vaccine, it was more painful, she had fever, she spent 2 days just sleeping due to being tired.  She felt as if she was &#34;out of it&#34;.  She was not focused to work on the computer, to do school work and decided to not do that.  She is a multitasker and was hard for her to get on her treadmill as she was off balanced and could not do that.  She just had a brain fog, memory problems, was off doing her homework and reading things, but the clarity and focus was not there.  She knew the answers to her tests, but when she was writing down it was not being written down as the answers in her head and was scoring low on her tests.   She was also not sleeping.  She has a fit-bit and averaging between 3-1/2 to 4 1/2 hours of sleep.  She just felt out of it and this was through the month of April.  Then on 5/8/21 she felt like something was in her eye, she had dyed her hair and put eye drops in her eye.  She did correlate anything with the vaccine yet.  Then Sunday morning (Mother&#39;s day), she observed something and was so tired and decided to go back to sleep.  Then she woke up and the eye and the face started twisting and was paralyzed on the left side.  Her speech was not clear and the automatic thing was to speak slower and it would fix itself, and what was going on.  (She had a prior TIA).  She thought of a stroke coming to mind, and decided she needed to take action and went to the ER by ambulance.  Once she was in the ER, they did an EKG, did CT scan and an MRI to see if there was anything going on for a stroke or sign of a stroke, which there was not according to the paperwork and results.  Not felt to be related to her heart either.  They diagnosed her with Bell&#39;s palsy and sent her results to a neurologist for them to do their assessment.   They were relieved that it was not a stroke.  She went to the neurologist the following week and felt that there seemed to be some white matter on her CT.  She finished the medication that she was given, and was told that he was going to do a phone appointment, and she refused to have that and said that he could not see the differences in her face and the progress over the phone.  She was not able to breath out of her left nostril and was getting worse, having pain and wanted to find answers and they did see her in the office.  They did EMG&#39;s, checked her eyes and said that she was fine, and asked why did it seem that it was getting worse.  She felt like her skin was coming off her spine, and feels a pull.  He suggested doing an MRI of her spine and her face, and suggested an EMI to see if there was damage to her nerves.    She had shingles in the past and was already having difficulties lifting her arm and had suggestions.  She also saw her acupuncturist who did not touch her face and did needling on her body and she was able to swallow better, and was informed not to do them on her face.  She also had a telemed APT and was OK&#39;d to have acupuncture on her head but again not her face.  She was still on the steroids, and had information and paperwork that she had researched and asked him questions to educate her and help her.  Her daughters have been doing research and told her that maybe she needed a different neurologist.  She called the nurse line at the clinic who advised her to stay where she was and see what he had to offer.  She is doing warm towels in the morning and evening and she?s able to get some relief and sleep.  She finds that her brain is working better and that it is going to take some time for this to heal.    She had testing for AVM?s during her chemo and she had no indication for that.    In November and December 2019, she was really sick with URI and was on breathing treatments and was one step away from pneumonia and was not able to work.  She took an antibodies test in March and had antibodies.  She then had COVID in her household in December of 2019, but was tested several times and tested negative for that.   She was diagnosed with cancer when she hit her head on a cabinet at work, and noticed that she had scarring, which she thought was from chicken pox and shingles.  Her chicken pox left scars on her lungs and she did not take medication for that due to driving her kids back and forth to school and not wanting to be under medication effects.   The ER followed up with her after telling her that she needed to see a doctor.  She went to a cancer center and had biopsies and they lost her specimens at the hospital.   She ended up having to get another test and was diagnosed with a very aggressive cancer, and told her she needed surgery.  She had laparoscopic thoracic surgery and they removed 3/4 of her lung.  She had chemo for 5-6 months, and was antibiotics the entire time due to infections.  At one point she was excreting skin from the chemo.  They inadvertently found out that a nurse had given other patient&#39;s wrong chemo and was fired from being a chemo nurse.  She has been under a great deal of stress.  Now since doing the warm towels her symptoms are better, the nerve is not as tight.  It goes from the top of her brow all the way to her chin on the left side, it goes in sections.  It was in the middle first, from there it goes up above and bulges on the top of her brow, and then with warm towels it progresses to a bulge on her face.  She can&#39;t breath out of her left nostril and uses saline to keep it moisturized.  She can blow her nose if she pulls her nose towards the left.  She uses the salt water rinses in her mouth as she feels everything is pulling to the right including her neck.  She was given a salve from her acupuncturist that has helped as well.   She does self pictures throughout the day to see her progress of this process.

                                                Woke in a.m. with heavy pressure pain mid chest and struggling to breathe, massive headache, could barely walk.  Got up and thought I&#39;d better sleep somehow so tried to find best position to allow me to breathe with less pain. Up/down several times, finally got to sleep.

I called the ER at the hospital and explained what my systeoms were and the person I spoke with said it was my choice to either come to the ER or if I wanted to try benadryl again. I opted to take the benadryl at the time then I took a 2nd Benadryl at bed time. Since then I have a little bit of a sore throat.

                                                Left lower lid eye edema,itching and hives on body. Slight wheeze. Took  a 25mg Benadryl p.o. Used my Proventyl  inhaler. Relief within 30-45 minutes. NOTE; I had been to my beauty salon to have highlight treatments to my hair that day also. (2/02/21.)I have had this  reaction in the past after my salon treatment but not the hives before. I strongly feel this was related to the chemicals used on my hair but felt I needed to report it.

                                                Moderna vaccine #2 was given on Friday, January 29 at 1 PM.  She had no side effects that day.  On Saturday she felt mildly achy and had a headache and stayed in bed.  Sunday her heart was flip-flopping with palpitations.  She noticed new dyspnea on exertion with just a short distance as well as feeling panicky.  On Monday she went to work and continued to have the same symptoms.  Two colleagues were vaccinated at the same time she was also reported the same symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea and new onset anxiety.  Yesterday the symptoms were even worse, &#34;really bad&#39;.  Her vital signs were checked at work and were all normal.    Today she is not feeling as bad but still feels very anxious.  She woke up with a headache again.  She is taking ibuprofen for the HA which helps.

It was getting hard to breath, so I got ice and sucked on it for awhile, then I put a cold cloth on my face, tried to relax and the swelling seemed ok.  I stayed up all night because I was afraid that it would get worse, At about 9:30a.m. it seemed to be getting back to normal with just a little swelling in the back of my tongue.  I felt terrible for the next three days and still don&#39;t feel great. Sore joints, got chills, headache.  I am not going in for the second shot.

Later that evening (about 4 hours later) heart had a series of strong, short, contractions. Continued for the next few day but less each day.  Followed up with cardiologist and was in regular rhythm but show him my left arm where I had a red circle (3 inches or so)  around injection site. Referred to PCP and they suggested no 2nd vaccination. If deemed in need of another Covid vaccination allergist should be consulted first.

                                                All three reactions were the same. I woke up feeling like my throat had a flap that was not allowing me to inhale. I had been snoring and work up abruptly because I couldn&#39;t breathe at that moment.  If I inhaled sharply or sniffed hard to try and clear my throat, my airway blocked. I had a fever and also swollen glands in my neck and under my jaw. Once I got out of bed, I drank a glass of cold water and walked outside in the cold. I felt like it was an allergic reaction; so I took a Benadryl and I tried to go back to bed, but when I laid down it seemed worse, so I spent the night in my recliner. The first reaction was the worst in severity and happened about two weeks after my first injection. The second reaction was less than two weeks later,  the last one happened 4 days after my second injection. All three incidents lasted about 12 hours, but I still feel like my glands are a bit swollen, and I have a hesitation when I swallow. I talked to my doctor today 3/1, he ordered a COVID test and ordered me to quarantine until I get the results.

And then I got a shooting pain up from neck to ear; shortness of breath; lips were tingling and mouth was going numb (like a was getting Novocain) and I got a headache and then I got an earache too; I started to feel itchy - all within a short time. I was given Benadryl. It was enough to get my home. I took another Benadryl and I was okay from all my symptoms except the itching (like I was in an ant next) that itching lasted for three days even with taking Benadryl.

                                                Modern Vaccine I felt a little nervous but I?m not afraid of vaccines. Arm hurt, got home was more shaken inside. Took Ibprophen for pain. I continued to feel hyper, then tired, repeatedly all day long. At some point I remember feeling like my breathing was way too fast. The nervousness became fretfulness. At bedtime, I took my normal medicine and 3 mg of Melatonin as usual. I could not stay rested. My body would do one jerk and wake me. I finally got up to read and took .025 mg of Clazonapem . I have that for flying, etc.  Today, March 11, 2021 I awoke at 6:30 am feeling much better but then as the day has continued I am out of sorts. Everything is very difficult to think about doing. My brain is getting stopped from simple writing ABC?s on index cards. Questions are overwhelming me. I?m not sure if I should even consider the second vaccine. This is very unsettling as I am normally very functioning as  a teacher, artist, homemaker. Caring on a conversation is troubling.

                                                I have not had a asthma attack this severe in several years and actually have not had an attack of any kind in  a year. I woke up at 2:30 in the morning literally unable to get any oxygen into my lungs. My wheeze was so loud it woke my husband who rushed to get my emergency inhaler. It was so bad that if any more time had passed he would have called 911 but eventually the inhaler did help me. I ams concerned if this was a result of the Vaccine or a coincidence but people kept telling me I needed to notify CDC...so here I am.

                                                I was exposed to Covid-19 in September, but my tests were negative. I had the same chest pain as when I thought I had Covid-19 on the third morning after vaccination. Started in the back with trouble breathing. I was lethargic and tired but I had a lot of trouble breathing for a week.  I also took a course of Zithromax and the symptoms resolved after eight days but the tiredness persisted. I gave blood on the day of vaccination after the shot and it may have some effect.

I had to talk to the on call Dr. 2x. After taking the Gaviscon,  I burped and had excruciating pain at the base of my esophagus, broke out in sweat and almost passed out. I had to breathe as if I?m labor. It happened again about an hour later. The Dr. said it could be a cardiac issue and go to the ER. I ended up with normal EKG?S and normal bloodwork during the time I spent  the nite for observation. The cardiologist said  I had no heart issues and to go home. I can only come to the conclusion that the inflammatory response from the vaccine was the culprit.

So that night, I checked my temperature and had a low grade fever. I took a COVID test on 1/6 and was positive and I got treatment on 1/7. I ended up being out of work for two months due to a sinus infection and pneumonia. I&#39;m still experiencing symptoms such as lung inflammation and SOB, so I&#39;m on an inhaler, nasal spray, allergy meds and I did a sputum test today. I&#39;m also scheduled to see a pulmonologist, who I also saw prior to COVID for breathing issues. I&#39;ve had to do 3 rounds of antibiotics to resolve my pneumonia.

Ten seconds later, her husband said that she felt like she was going to pass out. Upon getting to the patient, I felt for a pulse and observed mild breathing. The patient was unconscious and did not awaken with a sternum rub. The patient&#39;s husband helped me lower her to the ground, and I administered one dose of Epipen to the patient&#39;s lateral left thigh. She awakened and was able to state where she was, the year, and the president. EMT arrived later, and the patient refused further medical treatment.

Also took an arthritis tylenol when I got home and that helped relieve my tight chest from arthritis. The next day my head hurt all over and arthritis tylenol helped but I also iced my head and slept most of the day. The second day after I was much better but I needed tylenol for my aching arms and legs.

The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 15 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 027L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 08 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 0101M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The first dose of vaccine was taken in non dominant arm and second dose was taken in right dominant arm.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced swollen arm. In between the two doses she felt very hard to breath for few minutes and when she took a deep breath it was fine. She had tylenol for the headaches after the second dose on 08 February 2021. She also had nausea along with headaches. She had blood clogging when she was in a blood donation camp. The event very hard to breath for few minutes and blood clogging were considered as medically significant. Thiamine was provided as medication  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  Follow-up received on 17 Mar 2021 included updated date for first dose of vaccine, and the events very hard to breath for few minutes/dyspnoea, blood clogging/thrombosis.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a strong temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Nausea and headache are consistent with the safety profile of the product

The symptoms got worse each day and I went to Urgent Care on the 6 th day when the swelling started. I was given a Steroid shot and a prescription for Predizone for 10 days. The shot helped within a hour or two but the symptoms are still there but not as severe. All these symptoms have happened to me before when I have accidentally injested Gluten or Wheat. Is there Wheat in the fillers?  I am very nervous about having the 2nd shot !!!!!!!

Then by 2:00 in the afternoon all the symptoms disappeared. Then the next day, I felt just a little bit nauseous. Then the next day the numb lips and tingling tongue returned, except that only the left side of my lips felt numb, and only the left front quadrant of my tongue was tingling.the right side of my lips were fine and the right side of my tongue was fine. Today is April 2nd, and I still feel the tingling on the left side of the front of my tongue. That is constant. The numbness in my lips has faded, but it&#39;s still there.

Patient is not an established patient and did not receive care for her symptoms at our facility:  On March 18th I received my 2nd Moderna vaccination. On Friday the 19th at approximately 4 pm I began to have the symptoms of an immune response in my body. Sat the 20th was spent in bed with chills, body aches, fever, stiff neck, and bad headache. On Sunday I was having pain on inhalation along with everything else.  Monday the pain resolved into left side lung pain on inhalation. Tuesday the 23rd I called my provider who directed me to go to the Emergency Dept. I drove to Superior Hospital. After being accessed I was transported; with pericarditis and the additional mentioned immune response symptoms, and a pronounced heart murmur. On Wednesday the 24 I shook uncontrollably with chills for 4 hours and 2 min and went into atrial fib for about 12 minutes, resolved with medication.  Thursday the 25th I woke to all symptoms being gone. I was released on Friday the 26th with the statement my issues had resolved themselves. I was told to report this to where I got my vaccine so it could be passed along.

                                                After the first injection arm was sore for three days. Second shot started with fever of 102.7.  Extremely cold with chills.  Headache.  Muscle and joint pain.  Very tired.  Second day fever went down to 101 with Advil.  Day 3 developed hives in my mouth and my throat started to feel as it was closing up.  The throat was better the second day but the mouth hives stayed until about day 6 or 7.   Last night my arm was still sore to sleep on at the injection site. Today it is still tender but better.

Have asthma so thought it was just an asthma reaction vs. an anaphylactic reaction since there were no other symptoms.  However, have been having at least one asthma attack each day since receiving the shot and Ventolin is not clearing things up.  Not sure how much longer to expect this to go on.

I am not trying to deceive you or what ever but I will not take the second dose.  Many medical things happened this week and I cannot remember who what or each thing  was discussed but I WAS NOT told it was a reaction but that it could be and the 2nd could be worse.  I sat here at home coughing so hard I could not catch a breath for over two hours before calling the squad.  All tests, including chest xrays came back normal,  I am not sure it was because of the covid vaccine and I am not sure it was not.  I will not be getting the second dose and taking another chance.  If you want pacifics my medical record is there.

                                                Injection at 9:10am. Ten minutes after injection, severe swelling in left arm. Informed nurse. She stated to remove watch band that was cutting into left arm - the swelling was normal. Ten minutes after noticed arm swelling. Pressure on left and front of side of throat with difficulty breathing. Informed nurse. We talked and she suggested I get out of the car walk around and take deep breaths. After doing so I informed nurse my breathing wasn&#39;t any better. She took me inside one of the buildings and found someone to use a pulse ox to test blood oxygen level. She said it was fine and I was good to go when 30 minutes was up. Husband drove me home, I laid down for a nap at 2:30 pm and got up at 4:45 pm. I woke several times during nap due to pain in lower left arm and upper left chest. When I got up I had difficulty breathing, talking and walking. I called on nurse. She asked questions and told me to call 911. My husband drove me to hospital in because it was faster than getting an ambulance. On the way to hospital swelling increased to left jaw and left ear.  At Hospital I was seen by many nurses, I received 2 Pepcid, a Benadryl shot and a steroid shot. Due to the location of pain they were concerned they were concerned that something was wrong with my heart or I was having a heart attack. They took blood tests and chest xrays and did an EKG. Then they had me wait for a long time then did another EKG because they didn&#39;t like the results of first EKG. No changes in EKG&#39;s.  They prescribed Pepcid 20 mg BID and Prednisone 2 20 mg tablets once a day. RX for Epi-pen 2 pack. Started with medications on Monday 4/12/21 morning and took for 5 days as prescribed. Also called primary care on 4/12/21 to inform them of situation. Also called hospital on 4/12/21 asking how to get records and get information

                                                The morning after I received my second vaccine I began feeling nauseated, then I started sweating profusely, and as I started to get a wash cloth to try to cool myself, I passed out.  I came to shortly thereafter, but was weak the rest of that day.  The second day after the vaccine I did go to work, but I battled my asthma all day.  I had to use my emergency inhaler twice, and at one point thought I was going to  have to go to the ER before getting it under control, but I did not have to.

                                                Coldness in my chest, heart. I had coldness in my right lung  and the P.A. thought I might have pneumonia so I was given ZPAC. It did nothing. She then told me I had inflamation in my lung and it would go away in weeks .I kept having a hard time breathing which finally stopped on the 18th day. I did have a covid test which said negative. When I got the first Moderna shot the coldness transferred and went straight to my heart area from my lung. It started getting better in the first 3 weeks but by the 4th week it was feeling stronger. The 2nd dose has helped a lot but the coldness inflamation in my heart comes and goes all day. It is very slowly improving. The inflamation and hard time breathing actually started on Dec. 31, 2020. The inflamation in my heart started April 6, 2021 and as of today May 26, 2021 I still have it.

                                                On Saturday 1/16/21 at approximately 4:15 pm my husband and I received the Moderna vaccine, lot number 041L20A . We waited the required 15 minutes to see if we had any reaction, we did not. After checking out we drove directly home. At approximately 5:10 pm, while driving to our home, about 45 minutes after receiving the injection, we both noticed that we were having difficulty swallowing and felt a swelling in the back of our throats. My husband experienced a metallic taste. The feeling of the swelling in our throats was similar to when a dentist uses a topical numbing gel prior to a dental procedure. The difficulty swallowing and the thickness in our throats lasted about 30 - 45 minutes. We monitored ourselves at home and did not feel that we needed medical attention. Because of my angioedema I had 2 Epipens at the ready. We both experienced soreness at the injection site (left arm), my husband&#39;s sorer than mine. The swollen throat and difficulty swallowing is the only reaction I had. My husband woke on Sunday morning and his arm was very sore, more so than what he has experienced with a flu shot. At approximately 12:15 pm on Sunday, 1/17/21, and about 21 hours after the vaccine was administered, my husband began to feel achy, like he was getting a cold. He took a nap and upon waking did not feel any better. His temperature was 97.6. He felt lethargic the rest of the day and went to bed early and sleep ok but woke up not feeling any better. I used a finger pulse oximeter and it registered 94/94. His temperature remains normal. I am registering these reactions after reading about the adverse and severe reactions of persons at who received the same Moderna lot 041L201 as we did.

The very day I did not notice anything but then 24-48 hours after the vaccine it started being pretty bad and it got a point where it got so bad  the whole left side of my face swollen up, my tonsils, my neck, down the throat, only on the left side of my face.  At one point it was hard to swallow (NY Eve), it was hard to swallow and breathe. I had just started taking the medication my DDS prescribed and it was not really helping yet. On New Years day when I woke up a little better.  It took about 4-5 days for the swelling to go down. After 2 doses of the medication prescribed the pain was much more bearable and the swelling started going down. On 01/02/2021 my dentist cauterized some of the sores in my mouth,

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA adverse event.   Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.  Patient then transferred to another hospital that could provide neurosurgical intervention.

Later that same evening my fever started fising and lowering non-stop through out the night into the next day and still today I am running fever.  It has gone anywhere from normal to 101.5 and 15 min later it can drop to 99 and a hour later back up,.  It has been like this for 48 hours now.  I am having a very hard time with my breathing but I am a copd patient and cannot tell if it is my disease or the shot.

Around 5:00pm that same day I noticed itchiness near the injection site and around the neck.  Around 6:00pm I noticed a muscle twitch around the elbow on the right arm.  By 7:00 pm my back, chest, and both arms were extremely itching.  I took a generic Benadryl and a puff of my Proventil inhaler.  This helped a little but I took another Benadryl an hour later.  I was able to sleep several hours later. Next morning sill have itchiness but less and asthma symptoms seem better.

I had the second dose of the vaccine  Prednisone and Allergy Meds added since second dose for exacerbation of Asthma condition that started two hours after second dose.

But  at about 9:00 PM on  3/17/2021, I immediately started feeling very ill.  I was freezing cold and it felt like ice was flowing through my veins; my breathing became much more rapid and deep (no congestion) and I felt weak and achy.  Then my teeth started to chatter.  I took 1 Aleve , which did nothing (after 90 minutes) and then took 2 packets of Emergen-C Immune system defense (an OTC vitamin supplement) in a small glass of water. I started to warm up and feel much better at about 1:00 AM.  At this time I took my temp which was 100 degrees.  I have felt fine since this strange episode, except I still  feel a little bit fatigued.

                                                I got the shot in my left arm at about 3 PM on March 18th. I did not have any side effects within the 15 minute waiting time. After 2 hours my arm became very sore and throbbing. I took 1 regular aspirin and 1 extra strength Tylenol. I went to bed at around 10 PM. I woke up at 3:30AM on March 19 gasping. My upper throat was tight and seemed to be spasmodic. Suspecting that it was an allergic reaction, I took 1 Benadryl tablet. I had difficulty swallowing the medication. After about 1 hour, where I was not seeing any improvement, I decided to go to ER .  They took two Soft tissue X-rays of my throat.  They gave me a nebulizer treatment with a bronchodilator racepinephrine at 7:05AM March 19. At about 8:15AM they gave me a steroid pill and I left the ER at 8:21AM.

Drank vitamin C 1000mg.   After 15 minutes I felt better.   About every 15 minutes there would be another wave of the same pains.   Then I would feel better and then another wave.   There were five waves.   After 1 1/2 hours, it stopped and I went home.   Later that night, I was very thirty, couldn&#39;t sleep and my kidneys were sore.   Next morning, I could not raise my arm from the pain.  Every day since, I have had another wave of the same pains once in the morning and then again in the evening.   Each wave lasted 1 to 2 hours.   I would sleep and afterwards felt better.  Saturday March 20th, the wave at night was the worst one and it lasted 3 hours.   The wave today March 21st, the wave was smaller and then I could sleep.   Today my arm is better, I could move it normally.

                                                No treatments initially. Big chills in the evening of March 20 and difficulty breathing, 100.7 F fever by morning, inability to even sit on March 21 so I stayed mostly in bed, nausea, headache, sore throat, altered taste (things tasted bitter and as chalk), strong body aches. I  understand that the fever was not high, so my extreme weakness and exhaustion were not really related to the fever. Fever subsided by March 22, but numbness on the whole  left side of head and body appeared  for about 2 hours in the evening - unpleasant and scary, but I did not seek intervention. Headache and nausea on March 23 and 24. Total inability to sleep on the night of March 23/24 (stabbing headache and nausea contributed to a lot of anxiety). Finally took Xanax in the morning of March 24, so I finally slept between 7:30 and 10:30am. I am writing this at 3:30 pm on March 24. I am much better compared with March 21, but still with a significant headache and some nausea.   I had Covid-19 in the first half of November. Post-vaccine symptoms were similar to my covid symptoms, but quick. In December I got post-covid a-fib and was diagnosed with heart failure. Improved on medication, awaiting heart ablation in May 2021. I am concerned that with the strong reaction I felt  after the first dose, my reaction after the second dose may be even worse than that on March 21.

                                                After 5 min of receiving shot, in right arm,  my right lung began to feel painful.  When I am in an environment (house) with someone that has dogs/cats,  I will have this same feeling.. allergic reaction to the animal dander.   This happens if I am in the environment more than 2 hours, and after leaving the environment, the reaction dissipates  from 2 to 6 hours  later.      The reaction I had after receiving the shot was the same as above.  Also, during sleep, my Left lung at times feels a crushing sensation.. it dissipates once I lay flat on bed for a minute or two.  The sensations continue to this day, the pain if felt from front to the back of my lungs.

It felt like what I had when I had covid the year before.  I went to bed and it eventually resolved and has not happened again.  I just thought that I should report it because I have not heard of anyone else having this reaction.  I did not seek any medical help, as it did not seem life threatening, but I was scared.

This subsided after taking Benadryl. Dull headache for a couple of days; only slight pain at injection site.  On 4/4, I began feeling sick with headache, weakness, nausea. On 4/6, the symptoms were worse and finally dissipated later that day enough to work. These symptoms continued for several more days and now feel better.

I also felt tightness in my upper back. I felt it was challenging to draw breath, though I had no swelling in my face or throat. The symptoms got worse for about an hour and then began to fade. I went to bed about six hours after the injection and by then I had milder nausea and much less tightness.

(12pm) Headache, fever, chills (2pm) Light headed, fatigued, swollen joints in fingers (I have arthritis), could make a fist (6pm) called off from work at 8pm Had very vivid weird dreams, breathing somewhat labored, woke up every hour. I took Excedrine Severe Headache every 4 to 6 hours, drank lots of fluids Woke up in a pool of sweat, showered, changed went back to bed. Friday same thing, I pretty much stayed in bed all day. I did not start to feel better until late Saturday afternoon around 2pm and then I developed a rash on my left inside of arm and left side of my waist. It is very itchy and I have been putting hydrocortisone on as needed. I still have the rash, and feel pretty good. Will be contacting my Drs. office today.

(Not known the amount of vaccine I received, most likely 1.5 doses).  For 2 nights, Very bad arthritis pain and stomach pains.  Disturbing dreams nearly every night, since the 2nd shot(s)--nightmares continue..they have not subsided.  Two days ago, woke up gasping for air.  No idea why.  Felt as though I was choking on something..it could only have been my saliva, or a spasm in my throat.  It eased up after about 30 seconds...and I was able to catch a breath again.  Right lung continues to have pain..from first shot..mild, but, it&#39;s there.

                                                At 0920 I felt severe tingling in my lips and tongue. Was quickly triaged, it was getting harder to breathe, my BP was high, my SPO2 did not drop, my pulse was around 80. Tiny red hives started to appear on my forearms. I had taken 25 mg of benedryl, however an epic pen was recommended and given. I felt better immediately, although my chest still felt tight. I was not wheezing. I asked for and was given an albuterol inhaler which really helped, so I did to need admission to the hospital. I was there for about 2 hours. I was sent home with 2 epic pens in case I had a relapse.

She had experienced that before and stayed calm, and probably about an hour it passed.  She then she started feeling really weird and in a day she started having uncontrolled shaking, and put on a sweatshirt, coat and she continued to shake, and got under the covers and could not stop shaking with the chills.  She was then sick to her stomach and could hardly stand up, she has two broken feet and was not able to stand that lasted for about a week.  Every part of her was hurting and she was afraid to get up for fear of falling.  After a week the reaction started to subside and in the meantime she developed hives on the back of her legs and on her stomach.  The one on her stomach was so bad that it was the size of a grapefruit, and looked like she had been severely burnt, which is now basically just going away and has lasted for over a month.  It was next to the wound that has not closed from her previous surgery.   The blister was full of liquid which she left alone for it to heal on it&#39;s own.  She had a telehealth conference with her endocrinologist  who told her that she was not to get any vaccines of any kind.    Public Health did call her the day before the 2nd shot and she explained to the supervisor what had happened and she also informed her that they would not give it to her and not to get the 2nd vaccine or any other vaccines.   This supervisor was part of the team that was trying to get her to heal with the wound vac from her previous surgery.   She does not carry an Epi-Pen for any other allergic reactions.

                                                I had severe reactions from the covid-19 vaccine the evening of receiving the vaccine, 02-24-2021.  I had to go to the ER with fever, shakes, shortness of breath, headache, clammy feeling, elevated BP, nausea-vomiting, lethargic, confusion-disoriented, panic attacks, constipation, gallbladder pain &amp; stomach pain. I am still having some of these symptoms to this day, 06-10-2021.  I request to have the medical charges for the ER bill, the radiology bill and the Dr bill compensated, due to my insurance not paying these charges.

                                                Started approx 80 minutes after injection with soft palate swelling and throat fullness, followed by change in voice, and chest tightness with paresthesias. Went directly to ED. Sats  were good, no wheeze, throat swelling was noted. BP initially 150/93, peaked at 189/93,. Was 148/67 at discharge. Received oral Benadryl and Zyrtec, IV dexamethasone and Pepcid. ECG was done, no other labs. Observed for approx 90 minutes with improvement of all symptoms. Did need to take additional Benadryl dose approx 5 hours after first dose for return of mild throat fullness and rising BP. Both resolved within 30 minutes of dose. No further throat symptoms, BP fluctuations for over 24 hours now

Please see below for more details:  After I got a first dose of Moderna vaccine around 9:30am on Jan 09, 2021, my heartbeat rate quickly went up to over 140/minute, my blood pressure was above 140/90&#43;; I felt hard to breath but my oxygen level was 100%. These were happened within 15 minutes after the vaccine shot. The Healthcare team/rescue team helped me and let me practice deep-breathing. After practiced deep-breathing about 5 - 15 minutes, my heartbeats reduced to around 80 - 90/minutes and my blood pressure went back to normal about 120/75. I left the clinic around 10:25am.

Immediately after the vaccine my face got hot and bright red as it does when I have an allergic reaction.  My heart rate raced and chest felt weird, but immediately I had tingling in my left arm from the vaccine. I was winded when speaking for about 24 hours. When I got home, I began taking Benedryl. My arm still has a hard knot and is still red and hot. I&#39;m trying to find out what to do about the red, fever at injection site and the redness. It&#39;s starting to itch. This has been 10 days ago that I had the vaccine. I&#39;m not an antivaxxer and look forward to my second vaccine on February 8, but I&#39;m a little apprehensive.

The left muscle in my left side of my neck stiffened.  As we left the area and headed down the street I was getting anaphalactic:  numb jaw, swelling tongue, closed throat, eyes closing, inner cheeks numb - as if I was severely novacained from the dentist.  I was able to breathe ok to  get home hoping it would pass and drank wanter to keep things fluid.  I was there for one hour.  On advice, I went to the ER to get checked out.

                                                40 minutes after receiving vaccine my  throat constricted, chest tightened, had difficulty swallowing and catching my breathe. Returned to Convention Center, site of vaccination. Paramedics took vitals, determined I was having a &#34;minor&#34; allergic reaction and administered Benadryl. Within 20 minutes of receiving Benadryl, I was able to breathe and swallow without difficulty. No further complications afterwards.

My brain felt compromised in it&#39;s thought process struggling to think straight 30 minutes into receiving shot. Eyelids felt so heavy . I struggled to hold my eyes open but could not. Fell into a 3 hour deep sleep. Woke up feeling foggy brained &amp; clumsy.  At 3am the next day my throat felt thick &amp; dry with difficulty swallowing.  Went to ER at 3:30. Was told my tonsils were swollen. I did not have a sore throat.  Dr tested for strepp throat with negative result. I was given a shot of benedryl &amp; an oral Allegra pill. Symptoms began to subside &amp; I was sent home. Nasty headache &amp; wobblyness continued through the day &amp; into the following day. Started feeling better Sunday night

Patient had no issues with first shot (even commented that she didn&#39;t have a sore arm with the first shot).  At approximately 3:19 patient stated that she was having extreme itching  around the injection site and down her arm.  I asked her if she was having any trouble breathing or itching of the throat and she said no.  Approximately 1 minute later she stated that her throat felt like it was tightening up.  At that point, 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered into her right mid outer thigh and emergency personnel were dispatched.  First repsonders arrived 5 minutes later and the ambulance/EMTs arrived.  Patient&#39;s pulse ox never dropped below 98% and she was transported to a local hospital.. She was discharged a couple of hours later and came back by the pharmacy to let us know that she was ok.  She stated that she had received 1 more dose of epi, corticosteroid, and antihistamines in the hospital.

                                                When the registered nurse injected me, blood squirted out my arm in a stream.  I thought that was strange.  She asked me if I took blood thinners, I said &#34;No,&#34;  She put gauze on the injection site, held it there and then put a bandage on it.  I told her this has never happened to me before ever when I took any shots in my arm.  She said I would be alright and told me to wait 15 minutes in the parking lot which I did.  That night, I had a slight fever, my arm felt like it was on fire and I had hot and cold chills and couldn&#39;t eat anything or I  felt I would vomit.  I felt the same way the entire next day and just felt  miserable.  I also had problems breathing all day.   I had to use my inhaler every two hours with 3 or 4 puffs.  This went all ALL day and in the evening.  The second day (5th), I felt slightly dizzy and my arm still hurt and noticed a red rash but I could BREATHE finally with no problem!

                                                Within 5 hours, patient was awakened from her nap but found that her eyes were swollen shut, upper lip was swollen and her gums itched.  Her head was hurting which is what awakened her.  She went and looked in the mirror, she immediately took a Benadryl 25 mg oral gel cap.  Within 20 minutes, the swelling and itching started to improve.  The symptoms resolved after taking the Benadryl.  The next day, she went to work.  She took another Benadryl at 10 AM on Friday, slept all day.  She ran errands on Saturday, took a Benadryl with her just in case.  She also carried an Epi pen.  Her feet began to swell, her hands swelled and she started itching all over.  Her throat began to close.  She took a Benadryl immediately (this is day 3).  The symptoms did resolve.   She returned home.  On day four, she had some nausea.  On day five (Monday), she went to work and her tonsils started throbbing.  She ran her bus driver route.  She was itching all over again.  She took another Benadryl . She called Dr. on day 5 after vaccination because of the recurring symptoms.  She also called her allergist.  She had an appointment with her allergist on day 6.  Family Doctor also called back on Day 5 and called a prescription in for Prednisone.  She did not start the Prednisone.  She did see the allergist on day 6. The allergist thinks her reaction might have been due to the preservative in the Moderna product.  It was the only ingredient in both the flu shot (7 years ago) and the Moderna contents.  She advised her to take the Prednisone dose pack (as prescribed by family doctor) to over-ride and she upped her Zyrtec to bid.

However,  two days after the vaccine I developed a continuous dry, barking cough for about 12 hours.  At times I coughed so much I couldn&#39;t catch my breath and almost vomited.  I felt like I had phlegm in my throat but didn&#39;t.   I took a Mucinex,  had a hot shower, drank some rooibos tea,  ate some honey and lemon lozenges, and was fine the next morning.  It was similar to when my daughter was young and had a mild case of whooping cough

                                                Metallic taste in mouth after 15 minutes. About a half hour later, tingling began around my mouth then my entire face and labored breathing ( used Ventolin inhaler)and a cough and very sore arm. The next day, Saturday, I had tingling in my fingers in the morning that spread up my arms and my toes up through my thighs along with my face . I took a Benadryl Sat. PM.  By Sunday the tingling intensity decreased. Monday-dizzy when I woke , then okay. Wednesday I saw my doctor. Today , a week later, and I still have tingling. Doctor recommended I take Claritin for 2 days and get the second shot  due April 16th. I am afraid to get it!!!!

                                                bacterial throat infection; SWOLLEN THROAT; A spontaneous case was received from a non health care professional concerning a 65-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed bacterial throat infection and throat swelling..   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, was not reported.  On 24 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 012M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On unknown date, the patient developed bacterial throat infection and throat swelling.  Treatment for the event included oral antibiotics for 7 days, but patient had not started yet.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for both events were not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

It was harder to breathe and I could not even take a shower that I would be out of breath. My daughter checked my pulsox and it was 85. I couldn&#39;t really walk or do anything so my daughter  transported me to ER and lots of labs were done so since my D Dimer was too high they did a CT scan and it showed some blood clots in my lungs. They admitted me because they were concerned with the location of one of them. They did some heart tests too and put me on Eloquis and then sent me home. I stayed for 2 days. Then they scheduled me FUs with a heart doctor and a pulmonologist.

Arrythmia grew worse to the point I felt I might faint.  Visited ER.  EKG showed Mobitz Type 1 Heart Block and Dr. suspected A-Fib though it wasn&#39;t appearing on EKG.  (Previous history of A-Fib, but ended treatment approximately 2010 because of long term lack of symptoms and normal EKG, Echo.)  I have been nonsymptomatic for at least 20 years.. Symptoms continued through 3/15/3031 though decreasing each day.

I also had benadryl and steroids with me.  About 40 minutes after the second vaccine, ( kept me for 30 minutes), had sensation of slight closing of throat on right side only.  I took a Benadryl and it resolved in less than 1/2 hour with no complications.  Also with second dose had soreness in arm, fatigue, headache and nausea but not severe enough to miss work.

In 8 hours was having chills and a very bad headache. Sleepy,  body aches and shortness of breath when walking. Very tired. Next day still felt bad. The same symptoms.  Over counter medications did not help the headache.   I never had a fever.  The last month i have brain fog, confusion, forgetfulness and mistakes I never made before the vaccine.  Its an effort to get through work.

                                                March 31, I woke up with very stiff joints, making walking and doing household chores exceedingly difficult. This lasted for 5 days.  Beginning on April 5th I felt like I could not catch my breath, so I called my doctor?s office for an appointment; I saw the PA and she felt I needed to have an EKG. I called them and the earliest I could see them was the 20th. I contacted my Doctor?s office, and they sent an order for the testing ASAP, I never received a call from them to reschedule. As the week continued, I got worse and went to the ER. After numerous tests and blood draws, I was admitted to the hospital. I spent 2 days in the hospital, 24 hours on oxygen.

Found out I had numerous pulmonary embolisms in all 5 lobes of my lungs. They did a COVID test and it was negative. They did an EKG and sonogram on my heart and it was fine. They checked for blood clots in my legs. There were none. They checked for signs of cancer. There were none. They started a heparin drip through my IV and the dissolved the largest clot with an embolectomy. I&#39;ll be on blood thinners for 6 months.

                                                Symptoms appeared after leaving vaccination clinic, on the 3 hour drive home. Headache, shortness of breath, and severely bloodshot eyes, with eye pain. Fever spiked at 102.7 with body aches, nausea, diarrhea. Severely bloodshot eyes and eye pain did not resolve. I presented 4/11/2021 at a Urgent Care. Diagnosed with sinus and bilateral eye infections. Prescriptions  for antibiotic, 10 day course and Cipro0.3% eye drops. Completed a 10 day course of both, but the eye symptoms and headache did not resolve. Wednesday, April 21  seen in-person by eye specialist Dr. Diagnosed with eye inflammation, and prescribed prednisone 1% eye drops. After two doses the eye pain and headache began to resolve. On April 22, I hand an in-person appointment with my endocrinologist. He told me I had had an unusual allergic reaction to the vaccination. After 1st vaccination, I also had mild bloodshot and painful  eye symptoms which resolved on their own after 3 days.  Eyes are now back to normal. I am concerned about the possibility of another adverse reaction if I were to receive a COVID-19 booster shot.   No contact lenses or glasses.

Recovery took 2 weeks and later experienced cold stores and shooting nerve pain on one side of my face.

                                                I developed a productive cough (had a dry cough before that) after the first Moderna dose.  Within a few days after the second dose four weeks later, I began coughing up green phlegm.  Less than two weeks after the second dose, I developed a fever.  If I were the only one who experienced lung issues after the vaccine, I would not be reporting this.  However, I&#39;ve talked to four others about their experiences and three report lung inflammation, one even reported getting pneumonia, after getting vaccinated.  I do not know if they all received Moderna, however.  None had received the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                Noticed bleeding in the mouth/gums. Looked inside and found bloody holes in my cheeks about 1/2&#34; big. I noticed the top of my hands we also very bruised although I did not get hurt. I went to the ER and they took me in and ran blood tests. They diagnosed me with Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura. My platelet level was at 8,000, and 6 months prior I was at 180-200,000. They began giving me platelets and were working up to giving my Immunoglobulen. After 2 doses of platelets they gave me 2 doses of benadryl intravenously and I had a scary reaction (I&#39;ve never had a reaction to benadryl prior to vaccine). My body went numb, it felt like my muscles fell asleep, I felt like I could not breath. It&#39;s as if my body attacked anything that came in. Then I was given a sedative to calm down.  As the sedative faded I began feeling immense pain in my abdomen, they thought it was internal bleeding, but after a CT scan they found 3 kidney stones. I was then put on fluids. Due to pain, my blood pressure went up and stayed up for about 8-10 hrs at around 255. I was given about 3 does of blood pressure medication throughout that time to lower it as well as morphine to help with the pain.  The next morning (Day 3) I was finally given the Immunoglobulin (3 bottles = 1 dose). platelets went up to about 60,000. Then I was given a second dose and released on day 4 (but the second dose was not completed in full, only 1 or 2 bottles of the 3 were given. I was released and came back after 2 days for a blood test. I was given steroids to take for a few months.   My platelets were at 120,000. I thought that I was getting better, but then a few days letter came in for another blood test and it showed I was back at 60,000 platelets. Thats where I am now.

                                                Dose 1 - 1/19/21 - On 1/26/21, I got developed a bad case of SOB. I called my cardiologist and she told me to get tested for COVID. I went to the county facility to get tested and it took 3 days for results, which finally came back negative. During my wait, I went to a Urgent care and they did a Chest Xray, EKG and another COVID test, which was negative and the other tests were normal. I was sent back to cardiologist. She scheduled a stress text on 2/11 and everything was fine. I was also feeling fine by then.  Dose 2 - 2/16/21 - The next day, I had a headache, aches, pain, fever and basically felt like I had the flu. I took Tylenol and that lasted about 36 hours. On 2/25, I was doing my 2 mile walk and I start experiencing the SOB again. So, I relaxed and figured it would go away. On 3/1, we drove to a park and back home 3 days later. On 3/3, I was really exhausted, so I took a nap for 3 hours and awakened with calf pain and a low grade fever. That lasted for 3 days, so I went to the ER on 3/6. They did an ultrasound on my leg and found a DVT in my right leg. They did CT Scan of my lung and found several clots (pulmonary emboli). I was in the hospital overnight and put me on a blood thinner, Eliquis 5mg, twice a day. Since then, I&#39;ve continued to take the Eliquis and I&#39;m following up with a hematologist on June 21. The hematologist has already tested me for two factors came negative and he will test me for the third one at my next visit.

Then around 6-7 AM had numbness in her hands, tingling like they were asleep.  When she walked her feet hurt and felt like she had plantar fasciitis or Morton&#39;s neuroma on the balls of her feet.  The tips of her fingers hurt and get cold very easily even if it&#39;s hot out.  The feeling of pain and also had feeling of swelling but they did not look swollen.  The symptoms are not as bad as they were but she has had a 4 day weekend and has not used them as much as she has rested.  Her doctor did not want to discuss it as it was vaccine related and told her to call the CDC, which she has contacted us.  She has not gotten her 2nd vaccine and does not know if she should or not and was calling us for that info, which I gave her the manufacturer phone # to contact them.

                                                While driving home after leaving facility 15 minutes after shot, I started having an increased heart rate.  Once home, the rapid heart rate continued and I noticed throat swallowing was getting a little tighter.  I started drinking water and just breathed normally sitting down.  I went to a mirror to see if I could see any swelling of my face and noticed my neck right under my chin was red about half way down.  My chest seemed fine.  I continued to just sit &amp; drink water and soon the heart rate was getting back to normal.  I noticed the redness on my neck was getting lighter also.  I looked at my watch and it had been a little over an hour since my vaccination.  I did not seek treatment, nor have I called my doctor.  There have been no more adverse reactions.

She took an allegra in the evening which did not help. That night she has persistent itching and shortness of breath with wheezing in her throat. This morning similar symptoms but woke with posterior headache, but over the day the rash improved receding from her legs, back, chest and remained on her chin and bilateral forearms. She was recommended to come to UCC for evaluation.  - prior to the vaccine, for the past week, she reported having sore throat, wheezing in throat, shortness of breath, no coughing or diarrhea - currently being treated for h pylori, taking levofloxacin qday (has one or two more tabs) and metronidazole (has another week). She has taken metronidazole before without adverse effects and no known allergy to levofloxacin. - denies known food allergy or recent change in diet - other than dust but she does not equate this reaction to past reactions to dust, denies known environmental or contact allergy and denies recent contact with plants, nickel, new cosmetic/ personal care product use, or occupational/ home exposure to chemicals - She denies using lotion, change in soap, detergent, clothes, sheets. She lives with family who do not have similar rash. Denies history of similar skin problems or rashes. Apart from augmentin (stomach pain, vomiting), but otherwise no known food or medical allergy. - denies throat/ tongue swelling, history of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis

She received to the vaccine at clinic. She has an allergy to sulfa drugs that gives her hives.  She reviewed the ingredients in the Moderna vaccine and it does not seem to contain any sulfa.

I took benadryl that night and by day 7, the rash began to subside leaving me very itchy for another day.

Breathing was fast but that might have been panic.

By day 5 it resolved.

This was already 5 days post vaccine so I also felt this was beyond the normal time frame to experience symptoms from the vaccine On Wed. I had a covid test to be sure I was ok, as I work in the clinic providing vaccine, that was resulted as neg.  I continued with some fatigue through out the week. On Saturday am, I awoke to a 3?x2?  welt that was itchy swollen and hot. I contacted my MD at that point.

                                                Patient is a 66 y.o. female presents with increasing shortness of breath and fatigue the last few days.  The patient presented to the ER just a few days after being discharged from Hospital.  The patient was treated as an inpatient at Hospital little under a week ago for a COPD exacerbation.  She showed dramatic improvement during this time, but over the last few days has started showing increasing signs of shortness of breath and severe fatigue.  She has no known coronavirus (COVID-19) contact, but states that anything is possible.  Her rapid coronavirus (COVID-19) test in the ER was negative.  However, her chest CT seem to suggest a severe viral pneumonia.  Because of this, the patient is going to be admitted to the hospital as she has failed outpatient therapy and is significantly hypoxic.

                                                At 3:30 PM on February 12, 2021, after receiving the Moderna second dose at 10:45 AM, I developed a very bad headache and overwhelming fatigue.  The headache worsened, and by 4:30 was throbbing.  Around that same time, I developed muscle aches in both arms, shoulders, back and knees, not unlike the onset of flu.  My temperature, normally 96.7, , was rising through the evening to 97.3, 97., 97.6, and 97.9 during the evening.   I was nauseous and had lost my appetite.  My temperature was rising and by 7:30 was 98.  I went to bed at 7:30 and woke up at 11:00 PM.  My heart was pounding, the backs of both of my arms were hot to the touch.  I checked my smartwatch and my heart rate was elevated to 110-120 bmp sustained.  My resting heart rate is normally 60-70.  I was short of breath and had shaking chills.   I woke my husband and asked him to help me - I was scared.  My heart rate remained very elevated through the rest of the night and well into the following day but the shortness of breath subsided.  It did not come down below 90 until the later afternoon of February 13, 2021.  The headache did not resolve until Sunday morning, February 14.  I am still quite tired and a little achy, but all other symptoms have resolved.  I considered going to the ER but decided it was an expected reaction to the  vaccine.

Facial swelling, eye redness and shortness of breath resolved within a day after taking prescribed medication.  Lymph node swelling resolved within a week.  Currently still have slight redness and pain/itching at injection site.  Primary Care Physician has advised skipping second dose.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

                                                When I first got the vaccine I was fine but as the day went on I felt soreness in my left arm with some stiffness in my neck. Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

The shaking was so severe that I was having  trouble breathing between the shakes.  I also had 1 emesis.  At approximately 20 minutes of shaking, I called 911 at the advice of a nurseline.  EMTs checked my vitals and my BP, pulse, O2 sat and blood sugar was all normal.  I almost had another emesis.  They offered to take me to an ER, but I declined as I couldn&#39;t see what could be done for me at that point.  At about 40 minutes of symptoms they began to abate.  I then slept for 11 hours straight.

                                                An estimation of about five minutes after receiving the Covid19 (Moderna) vaccine, my heartrate increased to around 100 beats a minute (as told to me by Dr. ). My breathing felt a little different but it could have been from wearing two masks for a longer period of time than usual. After ten or fifteen minutes, I felt sort of dizzness and it didn&#39;t feel quite normal around my eyes and forehead. The staff were extremely attentive to me. I probably was there after the shot for 30-45 minutes. Dr.  suggested my symptoms was due to anxiety and out of an abundance of caution, the emergency squad was called and I was taken to  Hospital Emergency Department.

She denied any swelling of the tongue, trouble swallowing, trouble breathing, or trouble speaking. Pt did not have any other generalized symptoms (no skin sx, no GI sx). Pt states she does not have any allergies and has never had a vaccine reaction before.  We monitored her for an additional 15 minutes. Her sister was accompanying her so Benadryl was recommended. Pt was calm and after 30 minutes, her symptoms had not progressed at all, however they were still present. Again, counseled on the use of Benadryl and recommended that if symptoms worsened, to call 911 or go to the closest ER. Pt in agreement.

Took a nap at 1 pm and woke up at 5:30 pm with fever of 101.5, shortness of breath, headache and chills. Drank some water, went back to bed with extra covers. Got up at 7 pm and took 2 ibuprofen as headache was unbearable. Fever was now 99.5 and I was sweating profusely from the fever and was restless, could not sleep. Finally slept at 1 am. Still have headache today.  I WILL NOT BE GETTING THE 2ND DOSE.

Nurses assessed, administered Benadryl 50 mg p.o. and transported her back into the clinic via wheelchair for observation. Client reported symptom improvement within 30 minutes post onset and was released to home with her daughter 65 minutes post vaccination. Client was instructed per Dr. recommendation, to take a longer acting antihistimine (Allegra or Zyrtec) to last through the day.  Client was cautioned about drowsiness with the Benadryl and additional antihistimine. She was also asked to check her blood sugar when she got home and to monitor more frequently than normal today. Client was contacted at 5:19 pm today and reports that she is doing well. She did not check her blood sugar until 2 hours post return to home and it was 48. Her provider&#39;s nurse and Dr. were contacted during this event.

I checked my Fitbit on my wrist, and it said pulse was at 93 normally runs around 52 resting. My breathing was heavy.  My head felt like someone tried to strike me with an axe down the center.  I woke again at around 2:00 a.m. My breathing was still heavy.  I decided to check my temperature and it was 101.4.  My arm was hurting where I had the injection but nowhere near like my head hurt.  I woke again around 4:00 to urinate, checked my temperature and it was up to 101.7.  But then it started coming down and was around 101.4.

                                                Hello,  FYI: My first Moderna vaccination I had a sore arm and fatigue for a day. For my second Moderna vaccination it was at 0745 6 Mar 2021. Twelve hours later side effects began. The first night was brutal. Temperature rapidly rose to 102. Joint aches, fatigue but couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain, loss of taste and smell, nausea, felt real cold, shakes, congestion, gassy, hurt to breath, headache, shallow breathing, slightly elevated heart rate. I drank a lot of water and hot Green Tea.  I did call the medical center and spoke with a nurse about whether it was Covid or side effects to the second vaccination.  Second day was miserable; I still had a fever that gradually went down. Finally was able to sleep end of second day. I continued to drink a lot of water and hot Green Tea. Third day, still fatigued, mild heachach. Mild sore arm for three days.  Third through  nine days I have a below normal temperature, hoarseness, mild headache, and fatigue.  the medical center gave me annual flu vaccinations. I&#39;ve never had a side effect from them. While I was in the medical center, before I was deployed overseas, the medical center gave me some dozen vaccinations. Again, no side effects from them.  I have never been around anyone who turned out later to have Covid 19 or tested positive for it.  I have never had the flu. I have had some four cases of a cold. Worst illness was after my exposure to norovirus. I was gravely ill, had to be admitted to the hospital here. Norovirus worse than the two cases of food poisoning I had.  I figure with those awful side effects I now have an immune system better able to handle Covid 19 if I do get exposed.  Per CDC, I will still wear a mask, social distance, avoid medium- and large-sized crowds, avoid poorly ventilated public and private spaces, and wash my hands frequently for the forseeable future.

Covid arm (rash,swelling) appeared on 2/28 and patient had a visable rash on arm when presenting for second dose on 3/18/2021. On advise of oncologist that stated that it should be ok to administer the 2nd dose, I administered it while observing patient for 30 minutes in which she was fine. Did advise patient that she may have a delayed or extended reaction to the second dose and  discussed what to do in the event that a reaction did occur and patient was in agreeance.

I used my ProAir Respiclick once an hour for about the next 6-8 hours. I used it several times during the night and continued to use it about 4-6 times a day for the next 3 days. I still seem to have a hard time breathing a few times a day.  On top of that my knee that had January surgery in, started hurting so bad about the same time. I had to get my cain out and use it the next 4 days. The pain from surgery was almost gone before shot.

I had a really bad headache, pain in my joints, hips, knees, feet, elbows, hands, shoulders and neck.  I was nauseous and lost my appetite.  Sensitivity to bright light.  It hurt my head to even talk.  This lasted 24 hours.  The next day I was extremely fatigued for 24 hours.  The third day, 4/1/2021,  I&#39;m still fatigued and out of breath when I climb 2 flights of stairs (which I do every day to get to my office), but it&#39;s not as bad as yesterday.

Patient stated that she had started to feel that her neck was weak, no ShOB, throat tightness, N/V, diaphoresis. BP 164/92, HR 82, O2 98%, HRRR no murmur, CTAB. No palpable abnormality in the neck. Patient took fexofenadine last night, I did give her diphenhydramine 25 mg to take and provided water to take that with as well. Patient requested to use the restroom and I walked her in to the office building, she did not appear to have any issues with ambulation, though she did state she felt less steady than normal. Extended her observation time for 10 minutes after my exam (total 40 minutes obs time) and patient had no further issues.

She got some hot tea, and the wheezing got progressively worse.  By 11:30 she called back to her doctors office because she didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital.  She told her to go to the hospital instead of trying to drive anywhere by the way she sounded.  She suggested her using a nebulizer and told her to try it at home since she had some.  She did that treatment and was not any better, was kind of worse.  She went to the hospital and said that she was having spasms where the larynx was.  They started her on IV, gave her Ativan through the IV and then she was somewhat better.  They also gave her a prescription for more solution as hers was out dated.  She suffered through the night and went to her doctor yesterday and was out on Prednisone.

Then tapered to 101 by the next night and continued until 48 hours after the vaccine.  At 3am I was UNABLE to MOVE MY RIGHT KEG IR ARM OFF THE BED ( same side I had polio  when I was infant).  I was unable to walk to bathroom and husband had to help me. All I could do was shuffle my feet forward once he got me standing.   By 4am I COUKD NOT RAISE MY ARMS OR LEGS OFF THE BED, EVEN AN INCH HIGH. and had a VERY hard time breathing. The only relief I had to help me breathe was lying on my stomach.  I was seeing streaks of light across my vision for the next few hours.  By 11 am I still had a fever 102 but I was able to start breathing easier and I could start moving my arms .  It wasn?t until 48 hours after the vaccine that I could move my arms and legs without assistance. I had a slight fever of 100 all day Sunday and slight muscle soreness.

When the arm pain left I got #* out of 10 pain in my right back shoulder blade. The pain was not surface pain it felt  deeper. It would even hurt to breath in deep. It lasted 6 days and than started to come and go  for hours at a time. Because I still had intermittent  pain I canceled the second dose. It  presently is  all but gone with just the feeling that I know where the pain was so maybe just a 1.

She stayed that way for about 25 minutes and then it resolved to just her lips. She walked away and within 2 minutes her throat closed up and she came back saying she could not breath or swallow. We called 911 and administered epinephrine right away. A second dose was given when we got no improvement 15 minutes later. She was also given Benadryl 25mg liquid because she could not swallow pills. EMS arrived about 11:35am and she was taken to the hospital. She reports feeling much better this morning and just being achy all over.

                                                1/24/21 I received the Moderna 1st vaccine through the county fairgrounds.  2/11/21 I started experiencing terrible mouth pain on the right side. This included pain in the bone, teeth, gums, cheek and right ear. Thinking it might be a bad tooth I went to the dentist the next day 2/12/21 Dr. took x-rays of the upper and lower right side and found no tooth problem 2/15 After taking continuing pain meds the pain in the right side of my mouth went away, but feeling fatigued.  3/2/21 I received the Moderna 2nd vaccine at the county fairgrounds. I was sick for 3 days with a low temperature. 3/10/21 I had my teeth cleaned and xrays at Dr. office Dental practice. He said everything looked good including fillings.  3/25/21 I started experiencing terrible mouth pain on the left side of my mouth. This included pain in the bone teeth, gums, cheek, right ear and right side of my throat.  3/26/21 I went to the Urgent care. Doctor could find nothing wrong. The Dr. prescribed 3 days of steroids. After 3 days of steroids and other pain meds the pain went away. 3/30/21 I was now experiencing tooth pain specific to the upper right back molar and the upper left back molar. They both felt loose ad pain when chewing. 4/7/21 I went to my dentist and he said the upper right molar appeared to be cracked and needed to be extracted. The upper left molar looked like it could be capped but then he found out later it was also cracked and had to be removed. 4/13/21 I was experiencing headache, fatigue, and shortness of breath when exerting myself. Talked to the triage nurse and made an appointment for 4/19/21 4/14/21 Upper right back molar cracked and was extracted by my Dr at the dentist. 4/19/21 Upper left back molar cracked and was extracted by my Dr at the dentist.  4/19/21 I saw a Dr at urgent care for fatigue, shortness of breath and headache. She did a checkup and blood work. 4/20/21 I was rushed to the emergency room for critically low hemoglobin (5.5) and given 2 units of blood, fluids, and a B12 infusion. 4/21/21 Endoscope procedure while in the hospital showed a possible hernia problem but there was no strong conclusive reason for my mouth pain, cracked teeth and low hemoglobin. I am now taking supplements and seemed much recovered. I believe this was a onetime event caused by the vaccine. My primary doctor, agrees the mouth pain has been reported as a side effect. In October of 2020 I had a complete checkup with my primary Dr.  and was found to be very healthy and did not have any problems until I received the vaccine. I would like to know if there is a pool of money I could draw from as I now need two implants to replace the two cracked teeth.

                                                About 1 month after her second dose of Moderna Covid vaccine she started noticing some shortness of breath with activity. She thought it was related to her subglottic stenosis that she gets dilated often.   A month after her symptoms started she was seen in clinic by ENT for the stenosis and was noted to have significant leg swelling and sent to ED where she was admitted for heart failure &amp; significant PVC burden on telemetry (about 30%). She was diuresed &amp; discharged with the plan to do a Holter monitor and decided if she was a candidate for ablation for PVCs.

                                                I assumed I had bronchitis shortly after getting the first shot. I&#39;d seen my doctor and was given prednisone. I continued to have brochial  symptoms that have not let up for at least 3 months.  I have constant coughing spasms which become constant when in a lying position.   I was also given an antibiotic during the last few months by my PCP.  I kept thinking it was bronchitis, allergies, the pollen.  But this is really getting scary. My friends and family are noticing it now. I can&#39;t talk to anyone too long. I&#39;ve had to take time out of work.  I had a breast reduction scheduled. I mentioned all of this to the surgeon and he didn&#39;t seem concerned, but again, I thought it was related to bronchitis.  I had my surgery. My breathing was very poor after the surgery and for at least a week. I couldn&#39;t get a breathometer up  even a quarter of the way. I have constant wheezing when I exhale.  I never had a breathing problem like this before. My PCP referred me to a lung specialist, but I haven&#39;t an appt until July. I haven&#39;t smoked a cigarette in over 40 years.  This is getting very scary and worrisome for me.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

Felt a tightness in my chest and had a slight bit of difficulty breathing.  Did not want to tell the monitors.  Afraid to go to a hospital with COVID.  My left hand turned blue and got cold and tingly.  That lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  So did the trouble breathing.  All subsided in 15 minutes.  Went home and took an antihistamine.  Had a light rash on my body.  Consulted with PCP and cardiologist.  They seem clueless.  We all agreed that i need the second dose but what is the antidote.  Cardiologist gave me a beta-blocker to take before the dose but these symptoms all appeared on the severe allergic reaction list.  The heart pounding was the most pronounced symptom.  What do I do?

On day four, more appeared and progressed rapidly to entire trunk, arms, face and legs.  and throat felt tight.  Urgent Care Center gave me two injections: Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate, and Diphenhydramine.  Was observed for 40 minutes.

Continuing to resolve.

Pt has numerous documented allergies including iodine (hives, facial swelling), Shellfish Containing Products (Hives, facial swelling) and penicillin (edema). Pt initially tolerated injection without incident and was sent for post-injection observation. Within 10 minutes, pt developed acute SOB, increased WOB, wheezing, and cough. Pt also reported itching skin and scratchy throat. Provider notified and exam found pt in respiratory distress with increased work of breathing, bronchospasm and wheezing. Pt had no rash, lip swelling or vomiting. Vitals assessed as O2 sats &gt;96%, BP 140-150s/60s, HR 70-80s. Pt was administered albuterol 2.5 mg via nebulization x 2, diphenhydramine 50 mg IM and epinephrine 0.3 mg IM. Pt was subsequently transported to ED. By time of arrival, pt&#39;s symptoms had significantly improved. Pt administered famotidine 20 mg IV and prednisone 60 mg PO and placed on continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring. After complete symptom resolution, pt was discharged in stable condition. Pt&#39;s allergy profile was updated to include Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine (eua) (rxn: Anaphylaxis; severity: High).

                                                Patient began to complain of swelling in throat and difficulty breathing. She was asked by EMT if she has an Epi pen at home that she uses as she states this happens often. She does not have an epi pen and states that it usually goes away with Benadryl. The EMT administered 25 mg Benadryl PO. After 15 minutes of observation patient reported that she was feeling much better and the swelling had gone away and that her trouble breathing had subsided. She was able to leave after being monitored for the additional 15 minute time frame.

That night ran fever of 103 pain all through body, chills, couldn&#39;t warm up.  couldn&#39;t eat, just drank water Respiration quick and short. Scary all night long..  Next day fever of 102 aching, bone pain, extreme soreness in arm, couldn&#39;t walk without falling..  Stayed in bed, did not eat, no appetite.  Third day fever broke somewhat in night.  Sweating, fever down to 101, still weak and uncoordinated. Still short of breath just walking.  I had a bad case of Covid-19  in July of 2020 and asked if this would aggravate it.  Was told no.  It actually felt like I had a case of it again.  The pain has been really awful.  I still do no want to eat on the third day.  Still having chills.

                                                On the 17th at 9:00 PM she started itching on her thigh, didn&#39;t think anything about it, just a rash.  Through the night it increased to the whole thigh, and a little on her abdomen, and itched all night.  The next morning is dissipated, and it kept happening for the next night and then increased.  Friday night it happened to the point that 95% of her body was covered with hives, rash, and felt like her skin was burning and pins and needles throughout the areas of the rash.   She called her doctor on Thursday morning and kept in contact them him.  Was given a prescription on Friday for Prednisone and she took that morning and Saturday morning.  Her symptoms were gone during the day but at night they would return with the itching.  She started Benadryl 50 mg on Friday.  She also used Hydrocortisone ointment through the night on Thursday.  Saturday morning her entire face was swollen.  She put a cold washrag on her face and within 45 minutes it stopped hurting her, continued with the 50 mg of Benadryl every 4 hours.  By noontime she was getting short or breath on 2/20/21 she went to the ER.They gave her Solu-Medrol 120 mg, Benadryl 25 mg IV as she had just taken a 15 mg tablet 3-4 hours before that.  Then they gave her Ibuprofen and Pepcid IV.     The shortness of breath was when she was talking, and within 4 hours she was fine.  She had markings on her legs as well.   She was wiped out by this with no energy.   She has not been able to do gardening or anything due to the fatigue.  The rash and symptoms are gone, but her energy level has not returned.  Her legs felt like jelly when she walked on 17/18th.    On Monday, 2/22/20 she stopped the prednisone and Benadryl totally.

                                                RN was staffing a Covid clinic at HS. One of our other nurses gave her the 1st Moderna vaccine at 1:45 PM on 2/12/21. At 1:55 PM, the nurse who had given her shot noticed that patient was pale, and said she was not feeling well. Her BP was 179/110, and she said she usually has low BP. She c/o of &#34;feeling hot and was having difficulty breathing.&#34; She was seen by our medical director. After 30 minutes, her BP was 120/82. She said she ?felt a little better and called her sister to pick her up.? Later that evening, patient texted me saying I didn?t feel well when I got home, had trouble focusing literally and had a crying jag and felt shaky on the inside. I kept hydrating, took 25 of Benadryl and slept for 2 hrs., now feel close to normal. It was definitely a reaction to the shot-just weird!? Patient texted me on 2/13/21 that ?the FDA thinks one vaccine may be enough for 80?90% effectiveness, so I might not get the 2nd dose? On 2/15/21 patient texted, ?My PCP thinks what I had was a side effect &amp; recommends taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or Tylenol before the 2nd injection, and doesn?t seem to be worried about it!?   On 2/19/21, I received a text from patient at 5:28 AM as she was scheduled to staff a Covid clinic that day, beginning at 7:30 AM. She said, ?I have been up for a couple hrs w/severe eye pain and can?t hardly open my eye but it hurts to close it too! At 10:37 AM she texted, ?I just got home from eye doctor and was prescribed drops 4X/day. Apparently, there are pin holes in my sclera &amp; cornea which hurt so bad I had lavender cold pack on all day &amp; couldn?t stand the light. It is a corneal abrasion &amp; I have no idea why that would happen suddenly?. The following day, she texted me a picture of her L arm injection site which she said was ?very itchy and hot! Not painful-? It was about 6 inches in diameter, red, inflamed,  delayed cutaneous rx.

                                                At approx 2 pm Monday, March 8, 2021 I was shopping for clothes.  I was having difficulty breathing through my mask and asked employee if they had a mask I can have.  When I took mine off to use theirs, I was surprised it wasn&#39;t my usual KN95 on me as those are more difficult to breath through.  I felt labored in breathing from that point.  I left the store to get home quickly.  I was also experiencing rapid heart rate\great nervousness and was assuming that because I purchased a large diet coke one hr before that, that the caffeine was causing this.  However, I&#39;ve never experienced this event.  Within 3 minutes of my home, I started experiencing what seemed to be shortness of breathe.  it lasted about a minute.  I considered going to ER.  But went home.  Shortness of breathe stopped and I looked on google how to reduce caffeine reaction.  I ate handful of peanuts for protein, but had odd indigestion.  Kept drinking lots of water to flush out.  Was doing many deep breathing exercises. Nervousness and rapid heart rate lasted about 2 hours.  I  was back to normal by evening.  Scary as I never experienced difficulty with a regular surgical mask.  Never experienced such a severe reaction to a caffeine beverage.  Never experienced that shortness of breath.

                                                Both patient and spouse we given their Moderna prime dose on 2-10-21. Both patient and spouse agreed to observe the post vaccination waiting period and reported no concerns.  On 3-10-2021, they returned for their boost dose at 12:30 PM.  Prior to administration of their second dose,  they reported only mild headache and fatigue that presented approximately 12 hours after their  first dose was administered.   Once again, spouse and patient observed the post vaccination waiting period and reported no issues.  On 3-11-21,  I was notified that patient had passed away at home.  In speaking to spouse, he stated that they both went to bed that evening with with a mild headache and fatigue. Spouse stated that he woke up early that morning with a more pronounced headache and had difficulty sleeping.  He noted that at approximately 5:18 AM  patient seemed to breathing heavily and may have gasped a bit.  He checked on her again around 6:40 and determined that she had passed away.  He contacted EMS and the technician confirmed that she had passed away.  Spouse reports that the state will perform and autopsy in the next few days at the direction of Medical staff.

I have had allergy attacks like I have never had in my life - one 4 days after the shot, another a week after the shot. I sneezed repeatedly and my nose ran nonstop for a few hours, leaving my sinuses feeling swollen. I could not breathe through my nose for several hours. These are not severe reactions, but they make me wonder if I should take the second dose.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 16 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch:unknown) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. After that she had numbness, tingling and itching in left side of her face, which has stayed. Then, almost immediately after shot she had an anaphylactic reaction: throat tightening and problems breathing. In the ER, they gave her Benadryl and that was enough to stop it. Now, she says the numbness is similar to being numb from going to the dentist.  On 16 Mar 2021, immediately after the shot, the patient experienced the event(s) anaphylatic reaction/anaphylactic reaction, generalized allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, tingling/parasthesia, itching/pruritis, throat tightening/throat tightness, problems breathing/dyspnoea. The event anaphylactic reaction is medially significant. So, this is a serious case.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event(s), anaphylatic reaction/anaphylactic reaction, generalized allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, tingling/parasthesia, itching/pruritis, throat tightening/throat tightness, problems breathing/dyspnoea was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67 Y/O M had a serious expected event of anaphylactic reaction and nonserious unexpected hypersensitivity, pruritus, dyspnea, throat tightness, and paresthesia.  Event onset immediately after first dose mRNA-1273. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine. She told pharmacist in IMZ room that she was very nervous about getting the shot and felt nauseous. When patient went and sat down we noticed that it looked like she was crying. I went out to check on her and patient stated that she felt very nauseous and like she could not take a deep breath. I gave patient water and benadryl (10 ml of 12.5 mg/5 ml solution) and told her to take deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. Within 30 seconds to 1 minute of taking the benadryl patient was feeling fine and able to breath normally again. It does seem that this may have been more of a panic attack or hyperventilation rather than a true allergic reaction due to the quick resolution of symptoms. Had patient stay an extra 15 mins in addition to traditional 15 mins for monitoring. called patient at 8 pm to check on her and she said she was still feeling ok as far as her breathing but had a slight fever and sore arm.

                                                The 1st  shot was ok. Had a very slight breathing problem. Similar to when I  have accidently eaten shellfish and starts with coughing.  Not nearly enough to use Epi-pen.  Took  Benadryl. Got the 2nd shot  this past Tuesday and started  getting itchy on different parts of my body approx. 20 min. after the 2nd shot. Today is Sat. and I am still taking occasional Benadryl.  Am itchy on my ankles, my torso,  my arms, thigh,  knee, butt....forehead.  In certain spots there are what looks like little tiny pimples.  Yet on my knee and thigh  were larger welts similar to hives. ps...I feel like I have flees! which I don&#39;t!

                                                After the second vaccine I began to have trouble breathing, racing pulse when I do  the slightest activity, progressive muscle and joint pain, instability standing and walking, digestive issues, headaches and  extreme fatigue. It continues to get worse instead of improving, and I am getting very concerned. I have made an appointment to see my GP the first week of May in Illinois, when I return from FL. However, if this continues I will go to the ER at the hospital.

She had an EpiPen on hand at the time of the injection.   She is a nurse and is knowledgeable of her on health situation and medicines.   She had no problem with the first Moderna vaccine she had on 4/1/2021.   She sat in a chair for about 10-15 minutes after vaccination with the second dose of Moderna Covid 19.  She decided to get up and walk around the store and noticed after several minutes she started having breathing problems/heart rate increased.  She returned to the pharmacy and was observed for 20 minutes.   She did not want us to call 911.  She wanted to try to get through the reaction herself.   I offered to administer her EpiPen or told her I had Benadryl injectable too.   She wanted a dose of Benadryl and I gave her 50mg IM.   She continued to improve and walked out of the store at her own will.  Breathing and Heart rate slowed down.   I have reached out to her at home and she is doing much better.

                                                My mom was very ill with fever like symptoms following her first vaccination on January 26th. The symptoms were even worse after her second vaccination March 2nd and included muscle cramping in her legs. Once she was recovered she only had a persistent cough which she attributed to allergies as the pollen count had been high. In the early morning hours of March 19th she was having difficulty breathing and chest pains. She was rushed to the emergency room where she subsequently died of cardio pulmonary embolism which the coroner indicated began within three weeks of her death.

I called my NP to see if I should report this extreme diarrhea and the  nurse agreed.

Pharmacist helped me to lay down which took care of the nausea and relieved the passing out feeling.  Still had difficulty breathing for several more minutes.  BP was  100 over 80.  About 30 minutes before I could get up and sit in a chair.  Extremely weak.  It was two hours before I was strong enough to drive home.  Pharmacist offered several times to call an ambulance but since it was gradually improving, I declined.

My husband tested positive on the 3rd and my job advised me to test again on the 5th and I was positive. Around the 10th, until 2 or 3 days ago, I&#39;ve had SOB with exhaustion and brain fog. Three days ago, I had a tele appt with  and received antibiotics. I now have sinus infection, secondary to COVID.

I was having difficulty catching my breath and unable to burp or clear the liquid.  After three tries, I was able to clear the airway and was able to breathe well.  I also checked my blood pressure which was 163/83.  I had phlegm in my throat and could clear it with drinking water.  After approximately 40 minutes of checking and rechecking my blood pressure and drinking water, I was able to sleep until 9:00 am.  It is now 24 hours from the injection and I feel much better.

                                                I felt foggy and disoriented and tired within a half hour of receiving the vaccine.   I felt pain in my arm traveling to my underarm.  After an hour I felt like the inside of my skin was prickly and tingly, my face was flushed and burning.  I was so tired I had to lay down.  I just stared into space.  There was ringing in my ears.  My heart rate was a good 20 beats per minute faster than normal.  By bedtime, my face was slightly swollen and I was unable to read because the letters were jiggly.  I had a traveling headache from the side to the top of my head through my eyes.  My breathing was more rapid and shallow.  I felt intermittent chest tightness. And pain.  The next morning, I felt better, but the prickly skin continued and my chest and back were  sore.  I had intermittent cramping in my feet and was sore in my joints.  My arm was very tender.  I was still tired and my heart rate was still elevated.  I did not sleep well and got up frequently during the night to walk around.  By the third day the prickly skin was almost gone, but I have had cramping in my chest and feet.  I am very tired.  I still have an occasional traveling headache.

                                                I got the shot within a minute I could feel in my neck, my jaw, my throat and my ear felt like it was getting big, and my mouth felt like it was full of cotton and I couldn&#39;t swallow. A few days after that my blood pressure was going lower than normal and I felt dizzy, so I reduced my blood pressure medication and kept an eye on it. I also had a huge a lump in my arm and my whole arm was sore. It was red and hot to the touch.

                                                Friday I got the shot at 10:35 - about 40 minutes later I started to cough very badly until I could not breathe. I could not get air into or out of my throat. the coughing lasted about 15 minutes and the loss of breath lasted seconds but happened twice one after the other. I got home 10 mins later and I started to feel nauseous and dizzy I could not stand or sit in a chair.  a few hours of feeling like that I  started to vomit up clear liquid for about 20 min. Saturday I still felt dizzy and nauseous not as bad as the evening before and exhausted.  Today is Sunday and I still have  nausea.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

Also couldn&#39;t use arm for over a week, and felt like crap for days.  Did not report to nurse, just got up and went home.  Had no choice. Had a handicapped son with me and he had wandered outside.  He cannot be left alone.  Got home the feeling lingered.

                                                On March 5th I experienced shortness of breath around 1:30 that lasted for 10 minutes.  I had no other symptoms and it subsided. On 3/9 around 2:30 am I had another episode of shortness of breath that lasted about 5 minutes. I was able to return to sleep. I went to work that morning and had shortness of breath, sweating, and dizziness. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed with an acute saddle pulmonary embolism.   I was admitted and started on IV heparin.  On 3/10, I was also found to have a DVT in my right leg.

These symptoms went away within approximately 5 minutes. The next morning I woke with a slight headache which didn&#39;t last very long. I had significant discomfort in the left arm at the injection site.  It felt like someone had inserted a balloon in the muscle.  It hurt to raise my arm to 90 degrees and above my head.  I became less aware of it about 9:00 pm the following night.  I called my doctor to report the side effects and it was recommended that I take 2 extra strength tylenol.  I still feel some discomfort at the injection site.

                                                Sent: 3/4/2021   7:55 AM Subject: Non-Urgent Medical Question                    For a full week now, I have been battling diarrhea and a very hyperactive stomach and intestines. Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

                                                After 20 minutes, my throat began to burn, from the roof of my mouth and down to the bottom of my neck.  My throat felt like it was swelling up and swallowing became more difficult.  The nurse was called and since I didn&#39;t have a rash and was able to speak suggested I stay another half hour.  My throat felt worse so the nurse gave epinephrine and called EMS. EMS said my BP was normal and oxygen saturation was good.  I therefore declined hospitalization.  I waited until I stopped shaking from the epinephrine and then went home.  My sore throat continued and is still sore today.  I spoke to my GP, Dr. who said I shouldn&#39;tn have the second vaccine or any other COVID-19 vaccine. I also had diarrhea.

After about 10-15 minutes, my face and head began itching and my Eustacian tubes began to close (as if flying in an airplane and unable to &#34;pop&#34; my ears).  I took a 25 mg benadryl right after receiving the vaccination and remained at the pharmacy for an hour observation.  When I arrived home, about 1 hour and 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I took another benadryl and slept for about 6 hours.  Upon waking, all symptoms were gone.  The reaction to the second vaccination was more intense than the reaction to the first Covid-19 vaccination.

This lasted for about an hour, with no impediment in my ability to breathe.  About 4 to 5 hours after the vaccination, my head and face began to itch.  At that time, I took one 25 mg benadryl and the itching subsided.

                                                Pt. arrived just prior to the clinic at 4:00pm  for her scheduled vaccination.  While there she informed the educator and the vaccinator that she had unknown environmental allergies and indicated that she had a history of anaphylaxis.  She and the nurse reviewed the ingredients in the fact sheet and the patient stated that she was not aware/did not have any allergies to the ingredients to the Moderna vaccine.  She stated that she had had other vaccinations Flu and pneumonia with no issues.  After discussing with the nurse, she decided to proceed with getting the vaccine.  0.5 ML of Moderna vaccine was administered to her right Deltoid at approximately 4:00 pm.  She was informed that she would need to stay and be evaluated for 30 due to her history of anaphylaxis.  At 4:17 patient reported to the monitors that she was starting to feel like her throat was tightening and that she was having difficulty breathing.  At 4:19 pm she began pulling out her epinephrine to draw it up.  RN took over for her as she was struggling and administer 0.5 mg SQ to her right lower abdomen. BP was 180/80 at 4:19 pm.  911 was called.  Pt. continued to have difficulty breathing  and talking.  At 4:27 pm 50mg Benadryl IM was administered to her right deltoid.  She was still having difficulty breathing and her respirations were rapid.  At 4:28 pm  Epinephrine 0.5mg SQ was administered to her lower left abdomen.  BP at 4:28 pm was 150/100, Pulse was 154.  At approximately 4:33 pt. reported some relief, her respirations were not noted to be as rapid but she reported continued difficulty breathing.  At approximately 4:35 EMS was on scene.  EMS intubated patient in the EMS and transported to Hospital.  Pt. is in critical condition in the ICU.  This RN called to check on patient on 03/24/2021 and it was reported by her nurse that she coded multiple times through the night and was made a DNR and will be placed on comfort care and it was anticipated she may pass in the next day or two.

                                                Got the vaccine and they had her pull over as she had already had a reaction to the first one.  All of a sudden she felt like her lip was swelling, and her tongue swelling, her face was a little red.  She then had trouble breathing, and thought it may have been anxiety.   She also has had headaches which have lasted for about 11 days, and depression.  Her breathing was getting worse and the nurse came over and told her that she was having problems breathing and started coughing.  She had Benadryl with her and she was advised to take that, and took 2 puffs of her inhaler.  She stopped coughing as much, and was able to drive home within 10 minutes.  She went home and realized that she was hyper, advised to take more Benadryl.  It did not make her sleepy and did help with the allergic reaction.  A friend saw her and told her that she was wired.  She keeps having the coughing fits and breathing problems, and was thinking she was going into anaphylaxis.   She also has had some confusion.  She then went to the doctor on 3/25/21 due to urinary symptoms and had a UTI.  Within the first couple of days she was having coughing bouts and was wondering if she should go the UC or not, wheezy type feeling.  Her doctor gave her antibiotics and told her to use inhalers.  She went back to the doctor on Monday 3/29/21, did a chest x-ray which was clear.   She still thought that she was wheezy and ordered a new inhaler which she has been using, and still having coughing fits even today.  She has been taking Benadryl every night since the vaccine which has not made her sleepy.   The antibiotics seem to have helped the chest symptoms, but she is still coughing.

                                                68-year-old female presenting with shortness of breath and hoarse voice after her first Moderna COVID vaccination today. She took Benadryl at onset of symptoms and received additional by EMS. She now feels better but has persistent hoarse voice and shortness of breath although with unremarkable physical examination.   Given her history of similarly presenting anaphylactic reactions to foods, as well as symptomatic airway involvement, advised treatment with epinephrine for probable anaphylactic reaction.  Patient expressed agreement to this.  She received epinephrine as well as Solu-Medrol, with improvement in symptoms.  On reevaluation, she is breathing more comfortably and says that she feels almost entirely improved.  Repeat vital signs have remained stable.   Prescription for prednisone given for home.  Advised her to discuss symptoms and next steps with her primary doctor, although she probably should not receive her second vaccination.  She does have an EpiPen at home.  Strict emergency department return precautions for recurrent symptoms were reviewed and she expressed understanding and agreement.

                                                multiple pulmonary emboli; could barely breath; fatigue; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of PULMONARY EMBOLISM (multiple pulmonary emboli) and DYSPNOEA (could barely breath) in a 68-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 062G20A and 027L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Gallbladder removal on 25-Mar-2021.   On 14-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 11-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 11-Feb-2021, the patient experienced FATIGUE (fatigue). On 27-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (multiple pulmonary emboli) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged, medically significant and life threatening) and DYSPNOEA (could barely breath) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged, medically significant and life threatening). The patient was hospitalized for 3 days due to DYSPNOEA and PULMONARY EMBOLISM. On 13-Feb-2021, FATIGUE (fatigue) had resolved. At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (multiple pulmonary emboli) and DYSPNOEA (could barely breath) outcome was unknown.            The doctors believed that her diagnosis was not a common side effect from the surgery and believed that the vaccine contributed to the diagnosis. She was treated with apixaban, omeprazole and aspirin 81mg (once daily).  The patient is scheduled to visit a hematologist after 6 months.

Caregiver did report temporality associated with completion of COVID-19 vaccine.  She was found to be hypoxic with evidence of aspiration pneumonia and with hypernatremia suggestive of poor PO intake.  An EEG was performed that did not show any definite seizure activity.  She was kept on telemetry while in the hospital which also captued several pausea, one up to 7 seconds long likely also contributing to her encephalopathy secondary to poor perfusion.  She was evaluated by speech who did not feel that she was safe for any type of modified diet and would require tube feedings should this wish to be pursued.  In addition, there was also evidence of acute blood loss anemia with suspected GI bleed.  Palliative care was consulted.  Her son and caregiver were contacted and wished to avoid PEG tube placement or further aggressive work-up.  She was felt to qualify for hospice and hospice services at her prior group home were arranged.  She was started on oral morphine while here in the hospital to help with air hunger, discomfort, and anxiety.     In addition to oral morphine, she was discharged with liquid Augmentin to complete antibiotic course for aspiration pneumonia.  On 4/5/21 (the day of discharge) Pt appeared less anxious than she had been.  She is nonverbal at baseline but was awake and alert and reaching for the hand of any staff in the room. Discharge to group home on hospice.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. No adverse reactions from first shot March 16, 2021. This reporting concerns the second dose April 14, 2021. Two weeks later I experienced locking and pain in both shoulders but more severe on the left side where the injection occurred. The shoulders would not rotate then &#34;popped&#34; , motion returned and the pain subsided.  The pain was quick and intense. Second issue, a similar locking pain across the shoulder blades that literally stopped my breathing until the pain subsided. Third issue, a similar cramping pain in the toes of both feet while walking, again slowly subsiding. All of these issues have occured daily since the second Moderna injection. I have contacted my primary care doctor for an appointment as well as reporting this here.

Area was cleaned prior per pt with alcohol swab.

                                                I had it at 10am on Monday and woke up at 3am at Tuesday morning with headache, shaking and fever. Body aches and all of that. So that continued through Thursday, I started feeling better by Thursday afternoon however I woke up at 4am Friday morning with a horrible cough. It sounded like I had Crip and I couldn&#39;t catch my breath and coughing up yellowish mucus. I had a low grade fever. I called the Doctor that day and he told me to continue my breathing treatments with the Nebulizer that I do 4 times a day and take Mucinex. I was really sick for a few days. I ended up calling the Doctor every Friday and could hardly speak cause I had Laryngitis because I was coughing so hard. The cough went for 2 weeks without getting better and got worse. The 3rd week on the weekend I went to urgent care that afternoon because I started getting a fever. They told me I shouldn&#39;t have gotten my vaccine because I was too close coming out of COVID and had too many antibodies. I also had an infection on my tongue with little bumps and it stings and I have a horrible taste when I eat certain foods - I take a swish and spit medicine I use everyday.  I have a  after covid care for long haulers with a Pulmonologist 7/2/2021.

                                                The day after the injection I experienced shortness of breath and a pounding heart, especially going upstairs.  After several days, it became so severe that I had to lie down to catch my breath after climbing stairs or doing anything remotely strenuous.  It would resolve itself after a few minutes of rest.  It continued for 6 days and then stopped on the 7th day.  I felt fine the day of the injection.   I plan to follow up with my primary doctor.  As of now, it appears to be completely resolved but I will not take the second dose for fear of a bad reaction.

                                                the day after the vaccine I slept all day.  Next day felt 100% better.  On the 3rd day I began feeling exhaustion and weakness as though I had been very sick and my body was having difficulty recovering.  20 years ago I had an autoimmune issue (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and asthma that took me about 10 years to get under control. I started getting shortness of breathe and I was concerned I may have gotten COVID, but I since took a test and do not and have never tested positive (about 5 tests).  I had 2 days of Renaud&#39;s incidence when one segment of my right forefinger completely drained of blood, and turned white.  (Same finger both days). It took me 10 minutes of massage and windmills with my arm to bring color back to the finger.  The shortness of breathe continues weeks later and it appears my asthma has returned.  Went to the doctor last week and we are starting with and inhaler to see if that takes care of it.  I have had to use it every day since I got prescription 3/6 - all day the first day, lesser since.  Still shortness of breathe and feeling compromised.    My sister has worse autoimmune problems and MSRA.  After her Moderna vaccine last week she was confined to bed the whole week with her 1st vaccination.  She had not been exposed to COVID that she is aware of. Neither of us ever smoked.  Could be our lungs were already compromised with both parents heavy smokers and growing up where all the smog from the 1960&#39;s would linger. Our breathing would ache from exertion.  A brother, once a heavy smoker, has had emphysema, and serious heart damage from a heart attack, and suffers from a lack of O2.  He has not had a shot yet and we are concerned about his response.

                                                Feeling of swelling in throat, and strange feeling in face, which happened at first vaccine.  This was same reaction I received when starting allergy shots years ago (for grass, trees, etc. ) Reaction did not progress  after the  first vaccine,  but persisted with headache for four hours.  This time, while driving home, face felt like cement, throat felt full like I could barely swallow.  Intensity subsided about 20 minutes later and I was able to drink, so I assumed it was okay.  I  had bad headache for 2 days. On day 2, noticed welts below and on sides of injection sights, which were painful to the touch.  Today, they look like hives.  I was not concerned about the headaches, but the strange feeling in my face and throat were concerning.  I&#34;ve never had painful hives after any vaccination.

                                                First vaccine on 1/16/2021, I experienced some numbing of my limbs (arms and legs). It was random and typically didn&#39;t last too long (except one time in my left arm that was quite dramatic and I took Bayer aspirin immediately) but was definitely not a normal experience in my body.  After the second vaccine on 2/15/2021, the next day, I had the expected fever (100.1 to 100.9) throughout the next 2-days, along with no appetite, energy, or strength. I expected it to dissipate but by day 3 &amp; 4, I felt even weaker and more exhausted. As the days turned into weeks (5&#43; weeks now), I&#39;ve experienced severe exhaustion needing to sleep most days 9-13 hours, consistent numbness in my arms (con&#39;t next page) and some w/legs, blurry vision, and very unbalanced. I went from walking several miles a day to barely being able to walk a few blocks due to unbalance, weakness and being out of breath. This has gone on for over 5-weeks now. It feels like I am a long-hauler but without having had Covid. I&#39;ve always been sensitive to drugs, expected to have a reaction, but never imagined something like this would go on for so long.   During this period, I had two Covid tests on March 1 and March 10. Both were negative. The week of March 8, I came down with a good old fashioned cold. PCP asked for the second Covid test and chest x-ray (all clear) on March 10. PCP did lab work on March 5. Everything showed as &#34;unremarkable&#34;.

                                                Patient began having symptoms 7 days after vaccination:  chest pain, shortness of breath, feeling like a lump in the throat.  Over several days symptoms worsened, and included upper back pain and some pain in the upper left arm.  Patient went to urgent care clinic on the morning of March 15, where staff decided to send patient by ambulance to the hospital.   She was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with having 5 blood clots in her lungs. She was discharged March 16 in the evening on Eliquis 5mg twice a day. She states the hospital did not know what caused the blood clots, and were aware she had been vaccinated recently.  She has not had a doctor visit in years, but is now established with a primary care physician for follow-up care.   The second Moderna dose was given today 3/31/21.

                                                Started with body fatigue so I went to bed. Very restless and couldn&#39;t get comfortable because my arm hurt.. Sometime during the night I woke up with a crashing headache  and I felt as if I couldn&#39;t move.  At first I thought it to be a dream until I tried to sit up nd everything hurt and my head especially. My chest hurt when I tried to breath deeply.  I had chills and couldn&#39;t stop shaking although I did eventually. With my body and head aching I was afraid to move because I felt nauseous.The next morning I called a friend, I took naproxen sodium, 200 mg as directed. It is now the following morning and I have a dull headache and slight body aches.  The first dose nothing.

Shortness of breath got worse till I took some prednosone I had, on April 4, 2021 thinking I was having an asthma attack. Helped a few days. Shortness of breath returned on April 9, 2021. On April 10 we went to critical care thinking I was having asthma attack as extremely short of breath! They said it wasnt asthma but sent me to ER as my oxygen levels were low. In ER they took many tests including CAT scan and ultrasound, which resulted in diagnosis of several large bloodclots in both lungs

So I took my pulse reading on a commercial pulse oximeter and my reading was bouncing from 136 to 156...which I told my husband about.   I took a Tylenol and sat in a recliner and promptly fell asleep...as my fever was 102 at that time also. I took Tylenol (one tablet) on 2 separate occasions during this period.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No recorded medical history).   On 09-Feb-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced INAPPROPRIATE SCHEDULE OF PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION (Second dose administered on 38th day). On 23-Mar-2021, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY TRACT IRRITATION (pressure in the area of her cancer (left lung cancer)/felt was like somebody was squeezing her lungs/tightened up in the area of her cancer) (seriousness criterion intervention required), PULMONARY PAIN (painful in the area of her cancer) (seriousness criterion intervention required), DYSPNOEA (difficulty in breathing) (seriousness criterion intervention required) and DISCOMFORT (lot of discomfort). On 27-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ILLNESS (really really sick - with chemotherapy), HYPERTENSION (blood pressure was slightly elevated), MALAISE (felt unusual), PYREXIA (Temperature was 100.4F.) and FATIGUE (exhausted). On 19-Mar-2021, INAPPROPRIATE SCHEDULE OF PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION (Second dose administered on 38th day) had resolved. On 26-Mar-2021, RESPIRATORY TRACT IRRITATION (pressure in the area of her cancer (left lung cancer)/felt was like somebody was squeezing her lungs/tightened up in the area of her cancer), PULMONARY PAIN (painful in the area of her cancer), DYSPNOEA (difficulty in breathing) and DISCOMFORT (lot of discomfort) had resolved. On 31-Mar-2021, ILLNESS (really really sick - with chemotherapy), HYPERTENSION (blood pressure was slightly elevated), MALAISE (felt unusual), PYREXIA (Temperature was 100.4F.) and FATIGUE (exhausted) had resolved. Not Provided          Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  Because of chemotherapy the patient rescheduled her second shot and so it was delayed. Four days after the second shot she got pressure in the area of her cancer (left lung cancer), it tightened up, she had difficulty in breathing, painful, lot of discomfort, it was like somebody was squeezing her lungs. Few days later (2-3 days) she got really really sick and felt very tired - she was under chemotherapy. This never happened before with the chemotherapy (she has been taking it from several years). Her blood pressure was slightly elevated. Temperature was 100.4F. She felt very unusual and exhausted. All this happened for about for about 4-5 days.  Treatment for the event included acetylsalicylic acid.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.

Patient did not go to the emergency room or call 911, but went to a park to sit and get some fresh air.  Patient called the pharmacy just before closing around 6:30pm to inform us of her reaction and that her breathing was still not 100%.  I suggested she go the the emergency room, but the patient seemed to feel comfortable enough to not need to do so.  I encouraged her to call 911 if necessary and to contact her doctor to inform him of her symptoms.

                                                Two days after the first dose of Moderna, I experienced severe shortness of breath which lasted the entire month of February.  After walking up a flight of stairs, I had to lay down on the floor to catch my breath.  My heart was pounding.  I was unable to walk my normal 3 miles a day because it produced the same symptoms.  I went to my doctor and but it could not be determined if the vaccine caused it.  Interestingly, two days after receiving my second shot (March 10, 2021), the shortness of breath went away as mysteriously as it came.  I can go up and down the stairs without breathing difficulty and have resumed daily walks without any problems.

All through March I felt bad with symptoms of muscle aches, headaches, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, nausea. By the middle of March I felt so bad that on the 17th I had a covid test, which turned out negative. On the 20th I had nausea and vomiting and a fever of 101 to 102 degrees. I received instructions to use ondansetron for the Nausea/vomiting and Tylenol for the fever. On the 22nd I had a virtual with the nurse practitioner; she determined I had a GI virus and was not in need of anything further. I felt better on the 25th &amp; 26th and decided to get vaccine #2 on the 03/27/2021. On the night of the 27th I went to the ER for worsening shortness of breath and chest pain, especially with deep inspiration, and nausea/vomiting. I was admitted to medical center with a (later) diagnosis of Bilateral Pleural Effusion. I was started on antibiotics and received multiple tests including x-rays, blood tests, cardiac function,Ct scan with contrast, images from nuclear med and more. A thoracentesis was done to drain a pocket of fluid in the left lower pleura - 700cc was removed and sent to the lab. Between the blood work and the pleura fluid it was determined that I had Systemic Lupus. I had no other acute s/s of Lupus although the Cutaneous Lupus had been diagnosed for many years.

                                                After receiving the injection, I was directed by an RN to sit in a chair for 15min in the same room. Five minutes after the injection I felt my upper back  muscles, ribcage area, contract.  The contraction continued around to the front of my chest with next 3 minutes.  I felt tightness with each breath.  The RN who gave me the injection came to see if I felt alright. She informed the charge nurse that my chest felt tight and the charge nurse came to ask me questions.  The charge nurse called the hospital pharmacist to come to see me.  The pharmacist arrived with various medications and talked to me.  He instructed me to do breathing exercises and meditate.  I told him that I was familiar with these techniques and using them.  I also informed the pharmacist that I had a heart attack in 2018 and had atrial tachycardia but I wasn&#39;t feeling any problems with my heart, that it was beating normally.  I also informed the pharmacist of my severe allergies to certain items but I wasn&#39;t experiencing any anaphylaxis that I&#39;ve experienced in past allergic episodes.  The pharmacist left and told the charge nurse to keep me a half hour longer under observation and to call him if I felt worse.  During that half hour, the muscle contractions stopped and I was able to breathe normally.  The charge nurse asked me if I was ready to leave after the half hour was up, I told her I was feeling odd so she said to stay another 20min.   I began to experience intestinal cramping and asked to leave to go to the bathroom.  In the bathroom I had a bout of diarreah that lasted 10minutes.  After that I drove home but was experiencing a headache that started.   The headache lasted for 20hrs. It felt like I was wearing tight hat, squeezing.  Iv&#39;e not had that type of headache before.  My right arm site of injection feels a little warm and is pink but isn&#39;t painful.

Felt it was allergic reaction and took Claritin which helped a bit.  Then took Benedryl 25 mg. which seems to help further.  Took at 5PM and 9PM. Saw the doctor the next  morning  (2/5) and he prescribed methylPrednisolone to take PRN.  That evening, throat and roof of mouth felt a bit swollen so I took both Benedryl and prednisone.   2/6 Felt fine all day until about 9:30pm, felt hot and a bit  of nausea.  Again took Benedryl and prednisone.  2/7, this morning, feeling very tired but no allergy symptoms.  All vitals were normal this whole time.

                                                I first became exhausted 4 hours after the shot and my arm started to hurt. I had headaches, intermittent sweating, deep exhaustion and body aches, occasional sharp shooting pains around my body, and a feeling of heaviness and lassitude. My arm remained sore, and these symptoms lasted for 5 days. I stayed in bed.  I also took ibuprofen the next day, for the symptoms, not realizing I was not meant to do that.  I was already weary, and dealing with major stress for weeks before the vaccine. And I had been taking max doses of OTC painkillers for an extracted tooth for over two weeks before the shot. The tooth extraction had problems but because of Covid risk my dentist told me to &#34;tough it out.&#34; I took 800mg of ibuprofen and 1000 of Tylenol every six hours for over two weeks.

I experienced mild flu-like symptoms on 2-13-21 (general achiness, tiredness, slight fever - 99degrees- mild headache).  Symptoms were treated with Tylenol and had subsided by 2-14-12.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

I experience shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness.  My left upper quadrant is sore from the  Moderna vaccine.  It appears to be spreading circular to the size of a quarter to about the size of a fifty-cent piece.  I had gone to sleep.  I contacted the veteran 24 hour nurse, my best friend, and my brother to tell them my health status.  I had eaten dinner, taken a Tylenol, and went back to sleep before brushing my teeth.

It resolved during the night. (2) On Day 3 - today 3/15/21 - the lymph nodes in my right armpit, where I had lymph nodes removed during breast cancer surgery in 2019, became swollen and remain so.

I was given  an ADVAIR inhaler which did nothing to alleviate the symptoms, so then had 3 weeks of prednisone, to the point i did not want to go for the second dose, but my doctor talked me into it as I have so many pre-existing conditions.  I had no problem at all with the second dose and am now off the prednisone and the advair

                                                First symptom was  tightening of throat on 2/18/2021 not closing nor sore just tightening.  That lasted 48 hours.  Joint pain started after throat dissipated on Friday 2/19/21.  Joint pain was progressive from shoulders for several days, then  knees for a day, then tops of one foot for one night, then it moved to my hands.  I had swelling where I could not close my hands. I had severe and exstremely painful joint pain in  both hands that kept me up at night and unable to pick up things or close my hands.  I used ice packs for some relief. It would sometimes calm down somewhat for hours and I would think it was over and then it would come back . The hand symptoms lasted from 2/23/21  through 3/5/21 when pain began to slowly calm down.  I had one hand that would not close into a fist for one day 3/6/21 when pain was much less. By Sunday 3/7/21 most symtoms were much less with symptoms dissipating all together.  I have had no recurrence since the weekend of 3/6/21 of any symptoms.

                                                Noticed shortness of breath, extreme trouble breathing that worsened over 3 days. Cat scan was performed at hospital finding blood clots on lungs. Surgery was performed to eliminate the blood clots.

                                                Patient suffered cardiac arrest two days  (on 3/5) following first dose Moderna Vaccine at Rite Aid Pharmacy (3/3).  The following is the Discharge Summary From 3/26.    Resident Attestation: I personally saw and examined the patient on rounds with my cariology resident team on the day of the resident&#39;s note. Management was discussed with the cardiology resident and I supervised the plan of care. I have reviewed and agree with the key parts of the resident evaluation including:  Subjective information Objective findings on physical exam Impression and plan Gen: appears comfortable, sitting in bed Resp: clear. no wheezes, rhonchi, rales CV: normal rate, regular, no m/r/g Abd: soft, nt/nd Ext: warm, no edema. Pressure ulcer boots on. Pleasant 70-year-old woman who had a history of PVCs, left bundle branch block, and a mild nonischemic cardiomyopathy, came into the hospital following a VT/VF cardiac arrest. Her echocardiogram done while in the hospital showed a preserved ejection fraction. Her cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. She had implantation of an ICD. Hospital course has been complicated by watershed cerebral infarcts. In addition, she had an episode of C. difficile colitis. She has gradually improved over the course of the past 3 weeks. From a cardiovascular perspective, she is being discharged on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and her home atorvastatin. With regards to her etiology of cardiac arrest, I would be suspicious about the possibility of sarcoidosis. However, we were not able to get a cardiac MR while she was inpatient due to her strokes and inability to consistently follow commands and hold her breath. Would recommend consideration of an outpatient PET. She is ready to discharge to subacute rehab today. I have spent greater than 30 minutes in discharge planning.  Primary Discharge Diagnosis VT/VF cardiac arrest, s/p therapeutic hypothermia S/p AICD placement 3/16/2021 Secondary Discharge Diagnoses Anoxic brain injury, recovering, with persistent aphasia and dysphagia C. difficile colitis Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, resolved DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness 70 y.o. female, with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted on 3/5/2021 after out of hospital VT/VF cardiac arrest. She completed therapeutic hypothermia protocol. Cardiac catheterization did not show any significant obstructive coronary disease. TTE showed LVEF 55%. Patient underwent AICD placement on 3/16/2021. Had some recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia afterward, which resolved after increasing her carvedilol doses. Her course was complicated by a C. difficile infection, treated with PO Vancomycin, with significant improvement in diarrhea. She has had gradual neurologic recovery. Neurology felt she had had several watershed infarcts, but felt that she would continue to have a prolonged recovery over the next few months. Had some recovery of language/cognition prior to discharge. Due to her waxing/waning encephalopathy, she did not qualify for inpatient rehab, but will be discharged to subacute rehab. Discharged with tube feeding continued, though she can begin sips with speech therapy supervision. Patient seen and examined at bedside on the day of discharge. She stated that she had no pain, though HPI/ROS still limited due to aphasia. Discussed above information with patient&#39;s husband, who understood and was in agreement with the plan.  Problem-Based Hospital Course NEURO Acute metabolic encephalopathy, with gradual recovery -Due to neurologic injury from cardiac arrest. -Neurology consult: concern for anoxic brain injury with watershed infarcts, anticipate very gradual recovery over the coming months. No acute process on imaging. -Patient extubated on 3/11, following some commands. Continuing to regain conversational ability and motor function gradually each day. Has some waxing and waning of mental status, but overall her encephalopathy  continues to improve. -Limit centrally acting/sedating medications -Speech following for language/cognition as well as dysphagia requiring tube feeding. Can begin some sips in addition to tube feeds. -Continue tube feeds via Dobbhoff tube per instructions provided on after visit summary INFECTIOUS DISEASE C. Difficile Colitis: -C.Diff Positive 3/18. Continue 125 mg PO Vancomycin Q6H for 10 days (3/18 - 3/27), confirmed with infectious disease -Frequency of diarrhea has decreased significantly, was stable after rectal tube removed 2-3 days prior to discharge Pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, resolved -s/p 5 day course ceftriaxone (3/5 - 3/9 ) -CTA on admission showed significant RUL and RLL consolidation with air bronchograms, as well as some patchy airspace disease in LUL -Had copious tan sputum on suctioning 3/7 - respiratory culture negative CARDIOLOGY Out of hospital cardiac arrest, likely VT/VF -Pt&#39;s husband initiated chest compressions x 10 minutes, until police/fire dept arrival, when AED showed a shockable rhythm. Likely VT/VF arrest. -S/p therapeutic hypothermia protocol. -Troponin peaked at 1.09 -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), resolved Chronic left bundle branch block -Has had multiple episodes of NSVT noted on telemetry 3/19 - 3/20 -s/p ICD as above -Increased dose of Carvedilol to 25 mg BID with resolution of NSVT  History of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 55% -Echo in 11/2019 demonstrated EF 42% (nadir). -TTE on admission showed recovered EF to 55%, mild concentric LVH, normal RV systolic function, no valvular abnormalities -Was initially started on aspirin/statin due to high suspicion for CAD, but as cardiac cath 3/15 was unremarkable, these medications were discontinued. -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Hypertension -Blood pressure now improved after restarting home lisinopril and initiating carvedilol -HCTZ discontinued as BP now well controlled on above regimen  RENAL Oliguria, resolved -Pt initially had low urine output since admission, improved to 0.5 cc/kg/hr on 3/9. Continue fluids with free water flushes through tube feeds -Has had normal electrolytes, renal function, and urine output since initial renal recovery. RESPIRATORY Acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to cardiac arrest, s/p mechanical ventilation, extubated 3/11 -Patient successfully extubated 3/11, stable respiratory status.

Pt reports after her first dose of Moderna on 3/16/21 she went home after waiting for 30 minutes and noticed red lines by her nose when she got into her car but thought it was nothing and did not mention it to any staff members/providers. Per the patient, went to bed that night and her throat got tight and her tongue swelled up so she called her PCP and he advised her to take &#39;medication&#39; and she said symptoms improved. Pt notes for a few days she had to take these &#39;medications&#39; because her throat was still a bit tight. Pt denies ever going to the ER. Pt reports symptoms have resolved completely.   *I did not vaccinate this patient. This pt did not report any reactions while being monitored for 30 minutes by a provider on 3/16/21.   I am currently seeing regular office visits today and the patient asked to speak with a provider prior to her second dose she was scheduled to come have done today. This patient is brand new to me and new to clinic and has has never been seen before aside from getting her first Moderna vaccine here. I advised she cannot get her second dose of Moderna and she agreed. I also advised that she report the adverse reaction herself and she agreed. STRICT ER precautions were advised and pt was recommended to follow up with her PCP.  Pt verbalized understanding and agreed and her second dose of her Moderna COVID vaccine was cancelled and I wrote on her vaccine card she cannot receive her second dose due to anaphylaxis.

Her husband had to go to the Dr on 1/26/21 and was still having breathing problems, kept taking Tylenol.  After his APT she could not breath, went to UC, gave her a breathing treated, Albuterol and it seemed to make it worse.  Was wheezing a few weeks early and had scheduled her an APT for a pulmonologist which was on 1/27/21.  Went to the pulmonologist who felt it could have been stress related or if it was from the vaccination or not.   He prescribed her steroids and breathing treatments at home.  has FU in 2 weeks with him.  Still having difficulty breathing.

                                                I had an adverse reaction approximately 35 minutes after my injection when I was  driving home. I had numbness on the left side of my mouth and lips which came on very quickly. This numbness was identical to the feeling of Novocain injected for dental work, except it came on much faster. My cheek and left side of the throat were swollen. I was also chilled.  The intense numbness lasted about 20 minutes. The swelling did not worsen.     12 hours later I had some numbness and swelling in the bottom left lip.  The cheek and throat swelling were gone.  24 hours following the injection I had swelling in the left side of the bottom lip and numbness in the corner of the left lip only.  36 hours later all symptoms were gone.

The swelling was hard in nature.  Also has had diarrhea and vomiting at 2:00 Am this morning.  Got really hot and cold sweaty feel, then turning to chills.  Stomach hurting, breathing was labored, trying to stay calm.  Finally the diarrhea ran it&#39;s course, went back to bed and is very sore all over, especially her arms and shoulders to the point she can hardly use them.  She is now noticing pain in her arms and legs, just hurts all over.    Yesterday she took Tylenol before bed, has not taken anything today.   The vaccine site is still itchy, red, and swollen in a hard way and hurts.

I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

About 40-45 minutes after injection I had a distinct sensation of swelling lips and a tightening of the throat. I stopped driving, drank some water in the car. Fortunately, this reaction did not progress and after a few minutes more began to dissipate. I drove the rest of the way home. Then a late afternoon nap. I will have Benadryl with me for the 2nd dose.

                                                Got the vaccine and experienced slight shortness of breath, and then started developing a bronchitis-type cough that was very severe, very persistent and could not speak due to the bronchial cough.  Her arm was not sore, no other symptoms other than the cough.  She took Nyquil that night to go to bed, and then in the morning she went to the UC on 3/2/21, and she was prescribed and prescribed a rescue inhaler Albuterol sulfate, which has helped her.  She does have an APT with her PCP tomorrow.  At the 24 hour mark from the vaccine is when she noticed improvement and had had 2 doses of the inhaler.   Did have a reaction to the flu vaccine in the past, and discussed this vaccine with the doctor who prescribed an Epi-Pen and told her to take Benadryl before the vaccine.

However I felt as though I could not expand my chest wall. So I waited a moment and after 2 attempts I was able to expand my chest wall. This symptom has improved and is occurring less frequent, but it is still there. It feels as though I have to think the process of taking a big breath through. Over the following days I experienced pain in my joints and muscle aches. On day 2 I began to experience severe pain at he old surgical site on my lower back. The pain radiated down my right leg which is the same leg that was involved when I injured my back it got so The pain also went into my right hip. It got so bad that on day 3 my daughter came to stay with me until  I could walk upright and my pain began to resolve.  I was able to walk again by day 4. However, the pain in my leg still is restricting my movement and my ability to stand up and walk again.  I require some assistance to stand from a squat or sitting..

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

I had taken a Benadryl before I went to bed but I still woke up with swollen face which is what happens with some of my drug allergies. The swelling in my face lasted four days during which I took Benadryl every six hours. Four days after the shot I had issues with Herpes. I have never had this before. I had a burning sensation in my genitals and went to visit my doctor the next day. The doctor ran multiple tests and prescribed Valacyclovir 1 gm tablets for 10 days. The symptoms did not resolve until the full course of the medication before I got relief. The results came back Herpes Simplex 1 but I was negative for the antibodies for Herpes Simplex1. I have received the second dose with the normal side effects for two days, joint pain body aches. I was bedridden for two days. My face swelled up again  and lasted a little longer than four days. The swelling was more profound but I had taken Benadryl before I started. My Asthma was a little worse after both vaccines. I had to use it more often for four or five days after vaccination.

Patient was still able to breath and her chest pain has decreased per patient - said pain lessened when sitting down. Ambulance arrived and took patient away.

                                                Pain in the back of the right knee and discomfort in the left knee. It increased in pain level then started to recede right before getting second shot.  After the second shot the pain increased again. Any bending of the joint caused pain.  Also pain traveled up to the groin and down into feet at times.  April 12 went to ER due to added shortness of breath.

I have had hives before that covered my entire body and restricted breathing so I recognize the feeling. I was taking two 24 antihistamines every day and have been ever since.  Since then I have developed new allergies to products with skin rashes. I often have an itchy feeling all over like I am about the break out in hives all over. I have been applying benedryl spray to my new skin reactions. This has been ongoing the last three weeks. I am going to postpone my next vaccine scheduled for April 22. I live alone and am worried I could go into shock. I do not have an epipen at home. I don&#39;t think the current guidance for people with allergies is adequate.

No treatment information mentioned.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Although a temporal association exists, based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Atypical pneumonia and pneumonitis are assessed as unlikely related. The other events are in consistence with the symptoms of Atypical pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, Endometrial cancer and obesity increases the risk of any infection including pneumonia.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exists, based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Atypical pneumonia and pneumonitis are assessed as unlikely related.

In a matter of 3 hours I went to the ER because the swelling, pain and itching was  severe. Pain radiated to my shoulder and below my scaplua.  ER thought I may have a cellulitis stated on Keflex.  On day 8 went back to Walk in because the pain was still there but itching was severe. Started on Prednisone, Vistaril, and Risaquad.   I continue to have pain in my arm, shoulder and back and some itching .  the rash area is discolored brownish and very dry.

Began to have swallowing difficulty. I was getting a woozie feeling within 30 minutes. I took 100mgm benedryl by mouth w about a pint of water. For the next 50-60  minutes, the tightness continued as far as below my collar bones  face very tight swollen. Red raised itchy rash started all over my body.  Had epipen in hand as well as stat dose of prednisone to take if necessary.  (I have an allergic reaction protocol in hand from my doc for these cases. Transport to ER is always there if needed) . Took about an hour for the benedryl to start countering the adverse affect.  Took another 100 mgm at the 4 hr post injection time mark.  By bedtime about 10pm, I felt very fatigued, throat &amp; back of tongue very sore &amp; raw feeling.

I stayed in bed. My oxygen level we t down a bit. I finally took some aspirin and some Tylenol. Five days later I felt better but I feel like I will not get vaccines any longer after that and I may have had some sort of heart inflamation. I am sorry that I did the moderna vaccine. I will be telling my doctors a out this. We will be seeing if my body is damaged. The scariest part was the fast heart beat and it feeling hurtful and hot in my chest. You knew something was happening. I had also felt my heart squeezing on the tenth and eleventh day on the first shot.

I had a fever, 2 degrees above normal.  Then I got severe stomach / intestinal cramps and pain, I had to lay down and hold my stomach for a few hours.  I became inconvenient and it felt like I had a UTI.  Then it rolled into a sore throat, swollen glands on side of my neck with ear pain, and neck pain.  Then it rolled into my chest with bad pain from throat to middle of chest and it was hard to breathe.  By Monday I started to feel better but for the severe pain in the middle of my chest with coughing every time I took a small breath, had to breathe through my mouth.  Tuesday at about 2:30 am I started to breathe again.  I could not sleep for the first 72 hours and had to go to the bathroom every hour to one and a half hours.

                                                Shortness of breath, cough onset Sunday April 4th.  DATE OF SERVICE: 04.06.2021   CT ANGIOGRAPHY, CHEST (CPT=71275); PULMONARY EMBOLUS PROTOCOL; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION  CLINICAL INDICATION: SOB (shortness of breath)  COMPARISON STUDY: 10/9/2020  TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were performed during dynamic contrast enhancement for the  optimization of the opacification of the pulmonary arteries, following IV administration of 80 mL of  Isovue 370. Three-dimensional reformation into the coronal plane was performed.  Automated exposure control and ALARA manual techniques for patient specific dose reduction were  followed while maintaining the necessary diagnostic image quality.  ADVERSE REACTION: None  FINDINGS:  PULMONARY ARTERIES: There is a large filling defect within the right interlobar artery, extending  into the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe. There is expansion of  the right interlobar artery by this thrombus. Small filling defect is noted within the distal left  main pulmonary artery, with some extension to the left upper lobe and left lower lobe lobar  segments.  HEART AND VASCULATURE: The heart is normal size. No pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of  right heart strain.  MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  Heterogeneous densities are seen in the right lower lobe, new since the prior  exam. Scarring is noted in the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well as in the anterior  left lower lobe..  PLEURA: Small right pleural effusion.  CHEST WALL, LOWER NECK, AND AXILLA: Grossly unremarkable.  UPPER ABDOMEN: Grossly unremarkable.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen within the visualized spine.  IMPRESSION  1.  Bilateral PE, with extensive thrombus on the right and minimal thrombus on the left as detailed  above.  2.  Small right pleural effusion and heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation, likely reflecting  pulmonary infarction.

                                                trouble in breathing; congestion; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of DYSPNOEA (trouble in breathing) and NASAL CONGESTION (congestion) in a 72-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 001A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bronchitis and Shortness of breath (SOB). Concurrent medical conditions included Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Smoker.    On 03-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date (reported as few days after vaccination), the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (trouble in breathing) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and NASAL CONGESTION (congestion) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, DYSPNOEA (trouble in breathing) and NASAL CONGESTION (congestion) outcome was unknown.    The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported.  The treatment information included inhaler.   Reporter did not allow further contact.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  However, patient&#39;s prior SOB, being a smoker and underlying bronchitis and COPD may have been contributory.

It did not get to a point of an anaphylactic shock just a mild reaction. I consulted my PCP afterwards regarding the second dose and he said since it was not severe and I was able to take care of it myself, I could get the second one.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.

                                                Patient received vaccine at 2PM. Around 2:20 patient reports she is having some anxiety and difficulty breathing. She has found out her tire on her car is flat and she states that is making her worried. I observed patient and she appears to be shaking but no distress noted in breathing. Blood pressure is checked at 2:32 and was 152/92. Patient now states that she normally takes Xanax three times daily and a blood pressure pill daily and she has not taken these medications today because she was coming for her vaccine. At 2:35 she reports her throat feels like it is swelling. 911 is immediately called. Epinephrine 0.5 mg/0.5 ml is given IM in patients right deltoid at and patient is placed on 4 liters of 02 by nasal cannula at 2:39.  Patient reports at 2:43 that her throat does not feel as tight. Blood pressure is re-checked at 2:44 and is 148/86. Patient states she feeling dizzy, but her throat does not feel like it is closing. Ambulance arrived at 2:50 and resumed care of patient.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen. The patient was seen by physician and then sent to emergency room where it was determined that the patient had DVT in the left leg. A computerized tomogram (CT) scan found clots in the left lung, or saddle PE.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital.  Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking. Main field defaults to possibly related&#39;

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the first COVID vaccine she developed shortness of breath that was much more significant than she had previously. This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don&#39;t think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I&#39;m sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.

Chest felt very heavy and I became lethargic, not able to take a deep breath.  Left work and became a couch potato the rest of the day and evening.   Today symptoms about the same.  Breathing still a problem and although it does not feel good, I am forcing myself to take an occastional deep breath. Did not report to work.

                                                It began with a metallic taste in the back of the throat about 15 minutes after the shot was administered (February 16).  In an hour my tongue and lips were tingling and my throat was swelling slightly.  I called the pharmacy and was advised to take Benadryl.   I took doses at 4:00 and 10:00 PM that day and at 11:00  AM the next day (February 17).  By 3:00 PM I could feel tingling and swelling in my throat, lips and tongue.  I called my primary care doctor.  She told me to take more Benadryl and go to the ER.   She told me not to get the second vaccine.   I went to the ER and they checked me out, observed me and gave me a steroid shot.  The ER doctor also told me not to get the second shot, that the risks would outweigh the benefits.   He gave me a prescription for steroids and an epi-pen.   I still felt some swelling in my throat for about a week.   Since then I?ve been fine.

For next 24 hours I was deathly sick at my stomach.  Dry heaves.  Fever and chills.  Could barely raise my head.  Couldn&#39;t even eat a cracker.  Then my arm started hurting, got big long red knot,hurt down the inside for about a week.  I was sick like this for almost 48 hours.  I was exhausted, so tired.  This lasted for a week.  After the first week, every afternoon I would get exhausted and have to stop and rest.    First shot effected my breathing, causing rapid breathing, like I was anxious.  Had a headache.  My heart beat fast for about 20 hours.  Then all of it stopped.  Several days later I got a round red hot knot that stayed about a week or two and was really sore.

She notes that when staff took her vital, they were concerned because she seemed short of breath. Pt notes that she is overweight and does have dypsnea on exertion at times, but staff were concerned because she had been at rest for some time and they considered the shortness of breath unusual. Pt reports that her blood pressure was normal and her O2 sats were running 97-98% on room air. However, her pulse was 150. An EKG was done and the physician voiced concern over how long her pulse had been elevated. She was transferred to the ED,  where per her report another EKG showed that she was in  atrial flutter. Pt reports that she was treated with IV Cardizem and given and IV bolus of magnesium.  At approximately 4:30pm, a CT with contrast was completed to rule out blood clot or PE. A third EKG done in the ED revealed that she had returned to normal sinus rhythm. She was discharged home at 6:30pm.  Pt reports that she was seen for follow up on 3/20. At that time, her physician ordered repeat labs - CMP, potassium, magnesium, and thyroid - all of which were normal per her report. He changed her medication from baby aspirin 81 mg to Zarelto 20 mg, noting that she is at high risk for stroke. Cardiology has been alerted and she has an ECHO scheduled .

                                                She received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was seen in our office on 3/1/2021. It was administered in her right arm. She said later that day she had itching on her arm, tachycardia, short of breath with wheezing, felt like she could pass out, muscles felt like jelly. She had to use her husband&#39;s supplemental oxygen. Later that night she felt pressure behind her left eye as if it was ready to explode. She felt dizzy When she would try to walk, she would feel so weak that she felt like she could pass out. She then developed a feeling of pressure like an elephant sitting on her neck and her chest. It was hard for her to take a deep breath. Her pulse would sometimes go up to 114. She had headaches. She has felt like she cannot focus or concentrate. She has been using Benadryl 25mg every 4-6 hours since the reaction started. When she goes about 12 hours without the Benadryl she starts to feel short of breath and the chest heaviness again. She was given Depo-Medrol 80mg injection in the office that day. She will continue taking the Benadryl until she is no longer having a reaction.

On April 6th I was admitted because my hemoglobin had drop to 6.9. They had to give me a blood transfusion. They also ran a scope on my upper GI, and I swallowed a camera to see if there was any blood being loss in my GI tract. None was found.  The next test was to get a biopsy of my bone marrow. The results showed that the erythropoietin anti-bodies were destroying my red blood cell. My hemoglobin is still at 7.3 and the shortness of breath is still having it?s toll on me.  I is my believe that the Moderna Covid-19 maybe the cause of my health issues, that I am experiencing. My breathing issues stating after getting the vaccine. I really think this information should be noted in case others may have the same problem. Please know that I had no breathing issue before getting the vaccine.

I  used my rescue inhaler immediately.  I began to vomit and have explosive diarrhea  shortly after that.  Later in the day, my temperature was 102.  I took Tylenol for the fever.   By evening, I had severe stomach pain.  I contemplated going to the emergency room but honestly felt too sick to drive.  I had almost the same reaction the 3 times I attempted to take the flu vaccine.  I did go to the ER  the first time I took the flu vaccine.  Following the COVID vaccine, I had diarrhea for approx. 3 days .  I had loose stools for a week.  I was unable to eat anything but crackers for 4 days and was only able to tolerate soda as a fluid..  It took my stomach 6 weeks to return to normal.  I did not take the second vaccine.  I was concerned it would require me to be hospitalized.

                                                I got the shot at 11:45am and at 11:50-12:20 they had me sit in a chair and wait to see if I have an allergic reaction because of my allergy history. I sat for 30 minutes. At 12:20 the nurse said my face looked red. she took me to another area to take my blood pressure and said my face looked red and blotchy. at 12:25 2 more nurses came back and asked me how I was feeling and I told them my throat was getting scratchy and tight and felt like it was closing off. the inside of my mouth started feeling tingly/prickly and my tongue felt thick. My throat started closing off more and my lips started getting tingly and prickly. I started losing my voice as my throat was getting really constricted and I was getting shaky. At 12:30 a nurse gave me a half dose of epinephrine and called for an ambulance. At 12:40 the ambulance took me to the ER in the city. Then at 12:50 I arrived at the ER and they took me back and hooked me up to BP and O2 monitors and did blood tests. I was there until 3:30 pm that day. My BP was going up and down the whole time and I was very shaky. ER Doctor told me to NOT take the second vaccine dose and prescribed me an EpiPen.

She has a history of DVT and had more swelling and redness in one leg leading to ultrasound to rule out a DVT and labs significant for an elevated D-dimer which then led to a CTA of her chest because of additional complaints of breathlessness.  The ultrasound and CTA were negative for any clots.  She was prescribed furosemide for the swelling.  D-dimer was 2.26 micrograms/mL.  Due to the temporal nature of events, I felt filing a report was necessary.

                                                [03/18/21 ED Report] This is a 74-year-old female who has a history of multiple allergies and angioedema who states she received her second COVID-19 vaccination at 3 PM today.  Patient states that she experienced some mild throat discomfort around an hour later then after dinner she felt like there may be some swelling in the back of her throat so she decided to come in for evaluation of an abundance of caution given her history.  Patient did not take any Benadryl or administer her EpiPen as she is done in the past for allergic reactions with oral swelling.  Of note, the patient was seen here on March 11, 2021 by doctor secondary to right-sided tongue swelling after eating prawns.  At that time, she took Benadryl and administered her EpiPen prior to arrival.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, Benadryl and Pepcid IV symptoms resolved.

Sunday didn&#39;t feel good , cold and then I started coughing, asthma, and none of my usual meds helped.  Late evening Sunday the fever broke, but not the coughing and this continued until Thursday morning. I have a massage therapist friend that thought she could help the lymphatic system with a massage and it did. I saw her again Saturday morning and the cough stopped. Sunday afternoon started a UTI infection and had to get antibiotics on Thursday and still have to get more since it didn&#39;t clear up. In the meantime my whole body ached and when I went to the dentist my BP was elevated.  4/2 I felt the worst of all the days since the shot. On the 3rd started feeling better and yesterday my BP was good and just took it and it up again, but hadn&#39;t been elevated prior to the shot. In fact I felt fairly well prior to the shot. Based on how I&#39;ve felt since the shot I&#39;m electing not to take the 2nd shot.

Hospital course: 74 y.o. female admitted on 4/8/2021 for abdominal pain. Notable PMHx: aortic valve replacement, HTN   On morning of admission, patient woke up with severe epigastric pain.  Describes pain as a pressure.  Has had vomiting.  Had bowel movement after pain started.  Patient came to the emergency room.  Patient received an antiemetic and Demerol.  Patient has continued to have pain in got a dose of morphine as well.  Pain eased some but was still 7/10.  In the ER, blood pressure was very elevated with systolic in 200s.  Cardiac enzymes negative.  EKG look good with normal sinus rhythm.  Patient has aortic valve replacement and is on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.5-3.5.  INR was elevated at 4.3.  D-dimer was negative.  Amylase and lipase negative.  Creatinine normal at 0.9.  Chest x-ray done which showed no acute disease.  On the floor, we ordered a CT abdomen.  It did show gallstones, but nonobstructing.  It showed kidney stones in the renal pelvis, but none obstructing.  No other inflammation or signs of bleeding.  Blood pressure came down after medicines in the ER.  Did have some lower blood pressures through the afternoon evening which was felt to be a combination of blood pressure low in medicines in the ER and pain medication.  From 11:00 p.m. onward blood pressures were controlled.   Patient continued to have severe abdominal pain.  Hemoglobin down to 9.0 from prior 12.4 yesterday.  Creatinine up from 0.9 yesterday to 1.8.  White count up from 8.3 yesterday to 14.4.  INR from 4.3 yesterday to 4.2.  Coumadin was held yesterday.   CT abdomen was repeated. CT abdomen was read as worrisome for necrotic gallbladder and small bile leak Contacted transfer line at hospital.  Surgery accepted and wanted transfer to go through the ER. Patient has PCN allergy.  Surgery said that if reaction was not severe, they wanted Invanz given before she left.  Patient says that she had a itching rash in the 70s.  No trouble breathing or swallowing.  No other reaction.  Dose of Invanz ordered.  IVF were increased.  HPI from hospital: 74 y.o. female who presents with Chief Complaint Patient presents with? Abnormal Scan   Patient presents via EMS as a medical transfer from hospital after having gallbladder necrosis seen on CT imaging.  She was given IV Invanz there.  General surgeon was contacted by that facility and he accepted the patient for transfer to this facility.   Apparently, the patient began having abdominal pain yesterday. Timing of onset was gradual.  Severity is rated as severe at maximum intensity. Quality is described as aching abdominal pain.  Symptoms have been improved after IV pain medicine.  Symptoms worsen with nothing, and improve with IV pain medicine.     History was provided by patient, EMS, transfer paperwork and EMR, and I spoke with treating doctor in general surgery who accepted the patient for transfer.

                                                Patient started having some low-grade chills and aches around 3/2/21.  Her first COVID-19 vaccine was received on 3/1/21, so she was originally attributing these symptoms to the vaccine.  She has had some diarrhea.  Mild headache, muscle aches.  However, she started to develop some dyspnea on exertion and mild cough that is nonproductive.  When she realized her sister was having symptoms of COVID and tested positive and she had had some mild exposures to her, she realizes she might have active COVID infection and was tested positivity on 3/6.  She has had poor appetite and poor oral intake compared to average.  On 3/12, she became weak, fatigued, having diarrhea, and a difficult time urinating, advised to ED by PCP. So, patient was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonitis on 3/12. Received dexamethasone 3/12 to 3/21.  Discharged home on 3/19/21 with supplemental oxygen.

Her oxygen saturation level was found to be in the upper 80&#39;s percentage. Was then taken by ambulance to Hospital and given oxygen. At hospital she was given a blood thinner drip. Also performed CT scan and found blood clots in her lungs. She was released to return home approx 24 hrs later with blood thinner pills (Eliquis) and at-home oxygen generation. These were necessary for approx two weeks until her O2 levels returned to normal without supplemental O2.

Recommended to continue taking b/p medications, and to obtain a pulse oximeter, and oxygen tank depending on blood oxygen reading. If symptoms worsen, contact primary provider. 4/19-Completed follow up call on 4/19/2021 at 10:27am: Pt reports that she feels a little weak (she contribute this to her laying down too much), and feeling lightheaded when she stands up to quickly. Otherwise, pt reports she is feeling much better today (BP 149/71, pulse: 79, blood sugar: 78). Pt states she went to the ER as a percauation, tests were done and she was released the same day she went in. Pt reports she is to follow up with her MD,  and no prescriptions was written from ER. Pt also reported that with both of her shots she had some tenderness in her right arm ~1 hour afterwards, the tenderness went away the next day. Recommend pt to regularly monitor her BP and blood sugar at home, keep a log and bring to her follow up visits with MD. Also recommend pt to make sure to get up slowly from sitting or laying down position, and to hold onto something while standing for approx. 30 sec to a minute to make sure stance is steady enough walk to prevent fall risks since she states she gets lightheaded.

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 75-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD chronically on 2 L of oxygen, hypertension, type 2 diabetes which is diet controlled and oral Metformin controlled, hyperlipidemia, GERD, anemia, past history of PE and DVT diagnosed in January 2021 following COVID-19 infection currently on Eliquis compliant twice daily and kidney stone history who presented with worsening exertional chest tightness and shortness of breath as well as nausea for the past 2 weeks.  Patient reported she got to the point that she was hardly able to walk due to her exertional shortness of breath and chest tightness and needed to be evaluated.  She also reported some nausea as well as some headaches that have come on around a similar timeframe.  She also reported some poor dentition and mild dental pain and has been having a difficult time getting into a dentist due to her Medicaid and lack of coverage.  She has a history of hospitalization from January 30 to February 25 for sepsis secondary to healthcare associated pneumonia and UTI and at that time was treated with vancomycin, azithromycin and cefepime during that hospitalization she was noted to have a new onset left peroneal vein DVT and peripheral PE which was thought secondary to possibly her past history of Covid infection from December 28, 2020.  She was placed on Eliquis twice a day.  During her lengthy hospital from January 30 to February 25 she had bacteremia with Enterococcus and echocardiogram showed a possible pacemaker lead vegetation and therefore her pacemaker was removed on February 12 and she was discharged to rehab for 6 weeks of ampicillin and ceftriaxone which was completed on March 23, 2021.  She was then ultimately discharged home.  She had follow-up with cardiology who felt that she no longer needed to have a pacemaker and it was therefore left out.  She reports she was doing well up until about 2 weeks ago when she began to have the shortness of breath.  She received her COVID-19 vaccines on 3/18 and 4/16.  She reported after the 2nd one on4/16 she was ill with significant fatigue and fever and malaise.  She reports she completely recovered from that but again began having shortness of breath and exertional chest pain 2 weeks ago which prompted her current admission.  She was subsequently admitted to the hospital and ultimately underwent a CTA of the chest when her D-dimer was noted to be elevated at 1800.  CTA of the chest revealed a new left lower lobe pulmonary artery emboli with right heart strain.  She subsequently underwent an echocardiogram which did not reveal any evidence of acute heart strain.  She had a CT venogram of the head and subsequent MRI of the brain which revealed no cavernous vein thrombosis and no acute abnormality other than possible mastoiditis which may be chronic.  The case was reviewed with hematology and her Eliquis was discontinued and she was placed on Lovenox injections twice daily.  She was educated on administering these injections herself.  She will be following up with hematology as an outpatient for close monitoring.  She was also placed on an antibiotic for her dental caries and the mastoiditis as she did complain of the nausea and persistent headache and we arranged dental follow up on dc.  At this time she is felt stable for discharge to home.  She remains with some shortness of breath above her usual baseline but feels that it is getting better each day.  Her O2 sat is 95% on her usual 2 L of oxygen.    Reason for report:new PE of the left lower lobe -radiologist  who reviewed past cta chest from jan and reports that that old small pe is gone and this is a new much larger PE in a different location Sx&#39;s started and worsening the last few weeks pta She has been compliant with her eliquiss twice a day Venous dopplers neg and previous dvt of the L peroneal vein seen 1/30/21 and re imaged on 2/21/21 was also noted to be gone Pt had her 2nd covid 19 vaccine just last month 4/16/21 Current echo shows no R heart strain and nl ef  started on lovenox bid per hematology beta 2 glycoprotein IgG and IgM, antiphospholipid ab&#39;s are negative

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the injection my throat started to swell. It got worse for the next 20 minutes and then stopped getting worse. When I got home and looked in my throat it was all swollen and looked like I had developed a round tissue looking white abscess.  I took Benedryly through the night. My asthma began to flare up to an unusual extent. I  had to take my stronger inhaler which is Dulera for several days. I went to my internist the day after the vaccination and she looked at my throat and said it was all swollen tissue related to the vaccine,  She told me to continue with the inhaler.  Today is 2/6/2021 and my throat feels normal and the abscess thing is getting smaller daily but is still visible.  My asthma symptoms have subsided. I have since had a consult with the physician and he advised that I should not take the 2nd dose.

                                                Rash starting on right cheek of face spreading all over the body except center of back.  Rash was RED, bumpy, itching and stinging was absolutely horrible.  Call Dr. on February 1 and received hydroxyzine 25mg (1 every 6 hrs.) from pharmacy.  Made Dr. apt for Tuesday Feb 2 at 1:30.  Dr. gave steroid shot in right hip and RX for Prednisone for 1/Day.   On Thursday, Feb. 4 I was no better.  Dr. upped dosage from 1 tablet to 2 on both RX&#39;s and added RX for Montelukast to take in the afternoon.  On Saturday, Feb. 6 my throat was closing up and I was seeing dark spots, but did not pass completely.  Medics called and checked vitals determining cause was from dehydration.  I was very tired throughout the course of this rash, itching and stinging.  I began to see a small improvement on Monday, February 8, 2021 with a little improvement each day.  I still have some visual signs of rash on my chest, breasts, and stomach, but the itching is much better and the stinging is gone.  That&#39;s all.

                                                I am a 75 year old female with severe Cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20% and an implanted defibrillator. I had my first COVID vaccine on Sunday, February 28.  I had had sinus problems with a little runny nose the week before...no fever, no chills, normal temperature.  Other than my arm being a little sore, i took two Tylenol the night of the vaccine and had no problems until Tuesday afternoon, March 2, 2021. i felt perfectly Sunday after =noon, all day Monday and Tuesday.  However while shopping at a nearby store as I got to the checkout counter I started having shortness of breath, It was hard for me to walk and I was very shaky.  I have an apple watch so I was able to check my heart rate.  The heart rate was anywhere from 58BPM to 177BPM and all over place in between,  i got in my car, trying to calm myself then called the EMTs.  They took me to hospital to the Emergency Room.  Several tests(see below) were performed.  The final diagnosis was hear palpitations.  They did a COVID test and I did test positive for the Rhino virus.  The doctors didn&#39;t know if my incident was related to receive the COVID vaccine and my defibrillator was checked, and a test was run that indicated it wasn&#39;t bad enough to activate the defibrillator.

No medical history was reported. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 Feb 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided).  On 03 Mar 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, the patient was completely wiped out for a couple of days following the vaccine. She was very tired and out of it. On an unknown date, over the weekend, the patient had difficulty breathing. On 08 Mar 2021, in the morning, the patient was hospitalized for chest pains and difficulty breathing. On the same day lab data revealed that she had blood clots in both of her lungs. On an unknown date, the patient had clots in both legs as well. She was hospitalized for a week and was in rehabilitation being monitored. The reporter also informed that the patient will be hospitalized until 18 Mar 2021 for the clots in both legs. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.   The outcome of the events of difficulty breathing (dyspnoea), chest pains, blood clots in both of her lungs (pulmonary embolism), blood clots in both legs (deep vein thrombosis), tired/ wiped out (fatigue) was unknown.  The reporter did not provide assessment for the events of difficulty breathing (dyspnoea), chest pains, blood clots in both of her lungs (pulmonary embolism), blood clots in both legs (deep vein thrombosis), tired/ wiped out (fatigue).

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Smoker (at least 45 pack years) in January 2020, Anemia, Spinal operation (thoracic upper lumbar spine) and Cholecystectomy. Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy, Pulmonary fibrosis since 2016, Hypertension, GERD (without esophagitis), Chronic kidney disease stage 3 (stage 3b), Interstitial pneumonitis (idiopathic), Centrilobular emphysema, Bronchiectasis and Pancreatic atrophy (fatty atrophy on CT scan chest 04 Mar 2021). Concomitant products included FAMOTIDINE (PEPCID [FAMOTIDINE]) and PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM SESQUIHYDRATE (PROTONIX [PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM SESQUIHYDRATE]) for GERD, CALCIUM CARBONATE, MAGNESIUM CARBONATE (TUMS [CALCIUM CARBONATE;MAGNESIUM CARBONATE]), CALCIUM, VITAMIN D3, CYCLOBENZAPRINE HYDROCHLORIDE (FLEXERIL [CYCLOBENZAPRINE HYDROCHLORIDE]), FUROSEMIDE (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]), SULFAMETHOXAZOLE, TRIMETHOPRIM (BACTRIM DS) and TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE (ULTRAM [TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE]) for an unknown indication.   On 20-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 27-Jan-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening) and CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening). In February 2021, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening) and INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening). On 18-Feb-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps). On 24-Feb-2021, the patient experienced INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening). On 04-Mar-2021, the patient experienced BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening). The patient was hospitalized from 31-Mar-2021 to 06-Apr-2021 due to ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE, BRONCHIECTASIS, CONDITION AGGRAVATED, INFLAMMATION, INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE, PULMONARY FIBROSIS and RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. At the time of the report, PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis), INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere), BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion), INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease) and CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) had not resolved and MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 27-Jan-2021, Computerised tomogram: no sign change (Inconclusive) stable findings of pulmonary fibrosis/chronic interstitial lung disease. On 27-Jan-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 % (normal) 99 room air. On 27-Jan-2021, Pulmonary function test: abnormal (abnormal) moderate reduction in diffusion capacity; forced vital, total lung, and diffusion capacities diminished. On 03-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 95 % (normal) room air. On 04-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) no PE, dramatic worsening of diffuse infiltrates much c/w UIP pattern; bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced. On 05-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 80 % (abnormal) 94 at rest, 80 when ambulating, then 96 when ambulating with O2. On 08-Mar-2021, Echocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) EF 60-65%, RVSP moderately elevated- 45 mmHg, mild MV regurgitation. On 21-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) low lung volumes with reticular opacities both lungs-uncertain if acute pneumonia or chronic fibrotic chnage. On 22-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) increased small pleural effusion and evidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy; overall fibrosis increased. On 23-Mar-2021, Bronchoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) neutrophilic lavage with negative cultures. On 09-Apr-2021, Oxygen saturation: 78 % (Low) 78% Room air 88% on 4L/min O2; 91% on 8L/min. On 14-Apr-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) diffuse interstitial infiltrates, no pleural effusion.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis), INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere), BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease), CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) and MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps).    Patient was seen by physician (MD) (the reporter, a pulmonary specialist) on 27 Jan 2021 with complaint of short of breath with heavy exertion; was chronically breathless going up stairs.  Her pulmonary physiology had been relatively stable over last couple of years.  Impression: Appeared to have worsening restrictive physiology (also reported as slight worsening) in the setting of stable pulmonary fibrosis on imaging.  Then, on 04 Mar 2021, the patient presented with worsened breathlessness of rather acute onset, starting approximately 24 Feb 2021.  Repeat CT scan showed no pulmonary embolism but showed dramatic worsening of her pulmonary parenchyma and then findings suggesting exacerbation of underlying IPF like picture.  The was also a significant change in spirometry.  She was placed on large dose prednisone with transient stabilization but then presented to the emergency room on 21 Mar 2021 very breathless.  No obvious infectious like picture.  She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids.  One more CT scan showed continued abnormalities with again increased ground-glass opacification.  She showed desaturation with limited activity.  The patient was hospitalized for 7 days, then discharged to inpatient rehab for 10 days on prednisone 60 mg.  She improved slightly and was discharged home on 6L of O2 with exertion and 4L at rest.  On 14 Apr 2021, the patient saw MD for follow-up at which time she was breathless with any significant activities and had difficulty getting around.  She was approved for nintedanib therapy for progressive pulmonary fibrosis.  Assessment included acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The events are probably related to the patient&#39;s comorbidities.

She was admitted to the critical care unit from the Emergency Department and was positive for COVID-19, right upper lobe pneumonia, septic shock, and COPD exacerbation.  She received her most recent chemotherapy treatment for lymphoma about one week prior to admission.  She received treatment for pneumonia with vancomycin and meropenem, remdesivir, dexamethasone, albuterol, and pressor support with norepinphrine. As of May 19th, she has improved significantly, but still remains in the critical care unit.

                                                Throat started to close up after 1 hour (took Benadryl which alleviated problem) Cough started next day, lungs still feel a little dry. Biggest problem are my joints, they hurt non stop - my fingers, my toes, my wrists, my knees, my spine - hurt, hurt, hurt. The joints started hurting the day after the shot and have not let up since.  Also have muscle pain in my thighs  which started at the same time as the joint pain. The pain is affecting my ability to go up and down stairs. Suffered from total exhaustion for about 2 weeks. Still get tired easily but not as bad. Taking acetaminophen which is not working.

                                                Pt presented to acute care on 5/21/21 following 2 weeks of SOB, intermittent low grade fever and fatigue.  Labs and chest XR ordered.  Diagnosed with UTI and placed on Omnicef 300 mg BID x 7 days.    Follow up in clinic on 5/24/21 for continuation of symptoms:  SOB, intermittent low grade fever/chills, dry cough.   Pt prescribed albuterol and labs ordered.  Follow up in clinic on 5/26/21 for ongoing SOB, intermittent low grade fever, dry cough, anemia, abnormal liver function.  Ordered ECG 12 lead and sent to emergency department.  Admitted to hospital 5/26/21 :  During hospitalization patient was diuresed with Bumex, she put out a net of approximately 2.4 L and then developed an AKI suggestive of intravascular depletion.  Diuretics were stopped, confirmed that BNP down trended and was within normal range. Patient had negative troponins throughout hospitalization.  Her free T4 and TSH was within normal limits.  She had mild electrolyte disturbances secondary to diuretics which were replaced.  She had a respiratory viral panel completed, did not identify any source.  Patient is Covid negative.  ANA and ANCA screen were sent out unfortunately they will be delayed.  #SVT: Patient went into an SVT rate of 150 required adenosine which showed underlying sinus rhythm.  Started on amiodarone drip briefly which did help maintain sinus rhythm although she had hypotension with that.  Cardiology was consulted during hospitalization.  Despite SVT troponins remain negative.  TSH and free T4 within normal limits.  #Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure #Suspected viral cardiomyopathy #Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Patient remains with good saturation off oxygen.  She is net -2.0 L from diuresis.  Weight is down approximately 4.4 kg.  Started on metoprolol, unfortunately due to hypotension had to decrease the dose to 25 mg daily.  Aspirin 81 mg daily was provided.  Currently holding diuretics but may need to be reassessed for restarting this in the future.  ANA and ANCA pending.  #Leukocytosis #Increase inflammatory markers #Sepsis with organ dysfunction No clear-cut source of infection but she did have pyuria with leukocyte esterase.  She could also have had atypical pneumonia.  The concern is that patient could have an underlying inflammatory process versus autoimmune process contributing to it end organ damage.  At this point I cannot tell so started empiric treatment with ceftriaxone during hospitalization, complete 5 of 7 days course as well as 3 of 3 days of azithromycin.  Despite this leukocyte continues to be elevated and inflammatory markers continue to be elevated.  #Hypertension: Patient was briefly hypotensive in setting of amiodarone, metoprolol continue to 25 mg after discontinuation of amiodarone.  Will need to be retitrate to goal-directed therapy.  #Hypothyroid: TSH and free T4 within normal limits given the tachycardia holding levothyroxine for 5 days  #Suspected UTI Day 5 of 7 of ceftriaxone currently, initially had 50?100 WBCs positive for pyuria, leukocyte esterase positive no bacteria seen.  #Atypical pneumonia suspected: Completed 3 days of azithromycin  #Elevated LFTs #Elevated alk phos: Unclear as to potential source other than congestive hepatopathy LFTs normalized alk phos downtrending  #Anemia of chronic disease: Possible viral syndrome unclear etiology at this point.  There may be some underlying iron deficiency.  No indication for transfusion during this hospitalization. Patient remained on sodium restricted 2 g daily, and 2 L of fluid restriction diet.  She is a full code and enoxaparin was used for DVT prophylaxis. Hospital transfer today, 6/2/2021 to St. Michaels with no clear unifying diagnosis.  Maybe a pericarditis:  Patient continues to have ST changes on EKG, elevated inflammatory markers, significant JVD, evidence of heart failure on echocardiogram, after speaking with cardiology will likely need a right heart cath
