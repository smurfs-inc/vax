After getting the shot, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and drank some water then waited 20 mins. When I left to go back to my department, I started getting dizzy and coughing. I sat down in my department and could not stop coughing so I went to the ER department. My eyes were swollen, I had a rash from my arms and legs all the way down my body. I had hives on my face and my eyes were swollen. I was coughing and wheezing. the ER RN started an IV and I was given steroids, diphenhydramine, ondansetron and IV fluids. I was also given some cough medicine. I was monitored for a few hours and before I left - they gave me hydroxyzine for the hives and itching. The PA also ordered meds for me to take at home.      - per patient report

The patient&#39;s respiratory status declined rapidly. 2 epi pens were administered with no improvement.  A 3rd epi-pen, IM Benadryl and high flow oxygen via non-rebreather were administered/applied. The patient showed a decline exhibiting dyspnea and decerebrate posturing. A 4th epi-pen was administered, after approximately 1-2 minutes the patient began to improve. Care was transferred to EMS and the patient was transported to the local hospital. This event occurred over the course of approximately  20 minutes.

I sat with her and she had progressive tingling, worsening throat tightness and some facial swelling under her eye.  We then moved her to a room and laid her down.  I discussed the use of the Epipen and a dose was given at approximately 400PM.  We also called 911 at that time.  Vitals were taken and EMS arrived and by the time they were taking her away her symptoms were improving.

                                                This facility staff member received her first dose of the MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine (Lot037K20A/EXP 6/22/21) at clinic at approximately 9:15AM on 1/14/21. She initially answered &#34;no&#34; to any allergies on the VAR but revealed to the pharmacist reviewing the VAR that she had experienced an allergy to food and contrast dye that required an epi-pen and hospital attention. She did not offer additional details and explained that she had tolerated other shots (including the 2020 flu shot) without incident. I advised patient to remain for a 30 minute monitoring period post-vaccination due to history of allergic reaction. Patient presented with some anxiety before the shot and immediately started to complain of feeling &#34;sick&#34; and said she was having trouble breathing due to chest pressure. We advised patient to remove her mask and provided her with water and a trash can though no vomiting occurred. After 15-20 minutes, patient still complained of chest pressure and difficulty breathing. When asked if she was experiencing any itchiness or throat swelling, patient said she did feel some throat swelling so she was given 25MG of Benadryl. After an additional 15 minutes, patient&#39;s condition seemed unchanged (not worsening, not improving) so the facility&#39;s nursing team was called to evaluate patient. Patient said she was still experiencing difficulty breathing and throat swelling so nursing advised use of EPI-PEN and patient consented. I administered a dose of 0.3MG (LOT0FM4066/EXP 02/2022) to the right lateral thigh and nurse called for EMS. Immediately after injection, patient&#39;s eyes fluttered and she seemed to be on the verge of fainting. Nursing checked her oxygen saturation which was 100%. Patient reported no improvement after 5 minutes so another EPI-PEN 0.3MG was administered to the left lateral thigh. Nursing also gave the patient 81MG chewable aspirin due to the patient experiencing a stroke last month. EMS arrived a few minutes after the second EPI-PEN dose and patient was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Facility reported that patient went home that afternoon but did not provide details. Based on my assessment of patient&#39;s symptoms and behavior, I feel it is likely that she experienced either an acute panic attack or anaphylaxis due to vaccine administration. I called the patient today (the day after the incident) and she confirms that she received treatment for an anaphylactic reaction to the Moderna COVID shot and is doing well without any lasting adverse effects.

Then, Saturday the 16th, a tickle in my chest.. soon produced a dry cough in relief/response to the tickle. Next day, I was hoarse (Sunday the 17th). Still hoarse. Sore throat off and on. Headache. Body aches. Incredible arthritis-like ache at the tops of my shoulders, upper back, and neck. Runny nose. Spitting mucous - was clear, now some thick solid white. Chest pain in the middle that comes and goes. Chest pain on left center side - it feels like in the area of my heart. Ache in my lower left side. Today, aching in my jaws mostly left side, but both. Ache on upper right front (lung area?). INCREDIBLY tired. It&#39;s so hard to stay awake.

                                                I waited the 15 min at the clinic and felt okay. As I got a few minutes down the road (at about 4:00) my lips began to feel tingly this then spread to my teeth and face. I could feel my throat begin to tighten. At that point I call the clinic and they suggested I go to ER to get looked at.  Got to ER and Tingling and numbness continued, throat had started to loosen up some but felt thick and heavy. I also had a headache that was more like pressure all over then stabbing and my teeth and jaw ached. Doctor saw me between 4:30 and 5 sometime gave me diphenhydrAMINE 50 mg by mouth, famotidine 20 mg by mouth and dexamethasone 10 mg by mouth.  By 5:45 symptoms were dissipating and I started to feel more normal. By 6:45 I felt much better (just very fatigued from the medications and slight headache still), and was discharged from E.R. sometime a little after 7. Through the night I had headache and hot flashes. Next morning some face swelling  and tongue swelling still as well as tightness in throat (mild) continue to take Benadryl as suggested by E.R. doctor.

                                                Patient started as having distress and hyperventilating. Patient was breathing and able to take 50 mg of diphenhydramine. Progressed some and patient used inhaler. Patient developed flushing/warmth to face and neck pain. On pulse oximetry O2 was 98% to 99%. BP was in low 140s and 100s. Patient began having chills and BP was read as 98 over 42 (possibly a bad read). Chills persisted and became worse. Inhaler was used again. The patient began to become harder to keep conscious. The patient&#39;s chills became worse, began to complain of bilateral arm pain. A BP reading occurred at some point prior that read back in the 140&#39;s; however, after this reading the pulse oximeter failed to read on multiple fingers, another individual was unable to find a pulse multiple times, and the patient grasped at their chest in the universal for need air. This was the point at which an epi was administered. The patient seemed to improve a bit as EMT arrived at the scene. Patient was still having chills.

                                                Went out to car around 25 min after with only mild throat discomfort.  Shortly after, was having difficulty swallowing, felt dizzy &amp; face swelling.  Took quick release (dissolve under tongue) prednisolone 20 mg (have for peanut allergy).  Symptoms didn&#39;t initially improve, used albuetrol inhaler and returned to hospital.  Swelling symptoms started feeling better.  Blood pressure when first checked was very high, still at 170/118 at 21:54.  Sent to ED.  Wheezing and constant throat clearing in ED, used inhaler again &amp; symptoms improved.  BP still high for me at 138/80 at 21:54 with patchy confluent erythema over anterior chest that blanches, non-pruritic &amp; 3-4 hives on abdomen.  Given Benadryl 50 mg, famotidine 50 mg &amp; dexamethasone 10 mg at 22:22.  At 23:09, chest rash resolved, but pruritis &amp; mild urticaria to back and arms.  At 23:41, urticartia resolved &amp; discharged.  After second dose of Decadron was delayed the following day, itchy hives returned on chest, stomach, back and left shoulder.  Same occurred on the 3rd day, along with wheezing (resolved by other meds &amp; inhaler) and more steroids were prescribed.  This resolved the remaining symptoms.

Each episode lasted under a minute This happened on and off it for about 30 minutes.  Each time it happened it was not as bad as the time prior.  I was dizzy when I tried to stand up and I sat and was monitored for an hour.  They administered  Benadryl.   I have some edema on my upper chest when I got home.  I was super tired too. The next day still the edema and I have a sore throat .   I explained the best I could to the pharmacist when it was happening .  I refused to get EMT because it was not constant and it was getting less intense each time.

It progressed to a panic attack with uncontrollable crying and breathing issues for ~5-10 minutes. I was able to calm down, but continued to feel horrible all night. I threw up twice about an hour later. Muscle aches in both my shoulders (far worse in the one I got the injection in), back, buttocks, hips, and feet all night that kept me from being able to sleep. Ongoing nausea, headache, and fatigue all morning. Mostly has resolved now (2 pm) aside from fatigue.

The medics did nothing for me as I am allergic to albuterol. After I felt like I could breathe properly, I went back to work and took some allergy medicine to help stop my reactions. It took four hours for the reactions to subside.

                                                I received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 2/8/21 around 11:30 am in my right deltoid. That same evening I had only pain at the injection site. When I woke up the following morning on 2/9/21, I had complete body fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and a migraine headache. The following morning, on 2/10/21, when I woke up at 5:00 am for work I had a sore throat. The sore throat rapidly progressed from mild to moderate pain. My sore throat persisted and worsening into the following day. On 2/11/21 my sore throat was still progressively getting worse so I had a co-worker (my charge nurse) inspect my mouth/throat. She told me it was swollen, red and spots on my throat/top of mouth. I left work and went to Urgent Care (on 2/11/21). They ordered a rapid beta strep test which came back negative. After evaluation, the doctor mentioned my throat being red, swollen and lymph nodes enlarged. He thought it was viral versus and an upper respiratory infection. I was not prescribed any medication when I was discharged. Over the next 2 days my sore throat worsened to the point of having severe pain, difficulties swallowing and talking, grossly enlarged lymph nodes, swollen and red tonsils, spots on the top of my mouth and throat, and pain in my ears, stiff neck, constant headache. I returned to Urgent Care on 2/14/21 at 9:00 am. The doctor ordered another rapid beta strep test which came back negative again. Upon inspection, the doctor quickly diagnosed me with peritonsillar abscesses (left greater than right). I was prescribed an antibiotic and a steroid pack. I have an appointment to follow up with an ENT (Ear, Nose and Throat) doctor in one week to ensure it is healing. Prior to this second vaccine dose, I was completely healthy. No illness. Not around anyone who was likely sick. I have never had an issue or illness related to my tonsils in my entire life. Since tonsils are a part of our body&#39;s immune system, I believe the vaccine triggered this adverse reaction (peritonsillar abscesses) I experienced.

                                                5 am - sore arm - a little swollen. That evening of the second day at about 7 pm - I had body aches and a low grade fever.  The third day, I felt back to normal and my arm was back to normal. The following week, the day after I tested positive for COVID, so that was January 7th. The arm was itchy and burny. It had a big rash on that area. (January 6 My upper back was hurting really bad and I had a fever. I wasn&#39;t feeling good at all. Had shortness of breath. So I went for a COVID test.) The rash lasted for about 48 hours and then it was gone. I didn&#39;t take anything for it. My other COVID symptoms lasted for about 6 days. I still didn&#39;t have taste though. I got that back on about day 10. I had the shortness of breath (feeling out of breath) which lasted a week and a half longer than when I felt better from the other COVID symptoms.  I treated COVID symptoms with VIT C; Vit D3 and tylenol.

I was able to stop my own fall due to a wall being next to me, and I stooped down close to the floor so as to prevent a fall. I then was able to walk about 20 feet to an office where I could sit and the dizziness continued. I noticed I was shaking and heartrate was elevated (that could have been the anxiety caused by the dizziness and being unable to walk straight). I sat for a total of 30 minutes before I walked to my office, which is a couple minute walk. I continued to have dizzy spells (not as severe) while sitting in my office for a few more hours. Also, I&#39;m having a hard time focusing, feel dazed.

I got up to go to the bathroom and became extremely dizzy and my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest.  I was having difficulty breathing  and felt disorientated.  I crawled up the stairs and when I reached the top I stood up to walk and promptly fainted/passed out.  According to my husband I was out for roughly 30 seconds.  He described my body as completely tense (formed fists, shaking). I don&#39;t have any recollection of passing out.  When I came to I was overwhelmed with nausea and immediately vomited.  I was sweating profusely and struggling to breath.  After I vomited, within minutes (less than three) I felt fine.  My heart rate returned to normal and I wasn&#39;t dizzy or nauseous.

By 7 pm on the same day the cramping and back pain was substantially worst and it progressed through the week. I was unable to move, walk, sit or take a deep breath on Wednesday March 10th due to the pain. On Monday March 8th and Tuesday the 9th, I awoke and my insides hurt.  Today that pain from my insides hurting returned as well as the back pain  and the abdominal cramping.    I have contacted my primary and have yet to hear back.

I was unable to stand up, so I crawled to the bathroom.  I couldn&#39;t catch my breath and my heart was racing.  I wanted to get my phone off of the counter and call for help, but I was too confused and too dizzy to get it.  I felt like I couldn&#39;t control my body.  My left arm was hurting really bad during this.  I am not sure if I fell asleep or laid there awake, but I couldn&#39;t get myself up and start making sense of things until 4 am.  I did not have any other episodes similar to this, but I did feel really tired and weak for two days.  My arm hurt really bad around injection site and through my shoulder blade for 3 days.  My symptoms are all improving now.  Just a slightly sore arm.

It did not get worse after being there under observation for 35 more minutes. I was able to swallow and breathe ok, nurse checked on me every 10 minutes or so. No need to take any medication as it was slight and I wasn&#39;t sure if it was anxiety or the start of an anaphylaxis reaction. The swelling was gone by 9:30a, and then it reappeared that evening and was more intense, around 4:40p. It did not get worse, and was gone by 5:30a the next morning (3/25/2021).

I used my epi-pen and then went to the ER where I was given prednisone and antihistamines.  The following day I was still having trouble breathing, tightness in my chest, wheezing, trouble walking due to not being able to breathe and symptoms persisted. I went to urgent care where I was given a prednisone booster and was sent back to the ER.  ER observed me and sent me back home.  I went back to urgent care and was prescribed higher dose of prednisone and singular.  One week later,  I still had trouble breathing, coughing, and tightness in my chest, my doctor prescribed albuterol solution with nebulized to use 4xs a day. 2 weeks later symptoms worsened when I started walking more and was prescribed another round of prednisone and continue albuterol.  Currently, 7 weeks later, my asthma has not gotten better, still wheezing, coughing, unable to walk without struggling to breathe.  My doctor has now referred me to a pulmonoligist.

Patient reports that shortly after receiving her vaccine in her left arm she developed the sensation of her throat closing and a &#34;film &#34;in the back of her throat.  Patient has also reported feeling nauseated and having a throat clearing cough.  No chest pain, headache, abdominal pain or development of a rash.  Injection site appears to be unremarkable. Patient is given some antihistamine medications as well as steroids and observed here in the ED.  The patient has improvement in her sensation of her throat closing and is able to be discharged.  I discussed with the patient the usefulness of continued antihistamines over the course of the next few days and would likely advise on not receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine based on her reaction to the first.  Discussed with the patient the use of epinephrine and EpiPen as needed.  See discharge instructions.  Patient is discharged home with her sister in improved condition.

I felt mild pain in my arm in the evening of the 31st and then the pain started from my elbow to my neck on my right side. I went to sleep and woke up with general malaise, chills, body ache, sore throat, headache. the same feeling I had when I had covid, a heaviness in my chest, almost like a shortness of breathe. I was flushed and felt feverish although I never had a fever. The symptoms lasted all day.  On the first also my arm pain was severe, I could not even lift it the whole day. I went to sleep on 01/01 and when I woke up on 01/02 the symptoms were all gone. I took Tylenol 3 times to help me with the symptoms. 3 grams total in 24 hrs.

                                                I received the injection around 2:15 pm.  There were no immediate effects. By late afternoon/early evening, my arm was a bit sore and later started to feel warm near the injection site.  However, I otherwise felt fine.  At 9 pm, I suddenly became very dizzy and passed out for several minutes. When I regained consciousness, I felt a little short of breath, which resolved within 20 minutes or so. However, I was also extremely nauseous, which got worse any time I tried to move. This continued for several hours.  I also alternated between being very warm and chills during this time - it was like waves of heat. I did not have a fever. Later, my head began to hurt and I took tylenol to help with that. I also had diarrhea. These symptoms began to gradually lessen after a couple of hours and I was able to fall asleep around 12:30 pm. I woke up hot and sweaty several times throughout the night. The following day, 1/6, I was very tired and had a headache and could not eat much, but otherwise felt much better.

                                                I received the vaccine at 12:59 pm and at 1:05 pm my heart began to beat rapidly. I felt heat rush into the left side of my head, I was extremely light headed and couldn?t catch my breath. I asked if there was a nurse that could help me. There was 1 paramedic watching everyone. I stepped outside, took my mask off to catch my breath. One staff member accompanied me and sat next to me. I began to shake in my legs and arms involuntarily, my heart kept beating and I just tried to do deep breathing techniques to catch my breath.  The paramedic came outside and asked if I wanted help. I declined his help and I called my husband who was sitting in the car to help me walk to our car. At 1:15, my heart was beating less rapid, I walked back to the car and as my husband was driving us home, my heart began to beat rapidly again, I felt burning and heat in my head and I began to shake in my arms and legs. It lasted about 10-15 minutes. We got home and I could barely walk into the house because I was so weak in my legs. I went to bed where my heart began beating back to normal after 1 hour or so.

                                                Right at the 15 minute mark I developed a full body sense of warmth followed by tremors and my HR rose from 70 to 138 very rapidly.  My mom was on the phone with me and stated I didn?t quite know what I was saying to her and she became worried.  The RN came by asking how I felt and I told her I was jittery and decided to wait at the site a few more minutes.  The sensation passed after about 3-4 minutes and then I felt ok.  I drove home and showered.  The rest of the night I would get random bouts of tachycardia and felt overall not well.  Also a small amount of chest tightness.  I also noticed things such as climbing by stairs cause me to become winded very fast and my HR would elevate rapidly.  Today I woke up and am feeling almost normal. HR has not been elevated but when I ate I did notice a small amount of lightheadedness.

I proceeded not to feel well they?re very next day. Then on Friday I was dizzy and a coworker said that I was flushed and I wasn?t feeling well. I proceeded to go see patients and while examining a patient I became very dizzy and lightheaded while bent over and almost passed out when I came up.. at that time I decided to leave work and go to my PCP. Orthostatic?s were positive and EKG showed normal sinus rhythm and an echo is ordered. Echo was normal. Throughout the week I continued to have tachycardia and shortness of breath with any type of exertion. I left work this morning and was tested for Covid because of my symptoms.

                                                I waited 15minutes at the facility and then began walking home. Approximately 30minutes after receiving the injection, my throat started swelling a bit and the back of my tongue seemed to swell, too. It was very hard to swallow. I removed my Covid mask and continued to breathe normally. Approximately 40 minutes after receiving the injection, I took 2 Benadryl tablets. The throat swelling eased but it was still much more difficult to swallow than usual. About 4 hours after my first dose of Benadryl, I took 1 more tablet of Benadryl. I fell asleep and woke up feeling completely normal with normal swallowing. Note: at no time did I have a rash, I did not wheeze, and my blood pressure and heart rate seemed normal. I have no history of allergic reactions beyond possibly reacting to penicillin when I was age 2.

The following day I continued having some dizziness, headache, nausea, shortness of breath. Mon. 1/11-Thurs. 1/14 I had splitting headaches and nausea. I developed a rash on my arm at the site of the injection at some point, unsure when. The rash wasn&#39;t noticed until Sunday 1/17 and still remains today, 1/18.

                                                Within first 15 min my throat started to feel like it was closing up. My tongue also felt like it going towards the back of my throat and I was dizzy/lightheaded. It lasted. About 5/7 min. It felt like was easing up so the school nurse told me wait an additional 15 min to be sure I was ok. She also took my blood pressure and said was normal. Dr. a pharmacist brought me orange juice a d said maybe was just low blood sugar. I said it felt similar to when my epidural during last delivery was up too high and my throat closed up and I couldn?t breathe.  About ten min later it began again.  I tried to get up and walk around some and I felt a little better at first but then started to get significantly worse. I felt like I was struggling to breathe and tongue was swollen feeling and stuck to back of mouth as if it was paralyzed.  I say back down and my blood pressure was high (just told bottom number was 106). I was moved to another room to lie down and pharmacist mentioned using epi pen or benedryl shot. I had to sit up and almost passed out. I was having difficulty breathing. Not because of my lungs but my throat and tongue seemed frozen. He decided to give me a 25 mg Benadryl shot but had me drink it. It had a horrible bitter taste and made my throat and tongue numb. At this point it was about 12:30. My administrator called a coworker to drive me home. I decided to leave about 29 min after I had the benedryl.  I could still feel that my throat was somewhat tight but it had improved enough that I didn?t think I was in danger of not being to breathe again. I went home (15 min drive) and by then my throat felt a lot tighter. I took 25 mg more of benedryl and it felt better. About four hours later it became tight again and I took 50 mg of benedryl. Through out all this I had severe pain at site of injection in my left arm, dizziness, nausea, and headache.

                                                Shot 1 given Dec 29 in the morning. I had no symptoms. I got very sick at about 4:30pm Symptoms: muscle aches, chills, fever, headache, SOB, chest pain, sore throat, cough. I ended in the ED because I couldn?t manage my asthma and my HR was high on Wed. I was diagnosed with Covid as I found out my husband gave it to me. Then a couple days later my asthma got worse and I ended up in the ED overnight. They were able to get better management in my Asthma.  I was sick for 3 weeks. Went back to work week four 1/25 Monday and 1/27 they cleared me to get the second dosage of the vaccine. I got the vaccine 3:20 pm and at 5:00 I walked my son in Kung Fu and then waited in my car. I ended up passing out in my car at approx 5:15 pm and my 8 year old son knew something was wrong and had to wake me up.  I could barely drive home I felt very drunk. When I got home my temp spikes to 101.3. I had extreme muscle pain, fatigue, chills, sore throat, chest pain, cough, SOB. My left arm swelled up where I was injected and I couldn?t move my arm. I was told I couldn?t take anything tylonel or Ibuprofen for 8 hours. I suffered. Even when I could take something my body was very painful. This lasted  wed, thurs, and Friday morning.

She was assisted to the ground in a supine position and given one EpiPen injection, with subsequent improvement of her symptoms. Upon arrival to ED, she does endorse some diffuse itching over her body, but airway is asymptomatic. She denies taking Benadryl, Zyrtec, or any other antihistamines today.  o Of note, on the day of her first vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, she had gradually developed symptoms including severe fatigue, muscle aches, and headache. The following day, she also developed increased redness, hives, and similar itching to her presentation today, which she describes feeling like &#34;bugs crawling inside.&#34; She subsequently had a virtual visit with her PCP on 1/7, who prescribed her an EpiPen and Zyrtec. She has had resolution of these symptoms and has had no other complaints since.

                                                Around 10am today I started having chest tightness and pain, some shortness of breath. It was constant and every time I got up to walk around my BPM (on my Fitbit) went up to about 120. I am normally around  70 and even when sitting still it was 80-95. I went to urgent care around 1 and saw Dr. They checked my blood pressure several times and it was between 118-126/84 (normal for me is about 105/70).  They did a PCR test for COVID but later called to tell me the sample was mislabeled. In the meantime I went to a rapid testing site and got an antigen test that was negative.  Dr opinion was that the reaction was most likely an immune response to the vaccine.  He said I should go in if symptoms last longer than 1-2 more days or if they get worse.  They said I could repeat the PCR test if I needed to be seen again but felt pretty confident about the antigen test results. I am still having the same symptoms tonight, the same severity.  I have no other symptoms of COVID and did not have any other vaccine side effects besides expected/mild ones. I had  a little shortness of breath last night before bed but the chest pain didn?t start until today. I?ve gotten all scheduled vaccines throughout my life plus some for travel and have never had a reaction. I have never had anything like this chest pain and have no history of heart issues.

I used my inhaler and was fine.

                                                Patient was seen in office today to receive the first dose of her Covid vaccination, Approximately 2 to 3 minutes after receiving her dose she began feeling hot all over her body and began feeling swelling and irritation to her neck and throat. Patient was brought back at that time for me to evaluate and was found to have urticaria and erythema from her chest up to her neck and into her face. There was no tongue swelling or dyspnea noted upon initial exam. The patient was initially given 50 mg of p.o. liquid Benadryl. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving Benadryl the patient began stating that she felt as though she could not breathe and became panicking while having rapid and shallow respirations. At that time 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered into the patient&#39;s left thigh and EMS was called. While awaiting the arrival of EMS the patient began feeling significantly better, was able to speak in full sentences, and the rash begin to diminish. EMS transported the patient to the emergency department for further evaluation and treatment.

                                                As soon as I received the vaccine it felt like I drank a hot alcoholic shot, my throat was thickening and hard to swallow, tingling and numbness on my face I felt hot inside and cold shivering, I was a little out of it, very tired nauseus and I had a really hard time swallowing saliva, 30 mins later I had no feeling in my face, my lips felt huge like I had just had novacaine, my eye felt like it was drooping, I went to employee health I was given Benadryl and I took it for two days and one day I did not take the Benadryl and my face started drooping all over again so I took Benadryl and it went back to normal. I was advised not to get the second vaccine. I fully recovered.

                                                Chills began within 2 hours of injection.  Fever rose to 101 within 6 hours and lasted for approximately 48 hours.  Chills lasted the entire time the fever lasted.  After the fever came down to below 100, bodyache became more recognizable.  Most unusual pain, which began while the temperature was above 100, was in the muscles connecting my neck to the shoulders, more severely on the left-side where the injection was administered.  The pain was so severe that it felt the muscle was tense, numb and itchy at the same time. The severity of the pain made it feel like the throat was closing up even though I knew it was not true because I did not have trouble breathing.  This pain lasted (in similar intensity) approximately about 36 hours. After this, on the third day, most of the pain was gone but I experienced dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea.  I had a loss of appetite the whole time (over 72 hours) I was experiencing these side effect symptoms.

Saturday 2/20, 24 hours after getting the vaccine my tongue started to swell up/ was splotchy/ had bumps allong the side and my throat was scratchy. My breathing/asthma was also triggered and I increased use of my albuterol.  I took benadryl with minimum results, but symptoms did not get severe enough to go to the ER.   The next day, Sunday 2/21 my tongue was still swollen and my jaw/ face were also sore and had inflammation. This was in addition to the sore arm/joints.

During her drive home (about 30 -40 min post vaccination) she noticed her throat felt full and kept trying to clear it.  She tried drinking but this did not ease the reaction.  She called her MD but was sent to local ER which was closer.  She denied any SOB, fever, rash, itching, HA, swelling to throat, tongue or body, and had no dizziness, GI distress or other systemic reactions.   She presented to a specific hospital and was treated with epi pen, IV benadryl, solumedrol and pepcid and released on 5 day predinisone taper

                                                I do not have a peanut allergy but I did eat waffles topped with peanut butter for breakfast that morning. About 30 minuets after eating the waffles I started to feel sick to my stomach, both like nausea and also having to have a bowel movement. I went to lie down in bed and after about 15 minuets my heart began to race and I felt very hot. I got up to get my pulse oximeter and noticed my face was very red and I had red blotches down my neck, chest and shoulders. My pulse was at 120 so I laid back down for a few minuets. I felt like I needed to have a BM so got back up to go to the toilet when I saw the hives were now down my arms to my wrists so I took 1 Benadryl 25 mg. I still did not have a BM or vomit. My chest began to have tightness and pressure and I felt short of breath. I was home alone and was feeling very scared. I took 2 aspirin 325 mg each. I unlocked the front door and got my daughter&#39;s Epi-Pen Jr. 0.15 mg. I waited a few minuets yet and began to sweat heavily, I was feeling cold and like I was going to faint. I gave myself the Epi-Pen Jr and called 911 around 11:50 AM.   I never lost consciousness thankfully. EMS arrived and gave me another 25 mg of Benadryl IM in my left arm and they started me on fluids. I received a prednisone and pepcid shots at the hospital.

Advised to continue taking the benedryl and the other antihistimine for an additional week.  I was really sick and nonfunctioning sick for about 2 weeks after and I still have respiratory issues that comes and goes periodically to date.

I felt my chest and throat closing up on me. Every once in awhile I get an itchy spot where the first dose vaccine was injected. I did not get my 2nd dose vaccine due to my first dose symptoms.

About two minutes after that, I developed a bitter taste on my tongue that later spread to the rest of my mouth. Several minutes later, my lips began to tingle and swell, then my mouth (i.e. my soft palette) began to swell as well. About forty minutes after I received the vaccine, I began developing shortness of breath and spiked a fever.  The on-site doctor administered an Epipen and I was transported to the ER. While at the hospital I had a blood drawn, a COVID test, a chest X-ray, and multiple EKGs performed. I was discharged about 2.5 hours later.

I waited 30 minutes and was able to leave to take a Benadryl for the swelling. 15 minutes later I coughed a couple of times and then felt my throat constrict and had a hard time swallowing. My breathing became labored so I used my emergency inhaler and while trying to use my inhaler I started coughing and could not stop. Hard coughing. I work at a school that has a nurse on site and she helped the front office stabilize me after 30 minutes of coughing and not being able to swallow well. My pulse ox got down to 90 with a pulse of 122. I had a rash covering my throat and chest. I did take a Benadryl as well. An ambulance was called but by the time they got there the coughing was slowing down and my throat was opening back up. I was sent home to rest.

                                                About 45 minutes after receiving my vaccine I started feeling a tightness in my throat. I then became lightheaded and shakey. I was driving so I pulled over and called 911 who transported me to Hospital. The tightness and pressure moved down to my upper chest area also and my hands were tingling. I was given benadryl, pepcid and prednisone at the ER. About 30 minutes later I was feeling much better except for a scratchy throat. I was sent home where I slept the majority of the rest of the day. The next day I woke up with a very sore arm, very tired and a headache. Today the injection site is still a little sore and I have a headache.

                                                Within minutes after the vaccine I noticed my arm swollen and my fingers started swelling as well. It was moderate swelling though. the injection site swollen up and it was hard for me to breathe as well. Not sure if it was the shot itself or if I was just nervous, anxious about receiving the shot. I received the 1st dose on 01/13/21 and I was supposed to receive the second one on 02/10/21 and because I had a flare up on my face, my face swollen up around 01/21 - 01/24, and I found out that I had the infection on my gums and had to get the teeth extracted. It seems that after receiving the vaccine my overall health that is not at the best just got worse. I could not stand for a long period of time, it aggravated things that were already going on with my system.  It affected my uterus, I already have bleeding issues but now I have very heavy periods since the vaccine. And they are lasting longer. I also had a lot of pain at the injection site and also a severe headache.  I also am now battling 2 different kinds of yeast infection that are resistant to the meds given to me.

I?m now allergic to soy, yeast, wheat, coffee, casein (dairy) peanuts, green beans/ legumes, eggs, onion and celery. I?ve had a huge rash that broke out on my left arm that started at the spot where I received the injection.  Now I?ve been experiencing my mouth and tongue swelling to the point that my throat has closed up. I?ve been hospitalized as air wasn?t going through my body. I had to inject an Epi-pen in my leg, and be taken to the hospital. I?m currently on high dosage prednisone, Benadryl and several other meds to address the swelling in my tongue that happens daily. I am desperate to find out if there is anyway to stabilize anything that vaccine had in it to see if this condition will get better.

Woke up March 7th with swollen lips/throat/tongue. went to urgent care and received an EpiPen and steroid. Monitored for a couple of hrs and went home for a nap. (refused the ER at this time as I felt better). Woke up around 2:30 and my symptoms worsened . We to ER and received another Epipen for anaphylactic shock. Remained at the hospital for 5 days. Had 5 episodes while there. Also, had tightening in chest and what felt like a heart attack. Been resting, still very tired and swollen nodes in my neck and sore throat as well as aches. Also, might be developing thrush. Didn&#39;t run a fever and Ive never had an allergic reaction  before this.

                                                The day after my vaccination I woke up with horrible bone pain like my bones were breaking.  Intense dizziness and shortness of breath when getting up and moving around.  Muscle pain would come and go all day long. On the second day, the bone pain has lightened up but still very tired and running a fever on and off.  I then felt a lymph node the size of a lemon in my left armpit.  I couldn&#39;t put my arm down because of the size of it.  This was 12 hours ago.  The lymph node has shrunk a small amount, but I am still having dizziness, weakness, and body aches.

Initially, pt experienced palpitations and tightness in throat after vaccination  and wasn&#39;t sure if she was experiencing swelling in her arms.  BP was 130/79 and HR 93 initially.  Pt started to feel better without intervention but given diphenhydramine as a precaution while we continued to monitor her.  10 mins later she started to have tingling in lips and tongue and visible lip swelling  in addition to palpitations.   Immediately administered Epipen (0.3mg) x 1.  EMS was called.  No worsening but not improvement after 5 mins so a second dose of Epipen (0.3mg) was administered.  By the time EMS arrived (9 mins after first epipen dose) pt was feeling better, swelling had resolved, no throat tightness.  Pt was transported to local hospital by EMS for monitoring.

                                                1/7/21: injection site started to turn red, swell, itch and was hot ~12 pm; by 7 pm redness had extended to apx. 3 in. wide by 2 in. high; also I had extreme pain in my back between my shoulder blades and had a hard time breathing. These symptoms persisted until 1/10/21; on 1/10/21 the redness turned from swollen and smooth to not swollen and bumpy - rash like. By 1/12/21 the swelling had gone away, but the rash had turned red and spread to more area on my arm. The rash reached its full size on 1/14/21 of apx. 6 in. wide by 4 in. high making a &#34;box&#34; like shape with a circle (apx. 2 in dia.)inside of the rash box; I was still having a hard time breathing; I saw the Dr. on 1/13/21 and was diagnosed with respirator infection. He prescribed antibiotics and prednisone. I felt better by 1/18/21, but then started having more back pain. Went back to the Dr. and was told I was having severe muscle spasms possibly due to the respiratory infection; was prescribed a muscle relaxer. The (1st ) doctor did not feel the symptoms I experienced were due to the vaccination, but all of the symptoms started as soon as my injection site started to have a reactions. I finally felt better without medication on 1/29/21. I received my second shot on 2/2/21 and had normal symptoms the day after (body aches, fever, chills, fatigue). Thank you! :)

                                                Sore arm all day. Woke up at 1am extremely nauseated, headache, and in sweats. Went to kitchen to get some nausea meds and felt my ears closing. I couldn?t breathe and apparently passed out. My husband called 911 and I came in and out for about 30 min he said. I couldn?t open my eyes and couldn?t feel my legs. Bp was normal and so was blood glucose. They gave me some fluids and nausea meds and I started coming too. Today I am extremely achy and terrible headache, scared to get out of bed.

After the second dose all my muscles seized up and I had fever, chills, overnight sweats, I had waves of nausea and a terrible headache. I am still nauseous 2 weeks later. I am taking anti nausea meds and drinking ginger teas. Any injury I have ever had like broken bones or torn rotator cuffs have all started hurting so incredibly bad. I also had a COPD flare up.

I immediately took 2 Benadryl tablets.  I called my best friend who is a nurse and is volunteering at Covid Vaccine sites.  She advised me to go park outside my local urgent care in case my symptoms worsened and I needed quick access to an epi-pen, etc.  I drove to the Urgent Care.  I continued to feel that my throat was constricted and could only swallow if I was drinking water through a straw.  I could not swallow on demmand.  I sat outside urgent care for an hour and my symtoms stayed the same for 35 min and then by 60 minutes I felt much better and could swallow without drinking water.

I wanted to share this information in case  someone needed to know. I figured out that this occurred after I took the Metoprolol and Flecainide when I woke up and before I had anything to eat or drink (besides a sip of water).

Transportation to hospital refused due to lack of health insurance.  Other symptoms began the next evening.  Six days later, as I complete this form, the symptoms have improved.  The fever is gone.  The muscle soreness is gone except in the arm that received the injection.  The shortness of breath has improved.  It was really quite concerning.  It is still present but to a lesser degree.  The fatigue is somewhat better but still very much an issue.  There is no appropriate field below regarding the outcome because after only approximately one week, I am expecting that the remaining issues will resolve.  Since I was not hospitalized and did not die, I will mark &#39;Disability or Permanent Damage&#39; since I definitely can not currently do many of the things I normally do, however, I expect to recover those abilities.

                                                The next morning after I had trouble getting up.  I was achy and had a 99.7 fever.  Took tylenol and rested.  A few hours later the symptoms got worse and worse an my body  ached so bad I could barely walk.  The fever elevated as high as 103 during that time.  And I had what felt like pressure on my neck which made my voice sounded really rough.  I had chest pains, rapid HR and SOB  and the symptoms got so bad I went to the ER where I remained for about 8hrs.  While there I started getting a really bad headache which lasted from that Sun after to the end of the week on Friday.   Benedryl, pepcid, tylenol was given.  About 9:30pm I was released with a prescription for the headache and advised to take benedryl.  Once home I noticed my arm was swollen and white in the center.  I got a rash on that arm that carried to my face and was itchy and burning.  I had lymph nodes that devoloped under both arm pits but the side where the injection was given hurt worse than the other. Had to wear the holter monitor for a week d/t the elevated HR which in turn made the healthcare specialist prescribe metroprol to help lower the HR but to date I am still having issues with the rapid HR.

                                                Around 730-8 I got a really bad headache. Throughout the night my back tightened up and my hips. I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

Another 15 minutes past and my right hand and left side of my face went numb. The school nurse gave me two Benadryl, some water, and cold cloth.  When I returned home I took Motrin and later in the evening another Benadryl.  The redness and heat subsided at the school but the numbness lasted throughout the evening.

                                                01/29/2021 (1st dose): A few days after the vaccination I developed some raised red spots that itched slightly: inside upper right arm, outside lower right arm, on my right hip, and right buttock. Also, I was very achy and fatigued for about 2 days after, as if I had the flu.  03/01/2021 (2nd dose): Sometime in the middle of the night on the 3rd night after the vaccination, I broke out in a much more pronounced raised blotchy red rash at the injection site on my left arm and wrapping around to the front of the same arm. It is a little bit itchy and overall my skin everywhere feels slightly itchy. Also, this second dose made me feel even more sick than the first one. I felt fine for the rest of the first day, but a little stiff at the injection site and a little tired. By midmorning the next day I became achy and increasingly fatigued. By the end of the second day and through the third day I was in a lot of pain and has the chills but without a fever. I was also congested during these two days.  Today, on the fourth day after the injection, I have the rash, as stated, a headache, and am a little fatigued, though mostly back to normal.

I went back to the pharmacy and they gave me an epi pen injection and then called 911 to get me to the emergency room. I had to take Benadryl, steroids and Pepcid AC through an IV.  They also prescribed those three medications and an epi pen to my pharmacy for an additional 4 days.  It is day two and there is a slight improvement, but the swelling is still there.  I had no issue with the first shot, Lot #013M20A.

I felt completely out of it, I went pale, shaking.  The EMT&#39;s were with me and checked my pressure.  It was through the roof.  I&#39;m otherwise a healthy person with BP regularly of 120/80. My BP at 3:20 PM -- 148/96   3:35 pm - took one 25 mg of Benadryl.  3.45 -  BP 139/92 3.52 -  BP 122/88 3.55 - Took a SECOND benadryl pill 25 mg.   (throat felt heavy when swallowing) 4.20 -  BP 120/82 EMT stated that it was an ALLERGIC REACTION cause VASO VAGAL SYMPTOMS.  My throat felt swollen (I have NEVER experienced this before).  I was sitting in the car for almost 2 hours before I felt somewhat comfortable to go home.  My husband drove me home.

                                                Exactly 1 week after receiving dose, my left arm became swollen and itchy about 2 inches below the vaccine site. The area affected was about 3 in x 1 in. The redness and swelling proceeded to get larger over the next 24 hours, and now is about 5 in x 6 in. I have started oral doses of Benadryl. Today, my throat is a little sore and feels swollen.

                                                about 2 minutes after receiving the shot I felt like I was having an allergic reaction in my chest area. My lower esophagus got extremely tight and then it worked its way up to the back of my throat. It felt like there was a lump in the back of my throat, along with burning in my throat. This same reaction also occurs when I eat certain foods I&#39;m intolerant to. I felt very dizzy right after as well. After exactly one hour my throat symptoms went away but suffered from residual effects for the next few days.  The next day I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm(which went away 2 days later), I was out of breath with everything I did, dizzy, muscle cramps, chills, body aches(as though I had the flu) and had extreme fatigue. All of theses symptoms lasted for the next week almost two.

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

Pain and swelling moved down into armpit and below followed by extreme itching.  Swelling and pain then moved down to left elbow. Then I developed throat itching, difficulty swallowing and wheezing. I also developed joint pain in opposite shoulder. I  immediately took 600 mg Ibuprofen and 50 mg Benadryl .  Itching, redness, and wheezing, and difficulty swallowing resolved about 30 minutes after taking the medication.  Next morning (today) I still have pain and swelling around injection site. Pain in left elbow and right shoulder joints. I still have moderate pain and edema below left armpit.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after injection I became itchy; the itchiness covered my body from the top of my head to just above my knees. About 5 minutes after that my face became tingly and my breathing became shallow. At this time my blood pressure, pulse ox and pulse were taken. They were all normal, however my breathing was still labored. I used my rescue inhaler, was given a double dose of allergy medicine and 800mg of ibuprofen. Within a couple of minutes my breathing had returned to normal.  Approximately 20 hours after injection I suffered from a headache that lasted around 6 hours. I also became very tired; the day of the injection I slept 10 hours and the following day I slept 12 hours. On both occasions I woke up to an alarm, so I have no idea how long I would have slept on my own accord.  Final thing to note which may not be related, but merely a coincidence: since receiving the vaccine, I have been unusually thirsty.

She had a nurse check her blood pressure and it was 101/65 and her heart rate was 138 bpm.  She felt presyncopal so she went to the ED for evaluation.  By the time she got to the ED, she felt her throat was scratchy, and when she would lie down flat she felt her throat was occluding.  She notes that she is s/p tonsillectomy in 12-2020, and considered whether that was playing a role in her symptoms, but she had not had any of those throat symptoms for 1 week prior to getting her COVID-19 vaccine.  In the ED, she was given IV medications and IV fluids.  ENT was consulted.  Her symptoms got better with medications, she is still experiencing some throat dryness but otherwise is feeling back to her usual self.  She never had any rash, flushing, itching.  She had a little tenderness at the injection site only.  She never had any difficulty breathing, lip/eye/tongue swelling, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting/diarrhea/abdominal pain.  She did have nausea when she felt vertigo.

I wear an Apple Watch and notice my heart rate was steadily climbing. I asked the exit secretaries to be seen by a nurse and as they were getting a nurse my heart rate reached 169 and I was feeling faint and beginning to shake. When the nurse came she noticed how white my hands were and my breathing was becoming labored. The nurse called a code white and an ICU nurse and respiratory specialist arrived to assess me. I thought I would pass out and they had me lay on my back with legs up. They tested my blood sugar and were assessing my vitals. My breathing was fast but I was still able to breathe. My heart rate started to slow down but remained somewhat high. they helped me into a wheelchair and escorted me to the emergency department. I was assessed for cardiac concerns and labs were taken. After a couple of hours in the ED the dizziness started to subside but I had excessive thirst and dry mouth and slightly swollen tongue. I had feeling of butterflies in my stomach off an on. My heart rate stabilized and I was cleared to go home after four hours.

Fever and chills began the first night (didn&#39;t take temperature).  Short of breath on the evening of 2/6/21 with moderate activity.   2/17/21 - Fatigue throughout day. Slightly (less than 2/6) short of breath with mild- moderate activity on 2/7. Fever, chills, and body/muscle aches continued throughout 2/7/21 and were moderate (muscle/body aches severe) until about an hour after taking 1 pill of over the counter ibuprofen at 2 p.m. on 2/7/21. Symptoms returned as the ibuprofen wore off, and I took another 1 pill of ibuprofen at about 9:30 p.m. on 2/7/21. Symptoms then diminished except for some mild back pain.   2/8/21 - the only symptoms are some fatigue and mild back pain (could be unrelated and just due to activity). No medications taken on 2/8/21.

                                                I got the Vaccine at about 1:45 PM. About ten min later my heart started racing and it was getting harder to breathe. We called over someone in the waiting lot and they accessed me and gave me benadryl.  After another 5-10 min I couldn&#39;t get a good breathe, hard time swallowing, couch and itch in throat and got an epi-pen and transported to ER. I was put on steroids and beta blocker and stopped the reaction.  While in the ER my O2 went down to 92 but I was better than before.  I went home after hours of observation with prednisone and Beta blockers. I followed up with my Dr. When the 5 day steroid was stopped I almost immediately started struggling to breathe again and hard time swallowing. Dr. put me on a longer dose of prednisone. I&#39;m starting to taper off the prednisone and my throat is hurting, itching and a little swell. I follow up again today.

The symptoms continued to worsen each day, and on 2/09, I vomited and went to the clinic.  I tested negative for Covid-19, (both the rapid and 3 day tests), negative for the flu, negative for strep.  I started taking Excedrin for the migraines, and it helped, but prior to that, no medicine was working.  I continued to rest and take Excedrin.  Daily symptoms continued to include:  migraine, fatigue, chills &amp; aches, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, could only warm drinks &amp; bland food.  Also nausea, short of breath.  These symptoms continued to slowly improve, but I had them through 2/19.

Got home and went to bed  around 11AM and woke up at 2PM feeling worse the numbness now was going down my throat, like it was swelling. Took 25 mg of Benadryl and called my PCP who advise to go to the ER. At the ER they did a CBC  and a CMC or a CMB not sure. They also gave me 15mg of IV Benadryl and 8 mg of IV Decadron. About 15 min after receiving the IV meds at the ER I started feeling relief.  Around 8PM I was released to go home.  No symptoms next day.

From the time of injection until current, chills, intermittent low grade fever, headache and body aches different from my normal aches. Worse GI issues, memory issues worse than normal, feeling of disorientation at times, little difficulty catching my breath (only used rescue inhaler once). I felt a bit better about a week and a half post injection. But, then, started to feel worse, including vaccinated arm feeling heavy and sore again - February 27, 2021 - noticed reddish/ pink abnormal circle around injection site this is new, delayed, overall worse malaise, I felt a general feeling of yuck. I know it?s not a great descriptor, but, it kind of fits. Basically, lupusy, but worse.

After another 5 minutes, I felt an asthma attack start. I could still breath through my nose but it was difficult to swallow.  I used my albuterol inhaler and took Benadryl (2 tablets) and felt much better after 15-20 minutes. I am taking daily antihistimes and still feel congested but no further asthma attacks have occurred. I developed hot flashes and chills the night of taking the vaccine but that has resolved. I also have upper abdominal pain that has not resolved.

                                                I am emailing you about filing a petition for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination that I received on Wednesday February 17, 2021, at the Department. I went to my primary care providers for my annual physical and to address my concerns with the vaccination. I gave blood work. Later into my afternoon, I notice that I began to itch across my sternum and I thought it was an allergic reaction to some of my common allergies. I took some Benadryl to calm the itching to get rest. I was out of work from Wednesday February 17, 2021, @ 1300 to Friday February 19, 2021, without pay, returning on Monday February 22, 2021.   On Monday February 22, 2021, I came into work and felt fatigue, light headed, headache, blurred vision, and some great deal of body pain. Approximately 2145, I notice that I was having trouble breathing and began itching profusely. I grabbed my epi pen and gave myself an injection. I laid back on the bed and I fell asleep. The following day Tuesday February 23, 2021, I barely had energy to get up and get ready for work. I prevailed because there is nothing set in place for people who experience an delayed allergic reaction to these vaccinations. I have literally been pushing myself through my workdays because I can not afford to be off.   On Sunday February 28, 2021, I notice that the rash began to spread across my body parts. My arms, neck, shoulder, upper back, behind my ears, legs, and again I figured it related to my allergies. The condition continued to get worst throughout the next week. It was several occasions I almost lost control of my vehicle because the itching sensation had hit me instantly while driving. Once I was able to pull over, I just began to scratch every area of my body. Therefore, Friday March 5, 2021, I drove myself to Hospital too seek help.   I explained my situation, I was checked in, and I showed how the rash had spread all over my body. It was nothing they could do but give me IV fluid, did some blood work and Prednisone 10mg (5 tablets) and send me home without relief. I continue to suffer from this vaccination and no one has any answers to give me. My scar-less skin now looks unattractive and dark spots where there was a rash that came and went but left awareness that I once had a rash in that spot.   I am scheduled to see my dermatologist today, Thursday, March 11, 2021. My appointment time is 1615. I went my employer to file a notice of the outbreak and to see what if anything that they could do. It was just a standard report and they are submitting all information to the CDC.   I am a health care professional and my job requires me to stand, sit, bend, lift, push, pull and assist in all aspects of an operating room that has caused me some issues and concerns that I can not perform my duties as required due to the severely of the itching.

I  had dreams that were very short and back to back for only about a 20 min.  period  and this was on 3/26/2021 around 1:00 pm. I then woke in a panic gasping for air and quickly snapped out of it. I have had a Lingering headache since then.

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

My throat did not close, but it clenched or got tight and my tongue seemed to tense.  Before I had time to think about that, I had a surge of adrenaline which left me a bit startled.  The tongue and throat tightening happened without an adrenaline surge approximately 4 more times.  I lost feeling in my left arm and felt lightheaded.  This lasted about 30 minutes, after which I felt fine.  I experienced sharp stabbing pains in hands, feet, pelvis and fingers, which are still present 48 hours later.  At 24 hours post-vaccine, I felt chills and developed muscle aches and a low fever, which are still present at 48 hours post-vaccine.

                                                1 week after injection I woke up with severely swollen lymph nodes in neck, swollen throat and could barely swallow. Right arm at site of injection 1 week prior was acutely hard, elevated, red, warm and tender to touch.  I immediately took a benadryl and 5 mg predniosne tablet, water, elevated position to rest. Swelling of lymph nodes in neck improved and gradually resolved 3-4 days later. Right arm redness and size of affected area doubled over the next two days, but then started improving. Resolved in about 8 days.

                                                At first I was feeling dizzy, then the back of my throat felt itchy. EMS came over, and took my temperature, which was 98 degrees. Then I started to feel compression and pain in my ribs on both sides, and the middle of my chest - like an elephant was sitting on it, or I had a corset wrapped too tightly around my diaphragm. Then I started having uncontrollable coughing fits, followed by wheezing. EMS got me some ice packs for my ribs and the middle of my chest, but I had to get up and use the bathroom.  When I get anaphylaxis, I usually take two aspirin, a benadryl, a cetirizine, a CBD capsule, a famotidine, a 20 mg steroid pill, and a hydroxyzine pill - all at once. EMS agreed I should take it, and they gave me a shot of epinephrine in the arm. then they loaded me on to the ambulance, where I got a shot of steroid, and we went to the hospital in. EMS also started an IV for me. At the hospital, they gave me another shot of EpiPen, over 20 minutes after the first one, and a shot of Benadryl. by the end of 2 hours, my breathing was back to normal, and I was able to go home. Today I still feel a little bit dizzy, but mostly my arm is sore where I got the vaccination. I also still have a headache.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; Angioedema; Shortness of breath; Wheezing; Fast heart rate; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 44-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylaxis reaction, angioedema, shortness of breath, wheezing, and increased heart rate.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021 at 18:00, approximately 10 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 041L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection, the patient began to have tongue swelling. She was given diphenhydramine and epinephrine by epi pen. She went to the emergency room where she displayed symptoms including a fast heart rate, wheezing, and shortness of breath with an angioedema or anaphylaxis like appearance. She was given more epinephrine, famotidine, scheduled diphenhydramine at 50 QAs intravenously (IV), IV steroids, was intubated and placed on a ventilator. She was on the ventilator for approximately 18-20 hours following admission. She eventually responded to a high dose of dexamethasone. She was also given duonebs for her shortness of breath, regular sedation for the ventilator, and a dose of ketorolac. Consent was given for Safety to follow up.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events were unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44 year old female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred approximately 10 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration. She was treated with epinephrine, famotidine, diphenhydramine, IV steroids, intubated and placed on a ventilator.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                1/28- Moderna vaccine to left deltoid approximately 1000 AM. Felt fine the rest of the day. Very tired in the evening and went to sleep early. Took PM medications- Xyzal 1 tab PO HS, Xanax 0.5 mg PO HS. 1/29-Woke to Left arm was sore, felt like I had received TDap injection, like I was punched in the arm- localized to Deltoid.  Took AM medications as normal- Wellbutrin XL 150 mg QD, Effexor 75 mg QD, B12 SL, Multivitamins QD As the day progressed, left arm soreness and discomfort became more pronounced and then went from localized to circumferential to left arm. Also noted discomfort and soreness to left axilla and soreness to left lateral/posterior cervical neck area. Became increasingly tired, weak, left arm was weaker than right arm with grip.  Headache was pounding and predominantly bilateral temporally.  Decreased appetite. Non productive cough.  Mid day, started to have freezing bilateral upper and lower extremities. Applied wool socks and clothing layers to accommodate. Temperature to forehead was 99.0, Right ear 101.4 and Left ear 102.0. Pulse ox 97% on room air. Took 1 gram APAP prophylactically, also took Zicam SL. Tolerated as much PO fluids as possible, water.  Increased flu like signs and symptoms for the rest of the day, no actual fever recorded. Literally had on thermals, top and bottoms. 2 pair of wool socks, gloves, and a hoodie. Wrapped in bed with 2 blankets.  Through the night, had discarded all clothing and remained in shirt and had sheet covering. Difficult night sleeping with the soreness to left arm and left axilla, was not able to get comfortable.  1/30- Woke, still, felt signs and symptoms of flu, body aches, pains, weak, tired, and decreased appetite.  A noticeable audible wheeze, shortness of breath with minimal exertion, and persistent dry cough. Cough remained non-productive.  All other signs and symptoms from the day before remained and the soreness to the left upper arm, left axilla, and left neck. Flu like signs and symptoms were just as intense as day before. Chills were consistently inconsistent with start and end, noticeable bilateral hands and feet were freezing. Afebrile, pulse ox 97% room air . Continued to treat prophylactically with APAP and Zicam, po fluids, rest.  1/31- Difficult night sleeping again related to discomfort to left side of upper torso. Felt a little better concerning weakness and being tired. Headache subsided some from it?s intensity. Started to have stomach discomfort, diarrhea, and remained short of breath with minimal exertion. Felt as if I was not able to expand my lungs to their full capacity, thus yawned a lot and had to continue to try to expand lungs. Continued to have flu signs and symptoms (not as intense as past 2 days), diarrhea STARTED, and feeling tired continued. Shortness of breath decreased in severity and lungs continued to feel a decline in expansion with inhalation. Continued to treat prophylactically and rest. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/1- Difficult night sleeping related to left upper torso soreness and discomfort. Diarrhea continued into this day. No nausea. Tolerating PO fluids; however, feeling weak and tired.  Left upper arm soreness and discomfort less than initial onset. Left axilla remained sore and left side of neck. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/2- Diarrhea subsided, flu signs and symptoms continued to decrease in initial intensity. Shortness of breath not as extreme; however, continued to feel as if not able to expand lungs to full capacity. Left upper arm soreness and discomfort almost resolved, left axilla beginning to decrease in soreness along with left side of neck. Only prominent s/s is feeling tired and inability to expand lungs to full capacity. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/3- Feeling 95% better, closer to baseline. Worst days were the first 2 after the injection; however, still remain unable to expand lung capacity to full expansion with inhaling, thus requiring multiple attempts and yawning. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile 2/4- 99% to baseline and feeling better, continue to have decreased expansion of lung capacity. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile

                                                Thursday, 2/21 - started feeling, overall, exhausted, and having lots of aches and pains. My chest and back (near area where I have costochondritis (xiphoid process) was in a great deal of pain. My heart rate also kept jumping around between 65 and 105 without exertion.  Tuesday, 1/26/2021 - I was feeling exhausted and got out of breath with minimal exertion. Heart rate jumped up with minimal exertion (e.g. just standing, heart rate climbed about 110). I also started feeling dizzy and , ultimately, fainted, which put me in the emergency room, where they ruled out a PE and all cardiac emergencies. My blood pressure spiked with a systolic around 165 (my usual is 90-95). Labs indicated everything was fine. The only thing different than usual was the vaccine. This was also the day I realized I developed extreme cold feet and also cold fingers, ears, and nose. My cold feet is still an issue - they get so cold, it?s actually painful. I now have to have a heating pad around my feet at home. This has never happened to me before the vaccine in my, now, 45 years alive. I?m still a bit fatigued, have sporadic aches and pains, sometimes get a little dizzy, and have extremely cold feet...two and a half weeks later.

At the time of the injection my diagnosis is contact allergy, so the nurses continued with the injection.  It wasn&#39;t until 12-14 days later that this reaction started.  It is intensifying.  I have reviewed everything I eat and products I use, and nothing has changed other than having the first shot. I have some skin irritation and itchy if I do come in contact with an allergen or eat something, but it subsides after a day or two.   This continues to get worse and it is going on 5 days.

                                                Patient received Moderna covid-19 vaccine in her left upper arm IM. She started experiencing nausea/throat tightness about 5 minutes after the vaccine was administered. Patient was continually monitored. Throat tightness continued to progress. A capsule of diphenhydramine 25 mg was administered approximately 3 minutes after initial complaints. Patient reported the capsule felt like it &#34;got stuck in her throat&#34; because the throat tightness was continuing to progress. At this time, another pharmacist was on the phone with 911 working on getting an ambulance to the pharmacy. I continued to stay with the patient as breathing got progressively worse, she began wheezing and had very labored breathing. An epipen was obtained from the pharmacy and I administered in the left upper thigh. Shortly after administration, the patient reported starting to feel slightly better and being able to breathe more easily. About 5 minutes after administering the epipen, the ambulance arrived. I briefed the medics on what occurred and what was given to the patient. The patient reported breathing better but still had nausea, felt dizzy, and did not feel well all around. The patient was transported to a local hospital  for treatment.

Then within 24 hours post vaccine developed burning in chest.   36 hours post vaccine severe chest pain.  Described as elephant on chest radiating down left arm to left jaw associated with paleness and diaphoretic.  Hurt to take in deep breath and pain worsened upon lying down.  Relieved with motrin 800 mg.  I continued motrin every 6 hours until I could follow up with cardiologist on Friday 01/29/21.  EKG showed ST elevation in all leads.  Stat echo was performed at facility.   Diagnosed per doctor with acute Pericarditis.   Started on Colchicine 0.6mg twice daily X 10 days.  Other doctor followed up and continued Colchicine 0.6 mg x 90 days.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

I advised th pharmacist about 5 min into the reaction and was told to buy benadryl and take &#34;some&#34;. I took 50mg oral benadryl.  By this time I was having trouble swallowing.  I waited 10 more minutes of observation at the pharmacy.  By then my lips had become numb and no effect was had from the benadryl.  The pharmacist advised I go to ER or urgent care. I went to ER. I was evaluated.  BP, HR, SPo2, within normal range. Respirations 25/min. By this time my neck and chest was itching and heavy feeling and I felt my breathing effort was increased mildly. I was given IV decadon and IV pepcid. After about an hour and a half my symptoms slowly resolved. The last symptom to resolve was difficulty swallowing.  I was told to continue oral benadryl and or pepcid. I was discharged home after 4 hours under my own care.

                                                Immediately I had a severe headache and body aches. I went home and took Benadryl and went to sleep. Next morning, itching skin and burning skin like it was on fire. Asthmatic symptoms and I had hives all over my neck and back ( and still had headache and body aches). That night - all the same symptoms but just increased. I also started having weird neurological speech problems - could think of a word but couldn&#39;t get the word out. I went to ER - They treated me with a breathing treatment - six rounds of Provental and gave me an epi-pen and told me to take Zyrtec for next 15 days. Told me to go to allergist/immunologist  - that appt was two days later - Private practice. He diagnosed that I was allergic Polyethylene Glycol that was in the vaccine. He put me on Prednizone for a week. That with the Zyrtec and the inhaler pretty much cleared up everything.

No other issues with allergic reaction.  Mild injection site soreness, mild body aches, 99.3 temp persist at 36 hours post injection.

Today is day 5 of reaction and it does not seem to be resolving.  I have been in contact with my doctor&#39;s office 2 times since onset.

This were the immediate adverse effect withi in 5 to 10 minutes of receiving the shot. Followed by aches, chills, loss of appetite and days of swollend tongue and sore throat and difficulty swolling. My breathing was not affected as I did not experience a full anaphylaxis reaction but I continue with the discomfort a week and a half later. I have been taking benedryl, claritin, and fatmotidine which is what my doctor suguested I take to calm down the allergic reaction and it has helped a bit with the nauseau and the feeling of having a lump in my throat.

The Observation person notified me right away and I immediately went to pt. with Crash Kit. I assessed her and she denied any complaints at that time and that they had subsided. She denied any pain, tingling, oral or airway issues. Pt. report when asked that she has chronic Fibromyalgia, and immune system issues. Otherwise no allergies to medication or food. I gave her Benadryl 50 mg PO once. She stated she had a ride waiting, so she would not drive. I asked pt. to stay an additional 30 minutes, then I would reassess and walk her out. I also updated the Dept.  Supervisor in the event we needed to give Epi and provide higher level of care. After 30 minutes,  I reassessed and pt denied any c/ o pain, tingling oral/ airway issues, but stated she had ? sinus like pressure ? in her forehead. I advised her to contact her physician and update with what occurred and if she has any continued side affects, headache pain, or other s/sx.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 1/1/21.  Initially, I had a sore arm for 24 hours but otherwise no problems.  Then, on day 8, my left deltoid area started itching and there was a red, slightly raised area just larger than a golf ball. I called the  hotline at that time and took a Benadryl.  Then, 24 hrs later, the area had expanded to over 3 times the size and felt warm. I actually went and saw a friend who lived in my neighborhood who is a general surgeon and he thought I should get it checked out to make sure it wasn&#39;t an NSTI.  Being Saturday at 9pm, I went to the ER  where they started me on Keflex/Bactrim for a presumed cellulitis.  By the next morning, the redness and itching were gone and my arm felt totally back to normal the next day after that. Unfortunately, on day 3 of the antibiotics (Tuesday the 12th), I had symptoms of anaphylaxis (chest tightness, wheezing, throat clearing, lip swelling, hoarse voice, impending doom sensation).  I took Benadryl 50mg and got my epi pen ready but did not use it.  (I have a tree nut allergy).  The symptoms resolved completely about 1 hour later.

                                                Patient waited approximately 20 minutes after receiving vaccine as is standard. Patient began to drive home when she started to notice tingling in her lips, feeling flushed, and then as though her throat was closing. She contacted 911 and they responded road side.  Patient was initially being monitored only, then her BP dropped. Decision was made to transport patient to ED. En route she received epinephrine and was placed on O2 by way of non-rebreather mask.  Upon arrival to the ED patient continued to be dyspneic. She was given solumedrol, benadryl, Pepcid, and mag. Patient was stabilized and no additional epi was required.  Patient was admitted to hospital in observation status.  She was stable overnight. She did have one episode of itching and nausea, she was given diphenhydramine and Zofran and these symptoms resolved. Patient was monitored until around 1PM the day after event and was released to home in stable condition.

                                                Within about 45 minutes of receiving the vaccine I started getting mild hives spreading around the injection site and across my belly. I had mild wheezing and feeling of loose fluid in my brachial area of my chest. Now at 24 hr out, hives are head to toe, and I took diphenhydramine at bedtime in addition to my loratadine each AM.  I&#39;ve used my inhaler twice to see if that helped - it doesn&#39;t, so it&#39;s not a regular asthma attack.  Today I have intermittently dealt with mild sweats, moderate chills, mild nausea, shakes (might be the inhaler as that sometimes makes me shake), headache fluxing between mild to moderate, eyes watering and lids swollen slightly with hives, injection site soreness, swelling about the diameter of a softball (interfering with ROM on left arm - I am an interpreter, so this interfered with work a lot today!), left arm from shoulder to elbow is hot to the touch, and I have had mild disconnects with my ability to focus/breaks in completing thoughts today.    I am keeping my EpiPens close, just in case.  I live 3 miles to the nearest ER, and someone is here with me just in case I need to go.

I was working out 5 days a week in the gym and suddenly cannot barely get through the day due to weakness, body aches, and fatigue.  I also have experienced shortness of breath which gets worse throughout the day and had to take prednisone for 5 days to help manage symptoms

Raised red area around injection site is approximately two inches from center in a circle.  Entire upper arm is sore and upper back through shoulder blade is sore also.   Took benadryl the night it presented and drew circle around red/raised area to determine if it spreads.   Took zyrtec the next morning and put ice on throughout the day.  The red raised area has spread some and it remains hot to the touch.   Also began having problems with asthma and used rescue inhaler more than usual.

                                                The night of vaccination I got a headache, severe nausea and diarrhea. This continued through Sunday. Sunday evening I felt a greater pain and heat at injection site. I went to the bathroom to look at it and noticed not only did I have what looked like a band of a rash around my arm but also my checks looked to have a rash. I also started to feel throat tightness.  Not like I couldn?t breath but just a little tight and harder to swallow. I took an antihistamine immediately.  Arm ?rash lasted for 3 days after Sunday. Headache  and nausea were gone at this time but I still had severe diarrhea. Diarrhea continued for the rest of the week. It wasn?t always ?urgent? but any moment was diarrhea. For example some days I may have had only 2 bouts of diarrhea while other days I had over 10. I had tried anti diarrhea meds all week with no change in condition. It did not seem to help at all. I went to urgent care a week from the day of vaccination.  They took fecal samples, gave me an rx for bentyl (which I found out I couldn?t have filled  due to my eye issues).   My first day without diarrhea was February 10th. Diarrhea was replace with nausea and cramping. It is now February 12th in the am. I am feeling mostly ok at this time but am not sure  how I will once I?m up for awhile. Test results from samples were received feb 9th and negative for anything infectious.

                                                Allergic reaction:  About 5 minutes after the shot I started feeling flush and I turned blotchy red on my face, neck, chest, and arms. That flushing was followed quickly by mild shortness of breath, an overwhelming feeling of being so hot, a heavy-headed feeling, chest tightness, face and scalp tingling, confusion, hand tremors, and tightness in my throat. This all started during the 15-minute observation period. I raised my hand to report my symptoms, and the onsite nurses took me to a private area to monitor me. My heart rate was quite high (tachycardia) and my blood pressure was very elevated at 184/116. They gave me 50mg of benadryl and continued to check my heart rate and blood pressure. After 30 more minutes, my vitals still weren&#39;t really improving nor were my other symptoms, so the decision was made to call paramedics and have me transported to the emergency department for further evaluation/observation. After 30mg zyrtec, 50mg benadryl, 40mg famotidine, and 3 hours, I was feeling much better. My blood pressure was still elevated and my pulse pressure was quite wide, but my heart rate and other symptoms were improved so I was discharged to home, where I pretty quickly fell into a 3-hour deep slumber. I awoke still feeling shakey and confused. The confusion continued throughout the next day. It has finally subsided on day 3.

I sat down and put my head on the table. According to my husband, my eyes briefly rolled back into my head and I was convulsing for a brief period of time (5 seconds). I then sat straight up, sweating profusely, white a sheet and with a terrified look on my face started hyperventilating for a short period of time. My husband said I never actually fainted, but I don&#39;t have memory of this incident. After this episode passed I continued to feel feverish and achey. Temp about 100.7. Started to feel a little better 54 hours after injection.

                                                Within 5 min got a tickle in throat that led to coughing and asthma tightness and dizziness. Took my Ventolin inhaler and my chest opened up. I continued to feel more and more dizzy and found myself finding it hard to speak. Felt very buzzy, like my body was feeling waves of tingles. My head started hurting and neck. This progressed at the vaccination site for a while. I don?t know at what time they suggested N ambulance take me to the ER. By the time I was in ambulance my head and neck were hurting very had. I was having trouble talking and any body movement felt like I was moving through mud. Very tingly and heavy feeling.  I felt very drowsy and my eyes stayed closed. At the hospital they gave me an anti nausea, Benadryl and some migraine pain medicine. I think it was about a half hour or more I started being able to open my eyes again and see straight.  The pain in my head and neck calmed down. I think I arrived at the ER around 3:45/4 and I was discharged at 7:45. I continued to have head and neck pain, body aches. My shooter and arm wheee shot was is very very sore. I slept ok but woke many times with my heart racing and feeling that buzzing sensation again like I was high. I?ve taken Advil for pain. Been resting all day today. Still having a bad headache and neck pain. Feeling very drowsy. Eyes hurting. I feel like I?m slowly coming out of whatever happened but still feeling like I?ve been hit by a truck.

                                                5 minutes after receiving the vaccine I had a rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, tight chest, very jittery. I reported to EMT on site he said I was fine was probably due to not eating anything before vaccine. Left, got something to eat felt better. Arm sorness after injection that lasted 4 days, very cold feeling for 4 days after vaccine. Developed brain fog that still has not cleared up since vaccination. On 1/12/2021 I woke up for work, as I was combing my hair I noticed the lymph nodes on back of skull and neck were raised and very swollen. Started developing vision problems and stabbing pains in my eye. Immediatly called my PCP, he had me come in thought it was shingles and gave me Valtrex to take. This did nothing for me, no rash, no symptoms ever appeared. I called again and he had me go in for an MRI and CT of my neck/head. I still have motor skill problems, dropping things, brain confusion, lymph nodes all over my body are swollen at random times, I have now developed muscle spasms in my legs and feet. Was sent to a Neurologist as they thought I might have a MS lesion after brain MRI. Still ongoing treatment for that issue. I have had no energy at all since this vaccine, having difficulty talking to patients at work, still get dislexic problems, symptoms seem to get worse with higher levels of stress.

                                                I am quoting this from my mother as she is currently unable to type due to the shaking and shivering. &#34;It started with red hot places on both arms, and then it moved to my face. 2 1/2 hours later I began getting really nauseated and began shaking/shivering uncontrollably. I then went to urgent care and on the way there my heart was pounding and racing. After I was admitted they told me that I had tachycardia and my blood pressure was high (I do not usually have high blood pressure). They did an EKG at urgent care and noticed small changes. I was then sent to the ER and was given IV Benadryl and oral steroids. I was put on a heart monitor, and they were able to get my heart rate to go down, but a few hours later it jumped back up. At that point I was referred to a cardiologist and given a prescription for steroids, and then I was discharged. I saw the cardiologist 2 days later, during those two days I still experienced red hot spots on my arm, shortness of breath, Tachycardia, and shivering. When I went to the cardiologist, they did another EKG and said I still have tachycardia and did some bloodwork. The results of the bloodwork were normal and the cardiologist diagnosed it as an unspecified delayed severe allergic reaction. I am still experiencing symptoms and still having to use Benadryl and steroids.&#34;

                                                I received my vaccine on 11 Mar 21 and about an hour after the vaccine my face, neck and torso felt numb and tingling. My throat and tongue felt thick and swelling shortly after that  I started feeling dizzy and light headed to the point where I needed to hold onto something because I felt like I was going to fall over. When I laid down it felt like the room was spinning. The swelling of my throat and tongue slowed and I didn&#39;t go into anaphylactic shock. I was still able to breath but my throat and tongue still felt swollen. The symptoms seemed to stagnate after about 2 hours from when it began. The symptoms didn&#39;t progress but remained persistent for 24 hours. I contacted my doctor and the clinic I received my vaccine of my symptoms. My doctor advised me to go to the ER due to my symptoms being persistent and my throat and tongue still feeling swollen. I went to the ER to be treated 12 Mar 21. They administered Benadryl and a steroid and finally it felt like the swelling went down.

                                                On 2/1 I started to feel rundown. On 2/3 I had no energy. On 2/4 I couldn&#39;t think straight. On 2/6 I got a covid test. Results negative. On 2/8 I saw a doctor who tested my electrolytes. Everything was good with labs. I was declining rapidly. I started to become very lightheaded and dizzy. I had blurred vision. I started to get migraines. On 2/11 I saw another doctor who did a bunch of tests like vertigo, said she could not figure it out. The migraines were severe and consistent. On 2/15 I went to the ER. They did a CT scan, EKG, more blood tests. She said she would diagnose me with migraines although I never had an issue with them before, and she was diagnosing me with it as a &#34;diagnosis of exclusion&#34;. I was bedridden. I had spots in my vision and couldn&#39;t drive. I felt like I was driving drunk although completely sober so I stopped driving. I had severe brain fog. I couldn&#39;t remember what happened 2 minutes ago.  They prescribed me propranolol and a triptan. I didn&#39;t take them because I felt that the diagnosis was wrong. Something was causing migraines, my whole body was experiencing something major. On 2/19 I went to another doctor for another set of eyes. I told him what I was feeling was systemic. I had been out of work for weeks. He tested me for B12 and Magnesium deficiencies. Everything was normal. I googled nonstop. I started feeling zaps like my body needed oxygen. My brain needed oxygen. The brain fog was so severe I felt like I had dementia. I kept googling... I came across iron... I started to take iron on 2/21. I went to the VA for more blood tests. The blood tests had some low markers like eGFR and slightly low MCHC. I was clearly very sick. The same day I could barely breathe well and I went to the ER. The doctor told me he &#34;deals with strokes and heart attacks&#34; and not what was happening to me. I asked him to please check my ferritin. He refused. I kept taking iron. On 2/22 I went to another ER with shortness of breath and all of the other symptoms. I felt like I was going to die. I had never been so sick. I am a very healthy person who eats healthy and exercises daily. This doctor refused to test my ferritin as well. She told me it was stress. I ordered my own labs using walkinlabs.com. I had read that ferritin can be falsely elevated if the body was inflamed and I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s what happened because at the time my ferritin was normal at 48. I kept taking large doses of iron (within safe limits) because my symptoms matched iron deficiency without anemia and the causes of it fit me. I read many many medical journals regarding our ferritin ranges and how ferritin should be 75&#43;. I had never had an issue with it before. I swore it was iron. Every day 2-3 symptoms would go away.  I saw another doctor shortly after who dismissed all of my symptoms again. It was the sickest I had ever been and 4 doctors, 3 ER&#39;s all dismissed me. I was beyond frustrated and lost faith in the medical community. Some mentioned it could be the vaccine but they did not question it too much. I went to a naturopathic doctor. She did a thorough test on 3/9. My ferritin came out as a 21 on this date (after 16 days of taking large amounts of iron). She thought maybe I was already iron deficient and that when I got the shot, maybe my immune system couldn&#39;t handle both. I left it at that.  Meanwhile, another coworker, had also been out 3 weeks. He had deteriorated severely about the same amount of time after the Moderna Vaccine that I did. I didn&#39;t think much of it as he had diverticulitis. He is also a healthy eater and exerciser. Today he is still very ill. Today he told me that his Kidney doctor just found out that his Iron was completely depleted! His labs were off the charts low. Coincidence maybe, but too similar to not consider as an adverse reaction to the shot! And how many people may have the same symptoms who don&#39;t know? As of today I am still very weak and tired but I am able to work.  I don&#39;t feel as sharp. Iron did fix a lot of the symptoms but iron deficiency usually comes on slower. In this case it is like I FELL OFF OF A CLIFF. I deteriorated so hard and fast and was terrified. My family was terrified.

I was monitored for a short time and released.

                                                The evening (3/20/21)I received the vaccine I noticed fatigue, headache and chills. The next morning I developed shortness of breath. The day after that my left left began swelling for no reason, was slightly discolored and warm to the touch. As the week went on my shortness of breath became greater and my leg more swollen. On (3/26/21) I sent to the ER by my doctor. Had a ultra sound and discovered an extensive DVT in my left groin down to behind left knee. Had a CT and discovered blood clots in my lungs. I had never had any underlying health conditions or been on medications, don&#39;t smoke, no complaints prior. Was transported to hospital spent 2.5 days in ICU before being moved to a regular bed for a total of (4) days hospitalized. The doctor installed two sheaths on each side of groin, injected my lungs with medication to blast/dissolve the clots and installed a filter in the main artery to catch any clots that may break away from leg. I was also put on a Heparin drip while in ICU. The next day the doctor went and the procedure was a success dissolving the clots. He removed the sheaths. I went back to ICU. The next day (3/28/21) a second utlra sound was done to left leg and DVT is still in left leg. Have been described Eliquis blood thinner.

                                                Two hours after the injection, I started to not feel &#34;right.&#34;  My head felt heavy, I was getting a little dizzy and all I wanted to do was to lie down.  By the third hour, my body completely shut down.  I was so tired I had no energy to move, to talk, and even breathing was difficult (not because I couldn&#39;t breathe, just that the effort was difficult).  I was dizzy, nauseous, and lost my appetite.  My temperature was elevated, 98.5, but no fever.  I slept for 5 hours as if in a coma.  Woke up to drink water, felt total-body aches, and slept the rest of the night again getting at least 12 more hours of sleep.  At some point during the night, I had chills so bad my body was shaking uncontrollably.  I had 2 layers of clothes and 3 layers of blankets and could not warm up.  Day #2 (today), I have a tremendous headache, dizzy, nauseous, my heart rate is abnormally fast and I am out of breath.  My resting heart rate is typically upper 50&#39;s and is currently averaging in the 70&#39;s, jumping into the 90&#39;s often.   Sitting up, my heart rate is between 80-100 (which is typically my rate when I exercise).  When I stand up or walk to the other room, my heart rate is around 115-120 (typical of when I am running/sprinting or participating in taxing exercise).  Along with this, I am out of breath as if I am exercising, although I am barely moving around. All I am doing is laying down, only getting up to go to the bathroom and my body feels like I ran a marathon.  Breathing is difficult even at rest.

                                                Just prior to 5P had left arm pain -that traveled to my hand. At 5PM driving and heart rate went 128 - most likely higher (registered on iwatch). This is abnormal for me as my heart rate is typically in high 40&#39;s (marathon runner).  Along with the rapid heart rate felt like throat was closing - like a reaction caused by an allergy.  The rate rate stayed like that for about a minute or two followed by severe chills (chills can be described like when a person comes out of the OR).  I felt like I was coming out of my skin and became dizzy. I became nervous and called 911.  In discussion with the 911 dispatch everything subsided and decided I would continue driving with an intent to going to Hospital.  About 10 minutes later, prior to getting onto I95 the same cycle with increased heart rate followed by chills occurred again for about the same timeframe.  I do not know how far apart the cycle was occurring other than I ended up calling 911 again and Ambulance was dispatched while I was on I95 and I had pulled over.  Approx arrival of ambulance was about 6P Once in the back of the ambulance, I showed no arrhythmia and heart rate was now in the 70&#39;s, however I was still having the chills.  Decided to drive home after waiting about 20 minutes in the back of ambulance with no further issues of the tachycardia. Once I was home I continued with chills and a high fever throughout the night.  The fever did not go away until about 48 hours. The chills went away by the following morning. Thursday and Friday have had chest tightness and the feeling of needing to take large breaths to expand chest.  Continue to have moderate headache.

My throat started to feel tight.  I was wearing a mask, which suddenly felt very tight on my face resulting in an inability to receive enough air.   I had to stand up and move to a window and remove my mask to take deep breaths.  I felt very jittery and was unable to sit down.  My throat continue to feel tight and also my chest started to feel tight also.

Arrival Vital Signs were WNL. Patient c/o itching, erythema, swollen tongue, changed voice, breathing &#34;a little tight&#34;.  Epinephrine and DuoNeb ordered. Seizure like episode at 02.04.21 at 1240 BP 209/81, HR 111, RR 24, Pulse Ox 100% on 15% Non-rebreather mask, Rectal temp 98.4 ED MD wrote:  &#34;At approximately 12:40pm this afternoon the patient was having what appeared to be a seizure versus severe rigors.  She was not verbally responsive and appeared to be apneic with her head shaking in her arms flailing rigidly in an up and down motion.  Symptoms lasted approximately less than 2 minutes and patient was not postictal.  She was not incontinent.  Blood sugar is in the 180s and her rectal temp is normal.  I believe this patient is having a severe reaction to her moderna vaccine that she received earlier today.  Her 1st vaccine was January 7th and today was her 2nd vaccine for COVID.&#34;  Teleneurology consult conducted, no documented recommendations. Patient was transferred to higher level of care.

I had finally stopped having the shortness of breath and having to use an inhaler for 2 weeks before taking the COVID vaccination. I started having the asthma like symptoms again two days after taking the vaccine. I am still having  shortness of breath and having to use an inhaler on a daily basis and it has been over 2 weeks since the vaccine. I also had flu like symptoms including  fever, chills, body aches immediately after the vaccine for 48 hours.

Left clinic after 30 minutes not realizing I was having a reaction.  About 35 minutes after injection started feeling lightheaded, more anxious, and slightly confused.  Drove home for 20min.  Once home (approx 3pm) I gave myself 2 doses of Epipen Jr., 25 mg Benadryl, and 20 mg Pepcid.  I started feeling better, thinking clearer.  Approx 10 minutes later I again became slightly confused and anxious and began having increased throat tightness, chest tightness, and cough. After continuing to not improve I went to Urgent Care arriving approx 4 pm.  At that time I was given 40 mg prednisone and another dose (0.3mg) of sq epinephrine.  I immediately had improvement in breathing, thinking, and throat tightness.  I continued to have mild throat clearing and cough for approx 24 hours.

My entire rib cage, inside and out were on a complete flare that I have never felt before. It was hard to breath, not shallow or during extent of deep breath, but in between the two. I was getting false chest pains as the intercostal pain over the chest would flare. This was constant pain that started within 12 hours of the dose. It resolved to about 90% by day 20, however I still have lingering intercostal pain. This may be a flare of my lyme reacting to the vaccine. It is still worth it to get dose 2, but I am not looking forward to the AE&#39;s.

Was driving to work but able to take an Allegra, dizziness was worse while trying to walk. Symptoms subsided 40 minutes after allergy pill, but then returned again around 1pm. Took 20mg of Clairton, again symptoms subsided, but returned again around 5:15pm with fever reaching 100.2 degrees. Took 2 Tylenol Extra Strength Rapid Release for fever and 10mg of Clairton at 7pm. Symptoms subsided, but at this point I had just continued with 4 hour dosing. Today (following day) fever is gone, 24 hour Allegra has one hour left before next dose.

                                                Patient&#39;s received 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine Friday 3/12.  Her husband reported she had not unexpected fatigue,  malaise, and fever for 1 day but better after that.  On Monday she began complaining of shortness of breath.  This progressively worsened and she started having presyncopal episodes.  On Saturday she was unable to come down the stairs in the house so husband planned to take her to the hospital but she stood up and passed out and woke up quickly.  He decided to call EMS.  By the time she presented to our hospital she was cyanotic and agonal breathing.  On moving her from EMS stretcher to ED bed she had PEA cardiac arrest.  She underwent mechanical device CPR with only brief (&lt;1 min) ROSC x1.  She at some point did have a shockable rhythm.  Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.  Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted with some result.  She was transferred to the SICU with increasing pressor requirement, and DIC.  Ultimately, the venous catheter of the ECMO circuit malfunctioned thought to be secondary propagating IVC thrombosis.  Family decided to withdraw care and she passed away.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving injection in right arm I felt a BOOM flush all over my body like I just had an IV Contrast.  Then I became dizzy, my heart started racing, I started cold sweats and felt tightness in my mid upper chest to the base of my throat.  The ED RN on site took my BP and HR and had me lie down because I felt that I couldn&#39;t breath.  She called paramedics who took my BP and HR, then did a 12 lead EKG.  They transported me to the ED.  I was worked up for cardiac, lung, chemistry.  My troponin-HS was slightly elevated and a cardiologist was called.  He did an echo on my heart, liver and right kidney -- normal.  Chest X-ray was normal.  A second 12 lead EKG was done, normal sinus.  Hematology, Chemistry was normal.  Was in the ED from 11:30 to 4:00 p.m.  Advised by ED Doctor, and Cardiologist, that it seems the stress of the anaphylaxis reaction stressed the heart which caused the spill of troponin.  Advised to see my cardiologist and get a stress test.  I have already informed my Primary Care Doctor and he has prescribed me an EPI-PEN to carry.  I have no history of allergic reactions/anaphylaxis reactions to vaccines.  I am up to date with all other vaccines and just had my yearly flu shot in November 2020.  This was my first allergic reaction/anaphylaxis reaction to a vaccine.

Patient also begin feeling lightheaded.  Patient was assessed and was found to  be breathing, but her pulse was weak and thready.  A blood pressure cuff was applied to patient right arm, but the monitor was unable to generate a specific blood pressure number. Patient was administered 0.3 mg of epinephrine intramuscularly in her right thigh. She was also given 10 ml (25 mg) of diphenhydramine.  Patient was moved from the sitting to the supine position.  Patient&#39;s subjective dyspnea improved, and her airway remained intact, with no cyanosis noted. Patient was able to talk normally after a few minutes. Her pulse improved and was strong (&#43;2) about 5 minutes after the epinephrine injection.  911 was called and paramedics arrived about 5 minutes later. Patient was taken away by the paramedics to the hospital, stable and in good condition.

                                                Received injection at 0930 on 12/29/2020 and was observed for 15 minutes after injection.  Around 1630 I developed a headache so I took a Fioricet as I have a history of migraines.  I had a few body aches and only ate toast for supper that night.  By 2330 my headache seemed to be worsening and I started experiencing a fever of 102, tremendous body aches, nausea, sore throat.  At that time I took 500 mg Tylenol at 2330.  By 2 am on 12/30/2020 my fever had reached 103 and I had difficulty walking as my body joints ached so bad.  My headache was unbearable and I asked my husband to drive me to the ER as I could no longer take the pain.  I also was hyperventilating.  In the ER I was given normal saline 500 cc, Tylenol 1000 mg IV, and Zofran 4 mg IV for the nausea.  I did fill prominently better thereafter, except I continued to have a headache. I was given Toradol 30 mg IV and advised not to take my Celebrex that day.  The ER Doctor did call and speak with ER physician, and discussed the validity of lab testing for Covid after vaccination as well as his recommendations as to whether I should receive the second dose of the vaccine. Since I did not really have anaphylaxis, the doctor recommended that I proceed with the second vaccination with extended observation. I was discharged and instructed to take Tylenol 650 mg orally every 4 hours as needed advised for fever/analgesia.

I had trouble saying some words., like my brain and my mouth weren?t communicating effectively.  My heart was racing at times and I was  a little short of breath. All of this subsided a few to a couple hours later. I then just became extremely fatigued,  sometimes light headed, with a slight headache and back ache. My arm hurts a little, but not near as bad as shot one. I ended up taking two days off of work to sleep and recover.

(With 1st dose covid vaccine the throat swelling resolved on it&#39;s own and was more minor. This time it was very clearly swelling!) I took 25 mg Benadryl. It didn&#39;t improve but didn&#39;t get worse.  After about another 20-30 min, the throat started swelling more and numbness and tingling started on the R side of my mouth and face. (This was my primary reaction with the 1st dose.) I took another 25 mg Benadryl. This took affect after 15-20 min. My throat felt better after this but minor swelling remained off and on  for the next several days. Took Benadryl again in the days following vaccination.

                                                Tightening of throat as I was walking to waiting area, chest palpitations, dizziness, fainting, and vomiting.  They were not prepared for this to happen. All people that where were calling anyone to come and help me and finally and ICU doctor came and took over my care asking for benadryl from the pharmacy, a stretcher to take me to ER. Stretcher arrived was put on it and an IV was put in my right arm and the benadryl was administer in which I felt I was burning and turn real red. They then proceeded to take me to ER, where they administered more medicine through the IV.  I was there for about 4 1/2 hours. When i was released my throat was still very tight, felt very fatigue, muscle ached, shortness of breath and dizzy. I was sent home with an EPI PEN, Allegra, and pepcid. I also had a referral to see the allergist doctor who  could see me on Tuesday 1/19/2021 because Monday was a Holiday.

My hands started to feel numb and were tingling, and I felt nauseated . I told the attendant I felt sick and a nurse listened to my heart which was beating at 130 beats per minute, and took my blood pressure (153/94) .After noting my elevated heart rate and blood pressure I still couldn?t catch my breath and was given oxygen by EMS and taken to the local Emergency room.  In the ER my heart rate returned to normal after a few hours, and my blood pressure returned to normal as well.

Subsided before leaving ED, but returned in more mild state the next day - managed by OTC Benadryl and allergy meds. Symptoms returned again at approx 39 hours and returned to Emergency Department again for more IV medications. Asthma attacks - started in the Emergency Department on first day and have continued to today 3/3/2021. Prior to vaccination, I used inhaler approx 1x every 60 days at most.  Have gone more than a year without using one.  After vaccination, used inhaler the same evening and then 12 times the next day, and several times before going to ED again, and have had to use it daily since.  This morning 3/3/2021, woke at apprise 2:30-3:00 am with an attack that needed 2 doses to subside, and then again at 8:30 this am about 1.5 hours after waking.  Burning on tongue with sores on outer sides, metallic/burning/no taste - began 20 minutes after vaccination continuing to today. Rash on face - began in Emergency Department on first day and continues to today. Began using Cortizone yesterday 3/3/2021. Rash and hives on neck, chest - began in Emergency Department on first day and subsided next day after allergy medications in ED and OTC allergy medications that night. Headache - sudden onset 25 minutes after vaccination.  Returned that evening after first ED visit. Returned the following day. Returned the third day. Subsided the fourth day. Used ibuprofen and acetaminophen to manage.

                                                The first day, I had fatigue (tiredness) and  little bit of soreness in the arm of the injection. It was later on that night that I had to use my other arm to get my arm up to a cabinet to reach something. I went to bed early. The next day, still very fatigued, I still had the soreness in the muscle in the injection site arm. 10:30 am at work - it hit me almost like a flu - really quick that I started to feel very bad. Headache - light a migraine - it encompassed my whole head and started having low grade fever and severe nausea and abdominal pain and chills and severe body aches and bone achiness. Extreme fatigue. Side that I got the vaccine in, the glands in my neck and under my arm were swollen.  My fever was never only 100 - but 99.6 is where it usually ran and that was unusual for me to have a fever that high. I had had shingles about two years ago that affected my left side. I started to feel like my shingles was coming back. This felt like it was going to go from trunk all the way up to my neck (the shingles) - it didn&#39;t. I did have a few areas on my trunk area on that left side that did start - like a burning pain - no itchiness but they did go away. I had  flushing feeling - it was worse than a hot flash and different - it was like my body was extremely hot. My coworkers told me that I looked red as a bright red apple - and I wear makeup and had a face mask on. That continued for about 5 days - face, cheeks, especially below my chin, neck and my trunk - just really red. I have a photo of it. There was no pain to it - just hot flushing feeling. That was different from the shingles. The headache never went away - seven days - had trouble sleeping it was painful. It was almost like I had  flu. I had also increased aura migraines - this aura was squiggly lines instead of usual round. I felt like my chest was tight over the weekend. Like it might be going to my chest - Pulsometer - I check my pulse and my blood oxygen level - it went down to about 92 or 94% and I felt  a little short of breath and that lasted about two days.  I did not check my blood pressure.  The only other thing, like if you have the flu for ten days etc which is what my symptoms lasted- but the fatigue lasted another week past these severe intense reactions.

We asked her to stay for more monitoring and gave her some water. At 545pm her symptoms did not improve and we administered 50mg of liquid benadryl.  She asked to go to the emergency room but did not want us to call an ambulance but we called the ambulance at 6pm.  EMS arrived at 6:15 and took her vitals, pulse ox and stated this is a milder reaction and it was up to her to go with them to the hospital.  She refused to go with EMS.  When we followed up with her the next day, she stated she did go to the hospital and was monitored overnight.  They discovered it was because her blood sugar levels were high leading to symptoms.

I called and he said we would continue to monitor her, but let him know ASAP of any changes. She has been our patient for over a decade, so he was familiar with her history. She has a history of going into catatonic state in stressful situations. She was monitored closely, and about 15 minutes later, relayed to me that she was having difficulty breathing. Dr. was called again. and ordered 0.3 mg epinephrine and start IV. Both of these actions were taken and breathing improved quickly after epinephrine was given. Vitals were checked Q 15 throughout the event and remained stable. After about 90 minutes, patient began to talk more clearly. Her respirations became less labored. She told me she could feel her muscles relaxing. She was monitored for another hour and continued to improve. She was sent home with her husband another hour later.

                                                Four hours post vaccine I had muscle and joint pain throughout my entire body and I took 600 mg Advil.  Four hours after that I repeated the 600 mg dose of Advil and went to bed.  I felt feverish and my pain did not diminish despite the medication.  At approximately 2 am I got up to try and cool myself off.  I fainted in my bathroom and fell, hitting my head on the tub, although I did not know this at the time.  I thought I just laid down.  I was unable to get up.  For the next 2 hours I slowly inched myself from the bathroom into the hallway and towards my bed.  I was very cold and in severe pain.  When I reached my bed I finally warmed up and fell asleep.  I was unable to get up out of the bed, except to raise myself on my right elbow to drink a mouthful of water, until approximately 4 pm the following day.   This was 28 hours after the vaccine.  No medications helped my pain, it just slowly subsided on it&#39;s own.      For the next 24 hours I was able to get up and use the bathroom and drink some water and juice but I could not eat or perform any function. I could not even sit up in bed.  When I was able to start eating again I had diarrhea for 24 hours.  It has been 5 complete days since the vaccine.  I am still winded while performing simple cleaning tasks.  I need about 2 hours of rest in bed (twice yesterday) just to get through a day with nothing in it.   I did not expect the level of immobility/illness, unalleviated pain or the seriousness of my second vaccine reaction.

I short episode of shortness of breathe and that went away. I got nausea, felling all of a sudden like crap. I felt like I was hypotensive for the rest of the day. I drove home I ate two eggs on rye bread. I took two Tylenols and took a nap.  I woke up at noon with serve abdominal pain for about an hour. I got out of bed and just couldn&#39;t stay out of bed, I could stand up right, I felt hypotensive. I had to be laying down.  The next morning I woke up with a slamming headache, I took two Tylenol and it went away.  I was ok after that until about day 6 after the vaccine. I had chills and thought i maybe had Covid but tested negative. My arm started swelling up, my whole upper arm was swollen. It was hot to touch and itchy, they thought it was cellulites and put me on medication, after 5 days It wasn&#39;t doing anything and it was getting worse. I went back to the Urgent Care, he had me finish the medication and took Benadryl over the next two days and it started to get better.  I was advised not to get the second shot.

                                                Around 40 minutes after receiving the second COVID19 vaccination, my heart began racing, I was lightheaded, and my tongue began to swell.  I was taken to an observation room, and a my oxygen saturation was checked.  Because my tongue continued to swell, my chest felt tight, and breathing became shallow, I was injected with 50mg of Benadryl.  I asked for this instead of the Epi pen injection.   The constriction in my chest improved a bit and my tongue started to reduce in size.  I was very sleepy and had the shivers.  After a half hour of resting, I was driven home by family.  The next day I had terrible joint pain, fatigue and chills.  Breathing was fine, but I was easily exhausted by any exertion.  Starting the third day, I was at work teaching and noticed a rapid heart rate, increased chest tightness and extreme fatigue from talking or walking the stairs.  The fourth day I had to leave work early because of the lack of breath and fatigue.  I visited my family doctor who gave me Prednisone and a rescue inhaler, and I started taking the medication. The fifth day my symptoms were the same, but I sat at my desk and was able to do paperwork.  The sixth and seventh days I had to get a substitute for my job, as I did not have enough energy or breath to teach or walk the stairs at school.  I have been on vacation from work since Saturday, a full seven days after the vaccination, and continue to have extreme fatigue and chest tightness with any exertion.   Sunday night I went to the Emergency because I could not get a deep breath and felt like I was suffocating. My oxygen levels were high and my blood pressure good, but the muscles in my neck and chest were constricted making me gasp and choke on my spit.  I was given an albuterol treatment and an anti anxiety drug to help relax me so I could breath normally.  I am still struggling with these symptoms of tight chest, constricted breathing, and extreme fatigue.  But now I am sleeping sitting upright and afraid to fall asleep because I may not be able to breath.

                                                At 15:52 this RN was called down to the nurse clinic to evaluate a patient with a reaction after receiving her first dose of the covid shot. Upon my arrival to patient&#39;s side, she was sitting in a chair with complaints of slight shortness of breath and chest tightness. I observed patient for 30 &#43; minutes as her symptoms subsided and she returned to her baseline. See vital signs below. Patient&#39;s blood pressure remained slightly elevated after several rechecks. At 16:45, patient denied any further symptoms and stated she felt better. MD was called with a brief report of these findings and advised that patient be provided with a follow up appointment for a blood pressure check. MD stated ok for patient to go home. Patient was advised to follow up or to go to Urgent Care if symptoms return or become worse. She verbalized an understanding of information provided her. Patient left ambulatory with no distress noted.

                                                Muscle and body aches - right hip and joint pain. I woke up with a sore throat and I had a sore arm the next morning. Thursday, I started getting a cough and that started getting worse and I was sick for about 6 weeks. I was short of breath, extremely tired and coughing. They started me on a Z-pack and Dx&#39;d me with bronchitis at the time. After I finished the Z-pack I went back to Doctor and he put me on another antibiotic for 10 days twice a day  - maybe Augmentin 875. And put me on a dose of Prednisone at the same time. I still had a cough and couldn&#39;t get rid of it. Adver discus twice a day and a Prednisone Taper. I am still on it the Adver. I was out of work for two weeks and had to use my PTO and paid family leave. The symptoms have resolved - but it was 6 weeks. First doctor visits were drive through since I had a cough. I had a total of four doctor visits.

                                                I did experience the common side effects that are listed, fever, chills, headache, pain to site of injection, fatigue, and terrible headaches. The issue that I am concerned about at this time is I am experiencing still pain to my left arm and shoulder area that is like a constant burning pain that radiates to the top of my chest.  .  It is a constant irritation feeling that has not resolved since my 2nd shot.  My chest feels the same way and feels like a kind of heavy sensation to it.  I still do experience headache and fatigue that is not normal to me.   When I exercise I experience some shortness of breathe  that is not my normal upon exertion.  I did have Covid July 4, 2020.  I did experience headaches, body aches, chills, however I never ran a fever or nor did I have a cough.  I had pretty mild symptoms.  I feel my symptoms completed resolved.  When I had the 2nd vaccination I felt worse than when I actually had Covid.  My major concern is the pain in my left shoulder and the shortness of breathe that I have.  I feel that it has been an issue that developed when I was vaccinated.  I had a CXR in September due to a surgery I had to have, at that time there are no documented issues of my chest at that time.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient informed me she was having difficulty breathing. She was gasping for air but able to speak. As we pulled an epipen from our emergency kit, I asked the patient to remove her mask to assess for swelling of lips and tongue--no swelling of lips or tongue were present. We administered an epipen and called 911. The patient&#39;s symptoms resolved within a minute. The patient did not have any more difficulty breathing while waiting for the paramedics. When paramedics arrived, they assessed the patient who said she felt perfectly fine. The patient remained symptom free and paramedics cleared the patient to leave the pharmacy and return home.

I began to get little red dots on both of my lower legs a total of about 10. They began really light and over the night got brighter and bigger. I went to the doctor the next morning and was given a prescription for a steroid and antibiotic which I first took at 2000 hours on 12/31/2020. By the next evening my dots began to get lighter. As of today all but one have faded away. The one I have is really light. I did have some of the usually listed symptoms, slight headache, runny nose, hard to breathe.

                                                I got the vacine today.  Unfortunately I did have a reaction, and had to cancel my patient load at work for the day.  They said if you have food allergies you might have one, but I was willing to risk it.  They observed me for 30 min after.  After 15 min it felt like I was having a mild panick attack, but I?m used to that so I just breathed through it.  Coughed a few times.  After 30 min got up and was whoozy/dizzy, but shrugged it off, got my card and walked slowly to my car, drove 5 min home.  By then my hands were shaking hard.  It was like being shot with a crapload of adrenaline.  I called my sister and when I talked I started sobbing.  I don?t know, I just couldn?t stop.  But I knew it was just the adrenaline and if I could calm down, I?d get thru it.  She was awesome bc she kept her voice soft and low when she spoke, which helps.  After 3 hours it has calmed down and I?m just really cold and exhausted and nauseous and only a little shaky.  Being quiet and calm is helping.  Also sitting on a heating pad bc it?s 74 in my apartment and I?m freezing cold.  I?ll be ok by end of day.  I got the Moderna vacine and I?m still glad I did and thankful I could get it....but to those who are getting it...symptoms are that it feels like being shot full of adrenaline, you get a panic attack, but my O2 actually went up, not down.  Chest pain, panting, high anxiety, shaking, nausea, dizziness.

                                                Upon waking the next day I suddenly felt very ill, I was short of breath, had chills and was too weak to care for myself.  I had been diagnosed with COVID in June and was very ill with that.  This felt exactly like I did when I had COVID.   Throughout the day I ran a fever around 102.  My ability to think or care for myself was greatly impaired.  I continue to fight fatigue and brain fog.  I then developed several cold sores outside and in my mouth.  I continue to battle fatigue and weakness but am improving and now back to work.  I do not plan to get a second dose as I am afraid of a stronger reaction that would require emergency care.

                                                I woke up the next morning (about 6am) with nausea/chills/fever (100.9)/headache/eyes were burning. I had to go to ED after getting to work(at 7:30am) due to SOB/elevated heart rate of 145-150bpm/101.6 temp (upon arrival to ED)/chills/nausea/headache. I was given IV fluids (2 liters), Zofran for nausea, Toradol for pain/headache, Tylenol for fever. I was in the ED for about 4-4 1/2 hours. My right eye has a large &#34;blood shot&#34; area that wasn&#39;t there until I took the vaccine also. I was found to still have a count of &#34;34&#34; on my Covid antibody blood test. The ED physician stated that was probably the reason I had the reaction was because I still had antibodies. I tested positive for Covid on Sept 19, 2020 and took the vaccine #1 1/11/2021 (almost 120 days from positive Covid test). If I had known I was going to have any type of reaction because I still had antibodies, I would have waited a few more weeks/months to get the vaccine. This should really be looked into. I am now very scared to receive the 2nd vaccine because of the side effects that has been reported after the 2nd vaccine. I really need good advice about what to do about 2nd vaccine.

                                                I had extreme pain at the injection site that afternoon that then included my arm from elbow to top of my shoulder.  That pain continued with the area very hot and difficult to lift my arm (which continued until Saturday, 1/30/21.)  After being asleep, I woke at about 10:50 pm, abruptly to racing heart beat, sense of tingling/numbness inside ears, feeling of swollen tongue (back of tongue) and then later feeling of tightness in throat. This was just less than 12 hours after my vaccination.   I sat upright sipping cold liquids for approx 2 hrs and sensations faded.   Next day I had headache, fatigue and felt extremely cold later in day for several hours. Occasional dizziness for the next 2 days with chills.

                                                After I received the shot I went to the observation room. I could feel the shot move from my left arm (where I got the shot) to my right arm and down to my hand. After 10 minutes I felt the shot go down both legs at the same time and come back up close to my chest. About 5 minutes after that sensation, my chest got a little tight and I was having a hard time breathing and the right side of my face started to tingle. I looked down at my hands and the finger tips of my right hand were blue.  I raised my hand and the nurse came over and took me to the back room. I thought maybe my hands were dirty, so I washed them off. My right fingertips were still blue.   I could feel tingles all over the right side of my face and my lips went a little numb. I kept pressing them together to see if that would help. My throat started to feel swollen and the nurses gave me some benedryl.  I left after an hour and went home. The tingling on the right side of my face stayed with me for another 2 days.  I have no known allergies.  That was my experience.

                                                Severe muscle and joint pain began 2/2/21, along with fever, headache and mild nausea.  MSK symptoms progressed over the next 24 hours to include intense fatigue and pain chiefly of the larger joints and muscle groups.  On 2/4/21 at approx. 1100, I developed severe ballooning chest pain, SOB and pain with breathing.  I was clammy and tachycardic. The balloon like pressure subsided and was replaced by a sharp right sternal pain.  I was taken to a local ER where major pathologies were ruled out.  While there I developed a painful cough as well. I was diagnosed with non specific chest pain and sent home.  Since then I have continued to have excursional/ pleuritic type chest pain,  intermittent headaches and pain involving the smaller joints and muscle groups, such as wrist/ forearm, scalp and neck.  The larger joints and muscle groups remain achy and stiff.  I am still experiencing intense fatigue.

                                                A few hours after the vaccine I developed a fever, dizziness, chills, severe headache and had night sweats.  It was if my whole body was swollen and just to move had me in tears because my body was so sore. The arm pain was there but not as bad as from the first vaccine.  I developed SOB and have had to start using my asthma pump which I hadnt had to use in over 3 years.  I have been off work since 1/3 from the AE experienced to both vaccinations and to date I am still experiencing breathing issues. I have been developing intermitten fevers off and on throughout this  whole time. An the fatigue has been awful.   I havent been able to stay awake long and as of yesterday was the first day I have been able to stay awake for an extended period of time.

That&#39;s when I notified one of the nurses. They checked my blood pressure. I vaguely remember hearing it was high (189/?). They called 911 and the paramedics came. Shortness of breath became worse and chest pains started. The paramedic gave me Benadryl and then epinephrine since I was increasingly getting worse. I was shaking  and I felt lethargic. I could not control the shaking and I felt cold. I do not remember a lot of details when I got to the Emergency Room. Looking at my record they gave me: LORazepam (ATIVAN), methylPREDNISolone sod suc(PF)(SOLU-MEDROL) and famotidine. I went home that night with the condition that I see my primary care physician. I felt like I have the flu and soreness of arm the next couple days. I went back to work after four days.

When I received dose 2 on 1/20/2021, I did well but later in the middle of the night felt foggy, severe arm pain, and kept asking my husband if I was in an earth quake.  That next day I had sever arm pain, extreme fatigue all day and the fatigue got worse as the day went on to the point I felt like I couldn&#39;t walk even though I could walk from the fatigue.  On Day 3, I felt fine just little arm pain. On Day 4, some fatigue only.  On Day 5, my arm became hot to touch, swollen, severe redness and itching.  The rest of that  week some fatigue but bearable until Day 8, I felt extremely fatigue.  Since then I have had 1-2 episodes a week of extreme fatigue that lasts about an hour or two for no reason.  I also have had some wheezing but comes and goes but that is better now.

As I was also experiencing severe pain in my left arm, I did not feel as if I could drive.  I called 911 and EMS arrived.  The EMS technicians assessed me and I was convinced at the time that I was not having an allergic response that was keeping me from getting adequate oxygen.  I took 800mg of ibuprofen and 100 mg of Benadryl before calling 911.  I went to sleep after EMS left.  I continued to feel achy and sick until the following Tuesday.  Wednesday, 2/24/21, I had a good day until around 9:30pm when I started having severe pain in the area of my stomach.  I slept that night and then felt like I had pain in my stomach area off and on with lesser severity until the evening of Monday March 1st.  Around 10 pm, I started feeling severe pain in my abdomen.  Throughout this time, I had severe diarrhea.  On March 2nd, I went in to see my GI doctor who I had seen previously for chronic constipation due to a side effect from the trazadone I take for sleep.

When I woke up on the second day after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with a great amount of pressure in my head and a massive headache.  On the 3rd day after the vaccine, I got up and ready for work.  about 45 minutes into work, I was short of breath and light headed.    I did have a positive Covid result on Dec 31 so I still have the antibodies.

I was immediately evaluated and given an injection of Benadryl and began to feel relief of symptoms. I was allowed to wait an additional 20 minutes and left after having another evaluation and had my blood pressure  checked.

                                                Immediate (non-severe?) allergic reaction. I received the first dose of the Modern covid vaccine, injected into my left arm. I went to sit for the mandatory 15 minute &#34;observation&#34; period, sitting with a couple of my coworkers who were being vaccinated at this time as well. After approximately two minutes, I started feeling a little light-headed and had slight difficulty breathing. I mentioned it to my coworkers and they suggested I take off my mask (masks were required for everyone). I did so and took a couple deep breaths which made me feel better. I put my mask back on and continued chatting with my coworkers. About 5 minutes later I felt the same, slight difficulty breathing again, but thought it was probably due to my mask, so I repeated - mask off, deep breaths - and felt better. As a precaution, I stayed in the observation area for 30 minutes with one my coworkers, but did not experience any other problems. Feeling a little shaky but otherwise okay, I left at that point and walked to my car. Once in the car, I took off my mask and took more deep breaths. Feeling okay, I started my drive home (approx 7 minutes). About halfway on the drive I felt a slight difficulty in breathing again, so I rolled down the window, took deep breaths. Arriving home, I told my husband I felt &#34;a little weird&#34;. My throat felt slightly swollen, the back of my neck felt stiff, my lips felt a bit numb, my face felt tingly and my jaw felt tight. It was about 2:45 at this point. I felt the outside of my throat with my fingers and realized my tonsils were quite swollen. My husband felt them, too, and agreed. However, nothing was visibly swollen in my face or neck, only felt inwardly. I still felt a bit shaky and had an occasional metallic taste in my mouth. I drank some water and laid down, with my feet slightly elevated. My husband stayed with me, both of us monitoring my symptoms in case anything got worse and medical attention was needed, but nothing got worse. My symptoms stayed at this level for the next few hours. I sat up occasionally and continued to drink water. I would get occasional waves of slight difficulty in breathing, but would take deep breaths and that would help. My airway never felt constricted, I just felt like I need a bit more oxygen. By early evening, I was feeling a little tired, but was able to eat dinner without problem and by about 8pm I was feeling a bit better. The swelling in my tonsils had subsided a little at this point and the waves of difficulty in breathing were getting much less often and milder. I slept through the night without problem. In the morning, however, I did not feel very well. I felt quite fatigued and had a little difficulty breathing again, but no worse than before. My arm was pretty sore from the injection, but no other symptoms had developed otherwise. By about 11am, I started feeling better, and by about 1:00pm I felt much better. I had low energy, but I otherwise felt good the rest of the day and slept fine again that night. This morning (day two) I again felt some fatigue and had a little difficulty breath at times, but by mid-morning I felt much better and have continued feeling a little low in energy, but otherwise okay so far. It is now 6:30pm on day two.

Continuing to take Benadryl every 6 hours which helps the headache and scratchy throat.

They ran out, so the second dose was given at pharmacy at 3:00pm.   1st dose - dizziness and racing heartbeat started 10 minutes after injection and subsided about 40 minutes after injection. THe 2nd dose the following symptoms started 45 minutes after the injection -shortness of breath, neck and chest flush, tingling on back of tongue, racing heartbeat, feeling extremely dizzy and feeling like I am going to pass out.  The symptoms subsided about 90 minutes after the injection.  The racing heartbeat and tingling on the tongue came and went off and on for 72 hours. I broke out with shingles about 48 hours after receiving the 2nd dose.

I have a history of SVT&#39;s - but after vaccine the palpations felt with SVT&#39;s increased in frequency and lengthy. Heart rate was in the 90&#39;s- 110&#39;s at rest most of the time.  Had chest discomfort by day 3 post vaccine. On Feb 8th- late night began to have left chest pain, left arm/jam tingeling, and shortness of breath.   In addition to this had weakness, fatigue, muscle aches, pain at injection site, headache- started on January 30th 2021 and worsened over the next several days.  ** Immediate symtoms not reported at the vaccine site as I thought they would go away on own.

I was given 50 mg of Benadryl by injection and then began developing hives. Another 25 mg of Benadryl was given. I became dizzy and nauseous and when i stood up, the room went black and I passed out. I was then transported to the ER by ambulance.

                                                Vaccine was given and while scheduling second vaccine I noticed my tongue and gums itching then my throat (?? trachea) began to tighten.  Not knowing if these symptoms were the vaccine, wearing of a face mask, or just slight anxiety, once I finished scheduling my next vaccine appointment, I took my seat and sat for the 15-minute observation time.  The itching and tightness did not seem to get too much worse so when my 15-minute observation time was up, I left the building, called my mom, and headed back to work.  Removing the mask and having a drink of water did not alleviate my symptoms, so my mom suggested I go back to the clinic at the fairgrounds and have them assess my symptoms.   I was escorted to the back of the building where Dr was.  After a brief examination and asking questions, Dr had me lie down on a cot and he monitored my blood pressure and oxygen while continuing to ask questions about how I feel and any new symptoms I may have.  He said my oxygen and blood pressure were great.  I was shaking/body tremor pretty much the whole time I was lying on the cot.  Neither of the original symptoms, tongue and gum itching and tightening of throat, ever really subsided.  I was thirsty and I began to feel nauseous, and on a couple of occasions thought I was going to vomit, but only had dry heaving.  (Note: I am not aware of the time and how long it was from beginning to end, when I was given something to when ems arrived, to when I arrived at hospital.)   Sometime later, my throat was a bit sore and I felt like something was tickling or in the back of my mouth.  Dr examined the location, and upon looking, called for a nurse and the next thing I know, I now have a throbbing headache and Dr was administering an EpiPen Injection to my upper thigh.   At this point, I was still nauseous, pounding on the right side of my head near eye socket, still having body tremors, and ready to fall asleep.  Dr explained that my Uvula and soft palate had double in size and that I was having an allergic reaction and will need to go by ems to the local hospital for observation. I tried to refuse, but was told it was protocol.   Several people looked inside my mouth. I was given a pill that dissolved on my tongue.  My head stopped pounding and I was no longer nauseous once I was in the ems.  I do not remember when the itching and tightness of my throat went away, but it was before I arrived at the hospital.    Once I arrived at the hospital, the only thing that hurt was my upper left thigh where Dr administered the EpiPen and I still had small body tremors. Two separate nurses tried to give me an IV, but both were only successful at blowing out my veins. I refused an IV after the second attempt. The nurse gave me, what she said was 3 steroid pills (Decadron??) and ½ of some other pill that will coat my stomach and protect it from steroid pills.  They allowed me to walk on my own without observation to and from the bathroom down the hall.  Sometime later in the emergency room, the itching of my tongue and gums came back and the tightness in my throat returned.  The staff at the hospital did not feel concerned enough to even examine me after I mentioned the return of the symptoms.  After about an hour, I was told I could go home, but they later came back and said I had not been there long enough and had to stay.  It was around 7:30 pm when I was able to leave and go home.  Saturday and Sunday, I was very fatigued.  Monday and Tuesday my hips and legs feel very weak and wobbly and I have pain going from my right hip down past my knee on the outside of my leg.

                                                First, my heart raced, then I felt flushed, then my throat and tongue swelled to point I could not swallow or breathe freely without sticking my tongue out of my mouth.  I took benadryl liqui-gel and waited to see if it would kick in. It took about 25 minutes for my tongue to go down to the point where I could fully swallow. My throat remained so swollen I looked like a frog for 36 hours and, now after about 52 hours, it is finally going down. It&#39;s still swollen, but not in an obstructive way.

I was fine for about 15-20 minutes then chest and arms turned bright red and I got all over itches.  Tongue started to tingle.  Itches and redness began to spread.  My heart rate and blood pressure when way up.  The ambulance was called.  I was going to ride with my husband to the hospital but then I got faint feeling and began to puke, along with a tightness in my throat so the ambulance took me and gave me an epi shot and benedryl and took me to the ER.

                                                7 AM 3/25/2021 - Patient called out to husband from the bathroom where she experienced a syncopal event, then passed out.  An ambulance was called and she was revived for a short period of time.  She was taken to Hospital where she coded 3 times.  She was then life-flighted to second Hospital.  According to the hospital records, tests conducted over the course of several days determined that she had no neurological activity.  Initial reports in the records indicate pulmonary embolism, cardiac and respiratory arrest.  She was on life support for the remainder of her time.  Organ donation is being pursued at present and results of this are pending at time of this report submission.  Date of death is unknown until organ retrieval is accomplished.  Family will be contacted in the next few days to ask further questions about any other kinds of vaccine-related reactions that may have happened more immediately to days after the vaccination on 3/17/2021.  A co-worker thought that she had shortness of breath for 3-4 days before this critical event occurred on 3/25/2021.

                                                The moment I received the vaccine, my throat immediately tightened, but I could breathe fine. It just caught my attention. I pulled forward for the required 15-minute wait.  The end of my tongue became numb, so I told the observing staff what was happening. As I was talking, I became light-headed, dizzy. I was told to drive over to the nurse station. I was able to drive slowly, down the parking aisle to the nurse station. She watched me for 15 minutes.   Before releasing me, she told me to report to the nurse station after I get the 2nd vaccine shot for 30-minute observation.                   The numbness faded. I was light-headed for a few hours. I had a headache when I woke up the next morning, lasting most of the day. The next few days  I had a sore arm, as expected.

Approx 10 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose # 1, patient was still in vaccine clinic area and complained of dizziness, palpitations and flushing.  I observed patient fanning herself with papers.  She was escorted out of the immediate clinic room, and assessed by paramedics present as having an anaphylactic reaction.  Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV given in clinic, Rapid Response was called overhead and patient immediately transported down the hall to the Emergency Dept. In ED, pt was noted as having swollen tongue, large areas of erythema on face, arms and chest, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness (per ED physician notes).  Pt reported being hospitalized in ICU with COVID disease more than 3 months ago, including intubation (not treated at this hospital), and has been back at work since August 2020.  ED physical exam noted bilateral wheezing and patient in acute distress.  In ED, pt administered racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL via neb, epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV and epinephrine 5 mg/250 mL IV drip (started at 0.118 mcg/kg/min).  Acute symptoms reported to resolve in ED.  COVID test was negative.  ED physician discovered that pt had history of multiple medications, including previous anaphylactic reaction to radiocontrast dye requiring intubation (which was not disclosed on the vaccine screening form).  Pt admitted to Telemetry floor for observation.   Overnight course was unremarkable, and patient was discharged the following day with prescription for Prednisone taper and prescription for Epi-pen.  Advised not to return for second dose of COVID vaccine.  EMR updated to reflect possible anaphylactic reaction to Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                Thursday January 7, 2021: Developed a hard lump around the injection site (A week to the day later).  Friday January 8, 2021: Arrived at work and around 9:30 felt short of breath. Had pulse and oxygen checked anyway; Pulse 99 (down from 107) and Oxygen 99. Dismissed it as being in my head. Proceeded through my day and it persevered.  After lunch, still felt short of breath. Contacted Infection Control nurse and was advised to leave work as it was also a COVID symptom.  Went home around 12:15; felt fatigued. Slept all day and night. Saturday January 9, 2021: Minor sore throat, feel as if coming down with a cold.  Back of sinuses felt hot upon breathing.  Bump at injection site gone completely (I massaged it Thursday and Friday). Minor discomfort with breathing; barely noticeable. In the afternoon time around 2pm, sudden and urgent diarrhea that lasted into the evening hours at bed.  Top of stomach burning (inside body). Diarrhea stopped, but nausea remained.  At bedtime, still felt as if coming down with a cold. Sunday January 10, 2021: Woke up feeling as if I was getting over a cold.  Nose stuffy on the side I slept on. Throughout the day, had the sniffles as the stuffiness went away.  Stomach still off; feeling nauseous.  No diarrhea (no bowel movement at all).  Throughout the afternoon tightness in chest/shortness of breath returned.  Towards the evening time still felt as if getting over a cold.  Contacted Human Resources and voice appeared hoarse. Ended phone call.  Touched my face and noticed a huge lump on my chin that felt like the lump at injection site.  Felt like a cyst. About 20 minutes later began to have difficulty swallowing; throat felt tight.  Drank a bottle of water and took two allergy pills with antihistamine.  An hour and a half after taking these,  tightness in throat is still present, but has not progressed any further; in fact, it appears to be slowly fading away.  (It&#39;s more like the feeling of having a &#34;lump in your throat&#34; (but I can&#39;t physically feel a lump).  The lump on my chin has noticeably diminished in size and is less painful to the touch. COVID test is scheduled for 1/11/21 at 10:30am. It feels as if my body is doing a &#34;systems check.&#34;

Patient was told that it was an anaphylactic reaction and shouldn&#39;t have been managed at home as a child by nurse and should have been taken to the hospital. Patient was told they would be monitored for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. Within 2-3 minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient reported tingling or burning around the site of injections. Within 5 minutes they stated to be feeling tired and that their arm had felt numb. After this the patient began starring into the distance and was unresponsive. Called for help and advice by turning around as patient had syncoped. Got nurses and other team members attention and had an epi-pen ready just in case it was needed. Patient began having notable distress with respiration and administed an epi-pen. Advised for a nurse to call EMS for patient and crash cart/oxygen was also obtaine dby the facility. Oxygen was required. Patient was not responsive after the first dose and was given a second as they remained un-alert with notable distress.

Mild wheezes heard.  BP was 223/119, Pulse 73, RR 24, spo2 95% using 2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula. Repeated BP confirmed similar results. Gave Benadryl IV, solumedrol, and epi 0.1 mg. After epi was given, pt started to throw up and c/o headache. Gave zofran IV.  BP did come down to 159/100, she says she did not feel the throat swelling any longer, and wheezing disappeared. Left clinic alert, and verbally responsive to Emergency department for further management.

Within 36 hours I developed a &#34;rash&#34; that was later diagnosed as petechiae. Labs were ordered immediately and my platelet level was 66,000. The hematologist that was consulted with had me report to the emergency room for further tests. I was informed not to injure myself in anyway with a count that low or I could hemorrhage and die.

                                                After the vaccine was administered to me, 5 minutes later I developed a strong tickle in my throat which later turned into a cough and I was trembling. Due to the excessive cough my throat was a little swollen. I was given 2 bottles of water while the nurse  monitored my oxygen level and heart rate. I was told that I may have to go downstairs to the ER to receive some medicine if the coughing didn&#39;t subside and if my throat continued to swell. I had some power mints in my purse so I asked if I could suck on it to see if it would help. After an additional 20 minutes being monitored the mint helped and I told the nurse that I would go to CVS to buy some Benadryl and that&#39;s exactly what I did.. I slept the entire day from 3;30 until 6:30, I got up to eat dinner and I went back to sleep and slept until 9:00 am on Sunday. I was so exhausted on Sunday and until today Monday, January 25th.

The night of the injection my arm hurt, a bruise was present and a large lump (1 inch by 2 inches) was present. Blood was also in the band aid ( 1 drop) applied to the injection site. The night of, I had shortness of breath, and severe right eye socket pain. I also had tenderness on the right and left side of the tongue. The injection site swelling and tongue pains were significantly reduced by 01/24/201.  On 1/26/2021 I visited my eye doctor who took pictures of my eyes to confirm no internal injury since pain around the sockets was still present . I have been prescribed eye drops. If the pain does not go way as of 1/28/2021 I will revisit my eye doctor.

                                                Was performing a COVID vaccine clinic at a skilled nursing facility.  The patient states that at approximately 5 minutes after admin of her second shot, she started feeling short of breath. The nurse ran over to monitor her and take her BP. I arrived as well to monitor. Her breathing appeared fast and labored but patient was alert and oriented. She had no localized reaction to the vaccine. The patient&#39;s lungs were auscultated and were clear. Her glucose was checked, it was &#34;low&#34; for the patient at 80.  She stated the center of her chest was radiating pain and her hands went numb. Her BP was 161/93 and HR 65 and OSAT was 94 but this was close to her normal range. Epinephrine was not administered - but instead diphenhydramine 25 mg. The patient reported feeling better at 12 minutes post immunization and her breathing improved. Her chest pain went away and numbness went away. The patient also ate a donut and drank a glass of water at this time and stated she felt much better. Her BP again at 15 minutes post immunization was 158/96 and HR was 61 and OSAT was 100. Monitored patient for 20 more minutes and no other issues were experienced. The patient is being paired with a nurse from the facility to monitor the rest of the day.   After discussing with the pharmacist who reviewed the consent forms, it was noted that the patient marked yes on the portion that asks the patient if they&#39;ve received a blood transfusion in the last year.

I was short of  breath and my heart was racing. i could not sleep all night due to up and down trying to settle my heart rate.  I was very thirsty during the night as well.  I ended up going to the ER the following day around 930am due to unrelieved tachycardia and sob. My headache continued. MY EKG showed PVC&#39;s, tachycardia and my triponin was slightly elevated on two different blood tests. I am now 7 days out and still have nagging headache, some sob and my heart races at times. When i talk alot, I become Short of breath.

                                                Patient post vaccine administration approx 20 minutes. Reported feelinging tightness in chest, spreading to throat. Patient was taken to observation portion of clinic. Patient was hypoxic in 70&#39;s. Supplemental oxygen applied. Oxygen saturation increased to 88. Epipen administered and albuterol nebulizer treatment started while waiting for ED/Rapid response team to arrive. Patient transferred to ED for further observation.  From the physician that treated the patient: &#34;It was a bit of a bizarre presentation. She reported throat tightness after the vaccine. She had a completely normal exam and no other complaints. no signs of airway/oral/pharyngeal abnormality. no respiratory abnormality. Unfortunately she was significantly hypoxic when I took her vitals. as low as 76%. Good waveform. I even checked the pulse ox on myself because I didn&#39;t believe it. In addition, with supplemental oxygen, her sats went up. I had to pull the trigger and treat her even though she looked well and I had no objective exam findings to explain her profound hypoxia. She received IM Epinepherine and Albuterol neb. By the time she was in ED she was satting 100% and her throat tightness resolved. So, not sure how to answer your question. Clinically I pulled the trigger and treated her for anaphylaxis following a vaccine administration. I wish it was a problem with my sat monitor but I don&#39;t believe it was. I was using a life-pack with wave form and verified with two other people that the O2 saturation function was working properly. Intuitively, it doesn&#39;t make sense but I think we should probably consider it a reaction to the vaccine. &#34;

I had a hysterectomy 3 months ago that had several fibroids, cysts and polys and Type 3 endometriosis.

She was given benadryl and utilized her home albuterol inhaler. She asked to be taken to the ED. In the ED patient received albuterol nebulizer (@1327), epinephrine 0.3 mg (@1345), famotidine 20 mg (@1327) and methylprednisolone 125 mg (@1327). She was discharged with a prednisone prescription.  Symptoms seemed to improve with albuterol and steroids. Epinephrine did not seem to improve symptoms. Patient was discharged with a diagnosis of asthma exacerbation.   Patient reported to ED again on 2/9 with feelings of lightheadedness and palpitations. All diagnostic evaluations were negative. Increased heart rate contributed to prednisone use for previous mentioned asthma exacerbation.

                                                Very soon after receiving the shot, my throat began to feel tight and I told my husband it felt funny.  Within about 45 minutes, it hurt swallow, more than any sore throat I have ever had.  It wasn&#39;t like a dry, scratchy sore throat, it was almost like ti was on the outside of my throat.  Had the clinic that gave me the shot kept me for monitoring, they would have been able to catch this reaction but they didn&#39;t.  When I called them they told me it could be 24 hours before I would get a call back so I went to the ER because I was afraid I was having an allergic reaction of some type.  The ER monitored me for 3 hours and then released me.  About 12 hours later, the pain in my throat and when swallowing began to subside.

                                                Jan 6, 2021 - on the day of the shot I had arm pain, moderate to severe headache, body aches and  lethargy which continued for the next 3 days.  Then on the 4th day I lost my sense of taste, but only for the day and also experienced shortness of breath going up stairs for the next 2 days.  Jan 26, 2021 @0 Days after my first dose I had an episode of Super Ventricular Tachycardia and went to the hospital because it wouldn&#39;t stop. After about 2 hours my heart rate converted on its own. Feb 3, 2021- I received my 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. Feb 4, 2021- I had a low grade fever of 99.6 with the chills and body aches. Feb 17, 2021- I returned to the ER with SVT that again would  not stop. This time they had to convert my heart rhythm  using Adenosine.  March 4, 2021- had an Echocardiogram to check heart because the  hospital doctor said the chest x-ray they took showed an enlarged heart and  the ultrasound they did showed fluid around my heart.  The echocardiogram  showed a moderate Pericardial Effusion   I am attributing these issues to the Covid Vaccine since I have not had any SVT or other issues since 2008. AND my personal nurse practitioner said she had the same reaction.

                                                Within 6 hours I had overwhelming headache with injection site pain that radiated up to my ear and down to my elbow. I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

My blood pressure dropped to 87/57 (normally have high BP).  I had a hard time catching my breath.  These symptoms came in waves about every 15 minutes.  I was monitored for 2 hours until I felt well enough to go home.  I arrived at home a little after 5:00 pm and started having a very bad migraine.  I had fever, (101.8) chills, and trouble walking.  My legs felt like they weighed 100 pounds each.  Every joint in my body ached. I was extremely lethargic for the remainder of the evening.  The next day, 03/10/2021 I continued to suffer from the same symptoms as I had on the first day.  I was unable to return to work.  I could  not drive safely.  I attempted to be active and it resulted in being dizzy and very faint.  The migraines are incredibly painful  I have had migraines for years but these were the worst I have ever experienced.  I am now on day 3 (03/11/2021) and I am still unable to work. I have extreme fatigue and headaches. I am reporting this event to hopefully help in research of the vaccine.  I believe in science and will do whatever is asked of me to help this progress.

                                                Within 2.5 hours after taking the second injection I started coughing , wheezing and chest tightness. Within another 2 hours pressure in my neck and head with a bad headache as well.  By the next morning body aches, severe headache with  pain in my neck and chest like aching all over. By that evening chills, fever and body aches and a dull headache. The second day neck stiffness and mild body aches but overall feeling much better.    Treatment used:When the coughing and bronchial spasms  and wheezing started I used my inhaler twice in total, used menthol cough drops and peppermint to help with the shortness of breath and wheezing. I then took a Vistaril just in case it was  an allergic reaction. I have not had an asthma attack in several years since i started utilizing daily essential oils. So this is not normal for me. I used Ibuprofen 800 mg and Tylenol ,migraine combination in conjunction with essential oils and ice packs for the headaches, body aches and so forth.

                                                Neurological response/trigger  - severe leg pain and weakness in both legs. Extremely difficult to walk and not able to climb stairs.  Disrupted sleep (woke up in pain throughout the night). This lasted for a couple of weeks, the worst (debilitating) being 48 hours from initial onset.  I also had difficulty breathing and nausea about 15m after injection which lasted for about 24 hours, then subsided.   I contacted my neurologist, Dr., early next morning, and notified her of what happened and she advised that I increase the dosage of gabapentin until symptoms resolved. After 48 hours, I began to walk without experiencing so much pain and weakness, and it slowly subsided over the course of a couple of weeks. I still experience flares of pain in both of my legs periodically.

                                                Rash started small area on my right arm (opposite arm of injection) - like eczema red; raised; itchy spot. As a couple of days went I got more and more spots. Sent pictures to my Dr - Pityriasis Roseola - Went to see dermatologist - he diagnosed me with the same thing (January 19th). He gave me cream for it - it was all over my entire body by the time I saw him. It was like a red petechiae rash over my whole body. I usd the cream as instructed per doctor. The following week on that Monday, I was short of breath and not feeling right and I worked. But next day I only worked a couple of hours and went home. I started having vomiting and diarrhea - I went to the ER twice - 1st time they diagnosed - Viral infection - and they discharged me and didn&#39;t give me anything but told me to rest and they pushed fluids. The second time I went - they gave me medication and they said it might help with the pain in my  abdomen. They didn&#39;t do much. I had gone to ER - was there for four and half hours waiting to be seen but didn&#39;t get seen. Two days after second ER visit - I went back to the hospital  on January 26 and was admitted for heart failure and that is when cardiac symptoms occurred.

My arm is quite sore and stiff, and the welt is red and hot to the touch. About 24 hours later, I&#39;m developing very mild wheezing. (Oops. I forgot to add in the &#39;allergies&#39; section that I get a similar reaction to getting 30&#43; mosquito bites at once.)

I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

Now upper lung feels pain. Difficulty taking deep breath.  Day 7: went to ER. Couldn?t move left arm without severe jabbing pain to left lung. Can?t take deep breath. Hurts to even take short breath. Pressure in left shoulder and lung.

Symptoms resolved pretty abruptly at 72 hours. 2nd dose 2/12/21.  Again symptoms within 12 hours.  fever up to 103, chills, headache, extreme fatigue, body aches, coughing, increased oxygen demand.  Initial symptoms lingered over 14 days.  On 2/25 was prescribed 20mg prednisone for 5 days which resulted in slight improvement.  Then continued to slowly decline again with increased fatigue, chest pain,  more shortness of breath.  Saw pulmonologist on 3/10.  Referred to cardiologist and echo on 3/11 with concern for heart failure.  Echo on 3/11 showed acute right sided heart failure, new diagnosis.  Cardiologist and pulmonologist both state that I reacted with severe symptoms to first dose of vaccine but recovered.  2nd dose I just could not recover from and with my compromised lungs from post-acute covid syndrome, wound up with heart failure.

                                                The vaccine was administered and the patient said they were starting to feel lightheaded within 2 minutes of receiving it. The patient then fainted in the chair with their head back and their tongue out of their mouth. I was trying to wake the patient up to clarify whether the patient was having trouble breathing or if any part of her mouth or throat was swelling, but I could not wake the patient. Both arms were very red. It sounded like labored breathing for about 30 seconds once I got in the room and then the patient stopped making noise. I could not hear any breaths so I administered one dose of 0.3 mg epinephrine in an Epipen.

                                                Graves disease; shortness of breath; tachycardia; A spontaneous report was received from a health professional concerning a 49-years-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and had graves disease (basedow&#39;s disease), shortness of breath (dyspnoea), tachycardia  No medical history was provided. No concomitant medications were provided.  On 12 Feb 2021, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided), intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 12 Feb 2021, the patient developed tachycardia and shortness of breath. On 13 Feb 2021, she had medical evaluation done that showed she did not have a pulmonary embolus. On 23 Feb 2021, lab data showed undetectable thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). On 01 Mar 2021, she had full set of thyroid function tests that still showed an undetectable TSH and elevated free T4 and a total T3. She was confirmed to have Graves&#39; disease (medically significant) based off elevated thyroid stimulating immunoglobulins.  The patient had been started on treatment.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.   The outcome of the events of graves disease (basedow&#39;s disease), shortness of breath (dyspnea), tachycardia was unknown.  The reporter assessed the events to be possibly related to the study drug.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On Friday, March 12, I received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I experienced coughing, wheezing and tightness in the chest at 4:00 pm. I treated the symptoms with an inhaler and it went away. At 6:00 pm, I experienced headaches, redness and puffiness in the eyes and eyelids were warm. I began to sneeze and sinus congestion such as seasonal allergies. I also experienced a headache, which I treated with Tylenol. These other side effects lasted until Sunday, March 14 at about 7:00 pm. On Monday, March 15 at 4:45 am, I woke up with swollen fingers on both hands. On Tuesday, March 16 at 3:30 am, I experienced swollen fingers, numbness and tingly in the hand and fingers. On Wednesday, March 17, the symptoms were the same as Tuesday, March 16 in the morning, but numbness and tingly subsided. On Thursday, March 18, the swelling, numbness and tingly in the fingers and hands returned when I woke up at 4:00 am. I was unable to curl my fingers in both hands into a fist and could not use my hands to grip. I realized from trying to hold anything I had a weak grip.  My symptoms have not changed throughout the day. On Friday, March 19 after midnight, I went to the emergency room regarding to the pain of swollen fingers and hands (entire palm), numbness and tingly feeling. I was prescribed with 4 mg of methylPrednisolone for 6 days and to taper down. As of today, there is no swelling in the hands and fingers, no numbness; however, there is tingly feeling in the fingertips of my index, middle, and ring finger in both hands.

Patient reports feeling fatigued, having cough, and feeling more short of breath for the last day, and has developed central chest pain which is pleuritic in the emergency department.  She reports that the chest pain is 4/10 in severity and does not radiate.  Her caregiver at bedside reports that the patient has had worsening dyspnea on exertion for the last 3 or so weeks.  Of note, she becomes dyspneic with limited exertion, such as going up a flight of stairs, at baseline.  She had a fever of 101.4 °F at home earlier today, but denies chills or diaphoresis.  He had 1 episode of nonbloody vomiting earlier today.  Denies nausea at this time.  She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine yesterday, 4 weeks after the first.   They note that approximately 5 years ago, she had a prolonged admission for which she was transferred to OHSU and was on ECMO for a time before making a nearly full recovery.  She has had the baseline dyspnea on exertion since that time.   Review of Systems  Constitutional: Positive for fever and malaise/fatigue. Negative for chills.  HENT: Negative for sore throat.

Slightly anxious appearing.  HENT: Moist mucous membranes. No posterior oropharyngeal erythema or exudates. NECK: Supple. No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.  CARDIOVASCULAR: Tachycardic rate and regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. No pain with palpation of chest wall.  PULM: Normal effort. No use of accessory muscles. Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. ABD: Soft. Non tender. Non distended.  EXT: No lower extremity edema. SKIN: No suspicious lesions noted on the exposed skin.    EKG: 04/09/21  Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia  Rate: 111  Axis: normal  Intervals: normal   Concern for possible inferior infarct noted, but felt less consistent with true ST depression  Recent Imaging: Chest x-ray, 04/09/21:  FINDINGS: LUNGS: Slightly low lung volumes.  There is hazy reticulonodular interstitial opacity seen within the left mid and both lower lung zones suspicious for interstitial pulmonary edema. CARDIAC: Slightly worsened mild cardiomegaly. MEDIASTINUM: Normal. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. LINES/TUBES: None. BONES: There is mild rightward convexity curvature of the thoracic spine along with minimal multilevel degenerative change. OTHER: Surgical clips overlie the left lung apex medially and the right upper abdominal quadrant.   IMPRESSION: 1. See above.   CT angiogram pulmonary:  FINDINGS:   Motion degrades image quality slightly.   No pulmonary arterial filling defects are identified.   Mild lower lobe predominant atelectasis and/or scarring. A single  small bulla is present in the left lower lobe of the lung. Lungs are  otherwise clear. Large airways are patent.   Small bilateral dependent pleural effusions which are new relative  to the comparison examination. No pneumothorax.   Heart is normal in size. Relatively low attenuation pericardial  effusion is present which is new relative to the comparison  examination. Pericardial fluid measures up to 1.7 cm in thickness. No  thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. No mediastinal mass or  lymphadenopathy.   Two small enhancing foci are present in the liver, larger 1.8 in  length which are similar to the comparison examination. Interval  cholecystectomy. Visualized upper abdominal contents are otherwise  without significant abnormality.   There has been partial resection of the left 5th rib. Osseous  structures are otherwise intact.    IMPRESSION:  1. No evidence of pulmonary embolism.  2. Pericardial effusion and small bilateral pleural effusions which  are new relative to comparison examination.  3. Two small enhancing liver lesions which are not further  characterized by this examination but are similar to comparison  examination. These could potentially represent hemangiomas.    Assessment / Plan   a 49 y.o. female with history of hypertension, developmental delay, DVT x1 not currently on anticoagulation, GERD, and anxiety who is being admitted for acute hypoxic respiratory failure, felt likely secondary to fluid overload from cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion.    #Acute hypoxic respiratory failure  #Elevated Pro BNP #Cardiomegaly  #Dyspnea on exertion  #Pleuritic chest pain #Elevated D-Dimer  Acute. Hemodynamically stable. On room air at home, and requiring 3 L via NC here. Considerations include new onset CHF, PE, PNA, PTX, pericarditis, pericardial effusion.  Presentation most concerning for new onset CHF/cardiomyopathy from pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion, as demonstrated on CT angiogram.  She has significantly elevated CRP which further supports pericarditis, and onset of symptoms approximately 7 to 10 days after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine dose 4 weeks ago, which may be associated.  Also possible viral or idiopathic.  Mildly elevated BNP and pleural effusions suggesting cardiomyopathy.  Patient had a fever to 101.4 °F earlier today, per caregiver at bedside, and has had shortness of breath and cough, and thus pulmonary infectious process strongly considered, though clinically I feel infection less likely. She has a chronic leukocytosis and WBC is 21 today.  She received ceftriaxone and doxycycline for pneumonia today in the ED, and may consider continuing these tomorrow. No evidence to suggest tamponade on bedside POCUS. - Admit to PCU with tele  - Echo in AM  - Ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily for treatment of pericarditis - Diuresis: 40 mg IV Lasix given at 0037 - Respiratory support as needed, wean as tolerated   - RTDP - Incentive spirometry  - Consider continuing antibiotics pending clinical status in AM    #Leukocytosis  Acute.  WBC 21.5 on admit, increased from 15.1 two and a half months ago, but that was at end of admission for cholecystitis.  Potentially due to inflammation, possibly infectious process.  See discussion above.  - Trend with CBC   #Hypertension  Chronic, presumed well controlled.   - Continue home hydrochlorothiazide and losartan     #Thrombocytosis Acute.  Suspect reactive thrombocytosis due to inflammation from pericarditis.  -Daily CBC while inpatient   #Elevated AST and ALT  Acute, mild. Most likely secondary to congestive hepatopathy.  Will trend. - AM CMP    #Hypoosmolar hyponatremia Acute,  mild.  Considerations include beer potomania, hypothyroidism, SIADH, low solute diet (&#34;tea and toast&#34;), increased free water intake, medication induced (SSRIs, thiazides). Suspect low solute diet.  SIADH from pulmonary pathology is also possible. - Repeat BMP   #Anxiety Chronic, presumed stable.   - Continue home sertraline     Ppx: Lovenox  Central Lines/IVs/Tubes/Drains: PIV  CODE: Full Dispo: PCU with tele    Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis SNOMED CT(R) Date Noted ?

Tingling came back  across my upper body (chest level to shoulder level), I began to shake excessively, my mouth got very dry and my skin became splotchy.  I was breathing hard like I had just ran flights of stairs.  Nurses were called and I was given Benadryl and taken to the Emergency Room at a neighboring hospital where they hooked me up to I believe heart and BP monitors.  My blood pressure was very high and my heart was pounding so hard.  Was given steroid pills.  All day I urinated excessively and my heart pounded hard.

                                                The day i received the first dose of the moderna shot i started getting nauseas  during the night. I woke up and was very tired feeling. I felt like flu like symptoms for the next few days. I was in bed Friday, Saturday, and Sunday i went to ER due to throat, face and neck swelling. It was hard for me to swallow. They gave me an IV and administered Benadryl and something to help with my throat. In about 30 minutes i could swallow much better. I still feel tired and just have no energy at all. I went to see my doctor and i will not be getting the second dose of the moderna shot.

At some time early in the morning of 26 Jan she experienced headache and felt very tired so stayed home from work. During the morning she mainly slept however had some Motrin and a banana around 0830 due to feeling feverish. She went back to sleep until about 1030. When she woke up, she still felt feverish and then noticed her pulse started racing a few minutes later. Her husband took her BP but her pulse was reading ?error?.  She then put on her iWatch and had a pulse of 210. She felt very sweaty, hot and ?weird??like she might pass out but I did not have any pain other than my throat felt tight.  She went to the ER. Within about 30-40 minutes of the onset of SVT she was given adenosine and converted with a 6mg dose.

                                                After dose 1  - this is what happened : I was fine during my 15 min wait but as I was driving back home  I started to feel a bit nauseous and then  there was a warm feeling in the back of my throat. That  turned into a burning feeling within minutes.  By an hour later   I started to feel tightening/ constriction in the back of throat  and like something is stuck there.  My voice felt  very hoarse.  I called the nurse she suggested Benadryl but I had a 4 pm kiddo to work with and Benadryl knocks me out so didn?t take it. I think my body was fighting having an allergic reaction.  My breathing  was a little labored but nothing too bad. I was not terribly surprised  because I?m typically allergic to everything.  On Tuesday - Everything hurt like a bad flu. Fever, Nausea, headache, fatigue, cough etc. That persisted for several days last wk.  By the weekend I felt better just fatigue, phlegm, cough .....  PS - I was fine on Monday prior to vac.  Dose 2 - had a slight warming in back of throat but nothing too bad.  7 hours later and &#43;for the next 24 hour - fever 101.5,(even after 800mg ibuprofen) non stop vomiting, inability to eat or drink, terrible headache - like a bad flu.  Somewhat better today( in that I can actually sit up in bed and type)  but very dehydrated and trying to rehydrate without having to go to ER for fluids.

                                                I am an LPN and received my 1st dose of Moderna vaccine 2/5/21.  Immediately after I experienced episodes of dizziness and request to have blood pressure checked which was 160&#39;s/100&#39;s and did not seems to come down after 10 minutes.  Started to develop shortness of breath at about 20 minutes post shot and was immediately taken to ER in which I started to become hoarse and losing voice and heaviness in chest.  I was given solu-medrol, Benadryl, Pepcid and neb treatment due to wheezing also.  Chest xray , EKG done which remained normal.  D-dimer was slightly elevated so did do CT chest which was also normal.  Was in ER under observation for about 4 hours before discharge.  I continued to have shortness of breath and difficulty breathing with exertion/activity and blood pressure remained high over next few days.  I saw my PCP on 2/10/21 and was instructed to continue with albuterol inhalers and neb treatments as needed, and added Amlodipine for elevated blood pressures.

Developed a large wheal around injection site (around 2 inches in diameter) within minutes, leaving a hard red bump that lasted for approximately 14 days. Within 24 hours of the shot, I developed wheezing, upset stomach, chills, fever, body rash/welts on my trunk, and muscle spasms in my shoulder and neck near the site of injection. The symptoms other than the wheal and discoloration at site of injection abated within another 48 hours.

EMS transported me to hospital mentioned above. IV started in ambulance where IV epinephrin, IV fluids, IV Benadryl, IV solumedrol were all given prior to arrival at the ER. ER then administered more steroids and anti nausea meds and sent me home after observation and stabilization with prescription for epi pen and prednisone.

Fortunately her O2 sat is 100% on room air, she is not tachypneic. Her lungs demonstrate no wheezing, her oropharynx is widely patent. She was observed for 3 hours after given Benadryl, Pepcid and Solu-Medrol, was able to ambulate to the bathroom. Still with some remaining symptomatology but appears more comfortable. Will discharge with close outpatient follow-up with PCP and neurologist. Recommended patient follow-up with her neurologist and her PCP regarding guidance regarding second vaccination dose as this did not truly represent an anaphylactic reaction but still symptoms could worsen with second vaccine.

                                                About 4 hours after the vaccine, I experienced sudden nausea and abdominal pain. The symptoms lasted for about a week. They were intermittent at first. I had 3 episodes of sharp adominal pain that radiated up my back and made me short of breath. I felt pain between my shoulder blades when I tried to breathe in. The first two subsided, but the third episode on 02/16/21 was more pronounced. I felt generally unwell, like something was really wrong. I first thought it was a normal immune response or side effect. But the nausea and abdominal pain had grown worse. On 02/16/2021 I went to the ER, where a CT Scan showed I had Epiploic Appendagitis. I suspect the inflammation or a sudden ischemic event after my vaccine had caused this. I had absolutely no such symptoms prior to the vaccine, but the nausea came on exactly 4 hours after my first dose like a switch had been turned on.    In addition to the above, I experience facial flushing on the left side of my face for about 7 days after the vaccine. My forehead and right side of my face would read a normal temperature, but my left cheek averaged 101 degrees. The flushing would come on suddenly, often in the evening. I also had heart palpitations.   Other symptoms: I had the typical sore left arm for a few days. I developed joint pain on my left side, including my arm and my jaw. In general, I feel like I had a pronounced inflammatory response.

                                                The morning after the injection, I woke up with a horrible rash on the bottom part of both legs (knees down).  The rash got worse throughout the day and started on my chest that evening.  By the end of the night (the day after injection), my tongue and airway appeared to be swollen and I had trouble taking full breaths.  I started taking 2 Benadryl every 4 hours. I took that dosage for the next 2 days.  The breathing got better, but the rash is still present (as of day 5 after injection).

                                                Patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/26/2021 at approximately 01:30 PM. Patient came into my office on 03/02/2021 with a complaint of elevated blood pressures over the weekend- in the 150-160/90-100 range, shortness of breath on exertion and light-headedness, fatigue, and tachycardia since Sunday evening (2/28/2021). Patient&#39;s blood pressure in the office was 174/100 and her heart rate was running 90&#39;s-100 at rest. Patient was still feeling short of breath if she was up moving. Patient&#39;s blood pressure came down to 162/94 in the office and her heart rate came down to 92 after sitting in the office for about 15 minutes. Patient reported that she has a medical history including hypertension and mitral valve prolapse but she had never been on medication for MVP and never had problems with high heart rate until now- reports that it usually runs in the 70-80 range. Patient reports that previous to vaccination her blood pressure had been running in the normal range 120&#39;s/70&#39;s the majority of the time on lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide 20-25 mg daily alone. Patient was started on Metoprolol ER 25 mg daily for better blood pressure and heart rate control and I plan to follow up with her in office next week and patient is to continue monitoring her heart rate and blood pressure at home.

I awoke at 7:30am on 3/5/2021 with headache, fatigue, congestion, and no appetite. By 12:00pm, the glands in my throat were painful and it hurt to swallow and I was have body aches.

I was given Benedryl and sat down.  My pulse was taken and blood pressure was taken.  My pulse was high and so was blood pressure.  I felt weak and dizzy.  Pulse and blood pressure remained high.   After Benedryl and 30 minutes, the swelling started to go down in throat and voice returned.  Pulse and blood pressure started to go down also. After 3 weeks I felt normal.  The weakness and dizziness, sore throat from the swelling and the blood pressure were finally back to normal.

Hard facial spasms, felt like I was in fight/flight physically- but not mentally, dizzy, very nauseous, hearing in right ear would drastically reduce for 30-60 seconds, heart palpitations, stuttering at times, difficulty finding words at times. Was driven to  ER &amp; evaluated (they said nothing was wrong with me-made to feel like I was faking).Called my doctor?s office the next day-symptoms were persistent but less than the previous day.She wouldn?t see me since I was seen in ER. I went to urgent care &amp; got an appointment the following day with a new provider, .  She sent me to ENT, who says it appears Mennier?s was triggered. Started on high dose Prednisone 60 mg tapered dose. My hearing showed some loss in lower frequencies. I feel slightly, very slightly better each day. Extreme fatigue Has also been an issue.

An ambulance arrived and gave me Benadryl on the way to the ER and the redness surrounding the injection site and on my neck and chest started to subside. In the ER, I received 125 mg Prednisone and 1 mg Ativan to help with the anxiety caused by shortness of breath and dizziness. Within about 20 minutes, my throat felt like it opened up and I could breathe normally. I was rleased from the ER at around 3pm.

I went to bed with no issues then within a short time I felt an instant burning in my stomach...before I could make it to the bathroom....I began vomiting uncontrollably...this lasted for 3 hours. I had 1 bout of bathroom issues but that was it. I thought I was going to go unconscious because I couldn&#39;t stop to catch a breath. Each time last about 7 minutes. As soon as I went back to bed....I got that feeling and had to rush back to the bathroom again. Today  (24 hours later) my left arm is extremely sore. (no swelling or redness------very tight and sore to the touch). I cannot lift my arm  more than 50%.

                                                On 2/4/15, within 15 mins monitoring, Pt started coughing and stated her throat felt tight. EMS was onsite. She later reported they gave her IV Diphenhydramine and a steroid. She thought it was Prednisone. Her blood pressure was elevated and she was still being held at the hospital when we called to check on her about 3 hours after her symptoms started.

They game me some orange juice and monitored me for about 15 minutes. I went back to work and I felt shaky for about 3-4 hours. I then had a terrible headaches and back ache. That same night I got some hives and chest tightness with increased in throat production and the headache continued that night.  The next day I still felt tired and achy, felt like a mild flu. I had chest tightness with difficulty breathing.  I continued to feel sick Saturday and Sunday and Monday I had a Covid test done, which was negative.  On Monday I had rashes on my arms and legs and continued to have the hives and on Tuesday I started to feel a bit better with a dry cough.  On Tuesday 01-12-220 I had a chest x-ray which was negative.  On Wednesday, I woke up and felt much worse and that&#39;s when I called the NP and she prescribed three inhalers for my breathing issues. On 01-27-2020, since I was still feeling not better I called off work.  As now, I am slowly getting better, but I still continued with the hives.

Called Dr to get prednisone usually works but it didn&#39;t touch this. Started feeling better just before my 2nd dose. No problem with 2nd dose. Could be a Coincidence that I was sick 2 days after the Vaccine with my COPD So I am not sure if other COPD&#39;rs experienced this. Dr. Recommended ER but I refused. Had to ride it out.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of vaccination, I experienced shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and disorientation.  I remained under observation for one hour, at which point I was able to drive home.  The symptoms decreased but remained until late that night.  On Friday evening, January 15, I developed an ear infection in both ears, a large dark bruise approximately the size of my hand behind my left knee, and the worst HSV outbreak of my lifetime.  The bruise dissipated after approximately one week.  I have had recurrent HSV outbreaks almost continuously since that time.  I still have the ear infection.  I called my doctor twice to request antibiotics for my ears, but she thought the infection would clear up without them.  After 5.5 weeks I called a third time and cefdinir 300mg twice daily antibiotic was prescribed for 10 days.  The ear infection remained after completion of the antibiotic course.  I began a new course of the same medicine without a break in treatment and am now on day 15 of antibiotics.  the infection is improving but not gone.

                                                I was still recovering from COVID when I received the second dose. I was still experiencing fatigue, shortness of breath (with activities) but no cough or fever. It was about 1PM on the day of the vaccine that I started feeling weird. I spiked a fever (102F) and felt extremely weak, I could not walk without my husband&#39;s assistance. I started having severe headaches (not like the ones with the 1st dose, these were regular severe headaches). My heart rate was elevated (lasted about 72 hours). I also noticed that my 1st injection site (1st dose) started getting read and hot to the touch again, it came back, like it reacted to something. Then, a little lower I had about the size of an orange a very hard and red area, like someone had beaten me with a baseball bat and you could see the separation of both areas of both shots. The second one was huge. I called my PCP&#39;s office but they could not see me so I went to Urgent Care (02/08) and the physician there was concerned about the possibility of cellulitis.  I was concerned about pneumonia because of my cough and shortness of breath. He sent me to get a chest  X-ray at Radiology, no pneumonia. He treated me with antibiotics for my arm. My arm was really bad. Everything lasted until 02/09. Arm got better on 02/10 (I was on antibiotics for 10 days). It took me a while to gain my strength back and not feel so fatigued. I want to say in fact I started feeling myself again around 03/15/2021.

Also, felt like it was more difficult to breath but could breath, again took a few minutes to return to normal.  It took a few minutes before starting to feel my heart rate slow down.  I remained seated for approx. 25 minutes after shot.

She was then transferred to Emergency Department. Per their report: The patient presents with a swollen discolored left lower leg.  She does have  discoloration and I am concerned for massive DVT and cerulea dolens.  She does  have really minimal pain to the leg except to the groin, she has intact pulses,  I have low suspicion for acute ischemia/arterial clot.  She does complain of  some mild dyspnea with exertion above baseline so I do have concerns for  possible PE.  She is hemodynamically stable, appears in no distress.  She is on  oral contraceptives, mild obesity, no other significant VTE risk factors.  I am  going to empirically start her on heparin, I have also ordered a CT PE and a CT  abdomen pelvis to check for proximal propagation of the DVT along with a left  lower extremity duplex Doppler ultrasound.    Duplex ultrasound also showed extensive left lower extremity DVT up to the  common femoral, she does have bilateral PEs without evidence of significant clot  burden or heart strain, she is hemodynamically stable with normal pulse  oximetry.  The patient also has clots proximal up to her IVC.  I discussed this  with Dr.  of vascular surgery for possible thrombolysis therapy of the  left lower extremity.  She was discussed with SOUND for admission.

                                                Throat tightness; not feeling well; Upper chest pressure; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacist concerning a 52-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced throat tightness, upper chest pressure and was not feeling well.  The patient did not have any relevant medical history. The patient denied any previous history of adverse reactions to vaccines. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 at 09:40 am, approximately five minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039K20A) intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 9:45 am, the patient experienced throat tightness and not feeling well. The patient was pale and hypertensive. She was carried on a stretcher and placed on oxygen. Rapid response team was called in and treatment with intravenous (iv) fluids including iv push of famotidine at a dose of 20 mg was initiated. Patient was transported to the Emergency Department (ED) for further evaluation. Additionally, the patient received iv treatment with methylprednisolone succinate at a dose 125 mg and diphenhydramine at a dose of 25 mg. Throat tightness and upper chest pressure were reported to be relieved. The patient was discharged with prescriptions for oral prednisone, famotidine, and diphenhydramine to be taken as needed for recurrent symptoms.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events of  throat tightness, upper chest pressure, and not feeling well was not reported.   The events, throat tightness, upper chest pressure, and not feeling well were considered resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 52-year-old, female subject who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 039K20A), experienced the unexpected events of not feeling well; upper chest pressure and not feeling well. The onset of events occurred 5 min after the first dose of vaccine administration. The reporter causality assessment for the events was not provided. Due to the temporal association between the events and the administration of vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, and the events are assessed as possibly related to vaccine.

She denied any rash, feeling of swelling in her throat or tongue and had no trouble breathing. Patient declined to have EMTs called because she did not feel it was anaphylaxis.  A dose of 50mg of Benadryl was via orally and she was closely monitored.  Her blood preassure was 128/84 and heart rate was 80.  She had offers to drive her to either the ER or urgent care but declined saying it was isolated to her lips and the tip of her tongue.  Patient is a nurse and was aware of what to watch for.  Pharmacy staff continued to observe her for an additional 45 minutes.  At that time she said the issues were resolving and she would like to go home.  She was counseled on what to look for with worsening reaction but said she felt more frustrated that anything.  Pharmacist encouraged her to reach out to her PCP and also explained we would be unable to give her the next shot at a clinic.  She was advised to speak more with her doctor regarding if she should get a second dose.  Patient was followed up with 2 hours after vaccination by phone and reported symptoms resolved and she was just tired from the Benadryl.  Patient was also called the day after and said she had a bad headache but otherwise no other signs of adverse reaction.

                                                26 minutes after receiving the vaccine I started to get a metallic taste in my throat. I felt my tongue from the back of my throat to the tip of tongue was very tingly. I difficultly swallowing, every time I went to swallow it felt like something was stuck in my throat. Due to me bad allergic reactions in general I took 25 MG of Benadryl prior to be vaccinated. I was instructed to go over to ER, I went to the ER. I was given 50 MG IV of Benadryl they watched me for a few hours and then sent me home. I went home and sleep and was told to take Benadryl every 8 hours. I woke up cause I couldn&#39;t breath right. My face and tongue was swollen at this time. There was redness on my face as well. I woke my husband up and he took my back to the hospital. I went back to Hospital. They said it was acute reaction I was having and gave epi-pen in my left thigh. I received Decadron IV push and said it would last 72. I was told to take Benadryl every 6 hours instead of 8 like told the day before. I went home and have been doing that. I have been okay today so far.  A week before getting the vaccine anti-inflammatory diet to help prevent the an allergic reaction.  I am having my tithers drawn in a month

Then at 12:30am I woke to severe chills, slight headache, sweats as well, body aches all over my body and I took my temperature and it was 103.4.  I don&#39;t think I have ever had a fever that high before.  I took some Tylenol extra strength  and tried to go back to sleep but I couldn&#39;t I was afraid.  This went on for several hours and my temp ranged from 102.3-103.6.  I tried to drink liquids too.  I called off of work.  That day I laid around hot and cold, body aches, my chest hurt a little to take a deep breath, fatigue and weakness were unbearable at sometimes. My fever spikes probably that high 3-4 times yesterday.  I had fluids and soup.  I alternated Motrin and Tylenol all day.  I tried to rest and maybe sleep but just couldn&#39;t close my eyes despite being tired/weak.  By 7-8pm I was still weak but felt better  My temp was around 99-100.  I went to be around 10pm and woke up at 2am with really bad heartburn that I couldn&#39;t lay down I had to sit in my recliner chewing 4 Galvascon tabs. Sipping water and felt my chest hurt and wondered if I was having a heart issue. But i relaxed and finally by 5 am when my alarm went off.. I took my temp it was 100.2.  I called off work again today and I laid down to sleep a few more hours.   Now  I feel better and still weak  My temp has gone down.

My voice changed like a horse - hoarse throat. And when I swallowed it was like a piece of food in my throat. At work, my left eye is swollen  and my lower lip was swollen too and they took me to patient room at work and examined me. Asked me to go home from work and my husband took me to ED  on January 5th- I had gotten hives - started feeling itchy all over my body. At Emergency room they gave me Prednisone to stop the swelling. My throat was swollen and they gave me blood tests, too. Prednisone helped some - took that for one week. (Still missed work on the sixth because my eyes were still swollen.) Had a previously scheduled doctor appt for something else and my doctor told me the hives will come back after Prednisone so he told me to take Claritin for two weeks. All my symptoms resolved after that.

Rash went away.  SOB lasted off and on for several days. Heart rate was off when I was working out for a couple of weeks.  I work out  so we wear heart rate monitors.  Heart rate did not recover as quickly as normal during my workouts. Took a couple of weeks for this to get back to normal for me.  Just really felt &#34;off&#34; for awhile and not like myself.  Did not feel comfortable getting second shot because of the above symptoms.

                                                This is for the EAU for the Moderna vaccine.   Due to recent injury to my left side, including an old Rotator Cuff injury on the left, I opted for my right arm.   As with the first dose, the actual injection was nearly painless. The first dose resulted in localized pain to upper left arm for a day or two. Second dose was significantly different. I have a headache that is nearly the worst in my life (and I&#39;ve recently cracked or traumatized my skull on 1/5/2021). If I laugh, cry, raise my voice, the pain increases to &#34;worst ever&#34; but only stays there for a few moments. The pain is around the base of my head and facial bones, particularly strong behind the eyes.    In addition to this monumental headache, I have the same fleshy soreness to the arm as occurred last time. Except this is extremely more painful. Extending my arm forward  feels very painful for the entire joint. Even flexing my muscles in that arm leads me to a severe pain in the entire arm that is most intense in the joint.   My fever --- With acetaminophen ---  is about 102*. I am having chills, exhaustion, wheezing. I feel like the worst hangover of my life (I&#39;ve only ever had one, this dwarfs it).   I understand that &#34;If it hurts, that means it works.&#34; so probably these are minor symptoms that will pass, but I had no idea how difficult it would be!

Within the hour, all symptoms started getting better.  Was release from ER after 4 hours with instructions to continue the benadryl at max dose for next 24 hours.  Rash remained for 4 days, continued to take benadryl until rash was gone.

I experienced some shortness of breath.  This continued until 3:30 am.   I had another episode on Sunday March 14th.  It did not last as long.  I had another episode on March 17th this too only lasted a few hours.   I have a lot of food allergies and carry an epi pen.  I initially felt fine after the vaccination.  I informed the nurse of my allergies and was monitored for 30 minutes after my vaccine.  I did not seek medical attention for the heart racing and shortness of breath.  I was not aware it was a considered an allergic reaction.

By 5:30 I was achy all over and had the chills.  The tightness in my throat which had finally gone away, came back with a vengeance and my chest was tight and my lungs were achy as well. I took ibuprofen at 6:00, Tylenol at 10:00, ibuprofen at 3:00 am, and Tylenol at 7:30 am, and ibuprofen at 11:00 am this got me through work on Friday. I decided not to take anymore drugs because I had taken a lot. By 6:00 my throat was really tight and my lungs hurt, as well I had the chills again. So I took Tylenol at 6:00, Ibuprofen at 8:30, and Tylenol at midnight, and ibuprofen at 7:30 am. That was the last time I took medication. The chills did not come back, but the tightness in my throat did once the medication wore off.

After second dose within a few hours I had a headache and woke up the next morning with fever, chills, headache, dizziness, I felt weak and my joints hurt. I also had a redness, swelling, itchy and sore arm at the injection site. Today is Monday, March 29th and the itching, reddness and swelling is still there. I have also have had difficulty catching my breath after walking up hills or stairs. I am overweight and have asthma but I walk everyday for at least 3 miles and catching my breath has been a little scary.

                                                Resident had the COVID vaccine 12/30/2020. 12/31/20,  resident has been in bed all shift. Staff became concerned when resident was not easily aroused. Resident displayed signs of tremors, twitching, confusion, in and out of consciousness, low O2 sats, elevated pulse and fever, fatigue and weakness. Writer called NP. NP stated this is most likely a reaction d/t the COVID vaccine. She gave orders for Benadryl 25mg IM x1 now and Tylenol 1000 mg now. NP also stated resident will not be getting the second dose of vaccine. Will continue to monitor and update NP if worsening symptoms.   After receiving Benadryl and Tylenol at 145pm, resident began to appear as though she was feeling better and was talking to talk, fever had gone down. Tonight resident is not easily aroused, lethargic, continues to have tremors and twitches, almost appearing as convulsions. When asked if she knows where she is or what day it is, resident can properly answer. Resident denies SOB but staff has noted loud squeals while breathing. NP was updated and gave new orders to give Benadryl 25 mg IM x1 if needed and Ok to send resident to ED. Resident currently refuses to go to the hospital. Will continue to monitor. BP 152/112, P 116, T 99.1, O2 87-91. Resident&#39;s O2 at 1205am was 80% on 3LPM. Resident unable to be aroused from sleep by writer. NAR called to assist. NAR could not arouse resident. Writer and NAR attempted to reposition resident and resident&#39;s breathing became more labored. Resident turned back to previous position and writer called on call MD at approx. 1220am. MD returned call approx. 1235am with orders to send resident to ED. 911 called and ambulance arrived about 1245am. History of present condition given to EMTs and they stated resident would be going to Hospital. Writer has attempted to contact Hospital ED x3 but have been unable to get through. An EMT did just call to clarify when vaccine was given, what symptoms have been present and when they started. She said she has everything she should need and she will let Hospital ED staff know to call if they need anything else. Writer will again attempt to contact them though.  Resident&#39;s temp was 97.5 and BG 128. When EMTs arrived they got an O2 reading of 60%. Resident did open her eyes a couple times during transfer from bed to stretcher and while stretcher was going outside but no responses from resident were made.

                                                Within 5 minutes of injection, felt mild tightness in throat and chest.  Did not report at time as it was mild.  Symptoms did not resolve after a few hours.  ~ 3 hours later, took Benadryl and bronchodiolator and symptoms improved.  Also since injection have had mild GI distress gradually improving.   Reporting now because I learned reaction could be worse to second injection, and 30 minute observation period would likely be prudent.

                                                within 30 seconds I had a cooling sensation rush across the tip of my tongue, then a sweet taste, then more identifiable as bubble gum flavored.  By 12:45 I noticed I was scratching several areas of my body. Arms, legs, chest, neck, back and scalp and kept clearing my throat.  I looked down at my arm and seen a red welt from my elbow to my wrist in my left arm and a fine red rash beneath skin on right arm.  I looked up at the pharmacist and he said at 12:40 he had already placed a call to have another pharmacist come to look me over.   I then noticed that my heart seemed to be racing and feeling winded.  I figured this was my anxiety and just tried to relax.  The second pharmacist arrived and we walked to the ER.  I was very winded. They took me to a room and checked stats.  after 3 attempts taking my BP and using two different cuffs, she said my BP was 190/90 where it is typically 120/70. I drank lots of water and they monitored me for almost an hour and gave me another Benadryl.  My BP came down to 180/82 , breathing was easier and itching was decreasing so I chose to return to my station and I took one more Benadryl.  The following day: woke up with head ache in rt eye and fuzzy vision all day, mild sore throat, mild body aches, queasy stomach, fatigue and runny nose.  Took a Pepcid for stomach, Tylenol/Advil duo for sore throat, headache/body aches, drank lots of water and rested.  Following day most symptoms resided, still  slight sore throat, rt eye blurred vision, coughing, sneezing and runny nose.  everyday since, symptoms continue to decrease.

                                                The patient received the vaccine at approximately 1:30. They were observed for the standard 15 minute wait time at which time they complained of some mild numbness to their arm. The patient felt well enough to return to work after the 15 minute observation time. They returned approximately 20 to 30 minutes later complaining of more numbness and some dizziness. She (the patient) was told to continue to monitor symptoms and alert anyone of worsening side effects or symptoms. The patient returned to the room again and was now complaining of nausea. She was offered Benadryl but patient refused stating &#34; I cant have Benadryl&#34; after multiple times of the pharmacist(s)  offering Benadryl. Patient stated they sometimes take Claritin so they were instructed to take it and lie down in an area where staff could monitor her. At about 3:30 another staff member came into the vaccination room and alerted the pharmacist they were having a hard time keeping to patient awake.  Upon arrival at the patient&#39;s side they were coughing and seemed to be in a state of drowsiness. They were linked to a vitals monitor by the staff. BP: 170/110 O2: 96-100% HR between 80 and 90.  Approximately 2 minutes after arrival at patient&#39;s side 911 was called. Pharmacist retrieved the Epi-Pen and was on standby if administration was needed.  The patient was moved to a chair and vomited multiple times over the course of a few minutes. The Patient was able to vocalize and stated they felt &#34;aweful&#34; and has some difficulty swallowing, and when asked if they were short of breath they stated &#34;a little.&#34; Over the next 5 minutes (approx.) the patient&#39;s BP went down to 152/90&#39;S and O2 saturation was holding at 97-100%. Epinephrine was not administered during this time as patient was breathing and did not appear to have hives. Emergency medical services arrived about 5 minutes but within 10 minutes after the call was placed. EMS then took over care  for the patient. EMS was told of condition and that epinephrine was not administered at this time. After patient assessment by EMS they also declined to use epinephrine. At around 3:40 the patient was transferred to a transport bed and was taken away by ambulance.

                                                Vaccine given at work left arm on Friday 1:45 pm and felt like tight Blood Pressure cuff  on my arm within 30 mins. This was constant pressure that lasted until I slept that night.  went home after work, ate dinner, then sleep with my CPAP. Slept late, woke up 1:40pm with entire left arm numb, but still able to move it. (sleeping on right side) and numb tongue that felt swollen. Stroke?  I got up and as time progressed over next 30 mins or so, I started coughing more, felt like sore throat, itchy, having trouble clearing my throat, some trouble breathing, tongue didn&#39;t look swollen, but it felt like scotch tape underneath my tongue with someone slowly pulling tape off. with top of tongue swollen and heavy.  2:25pm I took 25 mg Benadryl oral tablet and called 24/7 RN hotline and was told to go to ER and take another 25 mg Benadryl tablet which I did. I arrived at ER and was really coughing hacking repeatedly. Short of breath, kept trying to clear my throat. Seen in triage. No meds given, this was? &lt;20 from time I took Benadryl.  About an hour later I did have about 15 mins of feeling like I was wearing a very snug neck turtleneck with 2 brief cool sensations going down the middle of my throat and down both sides of my upper chest.   I felt better when I kept my neck very straight versus looking down.  I was later seen again and felt 75% better, given Dexamethasone and Pepcid.  Discharged home. around 6:30pm.  Took Benadryl 50 mg again 10 pm same night.

I went home and within 1 hour after the shot my ears seemed get clogged and itchy.  My upper lip swelled up enough for me to feel it and notice while looking in the mirror then my throat seemed to get thick. I did not have difficulty breathing.  I drank  a lot of ice cold water and took a benadryl which seemed to halt the symptoms.  I woke up the next day and all seemed to be better.

                                                Around 7:00 pm I started to get sick and my body started to hurt. Joints hurt. Tried to take Tylenol - it didn&#39;t take it away -  maybe slowed it down but then it came back. Thursday morning - I woke up really sick - joints hurt, hot and feverish and I called ambulance. My temp was over 100 degrees. They took me to ER. They took my temp there and it was 101.6. The Dr. requested morphine and I was given that for the pain. They observed me for awhile and sent me home with Tylenol with Codeine (300 mg). The morphine helped and I came home and I went to sleep and the next day my pain was not as bad as it was the day before. I was able to start moving around even though I was still achy. By third day I was feeling better. By fourth day, I was doing a lot better and the pain had gone back down. Felt shortness of breath when I first got symptoms and was using my inhaler. My shortness of breath lasted a little longer - for about a week. Had a Telehealth visit with doctor to refill meds if I needed it.

                                                MODERNA COVID19 Vaccine EUA I took my shot on Friday at 1:15pm I had tingling on the roof of my mouth for 2 hours starting about an hour after the shot; this resolved by itself w/o any medication. The tingling (and a bit of discomfort like my mouth had a sunburn) returned about 8 hours after the shot and was accompanied by mild throat swelling (no issues with breathing or any other symptoms). I did a tele-med visit and was instructed to self-medicate at home with Benadryl (50mg) which helped; I took benadryl to lesson the reaction for about 24 hours (q6 hr).   Other than these reactions, I was super tired until day 4  and had a slight discomfort where I had the shot on day two.

                                                I started becoming hoarse about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. I left after 30 minutes and while I was driving home about 5 minutes later I became short of breath and took benedryl 25 mg which I had on the seat next to me in the car.  By the time I got in the house, approximately 40 minutes after receiving vaccine dizziness and palpitations started.  I checked my heart rate on O2 sat, 99% on room air, and HR low 100s. I did complete appointments with patients that afternoon but had trouble thinking,  was dizzy, and hoarse. the benedryl helped the SOB. I told the clinic manager the next time I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine I would need to take off from work due to the reaction. I was off 4 four days after receiving the vaccine and had fatigue, nausea, chills, and SOB. During the 4 days off I doubled my corticosteroid dose from 2 puffs daily to BID due to needing to use albuterol rescue inhaler every 4 hours and took benedryl as needed. I am still having trouble breathing and needing to use breakthrough rescue inhaler and benedryl along with cetirizine that I take daily which is why I reached out to Moderna today and scheduled an appointment with allergy/immunology to assess safety of receiving 2nd dose of vaccine.

At 4:55 took 50 mg of Benadryl. She noticed mucus forming in her throat and tightening in throat.  At Approximately 5:15 EMS came to evaluate.  BP elevated,  171/110, 174/108, 166/127. while being evaluated she felt like the benadryl started to kick in and she started to feel a little better.  Through the night she started to feel somewhat better, headache and some pain in the back of her neck and knee pain was noted in the evening.

                                                I am a cardiology nurse and have a previous history as a dermatology/Mohs surgical nurse. Day 3 after the vaccine my first of 2 vaccines received on 12/28/2019,  I have a reaction from my chin line up to my forhead. Please note that I had botox and fillers in this area in August of 2020.  The worst of the reaction was directly where I had the fillers and botox. The area became hot, red, itchy, and swollen. I also experienced my throat feeling tight.  I did visit my PCP office (where I had the vaccine administered but at the time they nor I were aware of the reaction to fillers). The next day I became aware of the rare reaction to fillers/Botox. Then on day 5 after the first injection, an area on my upper left chest that has a tattoo and I am currently in the process of having removed with multiple laser treatments (The last treatment was in the fall of 2020) became hot, red swollen and itchy.  Both reactions were separate and lasted approximately 2 days before resolving.   Then 24 days after that same first injection I had an additional reaction on my face. This time my chin rapidly became hot, tight and very painful, red, swollen, and very itchy as well as it started weeping fluid.  I also had the feeling of my throat closing. This was more severe than either of the other reactions and came on very quickly. I did visit the ED and was given IV Benedryl, decadron, Pepcid, and zosyn.  This helped the reaction to clear quickly.   Of note, I had my second vaccine on 1/25/2021 and to date, I have not had another reaction.

Within 45 minutes - noticed breathing issue - shortness of breath and it continued to get worse. Had shortness of breath when I worked on Monday but I used my Rescue Inhaler. Woke up on 2:00 am on Tuesday - had fever - 101 degrees (took Tylenol for fever), body aches, neck ache and shortness of breath. Had to get COVID testing (January 5). By 3:00 afternoon Tuesday - all the symptoms went away except shortness of breath. Had to sleep sitting up in chair - as I couldn&#39;t lay down due to shortness of breath. It lasted about 3 weeks.  I called Dr.( a second time - the first time the first provider said to watch it and wait)  on January 15 and she wanted to start me on Prednisone. She put me on a 5 or 6 day dose of that.

All my muscles were trembling/twitching, this started 7-8 hours after the vaccine and lasted several hours even after taking Tylenol and Advil.  chills that lasted 3 days, no fever, joint pain that lasted 3 days. Shortness of breath after taking showers, this would last a few hours after and require me to use my rescue inhaler. This would be abnormal for me as I don&#39;t normally become short of breath during or after taking a shower.   Arm pain with 2 in x 2 inch swelling just above the injection site.  9 days out and I still have a red , raised  bump at the site of the vaccination. At day 9 post injection, I am still very tired and take several naps everyday. I have not been to work in a week. I normally work 10 hour days with no problems of fatigue. Of note, I did not have any reaction other than mild arm pain at the injection site with the first vaccine that I got on 1/20/2021.

I forced a sip of water down that seemed to resolve the not swallowing issue. I was closer to an Urgent Care than the vaccine location at that point so i went to urgent care. I was able to walk, talk and was monitored for about 2 hours. Had red blotches on my neck and arms. Airway was clear. The swallowing issue subsided. Blood pressure was 150/110 for first hour. Was 110/80 when they let me go. Blotches were gone when i was released

                                                I woke up in horrible pain all over my body and couldn&#39;t straighten my fingers for approximately 2 hours. It took me 3 hours to get the strength to get off couch to pee. Felt as I was being beaten in my lower back, hips and legs. Also, hurt in my neck and eyes were painful. My face and eyes were also swollen. It also felt as if a hot ice pick was being stabbed in the sides of my hips, back and thighs. I hurt all over my body, including a headache. I had hoped to die. I have had 3 children and one was a natural birth and I have never experienced so much pain and exhaustion together.  Took Tylenol and Turmeric and didn&#39;t get any relief. The injection sight was very swollen and was painful, could but lay on my left side. I was down for 3 days with the 3rd day finally able to take shower and dress.  I had diarrhea the 2nd day.  The sides of my hips hurt to touch for weeks and are still sore. I have had a lot of breathing difficulties and asthma flares. I related the asthma issues to having a new dog but now I wonder if it was due to vaccines?? I have rehomed the dog and asthma isn&#39;t getting any better. I had to miss a day of work after the 1st vaccine due to flu-like symptoms and was prepared to have a reaction to the 2nd. However, I was not prepared the  severity of a reaction I had.

The team acted very quickly by giving me an injection of Epinephrine and Benadryl, placed me in a wheelchair then rushed to the ER, given oxygen, IV fluids, prednisone and valium to control the neck spasm as my whole body was again shaking and causing difficulty breathing, rapid breathing. Once I was stablized I was wheeled to my vehicle where I was driven home by a family member. Once I was home, 4 hours later I was still having neck spasms, also across my upper chest and tingling in my hands, this is notmal for me so it is diffiult to determine if this was still due to the vaccine and Epinephrine and Benadryl or the Moderna vaccine. This was the first time  I was ever given or used Epinephrine.

In the evening I was exhausted and could barely move, around 10pm, I think, I started to labor with my breathing. It felt like I would stop breathing and then take 4 gasps for air, and this repeated all night and into the morning. Eventually it stopped the following day, every now and then on the following day I would repeat it but not as often.

Left at 10:25 for the ER, felt worse the whole drive there.  Was thinking my husband driving me was shorter than 911.

                                                Approximately 3 hours after shot I became nauseous, intestinal cramps with diarrhea.  Approximately 1 day later began having breathing issues.  Not like an asthma attack.  Just could not catch my breath, coughing trying to get air. I could not speak on the phone or in person without coughing to get air in my lungs.  I started using an inhaler but it was not helping.  I began using a Nebulizer; this helped slightly at first.  On Feb 20th (I got a new box of meds for the nebulizer) since then I have gotten another box of nebulizer meds on March 3rd.  I have used half of this box now.  Also, on March 3rd, my doctor called in for a new inhaler, which started with 200 sprays and as of today I have 15 left.  This has been going on for over a month!  I have been using the nebulizer every morning and at night but still would wake up 4-5 times during the night to use my inhaler.  I have difficulty feeding my horse without almost collapsing from lack of air.

                                                After a couple of minutes of receiving my vaccine I noticed my heart rate increased, I started to feel flushed.  I alerted nurse, my pulse was 108 to 110.  They didnt take my blood pressure.  My face, chest and ears were very flushed.   After about 10 minutes, they encouraged me to take a benadryl and pepcid I had with me.  That started to help after a few minutes.  I did have mild wheezing upon expiration but I wheeze frequently so I wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  I was not in any respiratory distress. Went home after 45 minutes.  After 4 hours, the symptoms began to return, flushing and increased heart rate (110 to 115 by my pulse oximeter) and had more wheezing.  Repeated the benadryl and called on call physician.   He advised taking 2 benadryl til symptoms subsided and ho to ER if worse.  Last dose of benadryl was around 10 pm last night, have not needed to repeat it.  Hands are a bit swollen today but not bad.

After 5 hours I was advised to go to ER.  I had to be helped by two people to do anything.  Complete assist.  At ER, I was evaluated and monitored.  I never got a fever.  I was given pain medication via IV and medicine to get my heart rate down.  After about two hours of observation, I was released.  No medications were given to me.

Started yesterday morning, more a bother at night than during the day hours. Slight change of smell sensitivity.  Sensation of tight chest, shortness of breath last night during the itchy scratchy episode, only of short duration. Had not reoccurred.  Insomnia last two nights, maybe unrelated, maybe just due to the itches.   Additionally: the injection site was hot and rather painful, for three days only, right after the injection.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

I was given Benadryl 25mg and salumedrol IV. Before the 30 min mark I had tingling on the tip of my tongue and lips. I was monitored for 2&#43; hours and was sent home. The doctor prescribed 40mg prednisone for 4 days an Epipen, and antihistamines, recommended I see an allergist.  I saw APN 1/18/21 after the tingling and throat tightness persisted, she prescribed a taper of the prednisone.  Went to allergist 1/21/21 where we discussed continued symptoms and longer taper of prednisone and she asked me to call her 1/25/21. We spoke 1/25/21 and she recommended I see an ENT. Saw ENT on 1/29/21 who examined my throat with no concerns there. We discussed the ?burning mouth syndrome? symptoms and he recommended I return for medicated mouth wash if the symptoms continue. I am no longer taking any medication. I still have mild tingling on the lips and tongue, slight peppery feel/taste and occasional tightness at the base of my throat. We

                                                On day 8 after my vaccine, my arm became very sore again, like when I received the vaccine. When I looked at my arm, I had a red welped blotch at the injection site. This spot is also itchy. I have had some pain and itchiness going down my arm as well.  Approximately 20-23  minutes after I received the vaccine, I experienced heart racing and throat constriction. Both of these symptoms went away.  I experienced diarrhea and tiredness the next day (January29).

She reported that symptoms subsided, feeling back to normal within 4 hours of the first symptom.

                                                The rash started on the feet on 02-07-2021 - progressed to cover all limbs, upper and lower back, neck to the hairline. I took Benadryl when I first noticed the rash as well as Zyrtec. When the rash started to become more pronounced and inflamed I called my regular clinic and was advised to go to urgent care since I also had an occasional cough (to get air) and a headache. I was seen by APN who advised a Covid test (both PCR &amp; Antigen) both ended up negative she also advised me to continue with Benadryl and Zyrtec and follow up with my regular doctor if symptoms continue - On Friday 02-12-2021 my throat began to feel &#34;full&#34; and the rash more pronounced my doctor then prescribed Prednisone 20 mg tablets for five days along with the other two meds. Rash has started to fade over the course of three days.

                                                After receiving the injection, after 5 minutes I felt my heart racing.  I took deep breathes and it went back to normal.  I waited the 15 minutes.  At 25 minutes after receiving, I was driving home and all of a sudden I felt my muscles in my neck/shoulders and back tighten up.  Other than a sore arm, all was okay.  That evening I started running a temp, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, could barely walk, headache, as if I had Covid all over again.  I called my doctor on Monday.  I stayed home in bed Monday and Tuesday and possibly Wednesday after the first injection.  I worked at home the rest of the week as I was too fatigued to get dressed and drive into town.

                                                Ten hours after vaccine I experienced a hyperglycemic  event; my glucose was so high than neither my arm sensor (Free Style Libre) or my finger stick meter could read it.  It took 40 units of Humolog over a 2 - 1/2 hour time period to bring it down enough to read it.  It was 452.  By morning, six hours later and 20 more units, I am down to 236.  My systems started with my heart pounding out of my ears and neck, frequent urination, and sweating or feeling warm (usually associated with low blood sugar events).  I ate lunch after the vaccine, but by evening when I would normally make some dinner, I didn&#39;t eat until I forced myself to eat some cooked cauliflower at 12:30 a.m.  As I was finally going to bed, around 2 p.m., the cough started.  The cough is an itch at the base of my throat with a slight feeling of swelling.  I have sugar free cough drops and cinnamon candy (which helps reduce the swelling).  This morning, four hours later, the cough has a small amount of phlegm with it (but mostly just itches).

                                                About 40 min after my shot I started feeling tightness (like asthma) in my chest. I ended up needing 6 puffs from my inhaler. (I had also experienced feeling very agitated throughout that day and night). The periodic daily need for the i hailer continued and so I called Moderna and the woman I spoke with told me that the breathing issue was a reaction (she was not as sure about the feeling of agitation) and that when I got my second dose to have them observe for an hour. Over the weeks since that first breathing episode it has continued daily and required the use of my in hailer. In the last few days it has been worse than before and I?ve had a mild headache for about 3 days.  Tomorrow is my shot. I didn?t realize about reporting here until I read about it today.  Since I have a n old history of asthma (though it?s been a relative ?non issue? for years (except  when I get a cold in my chest), but I would want this known for other people with asthma, because it?s definitely going on and strange. (Nothing preventing me from my normal day - but for sure my days have not been ?normal?.  I plan on seeing my doctor to get new medicine for the nebulizer and  likely stronger type asthma medication until it goes away)

                                                As soon as the Moderno vaccine started hitting my bloodstream I felt like the bottom of my lungs were getting a  slightly heavy feeling in them.  I could not breathe as well so I went outside the building to get some fresh air to see if it would improve.  I  started having a slight cough and sneezing and the sneezing continued for almost a week.     My  abdominal area started standing immediately along with the breathing issue and I started burping profusely, and incessantly.   In the morning it seemed like the breathing issue had relieved,  but I now had very bad cramping along with the nausea, fatigue and burping incessantly.   This continued day after day through the morning of 3/11/2021 and   As the cramping and nausea continued I was now getting a pain down in my right side where the appendix is located .   On the evening of 3-11/2021,  I had to go to the emergency room where they discovered I had appendicitis and on the following day I had to have an appendectomy.    I was not having any of these issues prior to the shot. I had been trying to eat better and walk every day and has been feeling well prior to the shot.   I strongly believe the vaccine caused inflammation in my abdomen In the form  of an allergic reaction and caused the appendicitis.

It started with severe chills, and graduated into fever, lethargy, nausea, hyperventilating, headache, and chills interchanging with sweating.   I had a fever the entire weekend and it wouldn&#39;t go away, even with taking Advil and Tylenol.  My oxygen level was fine, but my pulse was elevated.  I felt the same as when I had Covid-19 in June, to the point where I thought I had it again, so I quarantined myself, and was going to get tested on Monday. On Sunday afternoon, I started to feel better and thought it was the end of it, but then Sunday night I started shivering again, and it all started again.     I took an Ambien to get some good sleep and I woke up at 6am Monday morning feeling better.

She made it home and began to feel dizzy. Daughter asked if she was all right and she states her voice was sounding funny. Patient states she  felt like her throat was closing up. She immediately took 10 mL liquid benadryl she had at her house. She waited and felt better. She did not seek additional medical attention. Improved quickly and no further symptoms over the rest of the weekend.

Next dose scheduled for 1/22 and do not want to take it until I get official direction on what needs to be done proactively and after the next vaccine to ensure my safety.

                                                Client reports that she started feeling a dry spot in the back of her throat that made it slightly difficult to breath around 1/2 hour following vaccine.  She consulted with the nurse administering the vaccine and decided it would be okay to leave the vaccination site.  She reported that the dry spot on the back of her throat became more prominent and it was more difficult to swallow around an hour after receiving the vaccine.   She decided to go to the ER as a precaution because she lives far from the hospital.  At the ER they gave her 75 mg of Benadryl and 15 mg of prednisone.  Her symptoms resolved following the medications.

By the next day  I had a fever, chills, then sweating (back and forth for hours), body aches, very sore arm (sore enough it kept me awake for two nights),  fatigue, and a general feeling of being &#34;sick&#34;. On Sunday,  the fever was gone, but a headache took its place. The other symptoms were still there. When I woke on Monday morning, I felt back to normal (with very mild soreness in my arm). However, on Monday I was walking uphill on the same route I&#39;d taken the previous two days and ran out of breath to the point I had to stop and focus on breathing for several minutes. That&#39;s never happened to me before and I walk that route a lot. Though I was uncomfortable, none of these symptoms was bad enough to visit a Dr. I just wanted to report these side effects so people know that you can get them after the very first shot in the series.

Developed a delayed reaction to the vaccine 12 days after receiving  it.  Developed a rash that is approxiamently 3.5 inches wide by  5 inches in length.  It is dark in color and raised as well as itchy.  I am also experiencing tingling in my tongue and lips as well as feeling that my tongue is slightly swollen as well as my throat.   The rash is warm to the touch and slightly sensitive to touch as well, and is  giving off heat.  It has gotten slightly larger in the past 2 days.  I DO NOT have a fever. Monday evening started taking Allegra.  It helps to keep the reaction I am having in my mouth and the itchiness for about 12 hours

I was made to wait 30 min  for monitoring  and left the site at approximately 2:10 because the arm issue appeared to have subsided .   As I was half way home - 10 /15 min later, I began to feel tingling of my lips and tongue; soon after that I felt swelling  at the back of my throat and tongue. It was difficult to swallow saliva but did not have issues breathing.  I took a Zyrtec as soon as I got home,  I started to feel the swelling subside about 20-30 min after. I took an additional benadryl  as I still had difficulty swallowing and felt some swelling.  It is now 4:30 pm and my throat and tongue are feeling  more normal now.

                                                Patient had no issues during 30 minute monitoring at the clinic.  Around 45 minutes later reported a headache.  Blood pressure was taken and it was 158/78, which she reported to be normal for her.  Was asked about signs of allergic reaction including rash, tongue , throat or lip swelling.  Only reported the headache.  Went home an hour post vaccination and started to feel worse.  Was driving by the hospital and felt a little short of breath and still had a headache so she decided to stop for evaluation.  At this point she did not contact the immunzing pharmacist but rather called her coworkers to let them know, who told the immunizing pharmacist.  Pharmacist called patient later and she said that she was given some benadryl and a few other medicines but the ED told her they could not determine it was related to the vaccine and likely anxiety contributed.  Pharmacist discussed wtih patient that she should seek out medical advice before the next dose was due and arrange to get it at a health care facility and not work.  Patient&#39;s coworkers also reached out to Pharmacist and let her know the ED was unable to determine tha tiw as related to the vaccine.

                                                Patient is a 55-year-old female who had presented to the vaccination clinic this afternoon to receive her COVID-19 vaccine.  She does have a history of migraine headaches and other comorbidities as described below.  Has had reactions to a number of medications, mostly narcotics as noted in her allergy list some of which could in theory be compatible with urticaria.  Does not have true anaphylaxis in her history. Today at about 15 minutes after administration of her COVID-19 vaccine she began to rather precipitously developed an itchy crawling feeling in her skin, nausea with retching and some shortness of breath.  She did not have the sensation of her throat closing off.  Did not have coryza.  Within about 10 minutes she did develop difficulty with speech that she says is typical for her migraine headache.  She received, in the vaccination Clinic, epinephrine 0.3 mg subQ, 125 mg of Solu-Medrol and 50 mg of Benadryl all IV.  An IV was started and a 500 mL bolus of saline was initiated.  With this she was then transferred to the emergency room for further evaluation.   In the emergency room she did develop chest heaviness but no palpitations.  She was not dyspneic.  Her nausea and vomiting by then had seem to resolve.

Took 25 mg benadryl and Proair inhaler. Feeling of throat tightness started to relieve within 20 minutes. No further problem with the throat tightness after that. Asthma flared slightly after injection but controlled with routine asthma meds.

The Nurse had someone call 911 and the nurse gave me an EPI injection in my right arm. The ambulance arrived within just a few minutes ( the health department is located next to the hospital) . The paramedic started an IV and gave a steroid. I was transported by ambulance 1 block to the ER in the Hospital. Dr attended me immediately and gave me more drugs in my IV ( i&#39;m not sure what it was). I was observed for several hours and was sent home with an EPI pen &amp; steriod RX. I was told if I have any more problems in the next 24 hours give my self an EPI injection &amp;  call 911.

                                                I was ill/sick for three weeks.  I am currently going through menopause and have hot flashes frequently throughout the day; not with the Covid shot.  I was freezing cold.  I had 4 fleece blankets on plus wool pajamas.  Four nights I had to sleep in a recliner because it felt like there was an elephant on my chest and I could not breathe.  Two mornings I was coming to work, left my driveway and threw up all over myself; had to turn around, take a shower, and come into work, only to only be able to work 2-4 hours per day for 3 weeks.  The Sat. and Sun. following the injection, I slept until Mon. morning.  I had pure exhaustion from the shot.

They took her vitals which showed that her oxygen saturation was 99%, heart rate was 78 and blood pressure was normal.  They eventually let her go home.  She was not given any Benadryl or any other medications.  The following day on February 13, she was fine.  Later on that day, she developed some sudden onset of itching from the neck up.  Even the insides of her ears were itching.  This lasted 3 to 4 hours and then disappeared by itself.  On February 14th and 15 she said she was suffering from the usual side effects expected from the vaccine including fatigue and a low-grade fever of 99.6 but these again went away by themselves.  The following week, on February 17, she developed more generalized itching all over her body including feet legs and everywhere.  It was similar to the itching that she had developed when she was allergic to sulfa medication.  Discontinued on Thursday.  Now she continues to have some itching but not as bad as on the 17th and 18th.

Rash resolved within hours but she continues to have shortness of breath, intermittent wheezing, body aches, and profound fatigue. Shortness of breath required oral steroid and albuterol which patient has not needed prior to this- no known hx of any lung disease. Patient so fatigued unable to go to work. - seen by me today 3/1/2021.

I did not feel allergenic or odd yet, but looked prety striking. By the time I arrived home 45 minutes after the shot my eyes were puffed almost closed and I had some minor wheezing. I immediately took four 25 mg Benadryl and used my rescue inhaler (albuterol).  By about 1 hour later the reaction was abating and I still felt odd/allergenic plus drowsy from the Benadryl. By  3 hours later my eyes were less puffy, breathing was fine, and no further adverse reaction occurred.  After such a reaction eyes were weird and crusty in the morning but it was just leftover.

                                                Right after the vaccination ion Friday,  I felt fatigue. (at the 15 minutes wait time), I left the facility at 130, Took Prednisone 20 mg per my pulmonologist request at 235pm.  I felt the lungs are heavy, by around 545 pm, I started to have  shortness of breath, at 11 pm that evening, wheezing started.  I started  xopenex, and atrovent neb solution and tylenol for the headache (which started around time of wheezing) By Saturday afternoon, the ribcage is very tight, hard for me to breath, can only take short breath.  I continue to take prednisone 20 mg daily per doctor.  On Monday, telemedicine visit with the pulmonologist, he increase to 60 mg, Ribcage tightness relieved about 1 hour and 45 minutes, back to tightness again.  Tuesday morning, I went to Emergency room, admitted as observation.  Discharged on Thursday.  I was given iv solumedrol while under observation in the hospital.  I return home with oral prednisone prescription.   I feel fine on Friday, Saturday, the ribcage started to tighten again, along with shortness of breath.  Doctor contacted on Monday 3/8/21 with continuation of prednisone and taper down by 10 mg a week.  I am still having shortness of breath and ribcage tightness, especially, when walk, stand, talk.  As of now, I am still home and have not return to work.

I had to get into a tepid bath to get it down to 103 then I alternated tylenol and advil every 3 hours to keep it at 101. I ran a temperature until 3/6/21. Severe headache from 3/5/21 to 3/11/21. Gland under right arm so swollen I couldn&#39;t put my arm down until 3/10. 2 glands in my face and near jaw line remained swollen until 3/12/21. Mucus seemed to be thick and unable to drain from 3/5 -3/14 despite taking Musinex daily (3/8 -3/12 it was even a little hard to take deep breaths). Sore appeared in my nose on 3/6. I know the vaccine does not contain a live virus, but my symptoms after this first shot made me feel like I had Covid all over again.

                                                50 minutes after administration of the vaccine, the patient started to feel  like her throat was somewhat itchy and tight.  There was no wheezing or difficulty breathing.  IM benadryl was administered immediately, and blood pressure taken--which was found to be elevated.  Blood pressure continued to elevate further to the 180s/110s, and patient developed a &#34;pounding headache&#34;  She also complained of pressure behind her eyes and &#34;a funny feeling in my face&#34; (bilateral).  She was given 0.1mg of clonidine and was taken to the hospital by EMS

Returned to the site to be monitored by the doctor. Was advised to take a Benadryl (within 30 minutes of injection). The head issues continued in waves for about 2 hours. My throat felt tight, but never closed off. Once home I experienced a fever of 100 for approximately 2 hours. Remedied by acetaminophen.  Slept well and woke with no further symptoms except slight injection site soreness.

                                                On 1/2/2021, about 45-60 mins after receiving the vaccine, I had mild right sided throat swelling.  It didn&#39;t seem to progress so I wasn&#39;t concerned.  I also developed the typical immune response (headache and sore arm) later in the evening on 1/2/2021.  On 1/3/2021, I woke up with a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and mild shortness of breath.  These symptoms continued on 1/4/2021, however, the symptoms were improved when I woke up on 1/5/2021.  On 1/7/2021, I received an allergy infection.  Within 24 hours I re-developed a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath (all vitals were stable).  Since I had no improvement in symptoms, I consulted with a physician and was placed on antibiotics and advised to continue with albuterol inhaler.  I&#39;m now slowly improving with my symptoms.  I reviewed this information with my allergist and they have advised me to not get the second Moderna vaccine, in case if what I experienced was some form of a mild-moderate allergic reaction.  I personally feel it is also quite possible that I could have had onset of an upper respiratory infection just after receiving the Moderna vaccine, and this may possibly not have been an allergic reaction.  Since this was not the normal course, I felt it should be reported regardless.

She notified the Nursing Supervisor who in turn notified Dr.  She was prescribed Benadryl 25 mg PO and an EpiPen. She took the Benadryl at 11:50 AM and reported a reduction in symptoms within 5 minutes. No reported sequelae. She did not need to take the EpiPen. She is not sure if anxiety contributed to the event as she was aware that an allergic reaction was possible. She reported a severe allergic reaction to dogs in the past.

                                                The patient received her first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on 12/29/2020.  However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after injection, I began to experience chest tightness and labored breathing  similar to the early onset of an asthma attack. The rescue inhaler helped reduce the effects but did not fully eliminate them. The Symbicort Inhaler also helped with breathing but not chest tightness. Although not severe, effects continued to linger 10 hours after injection.

None of the fatigue was felt the next day on the same route. Also noted on day 7 was a droopy left eyelid that was mostly relieved by using refresh eye wetting drops but that still is present daily. I have had this occur once in my past and had a negative EMG workup. I have a scar on my left eye which may have been the cause and may be what is causing this to happen again. At 14 days I noticed new onset tight achy hips bilaterally, which is funny because one coworker has sudden knee pain/stiffness, and  another awoke with back pain and difficulty getting out of bed. They are still achy today

My hands and feet got tingly and then while I was on the phone my tongue and throat swelled and unable  to speak and started to cough. But couldn?t clear my throat . I was able to get enough oxygen. My husband drove my to ER and which time they took my straight back took my vitals and gave me Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroid injection and it worked! They observed me few hours and sent me home.  I was unable to sleep  last night and a hallucination that concerned my husband but otherwise  I?m just achy today, note I never had a fever.

                                                12 hours after injection:  felt cold water through body, extreme aches and difficulty walking due to pain in limbs.  R arm swelled, hot and itchy and stayed from 3/13-3/17.  The area was about 4 fingers wide and in height.  Unable to put any pressure on the area.  Light headed and dizzy 3/13 9 AM.  Needed a cold rag on forehead to avoid passing out. Dissipated after 30 minutes. Spent the day in bed. Extreme night sweats and fatigue 3/13, 3/15. Woke every hour soaking wet.  3/15 less night sweats, only 1 was bad.  Tried sleeping on R arm 3/14 &amp; 3/15. Woke up with difficulty breathing through the nose and mouth. Nose was so dry it hurt.  This was better by 3/16.   Almost felt like an inhaler was needed, but eventually after 20-30 minutes the mouth breathing had calmed down.     Finally it&#39;s 3/17 and my arm feels only slightly sore and very localized.  It is not warm nor is it red.    Treatments for itchy arm - Allegra each day (didn&#39;t help).  Hydrocortizone cream ( helped a bit), Sarna lotion (helped a bit) Treatments for pain in arm - tylenol/hydrocodone  - didn&#39;t help so gave up.

                                                I am a registered nurse. I also am very sensitive to joint pain and muscle pain due to my lupus so I was not surprised by my ?overreaction to the soreness of both injections. However: although I was one of the people who had a severe reaction to the injection in terms of the arm pain, I also experienced a lot of nerve pain down the arm injected into my hand and fingers from the swelling. I also had a large lump with redness and heat. It was more severe with dose number two. I also had pain into my left shoulder and neck. This didn?t concern me and I expected it. I also had severe joint pain bilaterally in all of my joints with malaise and fatigue. This also didn?t concern me. However in February after my second  Moderna vaccine, I began to experience shooting pain in my left back and chest ? just under my left shoulder blade and sometimes running around into my sternum area ?only when lying in the supine position (flat on my back) and only beginning a few minutes after lying down upon taking in a deep breath.  This pain was relieved by sitting up. Initially I thought I had a rib out of place and went to a chiropractor to have an adjustment. After a few visits to the chiropractor and some  Ice / massage, I still have this pain, now on both sides with shortness of breath. I feel it is connected to the vaccine.

Only experience fatigue for first couple of days. 01/03/21 - Around 2pm noticed 3 inch welt across right cheek by 5pm swelling under eyes and random itching around head, neck and face. Headed to doctor 6pm. Saw a PA who said symptoms were not from vaccine when I asked about possibility because of my Hashimotos Thyroiditis. They gave me a steroid shot and called in scrip for Medrol Pack. Later that evening I started also having bad flares of my asthma. Also continued on Benedryl. 01/05/21- started Medrol Pack and continued antihistamines. Very fatigued. 01/10/21-finished Medrol. Still slight welt on right cheek but everything else pretty good. 01/20/21- mid morning noticed welt growing in right cheek and eyes puffing up. By 5pm itching has returned. By 7pm there are now welts and hives on both cheeks and they are  red and hot....asthma flaring badly. Took 30mg prednisone from my medication used for asthma. 01/21/21- things have calmed down redness wise but lots of fatigue. Took 20mg Prednisone. 01/22/21- back to doctor, another Medrol pack. 01/27/21- finished second Medrol pack. Still having slight welts and hives.

                                                while in the waiting area after receiving the vaccine, my lower legs started itching within approximately 5-7 minutes.   I informed the young lady at the checkout station and asked if that was normal. She said yes, some people itch.  I sat back down and after about 10-15 minutes my upper legs started itching.   I waited until it had been about 25-30 minutes and told the young lady at the check out that I was going to the restroom to see if I had a rash from the itching.  When I looked at my chest, I noticed it was starting to get a rash.  I return to the wait area and told the young lady.  I told her I thought I needed to go to the ER and she said we probably need to give you some benadryl.  I told her NO - I&#39;m allergic to that medication. She went and spoke with one of the nurses who informed her that I needed to go to the ER.  She asked if I needed an ambulance and I told her I would drive because I was closer to the Naval Hospital than to the other hospital.  On the way to the hospital I noticed that my face was turning red.  I also noticed while waiting to get into the gate and for the guard to check my ID that my throat was beginning to swell because it was getting harder to swallow.    After arriving at Naval Hospital and explaining what happened they immediately took me into the ER.  I was given an IV Steroid and antihistamine.   I was released and told to take Zyrtec twice a day for the next few days and to follow up with my PCM.  I sent a secured message to my PCM and he called me late yesterday evening.  He asked how I was doing and I am doing well.  The rash, throat swelling and redness are done.   I still have a slight headache and sore arm. doctor informed me not to get the second dose of the vaccine.

After 5 minutes of receiving vaccination, I started to experience shortness of breath followed by rapid heart rate (which was confirmed by the nurse,) and lightheadedness.  I also found that I was shaking if I held my hand out in front of me.  After about 20 minutes after the shot, the shortness of breath, rapid heart rate and shaking subsided although I was still lightheaded.  I waited another 15 minutes until I only experienced mild lightheadedness and left.  The next day, my arm was still very sore (which lasted for 3 days) although I felt fine, however, experienced moderate fatigue and general achiness and just rested.  I experienced this also for 3 days with it lessening each day.  By the 4th day, my arm was only slightly sore and didn&#39;t feel much fatigue.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA 5  hours after getting my first vaccine I had a breathing crisis with my oxygen dropping into the low 60s. I have COPD and use home oxygen as well as portable on the rare occasion that I leave the house since COVID 19.  I&#39;ve also had a thoracotomy and thoracentesis in 2019. But my oxygen never drops that low. We turned up my oxygen, I used my rescue inhaler, and we started a breathing treatment. None of it was helping and I felt like I was suffocating. My husband called emergency services. The EMTs got me on oxygen with a face mask and gave me IV Magnesium in the ambulance. I was breathing better by the time we got to the ER. They gave me additional medications and oxygen there. They took a chest X-ray too, but said it looked clear.

I was unaware of what was going on and I had trouble breathing. The next thing I remember is being on a cart and they gave me the EpiPen in the left leg. My lips and right side of my face was swollen. I began to get numb again after a while so they had to give me another EpiPen in the right leg. I was taken to the ER for 4 hours I received some allergy medicine which I took for 4 days because my lips were still swelling. I had a facial recently and had a reaction again. My system is still on alert and I carry an EpiPen.

                                                I had my second covid vaccination on 2/3/21.  On the morning of 3/16 I woke up short of breath, chilling, chest pain, chest congestion and cough, and a fever of 101F which rose to 102.5F.  I was monitoring my pulse ox which would range from 90 to 91% but at times dropped to 84%.  I had to mentally take deep breaths to get my pulse ox to 90%.  These symptoms lasted 12 hours.  Next day, short of breath at times and tired.  Called the health department on 3/18 and was told to get a rapid test which was negative.  The NP thought I might have pneumonia or a pulmonary embolus.  I was sent to the ED and a CTa  scan was done and everything was normal including 12 lead ekg, pulse ox and vital signs.  The physician thought it was GERD.  I&#39;m a nurse and  have GERD, this was not GERD.  The PA that took care of me agreed the symptoms were, &#39;weird&#39; and I should report this incident.

                                                A few hours after vaccination, I began to feel like I was getting ill, with fatigue and headache. I also experienced swelling at site of injection, along with hives on my face and neck on the same side as the injection. I had swelling in my neck, throat, tongue, lips, ears and eyes with some tingling. There was a red pallor on both of my cheeks. I also had slightly labored breathing. I took antihistamines and tylenol which helped reduce the symptoms within an hour. If I did not continue to take these round the clock for the next 4 days, the symptoms would get worse. Toward the end of the day, symptoms worsened regardless of antihistamine or tylenol and continue to do so as of yesterday, 1/3/2021. Symptoms have gotten better over the last 4 days. Its hard to say if I am fully recovered as in the evenings when I&#39;m more fatigued, I still have the tingling and mild swelling although the redness and hives have abated.

                                                2-3 minutes after the vaccination I developed a very fast heart rate, had a strange taste in my mouth, and for a brief second I thought my throat would close in.  I was immediately taken to the ER and monitored for about 2 hours.  During that time I had about 4 episodes of my heart rate going very high. I was told 120-150 beats/m. I was also told that I had PVC&#39;s and PAC&#39;s. I was released after 2 hours and had  another episode of a  fast heart rate on my way home. Since then I have had daily episodes of fast heart rate but not as long and not as intense.  Last episode was 2 days ago.

                                                On 12/31 finished having dinner. Thought sudden slight shortness of breath may be do to appetizer type foods we had. Drank water to help subside it with little effect. Went outside into cold air. Still had some slight shortness of breath. At 8PM continued to my other daughters home( where I&#39;ve been going since pandemic) upon sitting there still felt slight shortness of breath but again manageable. We left at 11:30 as my breathing never really got better or worse. When I arrived home I Took my PROAIR-HFA inhaler that I use PRN. My symptoms resolved and went to bed. On Friday 1/1 I had again slight shortness of breath with no real excertion.  On 1/2 I went to work at Hospital in neurology dept. I was pushing collector up to SICU unit and then to M2 unit. On arrival to M2 I felt very winded and took my inhaler with results.  I then called my manager to make him aware that I was having dilemma do to fact that I didn&#39;t want to call Covid hot line as I felt symptoms were from vaccine not Covid!  I was put out of work by Covid hot line had test on 1/4 and negative results on 1/6. My symptoms seemed to subside on 1/6. I returned to work on 1/9 and am pushing collectors and patients with no symptoms

                                                Immediately following injection I had a metallic taste in my mouth. My heart felt like it was racing and shortness of breath. The lady who have shot said my face turned really red. Blood pressure spiked - they took it. Normally it&#39;s 107/70&#39;s-80&#39;s and it was 148/98 and my pulse was around 100 or a little more. Called Drs - to check heart. Okay. BP started going down and I sat for a little bit and I went home but I didn&#39;t drive. Went to work next day but I felt really tired. BP was in high range but not quite as high as yesterday. I was so tired and I went home for the day to rest because I couldn&#39;t work. Blood pressure started going back in normal range about 48 hours later. Metallic taste lasted about 3 days.

Anaphylaxis is often referred to as slow roll and without the typical face swelling and rash. It is more subtle and can be harder to detect.  And that was my experience: as follows: I became faint and briefly passed out within 2 minutes of injection. I stabilized quickly within a 30 minute hold although developed increasing nausea, I and med tech was satisfied that it might just be my dysautanomia. I spent the evening with severe headache vomiting as passed out again. I experienced throat tightening but not full closure. The next day I had flue like symptoms that I assume were normaland vaccine related. When this passed in the evening I again suffered nausea and dizziness, vomiting and throat tightening when I tried to eat.  These symptoms were not similar to the flush feelings earlier in the day. The symptoms ebbed and waned for 2 days with increased frequency as I took chromalyn , Benadryl with some effect at first and ate with great care as not to introduce more allergens.  I had increased chest pain,  sweating, fainting, throat tightening became severe Benadryl was not effective. I was having trouble swallowing. I was forced to us an epi pen and call 911. This  is a typical anaphylactic response for EDS&lt; Mast Cell patients. It became clear that I could not get past this on my own and the symptoms were increasing. I started to shake with chills and feared shock as my chest pains increased. The epi pen injection and hospital visit via ambulance occurred Monday 1/25-1/26. I became very faint during the Ems intake with the techs having to hold me up to check vitals etc.. My HR dropped despite the EPi. At the ER I was given IV steroids,  IV Benedryl and Potassium,  tablets and fluids throughout the night, admitted for evaluation.

                                                Nine days after vaccine #1 my Left arm directly above and below the vaccine site became warm swollen and red. The redness traveled to my shoulder and down to my elbow. It was slightly itchy but not much. It lasted for about 6 days and then disappeared. On the day of the vaccine I took my EPI pen with me to get the vaccine because of my allergy to pepper not really knowing what was in the vaccine. I had a slight tightening of my throat and some facial/head itchiness which resolved without incident. Later in the evening of the vaccine I developed light headedness, nausea and headache which resolved by the next day.

                                                Moderna dose 2 received at 1605. Patient reported funny taste and throat tightness. Oral diphenhydramine liquid 25mg was given. Tongue swelling and mild stridor were noted, prompting administration of an epinephrine pen and EMS was called. SpO2 noted to be in high 70s, along with persistent symptoms, so she was given an additional epinephrine pen as well as 100mg IM hydrocortisone. She was started on a 15L non-rebreather mask, IV was placed in the left antecubital space, and intubation kit was pulled from cart. Tongue and stridor improved after these doses of epinephrine and hydrocortisone. Blood pressure 190s systolic from 170s systolic after first epinephrine dose, with HR 116 at this point, and SpO2 99%. As EMS arrived, diphenhydramine 25mg IV was administered. At that point, tongue size and stridor were noted to have worsened again, so a third epinephrine pen was administered prior to EMS transport. Patient received racemic epinephrine inhalation nebulizer in EMS. Further treatment administered in ED: LR, dexamethasone and famotidine. Patient admitted later that day for further monitoring given hypertensive status. Put on scheduled cetirizine, famotidine, and dexamethasone and PRN albuterol and racemic epinephrine. Throughout her stay, patient continued to improve with stable vital signs and normal breathing. She was monitored for a total of 2 days and discharged home on 1/29.

                                                Symptoms began Saturday late morning - shortness of breath, throat felt closed by Sunday shortness of breath got much worse, had to yawn to get air or sit and breath through my nose. I used an 90 MCG Inhaler (that I had from a year and a half ago).  That was not helping enough.  My primary care  called in a prescription for Flovent HFA 110mcg (2 puffs X 2 a day). That and the Pro Air kept me from going to the emergency (just barely) Sunday night - nasal congestion and mucus in throat.   Added Flonase  and a few days later Mucinex. by 2/9/21 sore throat and swollen (lymph nodes), especially on left side 3/3/21 breathing is finally improving still have swollen area in neck, though it is much better. I did not get my scheduled 2nd dose

She had mild shortness of breath at the time. She has known and frequent episodes of tachycardia. Though they are often relatively transient; this lasted until and during her visit to the ED presently but she states there are no unusual features to her symptoms today. She agrees multiple Holter monitors and event monitor have found only sinus tachycardia, thought in past to be triggered by anxiety but pt denies any anxiety related to vaccine or otherwise today. She states she is eating and drinking normally today; did not fast for vaccine.  Pt states no sx today other than those of her usual tachycardia but was evaluated downstairs and sent to ED for further eval.

She removed jacket and sat down in room.  She started feeling dizzy and her eyes were closing.  She had some shallow breathing and felt faint.  911 was called, and while EMTs were assessing, she vomited.  When she came to, she said she felt that she may have been experiencing a migraine.  After EMT assessment, she refused going to ER.  Patient went home, I followed up via phone 6 hours later and she felt fine.

                                                Vaccine induced pancytopenia /  thrombocytopenia - STILL ONGOING WITH TREATMENT.  My mom felt very tired the 2nd day after the vaccine; blood taken ~5 days after vaccination showed lower HgB count (8.8 from her normal range of 11&#43;). She remained at home for recovery and then consulted a hematologist. During this period she still felt extremely tired / dizzy / headaches / couldn&#39;t walk up the stairs without breath. 13 days later - more blood sample was taken and now she is diagnosed with pancytopenia - lowered count of RBC (it down further), HgB (down further to 7.1), and Platelets (down to 80 from ~170 her first blood sample). And she was hospitalized. They gave her Prednisone, and a blood transfusion at the hospital. During this first stay - her RBC / HgB and Platelets seemed to have stablized and went higher but they didn&#39;t pay attention to her WBC - which went down to 2 (below normal range). A day later during follow up around WBC - it went lower to ~1.2 (her platelets ~117). She developed a fever - now it is considered a neutropenic fever and she was hospitalized once again (platelets was back down to 84 at the beginning of her stay). During this past week in the hospital, they gave her meds to induce WBC growth - which worked but it overshot to 12 (above normal range) and at the same time her platelets and RBC and HgB dipped again lower. Platelets dipped to 43 on Saturday along with HgB down to  7.1 after 2 days of sustained high WBC count so they gave her IVIG and another blood transfusion. After that, her WBC dropped a little further and is stabilizing around 6 along with HgB around ~10. However her platelets remain high volatile - it went to 51 on Sunday, dropped to 46 on Monday, and now it is 38 today. She was discharged from the hospital today and we have a standing order to have her blood tested everyday.

It was normal.  Most of the symptoms resolved approximately 20 minutes later. I did not go to the hospital.  I left feeling not completely right with some discomfort in my chest.  One week later my right arm at the injection site became hot and red 4 inches by 3 inches by 4 inches around and the soreness returned.  It is still slightly pink with soreness.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had fever and chills, vomited and diahrea at the same time so bad I had to lie on the bathroom floor for almost an hour exhausted. Got into bed and felt cold emanating from the inside despite the heat up high and loads of covers. Then had body pains hard to describe. Then everything stopped and I just was so exhausted I couldn&#39;t even roll over. The next day I was fine except for a very bad headache. The next 2 days I had coughing and slight shortness of breath. Now fine, a week later. I had these exact symptoms, end of  November 2019 that felt like pneumonia at the time. My niece was sick with this too. She was in contact with someone who was in contact with workers who came there for work. The Z-pack I took helped for a day maybe and then continued to be sick for several weeks.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction. Shot given around 9am. Around 11am symptoms appeared: extremely hot/flushed, nauseated, felt ill, difficulty swallowing. Went to pharmacist who had me sit down, within 30 seconds could not swallow. Pharmacist injected me with Epi Pen and called 911. Paramedics arrived gave more epinephrine, oxygen, started breathing treatment. Lost my voice as throat started to tighten more. Taken to Hospital where I was given Benadryl, steroids, stomach meds, more fluids and another breathing treatment since my lungs were so tight, I could only take shallow breaths. The crated my lungs, did blood work and kept me overnight for observation because I have a history of secondary reactions when I experience anaphylaxis. I was released from the hospital on 2/20/2021 at 2pm.

I stopped went into store bought benadryl, took the 50 mg was not far from work, went in, shortness of breath was worse so they told me to go home.  Went home, that day laid on couch covered with quilt.  Around 9 p.m. that night, had another spell got hot again.  I did  not think to check blood pressure or heart rate or oxygen that day,   The next day I did, by blood pressure was low  I have lost the logs but on blood pressure machine  106-65 hr 109, bp 85-60 hr 91, bp 115-81 hr 90 this remained for next 2 weeks, then went back to normal. kept the rash for a week, then went away, had the sore arm, pain radiated down arm into hand, felt fatigue and tired.  I called back spoke she advised not to take the second shot, I was orginally scheduled to take it on 2-5-21 @1:20 but canceled after all the trouble I had from the first one.  I did not go to the dr for myself, as I don&#39;t have very good insurance since my husband is on disability and we have insurance which does not pay very well. My husband has many dr&#39;s appt. and I could not afford to go.

Early the next morning I had a horrible headache, felt feverish and nausea.  Could not take a deep breath.  The second day after the shot was the worst.  I could not get out of bed, felt like someone had their hands around my neck, but I could breath, just not deeply.  Terrible headache, not wanting food or water.  Now is the fifth day and I feel much better.  Not so sure about getting the second shot.

She even looked like she was gasping for air. An epipen was administered and within seconds she was able to breathe. 911 was contacted upon initiation of the reaction. EMS arrived within minutes after administering the epipen. She was assessed by paramedics and it was determined that the patient would be ok. I called husband in the afternoon to check on patient and he stated that she was good. I also followed up on 03/05/2021 with the patient and she stated that other than soreness that she was fine. I let patient know that since she had a reaction to the first dose, that she would not be able to receive the second dose.

                                                Had second covid shot on February 18th. On February 20th while exercising on the treadmill I noticed my stamina was not the same. Felt like I just started an exercise program. I have been waling on treadmill for 20 years waling 4-6 miles at a time. Felt like I could hardly walk due to getting tired easily and very early in routine. Afterwards I am experiencing shortness of breath, smothering feeling, hard to take a deep breath, lightheadedness and palpatations. Have not been able to keep my normal exercise routine due to symptoms. Contacted my doctor about symptoms and he ordered a treadmill test. Did the treadmill test on March 16 and awaiting the results.

I made a comment to my husband that it felt like my mask was on.  Thought nothing of it.   I am not prone to allergies outside of sulfa, metforin, radioactive dye.  I had no idea I was having a reaction.  At 45 minutes after shot, while I was driving 20 minutes away from my home, my throat, tongue, started to swell.  My breathing became labored.  I didn&#39;t know what was happening to me.  I remained calm.  I drove to my house to seek help from my husband.  At 1:10-1:15 p.m., I took sips of water and tried to eat something.  I started to feel better.  At 1:30 PM, the swelling, etc. ... gone.  From that point, no further swelling reaction other than the start of the effects.

                                                after the shot, while I was walking to the next table, my heart began to race and there was a fluttering in my chest. I was given a number and sat down for 15 min. after a few minutes, the fluttering stopped and my heart rate became normal. After 15 min I went home. The next morning, I woke up to flulike symptoms. I stayed in bed teh whole day because I was too weak and my head was pounding. I did take two Tylenol but not until later in the day because I couldn&#39;t get up. The next day I was still weak but able to move about slowly because I was still fatigue. Monday, I took the day off because I was still fatigue, I rested all day Monday with very little movement. Tuesday I went work and in the course of my day, walking the halls at a fast pace, my heart began to race, the fluttering returned and I became short of breath. I nearly fell to the floor but caught myself. Every day I have been feeling the shortness of breath and the elevated heart rate as well as the fluttering but only on exertion. If I stay still or sit, I am fine, but walking at a fast pace puts me back in distress. It&#39;s been 6 days now.
