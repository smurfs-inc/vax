                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

She presented at a walk-in clinic and received Epi-Pen 0.3mg, Solu-Medrol and Benadryl, while there she received 2 additional doses and was transferred to the nearest ED by ambulance. At the ED  she received a 4th dose of Epi-Pen 0.3mg and albuterol and DuoNeb treatments. She was admitted for observation. She went home and needed to return within 24 hours to the ED because her lips and tongue started to swell and she turned blue. She subsequently needed 3 additional doses of Epi-Pen over the next 24-48 hours. She has been on Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours and Famodine 20mg until present.

                                                On Dec 28 - three hours after vaccine - started getting pain near injection site. It ached. 8:30PM that night I started getting itching from the midback to top of head on left side. Not left arm just the back, neck and face of left side. No rashes but a little red because I scratched. Then I noticed some bumps on my left side of my face and one hive on each knee and one hive on left shoulder. Telemed visit with dr. - took Benadryl - 25 mg. - within one hour of symptoms - at 9:00 pm per dr. Woke up next morning and had intense fatigue; muscles and back were really achy. Couldn&#39;t move my muscles very well. Felt like the wind had been knocked out of me. Bouts of itchiness. Slept throughout the day. That helped. But then had headache start - felt like a circle where my temples are to the back of my head and that is where is stayed. Next day - no fever and  but my symptoms improved except still had the symptoms but they had improved. Went to work on Wednesday because it started to go away - on and off headache - felt foggy. Bouts of itchiness and felt physically weak because my muscles had gotten so so tight. Felt a physical weakness for five more days. Headache went away by Wednesday night (Dec 30th). Itchiness went away. Three days symptoms went away although the physical weakness lingered until 5th  day. Used a heating pad for my muscles to help relax them.

                                                About 2 to 3 minutes after receiving my injection, I began to feel a burning sensation in my nostrils. It felt like a 4/10 pain. The burning sensation worsened when breathing through my nose. When trying breathing techniques to calm down (breathing deeply through the nose, exhaling out the mouth), the burning sensation deepened towards the back of my throat - but I never felt it in my lower throat and chest - only the top of my throat and nose.  The nurse on staff took me to a corner for closer evaluation. She had me remove my mask and checked my body for hives. I had no hives and the burning sensation occurred even after my mask was removed. She asked if I had trouble breathing or itchiness, I had neither of those symptoms. My heart rate was high and I began to hyperventilate because I was having a panic attack. I had no other symptoms besides the panic attack symptoms (tight chest, tingly face and hands, rapid heart rate, and dizziness) and the burning nostrils.  The sensation lasted about 5-10 minutes, then dissipated. I then put my mask back on after it was requested. I continued to be monitored by the nurse for another 20 minutes until I gained back my normal breathing and my heart rate lowered. I was scheduled for a 2nd dose and was dismissed with no other treatment or issues. I drove myself back home and rested for the remainder of the day.  I had no other symptoms that day, other than the typical sore arm, fatigue, and mild chills, which resolved themselves in a couple days. I had no other complications.

My throat started to hurt really bad and I felt like I could not breathe I looked in my mouth and my tonsils were swelling  and I had to give myself an epi pen so I could breathe. Went home called my doctor and told him what happen I was very flushed, headache, sore throat cough, and I started to warm up several hours later to 100.9. He told me to take steroids I was given when I had COVID and told me if I start to have other symptoms to go to the emergency room. He also said since I recently had gotten COVID I was not suppose to get the second vaccine yet.

                                                Arm pain began in early afternoon with skin tenderness beginning in the evening, which were followed by extreme chills, body aches that hurt to be still, muscle spasms, fever (102-101.4), throbbing headache (treated with ibuprofen x2 200mg Q4hr which helped some), then around 12am became hot and sweaty with aches and spasms persisting. Was able to sleep off and on every time I turned over onto my vaccine arm I woke because of the pain. Next morning I spent the day in bed with lingering chills, muscle aches, headache, and spasms, but less than night before. High Fever persisted (101.4) and a cough with mild shortness of breath developed. The night of 2/28 I took ibuprofen (same dose as before) and Benadryl which allowed me to sleep all night. This morning (3/1) I feel better, with fatigue, lightheaded, a mild fever of  99.3, and minimal muscle aches. Cough persists.

                                                Around 6 pm I got a severe headache, very bad body aches, trouble breathing, and a very fast heart rate. I felt faint and had cold sweats so I went to ER after work. The ER doctor gave me fluids, a vial of tylenol through IV, and just observed me to make sure my heart rate and blood pressure came down. They said it sounded like a normal reaction. Fever of 101. I am getting a MRI of my brain on Tuesday 3/9/21 for continued severe headaches.

                                                Starting about 1 minute after vaccination I became extremely dizzy, blacked out/lost vision, had shortness of breath and a tight chest, lost feeling in my hand and fingers on my left side (the side I got the vaccine), was sweating but felt cold flowing through my body. These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

                                                The adverse event began as a feeling that there was an air bubble stuck in my throat. It then manifested into feeling like there was swelling in my throat. Eventually, there was external swelling on the left side of my throat. This lasted for a couple weeks, and would happen off and on. I visited the Nurse Practitioner at my doctor&#39;s office, and she confirmed that there indeed was some minor swelling in the lymph node on the left side of my throat. She ordered an ultrasound for my head/neck, but because of the cost, I was unable to get the ultrasound. The swelling has since subsided. I made the correlation that the swelling was on the same side as both of my Moderna injections, so I figure the swelling is due to the COVID vaccine.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes under both arms, urgent care, referred to ultrasound tech, mammogram, referred to general surgeon (awaiting appointment). Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

At 9pm that night when I took out my dog outside for a couple minutes I started uncontrollably shaking and I couldn?t stop. My chest started hurting and my breathing was difficult. I went back inside and laid on the floor and waited for the symptoms to stop. Once they finally stopped after about 10 minutes I just had the sore arm and chills again. It?s now been 2 days sense the vaccine and the chills hasn?t gone away. But I don?t have the uncontrollable shaking anymore.

Monday, the fatigue improved but Instartes to get muscle aches and stiffness. Soreness in my joints. By Wednesday evening my chest started to hurt for a few minutes and my heart rate temporarily Increased. As the days went on the symptoms became more regular. I also got extreme anxiety, a very fast heartbeat (up to 130 BPM), insomnia, sweating palms and feet, and very difficult to breathe. I couldn?t even get up to take a shower sometimes or sit up. I was admitted to the ER on I believe Tuesday the 23rd of March. This is all in the records. All tests came back normal  aside from low iron, but anemia tests came back negative. After all doctors refused to give me medication to directly treat it, I finally went to an urgent care where they gave me prednisone. It?s currently helping me. I was finally able to go for a walk today.

HR elevated; having difficulty breathing so EpiPen 1:1000 given IM in left thigh.  Adult code blue called.  Code team arrived within 30 seconds to one minute and employee transported to ER via gurney.    Per ER Notes: DEXAmethasone (DECADRON) 10 mg/mL injection for oral use 10 mg (10 mg Oral Given 12/28/20 1301)  Patient is in no acute distress, states that she feels well.  History and physical exam as above.  Patient states that her symptoms have resolved as of arriving in the emergency department.  We will assume that this was an anaphylactic reaction, she was not given time to develop all signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, however she was given an EpiPen and her dyspnea rapidly improved and therefore we will treat her as if she experience anaphylaxis.  She will be kept in the emergency department for 6 hours for observation, she was given 10 mg of p.o. Decadron.  At the time of my shift change she continued to be hemodynamically stable, awake, and talkative. She still required ~3 hours of observation at that time. I saw this patient with attending physician, please see her note for ultimate disposition or further developments.

Most symptoms appeared overnight (about 8-12 hours post injection on 3/24) and have continued throughout the day (3/25). The shortness of breath began about an hour after injection (3/24), and has continued through the next day (3/25). So far treatment has involved taking ibuprofen at 10:30pm (3/24).

Heart rate was checked by medical professional in household and was found to be 120 and irregular. This lasted approximately 2 minutes. At this time also felt shortness of breath which lasted 30 minutes. Once the tachycardia and shortness of breath ended, I was getting chills and continued to have nausea and extreme fatigue. Since the vaccination my arm has continued to be very sore. When I woke up on 1/8/2021 I am still very fatigued and still have a sore arm.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning her co-worker, a 28 year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced anaphylaxis reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

A couple weeks after my first vaccine, I had a reaction when drinking miralax. Within ~5 minutes of having a few sips of a 17g solution, I had throat tingling/tightening, sense of impending doom, cough, dyspnea, nausea, fecal urgency, and intense chills with shivering. I stopped drinking the solution and my symptoms eventually resolved on their own (the chills and nausea took the longest, about 1.5 hours) - I didn&#39;t even think to take benadryl because it wasn&#39;t clear to me at the time if I was really having an allergic reaction (no hives, no vomiting - but in retrospect I&#39;m concerned). I&#39;ve had miralax in the past without any issues. I&#39;ve never had a vaccine adverse reaction. I have no history of atopy.

Staff did ask me how I was feeling I had no signs or symptoms upon being released. I left the facility feeling great had no issues at all. I went to pick up my dinner at 7:45pm drove home. When I arrived home my lips started to tingle, and my face was starting to swell up. I inspected the rest of my body for any rash called my mom and read over the fact sheet that was given to me at time of shot. As per the directions regarding the risk of an allergic reaction I called my primary care doctor because my face was beginning to swell, and my throat started to feel scratchy. My primary care doctor called me back and advise I go to the ER immediately to be monitored for an allergic reaction.  I arrived in a Hospital just before 9pm and checked in at the ER. The doctor saw me quickly.  By the time the doctor saw me at the ER my face was bright red I had developed a rash all over my chest and back and on the injection site, my lips were swollen and had mild throat swelling. She gave me a high dose of prednisone and 2 Benadryl&#39;s.  They continued to monitor me for a while until they felt better and discharged me with a epi pen and other meds.

I have had a steroid shot on 2/18/2021 and was started on a Medrol dose pack, no relief and the rash got worse. I contacted my doctor/dermatologist over the weekend and was prescribed Prenisone 60 mg. I have been taking Prednisone 60 mg daily since Sunday 2/21/2021, with Zyrtec tid, Pepcid tid and Benadryl twice daily. I have been using my bronchodilator (Albuterol) about 3-4 times daily with my daily Brillinta (diskus inhaler) to prevent airway issues. I have had no relief. My rash and hives are not fully suppressed and I they move over my body. They burn, and get hot. Ice helps but doesn&#39;t seem to make them go away.

                                                I received the vaccine at 10:10 am on 2/13/2021. I began feeling as though I couldn&#39;t breath approximately 5-6 minutes after I received the vaccine. The difficulty breathing began to get worse and I got the attention of the nurse. She administered my first epi-pen at 10:18 am. I was transported from the observation room to the emergency department. On my way to the emergency department I  began to have difficulty breathing again and received a second dose of epinephrine. When I arrived at the emergency department I was given Benadryl, Zyrtec, and another medication.  I was monitored in the emergency department for 3 hours without further incident.

                                                Within 3 hours of getting the vaccine, I noticed red, swollen hives on both forearms. It was very itchy and uncomfortable. I also got hives on the bottom of my neck. I noticed slight difficulty in breathing, but it was not significant enough to require emergency care. The hives persisted overnight and showed up on both hands as well. The hives on my arms lasted about 4 days. The hives on my hands lasted about 6 days and are  only slightly itchy now. The hives are still on my neck and now under my eyes and throughout my face/jawline (1 week after vaccination).

My husband took me to the hospital ER and before arriving to the ER I was having a stridor episode and when the nurse checked my temperature it read 102.3. I could not complete a full sentence and began vomiting. I was given epinephrine nebulized, solumedrol, benadryl, zofran, lidocaine nebulized. I had a CT with contrast of my neck and a chest xray. All images came back normal, I had been treated for an allergic reaction from the COVID vaccine and discharged home once the symptoms and stridor subsided.

                                                Strep throat like symptoms began 3 days after my 2nd covid vaccine (Friday January 29, 2021). Sore, red, and swollen throat, white patches on tonsils, low grade fever (max temp 100.5), chills, body aches beginning Friday, January 29, 2021.  I initially went to urgent on Sunday, January 31, 2021 for a strep test. The test was negative and the nurse practitioner told me to return if my symptoms didn?t improve in a few days.  On Tuesday February 2,2021, after my symptoms worsened, I went to Urgent Care for a second opinion/strep test as this is generally the hospital I use for treatment as opposed to the urgent care that I mentioned previously. The nurse practitioner did not swab me for strep, but rather observed my red, swollen, white patch filled throat and ordered me a round of steroids and antibiotics. I started both the antibiotics and steroids today, February 2,2021.

Patient did not complain of any shortness of breath, itching, hives, etc. BP and pulse ox were normal, but some wheezing was noted by a physician in the vaccine clinic.

This was also present after the first dose of the vaccine, but much milder. I also experienced, chills, headache, and body aches. I took Tylenol for these symptoms and took 2 zyrtec for the shortness of breath. All symptoms lasted only about 24 hours. They seem much better on 2 days after the vaccine.

At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

I started feeling itchy in that area as well. I started getting bumps all over. I took 2 puffs of my Symbicort, Benadryl, and Loratadine. I continued taking the Symbicort and Benadryl. I fell asleep siting up. By 12/24 I could not swallow and it would hurt my chest to breath so I decided to go to the ER.

I felt body aches, a horrible headache. The next day I had the fever (it went away on the 13th). the body aches were better.  I also had pain in my arm and the symptoms were all back in the evening. On 01/09 I was tested and was negative but on the 20th I was tested again and was positive. I was seen by the Doctor  on the 13th and he prescribed me something that helped me with the fever. He also diagnosed me with pharyngitis. After the 20th, when I was diagnosed positive I also started with shortness of breath and anxiety attacks.

The pain extended through all of it - from my elbow through both my little finger and ring finger, and I could barely move my arm without it making it hurt more. The intense pain slowly went away within the next 3 hours.  - About an hour later I was really exhausted.  -Around 4pm, I was extremely tired, had a really fast heartbeat, and I was having difficulty breathing (similar to when I have asthma). The fast heart rate and the breathing difficulties went away around 6/6:30pm. The fatigue went away the next day.

                                                The onset of symptoms started around 9:15am. I experienced numbness and tingling to bilateral feet and lower legs. I experienced dizziness. I also experienced an increased heart rate (160s-170s BPM). I was hyperventilating and had difficulty with breathing. I was pale and cold.  I had uncontrollable shakes. My BP was a bit higher than my normal but not hypertensive.  I was given candy and juice after onset of symptoms. ( I did have an English muffin prior to receiving the vaccine). My symptoms subsided for some time but then came back about 15 minutes later. These symptoms continued to occur about every 15 minutes for a period of close to 2 hours. I was given Benadryl 50mg PO after the first hour of symptoms. I continued to experience the symptoms for up to about 45 minutes after being given Benadryl. My symptoms began to subside and eventually stopped after the 2 hour mark.

She was scared to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Then she said she did feel SOB and throat feels tight. I grabbed the EPI pen and injected 0.3mg into lateral right thigh. Brought patient to our emergency room, administered Benadryl 25mg (2 caps) po. Started IV NaCl 1000 mL in RAC. Administered famotidine 20mg/2ml IPV over 2 minutes. Currently on slow IV drip, 2nd bag. Patient is doing well. She was initially shaky after the EPI pen but throat did not feel tight less than 10 minutes after injection. Currently is relaxed as I monitor her. Vitals have been stable.

                                                I received my vaccination at my place of work. Local pharmacy came in to administer them.  In less then a minute of recieving the vaccination I experienced a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  I told my symptoms to the  pharmacist that was there.  I had to take my mask off due to the difficulty breathing.  I sat down and was trying to catch my breath.  Roughly 10 -15 minutes passes then my throat began to swell.  My extremities were feeling tingly and I was very dizzy.  I sat with my neck extended to maintain my airway until they could locate some benedryl.  My voice was wheezy when attempting to answer questions the pharmacist was asking.  The pharmacist wanted to administer the EpiPen but I would not allow her to because then they would have to call 911.  It took about 45 minutes in total to locate benedryl.  I took 50 mg.  Roughly 15 -20 minutes after taking the benedryl I was able to breath with ease.  I waited about another 15 minutes at the facility to ensure I was ok.  I was told I would not be recieving the second dose due to my anaphylactic reaction.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

I fell back asleep until 3:30 AM. I woke up with a racing heartbeat, chills and shortness of breath. My oxygen saturation which is usually normal was in the high 80?s. I took another dose of Motrin 800 mg and was able to break my fever and this reduced my heart rate. My oxygen saturation was still low. I fell back sleep around 4:10 AM and was able to sleep until 7:00 AM. I took another dose of Motrin around 8:00. I had a persistent headache and general malaise the day following vaccination. 2 days after vaccination I still felt very tired and weak and had a persistent headache. Day 3 was symptom free.

About 1am I developed a fever of 101.5 which had went to 102.1 and for 24 hrs I could not get it down below 101.   On Tues I woke up at 2am soaked in sweat but the fever had broke for about 12 hrs. I developed another fever of 100.5 but it went away with no medication.  I felt better the next day but the fever returned later along with SOB and because the fever returned it prompted me to go to the urgent care where a chest xray was done.  The xray showed my lungs were inflamed.  On 1/19 I developed the same SOB, chest tighness and another fever of 101.  I reached out to my doctor and had an office visit where another xray was done but normal and was started on the Flovent enhaler to help with the SOB and breathing.

                                                After the vaccine I got chills beginning at 10pm.  About 1am I got a fever but was already taking started tylenol and motrin because I developed a headache also.  The fever went as high as 101.2.  On Tuesday I woke at 2am soaked in sweat and the fever had broke.  Later that day the fever returned at 100.5 but broke on its on.  By Saturday I woke up again with SOB and super cold.  Fever had returned at 101 so I went to Urgent Care  because the fever just kept returning.  A chest xray was done and it showed my lungs were really inflammed.  The fever returned later but went away.  The SOB is still here.  And on  1/19 I got the same feeling with SOB, 101.1 fever and felt awful all over again. So I visited with my PCP and another chest Xray and blood work was done again.  The chest xray showed normal but was started on a Flovent enhaler to help with the breathing and SOB.

As a result, I had mild nausea. If went away after 20 minutes. As the expected chills, headache, and fever continued, I started to develop tachycardia at rest (107-172bpm) with heart palpitations around 9:30am. The palpitations went away approximately 2 hours later. I still continue to have tachycardia with minor shortness of breath sensation.  My heart rate is currently 115bpm at rest. My typical resting heart rate is 65-70bpm.

I was having severe chills - never experienced these kinds of chills before. I took Tylenol. I tried to still go to work but I by was having difficulty breathing and on January 11, I called my primary care Dr. and waited for appt but on January 13, there was no appt available and she told me to go ER. ER  part of medical group/hospital. They told me I might have COVID.  Dr said severe reaction to vaccine. I was still having trouble breathing. I have albuterol inhaler that I use as needed. I had it in my bag and I used that (and I had been using it when I was having trouble breathing but it wasn&#39;t helping like it could have ). They sent me home but I was still having trouble breathing. I had difficulty breathing for about about three days and then it resolved. I followed up with my PCP - video visit after two days after ER and then I had an office visit with her. After two weeks, I felt recovered. Although my right arm still have pain - pinching sharp pain in my arm that comes.

                                                after the shot, back pain intensified.  Throughout the day, the back pain turned into severe stomach issues.  Took stomach meds (pepto bismol) with no effect.  Went to sleep and woke up in the middle of night with stabbing pain in my stomach. used a heating pad to help me go back to sleep.  the 2nd day my stomach felt as if it was a balloon- extremely bloated and it hurt to breath deep, and stand straight. Took pepto, gas x, and also tried tums- nothing helped.  Today is day 3, and I am back to feeling normal aside from still being very tired, and hazy.  No more stomach issues.  Called doctor to see what I should do today, and was advised to not take the second dose.  Would like a second opinion.

Minor rash started around 12pm on 3rd day, periods of shortness of breath.  I am so far only 3 days in, the skin sensitivity all over is the worse I had to leave work.

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

Then I started to feel very dizzy and light headed. My body could not hold me up so I fell to the floor. My heart started to palpitate very fast, and I could not catch my breath to try to regulated my self. I was like this for maybe 20 minutes. While this was happening the clinic called 911 for a ambulance. While this was happening I could not talk, my words and my thoughts could not connect for lack of a better world. I was like THIS FOR 4 hours not being able to talk. After this my word get getting confused with other word and switching them around with other words.

                                                Started to feel like my breath was being taken away at times for a few days (started a few days prior to 1/2/2021. Also, I felt like my heart was racing and having heart palpitations. On 1/2/2021, I noticed a inflamed rash over the injection site. It was slightly warm to to the touch and slightly sore. The rash had a red line around it with red spot inside the circle. The rash was gone by the morning on 1/3/2021.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

                                                At about 0130 on 01/13/21, I woke up not feeling well (I had also not been sleeping well prior due to arm pain and minor aches). I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

                                                I had a racing pulse, my throat was really itchy and tighter than normal ,  my lips were numb, my tongue was tingling.  This happened during the observation period and then I was sent to the ED.  About a week later, on the left arm, looked like I had hives, it was swollen and warm to the touch, pain went down into my wrist. I went to Urgent Care.

                                                Painful arm until Sunday, then throat felt tight, thought it was acid reflux so I took some tums. The heart palpitations started shortly after. Worse when lying down and almost felt short of breath. The heart palpitations continued until Monday night and Tuesday I woke up and palpitations resolved. I have only ever had this reaction one other time when had the Mirena. Symptoms resolved after having it removed but wasn?t sure what ingredients caused it. Now I believe there may be a common ingredient.

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

                                                Itching all over the body started about 2 hours after receiving the vaccine ( around 11:30am). At noon, I noticed I was dizzy and weak, and I couldn&#39;t stand up without holding onto something. The itching got worse as the day went on and became intense and painful around 3pm. At that time, I noticed a rash on both arms, my legs and my chest, so I took 25mg of hydroxyzine (prescribed by my doctor) which has been helpful in the past for itching and rashes. Around 7pm, I had hives on my arms and legs, and the itching was getting worse and more painful. I also had intense itching on my face, especially on/around my nose. I took another 25mg of hydroxyzine but the itching wasn&#39;t subsiding and at that point, it was so bad that I couldn&#39;t focus on anything else. At 9pm, I still had hives and itching but also noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and it felt as though my throat was closing up. This continued throughout the night, with it being at its worst between 1-3am on March 12th. I woke up and the rash was gone, but the itchiness is still present and I&#39;m having trouble breathing. I keep choking and gasping for air.

                                                It was 7 mins after the shot, I started feeling my throat closing up, like a golf ball. they gave me an epi pen it helped a little bit but went to the ER. When the epi wore off I was having issues, I had it again 4-5 times. I had a hard time getting air in and out. I was admitted to the ICU for an Epi drip. The stayed over night and they winged me off the Epi and sent me home.  I was home for a couple days, and in my kitchen not doing anything I felt like my air way was closing, my husband gave me Epi pen and took me to the ER. They have more IM Epi  (3x) and steroids and Benadryl.  I had  a CT of my brain because I had the worst headache and it came back ok. I was there for 6-8 hours and it cleared up after 3 doses of Epi.  A week after I was eating in the Cafeteria, my throat started to itch and took the Epi pen and gave myself a dose and took Benadryl, it did not get better. I ended up really struggling to catch my breath, I went down to the ER and they gave me another Epi and started Epi drip- I went again to the ICU for the night, more Epi, steroids and Benadryl. By the morning I felt a lot better and went home.  I have seen my PCP and waiting to see my Allergist.  Randomly I have just been getting rashes, my face, cheeks and nose, patchy rashes that will come and go.

                                                I have asthma that is primarily seasonal or exercise- induced.  About 2 days after the vaccination,  I experienced asthma symptoms that lasted for about 5 days. This was not related to exercise, humidity,  or seasonal allergies- I woke up struggling to breathe on day 3 after the vaccine.  I had shortness of breath,  wheezing,  resulting lightheadedness, and some dry coughing. Symptoms were worst first thing in the morning and at night. I am still experiencing some lingering difficulty breathing 10 days out from the vaccine, but no wheezing.   It is very likely that I had COVID-19 in early February 2020, before testing was available in the here (My coworker returned from abroad very ill; another coworker and I became sick shortly after,  and she lost her sense of taste and smell. I experienced low grade fever,  intense nausea,  diarrhea,  shortness of breath,  and extreme fatigue.  The fatigue lasted for about one month.) Following this illness,  I saw a sharp increase in my asthma symptoms for about 6-7 months,  which gradually tapered off. Again, there was no other trigger for these symptoms such as exercise or humidity. It seems likely that I contracted COVID-19, which damaged my lungs in some way,  and that the vaccine has resulted in irritating or &#34;re-activating&#34; that damage at a lesser intensity.

She did not premedicate for covid vaccine. Approximately 20 minutes after her vaccination, she was observed in the post vaccine waiting area and  stated that she was a bit dizzy and tickling in her throat.  In addition, she had an itchy rash on her left forearm, the side in which her vaccine was given. She was escorted to the nearest exam room.  There, she began to have nearly non-stop coughing to the point of gagging.  She was given epi 0.3mg im with some improvement of symptoms. Continuous monitoring showed oxygen sats in the upper 90s, BP was in the 150s systolically. She was given 50 mg of Benadryl orally.  At that point, patient was taken to the procedure room via wheelchair.  After approximately 30 minutes, the ticking sensation in the throat returned and patient was having more difficulty breathing.  Another epi 0.3mg im  was given, along with pecid 40 mg po.  125 mg of Solumedrol was given IV, with saline lock left in place.  After 20 minutes, patient again was having difficulty.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

I was told that my lips and cheeks were swollen and that my eyes were red. I was first given benadryl (25 mg) and prednisone (20 mg). I was later given epinephrine ( 0.3 mg/0.3mL injection). I was then taken to the emergency room where they prescribed the above medications to be taken for 3 days (minus the epinephrine).

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

                                                1-2 minutes after the vaccine, I got  very hot then my chest got very heavy. I never struggled to breathe, but it was harder to breathe. My pulse and blood pressure went up. I got dizzy and lightheaded. Maybe 5-7 minutes after the onset, it started to get better on its own. No medicine was given. The paramedic did an ekg which was normal. My blood pressure and pulse also went back to normal.  My oxygen level was normal. Later that evening and the following day, the only noticeable difference was extreme fatigue and a headache. I was dizzy and lightheaded for a few hours after.

                                                About 30-40 min after getting shot my breathing felt weird. It felt like I was breathing in hot scratchy air through my nose and throat.  I felt like my breathing was abnormal and it felt like I was possibly going to start wheezing. I became worried I was having an airway reaction and would need to go to the hospital but I did not end up needing to. The breathing issue did seem to resolve after 15-20 min even though my throat remained scratchy feeling that day. I have had panic attacks before and extreme anxiety and have never experienced any sort of airway reaction before. I am concerned I had a mild allergic reaction and am worried about getting the next shot. I did have Zyrtec in my system so I don?t know if that ha d any affect or not.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  SHORTNESS OF BREATH (CHEST PAIN, sob , BACK PAIN STARTING TODAY AT 0900, STATES ADVIL AT 1000, SSENCOND COVID VACCINE YESTERDAY AT 1500) 32-year-old female with past medical history of anxiety, asthma, Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, psoriasis who presents the emergency department with chief complaint of body aches and shortness of breath.  Patient is a nurse.  She received her 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the day prior to arriving in the emergency department.  This morning she did feel some mild body aches but otherwise was feeling fine.  Starting later today after her shift at work she developed severe body aches bilateral upper shoulders and down her spine, she also reports some shortness of breath, dizziness.  She felt unsafe to drive home feeling like this.  She had taken some Advil earlier in the day around 10:00.  She denies any fever, nausea or vomiting.  No history of severe vaccine reaction or anaphylaxis.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to Enbrel prior.  She denies any throat swelling, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain.    patient is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive.  Likely due to pain.  Patient is experiencing adverse reaction to the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed with her she is having an immune response to the vaccine.  She does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis which could contribute to the elevated immune response as well.  The patient is given 30 mg of IM Toradol for body aches here in the emergency department.  She is instructed to call PCP for close follow-up, rest, drink plenty of fluids.  She has no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis at this point.

I had a headache. A couple hours after vaccine I was told I was exposed to COVID. Got tested on 31st - I tested positive for COVID. Got shortness of breath, the bad muscle ache, the loss of smell and taste; coughing, sore throat, headache; fever. I still have headaches and I still have some congestion sometimes. It is getting better but my sense of smell and taste aren&#39;t back. Fever, shortness of breath, cough etc lasted 10 days. I was out of work for two weeks. Called the doctor  (January 4th, 2021)- for Oxygen levels - were dropping - they were in the high 80&#39;s - the doctor let me stay home and monitor on my own as I have a nebulizer and inhaler at home.

I ended up going to the emergency room and getting there by 3am. They immediately started running tests. My heart rate was in the 138 and my blood pressure was 148/100

After about 20 minutes, I couldn&#39;t feel the left side of my face and the left side of my body was like with you go to the dentist and have lidocaine.  The next day I felt like I had been hit by a mack truck. I felt like that until about January 6, 2021. I also had SOB, joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue and body aches, sore arm and redness at the injection site.

                                                Received the vaccine intramuscularly in right arm at 1:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and muscle soreness began approx. 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Fatigue and headache present by 3:00 PM on 3/3/21. Began hydrating with water and Gatorade at this time. Muscle pain and join soreness present from right shoulder to right hand by 4:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and stiffness in fingers of right hand by 5:00 PM on 3/3/21. Mild congestion, brain fog by 6:00 PM on 3/3/21. Any contact between right arm and other objects or surfaces caused significant pain by 8:00 PM on 3/3/21. Took 800 mg ibuprofin to alleviate pain (pre-existing tolerance to NSAIDs necessitates higher than normal dosages). Swelling of the right arm and hand identified by 9:00 PM on 3/3/21. Swelling was most significant in the hand, and accompanied worsening joint pain and stiffness in the fingers. Applied a cold pack to address swelling (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off). Could not identify these specific side effects in the information available online, took a Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Swelling decreased overnight and was gone by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21. Diarrhea began at 6:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Will continue to hydrate with water and Gatorade. At the time of this report, pain in right arm still present from shoulder to wrist and entire arm is tender to the touch, but pain level has lessened. Pain and stiffness in right side of neck present by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Lymph nodes in right underarm swollen by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and swelling is still present at the time of this report. Will continue with regimen of ibuprofin as needed.  * I am recovering fine at home, but I wanted to log these side effects for data collection purposes. I couldn&#39;t find any information about these side effects online and that really freaked me out, so I hope that writing this report will help people in a similar situation.

By that evening (unsure of time), started with my usual asthma flare-up symptoms. These include, soreness of breath, chest tightness and pain, wheezing. I started treatment at home with q4h DuoNeb breathing treatments and a decreasing prednisone prescription.  This treatment did not work so I followed up with my pulmonologist and his PA-C for a follow-up. They made the decision that this flare up was caused &#34;by my immune response to the covid vaccine.&#34;

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

                                                I have a history of prior anaphylaxis in 2009 when I received (separate arms, same date and time) the 2009 seasonal flu vaccine and the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Both were from multi-dose vials and providers I established care with following the reaction believed I likely had a reaction to a preservative. I?ve received single-dose flu vaccines with no issues since then. When I received the Moderna covid vaccine on 1/8/21 I had some right-sided throat swelling about 15 minutes after injection. It did not worsen and I was monitored for 1 hour after shot time. I went home and the feeling in my throat resolved after about 4-5 hours with no medication or intervention needed. I did not have any other symptoms until 3pm on 1/9/21. Started with mild abdominal pain, an hour and a half later I had chills, headache, fatigue and fever around 100.8F. No medication taken. The fever resolved within about 6-7 hours. On Sunday 1/10/21 the abdominal pain worsened and was a constant pain around umbilical region that felt as if it radiated outward, LLQ slightly worse. It was severe, directly affected normal daily functions. I could not walk, move, eat or drink room-temp water without pain increasing.  Walking 20ft at one point even caused me to crumble to the floor and cry, had to stay there for 5 minutes before even attempting to get back to the couch. No diarrhea, no vomiting, no fever, no nausea. I did have loss of appetite. The pain continued through the night and was constant. I could not find a comfortable position to lay in and tossed and turned most of the night. At 0430 on 1/11/21 I got up out of bed to pee, abdominal pain was so bad it kept me awake for about an hour after. Pain finally started to improve and I was able to sleep from 0530-0930. When I woke up on 1/11/21 around 0930 my abdominal pain was very mild and continued to improve as the day went on. Currently (1600 on 1/11/21) my abdomen feels about 90% better, I have no other symptoms. The symptoms, specifically the fever and abdominal pain, caused me to miss 2 days of work (Sunday 1/10/21 and Monday 1/11/21).

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

Heart rate would increase to 120-130 with simple activities like cooking dinner or taking a shower. This was sometimes prolonged with standing and associated with shortness of breath.  The night sweats continued for the next 6 weeks until time of submission. The lymphadenopathy was also noted L axilla and R supraclavicular and has also persisted. 2nd covid moderna vaccine received 1/30/21 with only mild headache.

                                                At 1:17 PM, I received the vaccine. Around 1:30 PM I started itching and breaking out in hives. I did not say anything because I thought it was my eczema reacting to my nerves. I went home and felt fine for a while. Around 5:30 PM I told my husband my stomach hurt and I had a slight headache, and I was going to lie down. Around 8:30 PM I woke up. Around 11 PM I was feeling kind of light-headed but did not say anything to my husband because I just thought it was my thoughts. I went to bed. Around 3:45 AM I woke up feeling sick, went to bathroom in master bedroom and dry heaved. I returned to the bed from our bathroom, and told my husband I thought I was going to pass out. I have no recollection of the following events, this is information my husband (Brian) shared with me. He said I then stayed standing on the floor, laid my head over on my pillow, and started breathing heavily, and it became progressively heavier to where he stated I sounded like a &#34;wart hog.&#34; He said he jokingly said to me, &#34;Are you mutating,&#34; then I collapsed onto our bedroom floor. He said he got up immediately, was saying my name as he was walking to me, and I was not responding. He then got on the floor by me, and was rubbing me and trying to wake me, and it took about a minute before I came to. When I came to I was laying on our floor, keep in mind I feel approximately 5 feet as our bed sits 4 to 4.5 feet in the air, and I am 5&#39;8&#34;. I hit my hit on our floor, and when I came to I could barely hear him calling my name as there was a loud rushing noise like water in my head. It took about 2-3 minutes before the ringing was completely gone. I then had cold chills off and on for the next 24 hours with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. On Tuesday following the initial encounter, I went to the ER due to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe headache on right side of head.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

She was sent to Cardiology and they diagnosed her with pericarditis and she was started on scheduled NSAIDS. - Cardiology recommended ESR, CRP and CBC and they were negative. - CXR was normal - Echocardiogram was suggestive of pericarditis. Cardiology told her to follow up in 1 month is symptoms did not improve and they have not. Also she stated she has developed mild, intermittent peripheral edema that resolves without intervention but this is new.  I am also ordering the cardiac MRI which the cardiologist recommended if symptoms did not improve with NSAIDs.

                                                2.5 hours after receiving 2nd vaccine I developed left lower facial numbness. And additional 30-45 minutes after that I began having throat swelling/tightness and chest tightness. I went to the ER and was found to have and elevated heart rate and blood pressure. I had taken Benadryl prior to going to the ER and was given IV prednisone and Pepcid there. After a 2 hour observation my symptoms had subsided and I was released. The next morning I began having chest tightness again. My PCP called in a script for prednisone and advised me to also take Benadryl and Motrin as needed.  I am still have intermittent facial/neck numbness, anterior and posterior neck pain; as well as intermittent headaches and axillary pain.

Gave patient diphenhydramine 25mg capsule and bottle of water. Called nurse to check pulse and blood pressure, both normal. About 5 minutes later she said the sensation felt worse. Gave her diphenhydramine 25mg liquid dose. Nurse called for Emergency Services prepared to administer Epi-pen if needed (was not used).  Patient felt she may  be getting short of breath. EMS showed up at that time and took over. They checked patients throat and she said she thought the shortness of breath was getting worse so they decided to transport her to the ER.

Then the nurse took me off for my next vaccine and said I had to be cleared by an allergist. Four days later at midnight I was at work and my heart rate was 140-150 and was very SOB and chest tightness,lightheaded and numbness/tingling of the mouth and had to be wheeled down by wheelchair to the ER. Then they drew my labs and potassium was 2.9. I have been in the ER three times since the vaccine. Since I have had the vaccine my blood pressure goes up very high for me 168/105,170/100,186/96,163,103 and I get chest tightness,SOB and lightheaded on and off also very dry mouth at times still. Heart starts racing out of now where and my normal heart rate is 60-80 and I have been very tachy since the vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine around noon on Thursday, March 4, and by Friday night started experiencing postnasal drip/sore throat. My arm was sore from Thursday night - Saturday morning, and I kept it moving to help with the soreness. By Sunday night I had developed a cough and nasal/chest congestion and have had cold symptoms throughout the week (but feeling slightly better each day). My sore throat disappeared by Tuesday. No fever, loss of taste/smell, or shortness of breath. I?ve been taking Sudafed and Mucinex daily, and NyQuil and Afrin at night. On Wednesday, March 10 I went to receive a rapid test for COVID-19 and tested negative, and was told to continue using OTC medications to treat my symptoms, but to take antibiotics if symptoms worsened over the next 3 days. As of Friday, March 12, I?m feeling much better with less cough and congestion but still fatigued and do not plan on using the antibiotics.

                                                1/23/2021 - The first Moderna vaccine. I had flu like symptoms, which included fatigue, muscles aches, muscle spasms, joint aches, chills, and shortness of breath for 2-3 days afterward.  2/20/2021 - The second Moderna vaccine. The side effects were much worse, including muscle aches, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, chills,  fatigue, and shortness of breath. I also found myself limping. 2/21, 2/22, 2/23 - I rested and stayed home from work. Most of my symptoms had improved by the evening of the 23rd, and I felt like the shortness of breath was also improving if I took it easy.  2/24 - I went to work where the shortness of breath became much worse after working for a couple of hours. I began to get dizzy, and my hands and feet were cold and tingling. The school nurse checked my temperature (which was normal) and oxygen levels (99%). I was sent home and told to take another day or two off.  I was fine if I was sitting still and doing nothing, but talking caused me to become winded. Walking and exertion of any kind caused me to become winded. Once winded, it would take 15 minutes of sitting still to get my breathing back under control. Then I would be hit by a wave of fatigue. Also, when my breathing was bad, I walked with a limp. 2/25 - I went to  the shortness of breath was still bad. They were concerned. They took a chest x-ray (which came back clear), did blood work (which was normal), and gave me a Rapid Covid test (which was negative). My oxygen levels were at 99%. They prescribed a 6 day pack of MethylPREDNISolon. If I was not better by Saturday, they wanted me to return. They also did a PCR test (this came back negative on 2/28).  2/26 - The steroid did not help, and by the evening, I was worse.  I went to the ER . The doctors there were concerned about a pulmonary embolism. They did blood work (which was normal), a chest x-ray (which came back clear), and an EKG (which was normal). My vitals were good, though my blood pressure was high for me (113/64). The doctor told me to continue the steroid pack and prescribed an albuterol inhaler. I was directed to contact a pulmonary specialist on 3/1 if symptoms did not improve. The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/5. 3/1 - The shortness of breath did not improve. I almost passed out while driving after I picked up my two small children from school. I could not catch my breath in the car and started to get lightheaded. When I parked, I stayed in the car huffing and puffing for several minutes. I was seeing spot, was dizzy, and my hands and feet were tingling. When I climbed out of the car, my legs buckled beneath me. I was able to grab onto the car and not fall. I had some really bad breathing episodes between 3/1-and 3/3. At these times, the breathing was so rough, that I couldn?t even talk. It would take 30 minutes or more of sitting still for me to be able to bring my breathing under control. 3/3 - Appointment with Pulmonary Specialist. I had an appointment  He ruled out asthma, as the inhaler and steroid were both ineffective. He considered anxiety, but the problem was clearly not a panic or anxiety attack. (I have experienced those before and know the difference.) He ruled that out. He ran a pulmonary function test (which was normal) and a CT scan with contrast (which was normal). The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/10.  3/4 and on - My breathing was better some days than others. The less energy I exerted, the better I did. If I did too much one day, my breathing would be worse the next day.  3/7 - Ajovy injection. I was past due for this monthly injection. Once injected, I had an allergic reaction to it for the first time ever (this was the 7th time I used it). A few minutes after the injection, the injection area had a rash and was itching like crazy. I put ice on it and took benadryl. It was fine by the next morning.  3/9 - Appointment #2 with Pulmonary Specialist. The specialist was not sure what the problem was with my breathing. I was the first patient with these vaccine side effects that he had seen. He scheduled more tests and said he wanted to read more literature. He wrote a note for me to work from home through 4/6.

                                                On Sunday, January 3rd, I woke up to find a rash about 3 inches long, starting at the vaccination site. By Tuesday it had widened. I have photos of both Sunday and Tuesday?s rash, if you would like me to forward those to you. Wednesday night the rash had lightened in color, it was mostly just the outline, but had grown larger than my hand. It crept up towards my shoulder, underarm, and about half way down to my elbow.   Thursday morning (yesterday) I called medical provider to make a Virtual Visit at 5:30pm same day. APRN, called me at about 12:20pm and told me to go to the ER right away. My throat felt swollen and constricted at the time, though I was able to breathe, drink and eat. Swallowing was a bit difficult.  I was seen by PA, at the ER at MC. She evaluated me and said the reaction was bad, but not severe, and on the mend. She prescribed oral prednisone 20mg for the next five days. I did not need any steroid or Benadryl shots. She also said she feels comfortable with me getting the second COVID-19 vaccination, which is scheduled for 1/25.

                                                on Wed 1/6/21 I had an allergic reaction and am unsure what set it off.  My eyes became itchy, watery and my corneas swelled.  I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

                                                I received my vaccination at approximately 7pm on Friday January 15th. Upon receiving my vaccinations I felt light headed, but after fifteen minutes I was okay to stand up and leave the facility. At around 12:05am  I began coughing and body aches and it continued throughout the night. By morning my cough had subsided, and I felt okay. By 11:30 am on 16th my body and skin began to tingle all over and I felt a burning sensation under my skin. My head began pound and a feeling of nausea came over me. I started feeling very warm about 10 minutes later and decided to take off my sweater and found that I had a large red rash across my chest. My temperature began to rise and my tongue and face began to swell and a feeling of shortness of breath came over me. By 4:00 my fever hit 104.2 and my body began to stiffen up  and my jaw began to clench involuntarily In small bursts for a total of what my family believes to have been 5-10 minutes. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol my fever dropped to 103 for the next two hours and I began to shake uncontrollably, then it began to spike a again reaching 103.6. My spouse put cold towels on me and opened the windows to our bedroom to cool me down. Slowly my temperature started dropping and it finally reached 101 by 11pm. The next morning, Sunday, I woke with blisters on my mouth and severe body aches.

I took two Benadryl pills when I noticed the itching would not stop.

Heart rate jumped up to 179 BPM using a pulse oximeter to read and was breathing heavily. Was assisted to a wheelchair and spent a few minutes breathing in through my nose and out through my mouth and after a few minutes of this, my heart rate went back down and the symptoms subsided. As of today (1/27/2021) I am very exhausted.

I understand that these were expected with the second dose. However at 9:40am I began vomiting. By 11am my throat started to close so I went to the ER. I had a minor asthma attack while I was there (coughing fit and slight wheezing). I was evaluated and they gave me IV fluids as well as other medications through the IV. I received solu-medrol, Benadryl, antacid, and anti-nausea. They took blood tests, urinalysis, and chest x-ray, all of which were normal. I did not have a rash around the injection site this time. I was discharged at about 3:10pm

She has fully recovered and denies any other symptoms at this time, but was instructed by her MD to contact the facility that administered her MODERNA covid vaccine.

Also reported neck pain, chest/throat tightness, slightly itchy throat, clogged ears, and a cold feeling. I took her BP and it was elevated at 156/94. I monitored patient over the next 30-35 minutes and she asked for water and crackers. She was not having any difficulty breathing, did not complain of throat closing so epi pen was NOT administered. She slowly improved over those 30-35 minutes. She declined me calling 911. She left with her boyfriend approx 45 minutes after onset of symptoms. I called her at approx 7pm the same night and she reported feeling &#34;fine&#34;.

                                                The patient received the Moderna vaccine on January 21, 2021. She waited at the pharmacy for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine to be sure she would be okay.  She felt fine after 15 minutes and so left the store.  As she was walking to her car in the parking lot, she started to feel &#34;weird&#34; as if something was very wrong but she could not figure out why she felt this way.  She got in her car and drove back to work.  The feeling that something was very wrong worsened during the drive and she started itching on her arms and legs approximately 25 minutes after receipt of the vaccination.  She did not have a rash or hives but the itching became very intense and spread to her entire body within a few minutes.  She started to feel that her throat was tight or swollen but thought perhaps it was due to something else.  However, within another 15 minutes she was having difficulty swallowing and her voice changed as she was talking to patients (hoarse).  The throat symptoms continued for 30 to 45 minutes and were quite uncomfortable but she did not seek medical attention.  They started to resolve after 30 to 45 minutes.  However, her intense itching continued for several hours.  She took Benadryl but it did not help.  All her symptoms resolved after several hours and she slept well.  The following day, within 24 hours, she felt her throat swelling again.  This lasted for a few hours but she did not seek medical care because she could breathe.  She developed a temperature of 100.8 degrees Farenheit which resolved after 4 hours but then the intense itching started again and continued into the next day.   She saw her PCP (third day after receiving the Moderna vaccination) and received a steroid shot and started taking Claritin 10mg daily and Pepcid 20mg twice daily which helped some but did not relieve the itching.  The itching worsened again on January 26th, 2021 and she was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg which helps but makes her extremely sleepy.  She continues to have varying degrees of itching off and on since then.

                                                After the fever of 40C, chills, tiredness, nausea, headache. Started to feel pain on the left side of my face. Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

                                                I am the patient. I do not have the lot number. I received it and was fine initially. I felt a little euphoric in my head. Light headed I guess you could say. After about 10 mins of that I felt a little sensation in my legs. It did not last long. I thought maybe just nerves. After about 15-20 minutes I walked outside to maybe leave. I started feeling a little Soreness (none painful or severe) in my throat. I looked in the mirror and saw two small red patches in the very back of the throat. I looked at my phone to text who followed me and looked back in the mirror to see they had no connected that quickly. With in 10 seconds. I walked back in and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl. I could still breath and had a good air way. My throat a little tight. I remember feeling this euphoric feeling in my head. After about 15 mins of the Benadryl I was getting bettter. I hung around for a little while and left. I know it was a allergy but honestly considered going back for the second dose of that is how it could be handled again. I felt some small dull none painful sharp pains if that makes sense in my sides and stomach that didn?t not linger. Over all it wasn?t so bad. This is my first day however and if more arises I?ll be sure to let you know. I did experience a very sore arm tonight. To even lift it hurt. Worse than other vaccines. I have never had any reactions to other vaccines.

The patient&#39;s medical history included anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 09 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) intramuscularly in her arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 09 Jan 2021 at 13:30, immediately after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient reported having a flushing sensation and felt anxious. At 13:36 the patient&#39;s vital signs included blood pressure 131/87 mmHg, heart rate 99 beats/min, and oxygen saturation 99%. Doctor noted hives around the injection site and on contralateral arm and chest. Patient was moved to a separate room to lie down on a bed; on route to the new room, the patient developed diarrhea. Treatment included diphenhydramine.   At 13:49, the patient reported having shortness of breath and throat tightness. 99%. Intramuscular epinephrine was given and 911 called. The patient&#39;s vital signs included heart rate 133 beats/min and oxygen saturation  At 13:55, the patient&#39;s vital signs included blood pressure 145/76 mmHg, heart rate 137 beats/min, and oxygen saturation 99%  At 14:00, emergency medical services arrived, and patient was transferred to hospital. Patient left the office in stable condition with vital signs within expected range and fully conscious.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, flushing feeling, felt anxiety, blood pressure fluctuation, hives around injection site and contralateral arm and chest, diarrhea, shortness of breath, throat tightness and heart rate abnormal, were considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 34-year-old, female patient who experienced serious events of shortness of breath, throat tightness and heart rate increased and non-serious events of flushing feeling, felt anxiety, blood pressure fluctuation, hives around injection site and contralateral arm and chest and diarrhea. The events occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of mRNA 1273 (Lot # 026L20A, expiration date unknown). Treatment administered include diphenhydramine and epinephrine. Outcome is resolved. Based on the information provided, which indicates a strong temporal association of the reported events with the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded. The event of hives around injection site is consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA 1273 vaccine

Pain increased over the course of the next 1.5 days until I found it was necessary to go to the hospital.  Trouble taking deep breaths and moving around was painful. Wheezing and crackling in lungs would occur if exposed to cold. Increased temp  occurred on day 4 (99.8). Currently am on day 8 and am mostly back to normal with occasionally chest pains/wheezing. I believe pleurisy was the final diagnosis.

However, at the time, she did not say anything and went home after 30 minutes of observation. After the vaccine, her arm was first sore and a couple of days later, the soreness turned into an itching. The itch is local around injection site on left arm. Potential allergic reaction, lasting for days post injection.

                                                About 15 minutes later - body felt like it was on fire; shortness of breath; heart rate was pounding very fast. I stayed in an observation room for about 3 hours. Next day, I couldn&#39;t feel my right arm. I started getting fever, chills. I had all symptoms of the coronavirus. Saturday at 03:00 am - I woke up and I couldn&#39;t feel my arm or my fingers on my right side. I called the Emergency number. I stayed home and took Tylenol. Couldn&#39;t feel my arm at all that Saturday - dead. Sunday - same thing. Monday morning, I woke up, I could feel a little bit of my fingers but I noticed that I had blisters full of blood between your index finger and your thumb. I didn&#39;t go to work that day. The doctor wrote me out of work for the rest of the week. I didn&#39;t have any sensation on my pinkie or ring finger. I had a little bit of sensation on the rest of my fingers. I stayed at home and I didn&#39;t do anything with my arm and it slowly started getting better. That whole week I was having symptoms that were just like coronavirus. They came and went. the following Saturday, I started being able to move my arm around and doing more stuff and slowly it came back but I&#39;m not 100%. I can&#39;t lay on the right hand side too long - it starts feeling like my arm is asleep. I got the second dose February 12th.  I spoke to an allergy doctor and an anesthesiology doctor (video and telephone visits) - they told me I was having common side affects that people were having from the vaccine but they didn&#39;t know why.

Squeezing sensation self-resolved after call. Paramedics arrived about 1 hr post-vaccination. BP 89/66. (Note my normal BP runs 90-110s/50s-70s.) HR 70s-90s. Pulse Ox high 90s. Paramedics not concerned that reaction was allergic, no rescue meds advised. I felt well enough to drive home despite persisting facial tingling and tight breathing. Allegra and albuterol taken upon arrival home, resolved breathing but not facial tingling. Facial tingling better but not resolved after about 24 hrs.

Pt stated in was administered in the L arm, but ALERT IIS stated R arm.) After the second dose, she reported immediate nausea, milder than after the first vaccine, and then  &#34;breathing trouble&#34;--a &#34;squeezing heart&#34; sensation that began about 10 minutes after vaccination and lasted for close to one hour. She also immediately began to have pain in her Left arm (the 2nd vaccine dose was administered in her Right arm). This pain has continued to grow and intensify; she called in on 2/24/21 and on 2/25/21 reported that it is even worse. She is planning to go to an urgent care but finds it difficult as she has 5 children at home.

                                                Pt has history of anaphylactic allergic reaction (not to vaccine or contraindicated material), made aware of risk (was told she would have to stay 30 minutes) and decided to be vaccinated. Approximately 20-25 minutes after her vaccination, she mentioned to the living facility manager that she wasn&#39;t feeling well. I checked her blood pressure (142/111) and pulse (82) at 8:27am. She said that was elevated for her and she felt as though she was having difficulty breathing. I had the living facility staff member call 911. At 8:29, I proceeded to help the patient self inject in her right upper leg with a generic epipen (this was her preference since she has used before) - I added with counting to 10. I then gave her 50mg diphenhydramine IM in her left upper arm (Moderna injection was in right upper arm). Within 1-2 minutes, she said that she could tell the epipen was working and helping her to breathe more easily. At 8:34am, I took her blood pressure (148/111) and pulse (90). By 8:38am, she said she was starting to struggle to breath again. Per the pharmacy emergencey protocol, epipen can be given again in 10-20 minutes. At 10 minutes, since she still said her breathing was getting more difficult and the EMS had not arrived, she was given a second dose of a generic epipen in the left upper leg. EMS arrived 2-3 minutes later and was provided with all above information. Follow up phone call with doctor at the emergency department, said that she was monitored for an hour and then sent home. He advised that she not get the second Moderna shot or if determined necessary by her PCP to get it in a doctor&#39;s office setting.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

After 1.5 hours I felt very weightless and felt like I was going to pass out.  Then a wave of nausea came over me.  That went back and forth for about 20 minutes.  The following 2 days, I had those same rounds of nausea and thinking I&#39;m going to pass out.  My left arm got a large red, itchy and red bump and red streaks going up my arm.

                                                About 20 minutes after receiving vaccine, started to get a rash on chest and neck and began to have itchy feelings. After about 25 minutes, chest started to feel tight and breathing difficulty. Used Xopenex (Albuterol rescue inhaler, two puffs). 30 minutes after vaccine told nurse at vaccination clinic that I was getting itchier and asked for Benadryl. Received 50mg benadryl intramuscular shot in left arm approx 35 minutes after vaccine. Just a few minutes later throat started to feel tight and kept on coughing. They administered epi in left arm intramuscular. I believe they said it was 0.5 (maybe 5?). A few minutes after that the tightness started to improve and they had called EMS. While in ambulance, it started to get more itchy again, neck and chest and down arms. In ambulance they gave through IV some type of steroid and pepcid. No more medication was given at hospital, monitored for heart and breathing  for approx 2 hours. Discharged home with 5 days of prednisone and benadryl as needed.

                                                Had seizure symptoms at 2:30 am the following day.  Husband woke to our dog whining.  I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

                                                Within 5-10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I began to have tachycardia and tightness in my chest and throat- airway remained clear but resembled tightness with asthma exacerbation. Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

Through the morning noted the hives spread up my neck and angioedema noted to both sides of my neck, lymph nodes swelling on both sides and the injection site became more swollen and turned very hard to the touch.  No difficulty breathing at baseline, but it becamer difficult to take a full breath and chest tightness with exertion.  Benadryl 50 mg was taken 4-6 times a day for 3 days.  PA consulted, who stated to stay with Benadryl regimen, steroids not currently recommended, call 911 if symptom worsen.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after first covid vaccine I was nauseous, muscle cramps in whole right arm (the side I was given the shot), migraine, dizzy, trouble lifting arm, redness swelling and pain at injection site.  Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination. She also advised that I wait for 30 minutes in the observation area following the next dose.   It is Monday evening and as of now I have had no other adverse effects. I have had minimal arm pain and no other effects at all.

I couldn&#39;t swallow, couldn&#39;t feel my lips. I went back to where I received the vaccine and was given Benadryl. I waited 30 min and my throat closed again. I was given more Benadryl and I had to wait again. I eventually went home and slept the rest of the day. I woke up feeling like  I was hit by a bus. I was sweating with chills for two days.  I slowly got better. The muscle ache took longer to go away and I was eventually able to return to work on Monday. I was having problems with my throat. The allergy specialist had me doing breathing exercises and it eventually got better.

Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

                                                I began having mild, localized left axilla pain and anterior shoulder joint pain at 24 hours post injection.   Over the next 24 hours (ie 48 hours post injection) the symptoms progressed to severe sharp, stabbing pain radiating to the left lateral neck along the jaw line, left anterior shoulder, left chest wall and along the left ribcage approximately T2/3 down to T9/10.  Also experienced gnawing-type stomach pain with some nausea at this time.  At the height of symptoms (approx 36 hours post injection), pain level was 9/10 and described as knifelike, sharp, and stabbing.  It was exacerbated by movement, particularly cough, sneeze, and hiccup.  Relieving factors included heat to the ice, but mild relief.  Pain levels began to diminish between hours 48 and 72 post-injection. By 72 hours post injection the jaw and left neck pain had resolved.  The left anterior shoulder/axilla and chest wall pain persisted, but severity had reduced from 9/10 to 4-5/10.  At 96 hours post injection severity had diminished to 2/10 with pain only at the left chest wall approximately T4/5 down to T9/10.  I am now 3.5 days out from injection and have pain level of 1/10 to the left chest wall with hiccup, sneeze, cough, and deep breath.

I felt like I was going to pass out &amp; I felt very dizzy. I went to the Hospital the same day and they said that everything looked red inside my mouth and to follow up with my primary the next day. They gave me an IV. The dizziness continued for a few days &amp; then I got very shaky the next day it lasted for a week but the swelling came down the next day.

I was unable to lay down, sit, walk, or stand without being in extreme pain. I had difficulty breathing and was gasping for air. My asthma pump was not effective. Drinking water made it feel worst. Using the bathroom had no benefit. I called 911.  The Fire Department arrived first and administered oxygen, which was ineffective and the pain was increasing.  I was taken via ambulance to Hospital. When I arrived to the hospital; I submitted to a urine sample. I was given Saline in an IV in my right arm.  I was given 3 Tylenol tablets of 975mg. I did a series of blood work, Covid-19 testing, had an X-Ray of my chest, Ultrasound of my abdomen; CT scan of my chest, abdomen, and pelvis w/contrast, and an EKG was performed.  The outcome was a 3mm right middle lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule and negative for Covid-19.  The hospital gave me a pamphlet for shortness of breath and told me to follow up with my primary doctor.

My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

Including malaise, low grade fever..not higher than 99.6, mild sore throat, shortness of breath, dehydration/dry mouth, light-headedness/dizziness, runny nose, and coughing. These symptoms continued on and off from {12/31-and continued all throughout the weekend and continue as of today-01/04}. Fevers don&#39;t last long, they come and go. The main symptoms that are chronic and consistent are the runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath, and feeling tired/lethargic, just low energy.

I felt like my heart rate has been rapid all day and my rate of breathing has been slightly increased. The pain in my left arm, where I was given the injection is very sore to the point where it is difficult to lift or to touch. I was too weak to attempt to go to follow up with medical professionals today and opted to wait to see if symptoms resolved.

It lasted for about 30 minutes. The symptoms subsided while sitting back in a chair and drinking 2.5 bottles of water. I was able to walk out and proceed with grocery shopping slowly. Have taken it easy the rest of the day but able to be upright. Now just fatigue, muscle aches, feeling cold, abnormal teeth and tongue sensation x 2 hrs). The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

I alerted the nurse and about another 3-5 minutes afterwards felt like a rising sensation up toward my ears. It almost felt like I was being filled with something but could still breathe. I start to have a fast heartbeat and felt like I was sweating. I received Benadryl (IM) and felt relief about 1-2 minutes. After about 7-10 minutes I felt like it was coming back and the feeling rising back to my ears. I received another dose of Benadryl. I went home and made sure I continued the Benadryl  for 24 hours. My throat appeared swollen from the outside of my neck when I woke up from a nap about 3-4 hours after receiving the vaccine shot. My chest did have a little redness like hives but not full blown. Just red and irritated. The next morning my voice was very hoarse for a day and a half.

                                                MODERATE PAIN (6/10) AT INJECTION SITE began within 30 minutes of vaccine administration. Ibuprofen provided no pain relief, taken once 4 hours post-vaccine administration, and again 8 hours after. 24 hours after initial injection given, at work (I am a medical student rotating in neurology at the clinical site where the vaccine was administered), I felt severe pain at injection site (10/10), radiating toward my left shoulder blade. The pain was so severe, I could not continue my work. I applied an ice pack to my arm and took Ibuprofen, sat on the floor in the dark to wait for relief. I felt my heart racing, hyperventilating (likely due to pain), became diaphoretic, and experienced photophobia as well as tremulous shaking. After approximately 30 minutes, a supervisor found me and alerted emergency med techs on staff, who measured vitals and rushed me to the Emergency Department of our hospital. The pain began to subside to 5/10 after an hour in the ED, where I was treated with intravenous fluid (NS), diphenhydramine PO, and metoclopramide PO. I was stabilized, pain under control (3/10), and released approximately 3 hours after admission, at 3:15 PM.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

                                                Beginning the night of the 27th, I had a headache and a low-grade fever. I woke up in the middle of the night with a 102.7 fever, severe migraine, severe body aches, leg cramps, sore throat/swelling, and chills. I alternated taking ibuprofen and tylenol to try to control the pain, to no avail. I used bengay and cool washcloths for pain and to cool off. These did not help either. I made sure to keep drinking water and pedialyte. I took benadryl to try to sleep and help with my throat swelling up, it did not help.  All of this was non-stop until the morning of the 30th. That morning when I woke up my fever was going down and I no longer had the chills. I still had the severe headache, body pains, cramping, swollen/sore throat, and now diarrhea. Today is 2/1 and I am still experiencing severe body aches, severe headache, leg cramps, &#34;nerve pain&#34; type feeling in my arms, GI issues, and a sore/swollen throat.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

Pt had taken Benadryl 25 and prednisone prior to making room attendant RN aware. Upon auscultation, no wheezing noted. Pt blood pressure was 158/100, HR 128, o2 sat was 98%. Pt verbalized that her baseline HR was around 118 and that she had anxiety. Pt was diaphoretic upon exam and asked for a bottle of water. Pt&#39;s request was honored. Pt walked around the room to relieve her anxiety and said she felt better.   Her HR went down to 90 after walking around the room. Pt was offered IM diphenhydramine and refused. Pt also refused Ambulance to transfer her to ER. At 4:30 pm patient took another Benadryl PO without medical advice. Pt is a registered nurse and wanted to be transferred to ER, where she works, by another RN.  Pt left facility against medical advice and declined EMS at 4:40 pm. BP was 190/140 and HR 104 when she left facility to go to ER, transported in private vehicle by coworker who is an RN. Called ER to check on pt and physician said she had recovered and that she did not require any further medical attention, the event was believed to have been anxiety related.

I recovered very quickly, the illness lasted about 24 hours. Five days later (1/28) the same exact thing happened only worse, I experienced all symptoms listed above in addition to vomiting and extreme dizziness.  Again, my symptoms subsided pretty quickly but then 24 hours later I became achy, fatigued and developed a minor cough with shortness of breath.

                                                I got my 2nd shot around 10am.  My arm started to feel sore within 1-2 hours.  At 7pm I started to feel pain in upper left back area with breathing. At 9pm I was in bed and started to have chest tightness and pain with breathing. Both arms and hands started to go numb and tingling. I got to ER around midnight and all testing was negative.  I was hooked up to IV fluids which seemed to calm the chest pain and numbness. I got home around 3am and went to sleep.  By 7am I was having sore muscles and body aches. I was fatigued and having chills.  I was also running a low grade fever.   I continue on like this for 24 hours.  The next 24 hours I was fatigued.  By day 3 I felt like I was getting back to normal.

On 2/9 those symptoms subsided, but I started to get right-sided flank pain with pain on inhalation. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital. I was admitted to a different hospital on 2/12 and continue to antibiotic s and a heparin drip

I, became aware at about 1:15 there was some concern.  I spoke with patient she was having some trouble answering questions and appeared in moderate distress.  She reported to me having some SOB after her first dose.  Dr. had been contacted already.  At 1:19PM the patient appeared to have trouble catching her breath and reported SOB was worse than with first dose.  At this point I decided to administer 0.3mg of epinephrine as a precaution due to significant SOB.  Dr. came on the scene shortly after, the patient was monitored a bit longer, HR increased then decreased with oxygen.  The decision was made to contact EMS.

                                                After my vaccine the Aid didn?t have any chairs or places to wait so they suggested I go to my car and wait 10 min.  I went to my car and about 5 min after my shot I began to feel tingling in my cheeks like they were going numb  and weak and constriction in my throat.  Swallowing water took effort.  I was scared my throat was closing so I immediately went to urgent care.  They took my vitals and gave me Benadryl and steroids (medrol dose pack).  I went home and had flu symptoms (chills, fatigue etc, which was expected).  But the tightness in my throat didn?t release.  Could breathe through my nose but more difficult through my mouth.   My cheeks and face were numb making it difficult to chew food for at least  2 weeks and I had tightness in my throat as well during that time including difficulty swallowing due to weakness.

Symptoms progressed with eyes swelling shut, itchy throat, wheezing and on  3/14 her throat started closing and she could not breath.  She went to urgent care on  3/14 and was given oral steroids. Today she is feeling much better.

At 11:00 a.m. this morning she received her 1st dose of the COVID vaccine and began to feel her throat closing.  Immediately she received 1 dose of IM epinephrine.  Approximately 15 minutes after that she received a 2nd dose of epinephrine by IM.  EMS was activated and she was brought to the emergency room.  She was stable and received 50 mg of Benadryl by IV during transport.  She denies shortness of breath or nausea.  was rather concerning that her chest pressure began after the administration of the epinephrine.  She denies shortness of breath, nausea, or other concerning findings for anaphylaxis minus the throat swelling.  It is unclear whether this was truly anaphylaxis or other.  Upon arrival to the emergency room she was rather stable and a thorough workup was initiated.  With her reports of the chest pressure I felt that a cardiac workup was indicated with concerns that the epinephrine may have caused her a cardiac event.  Initial troponin was negative, and a 2 hour troponin was warranted as her symptoms were less than an hour prior to arrival to the emergency room.  The 2 hour troponin did show a delta of 16 and changing.  At this time I informed the patient of the results and recommended a 6 hour troponin.  She was understandable and willing to comply.  She did have a low potassium at 2.9 and received to 40 mEq doses of oral potassium replacement.  Her magnesium is 1.6, and a corrected magnesium was calculated at 1.78 with her albumin at 4.4.  The patient was stable and comfortable throughout the evaluation in the emergency room.  She did not exhibit hypotension, nausea, vomiting or other concerning findings for anaphylaxis.  She did receive Solu-Medrol, and Pepcid while in the emergency room.  I did consider administering Benadryl, but she did receive 50 mg of IV Benadryl in the ambulance on the way to the emergency room.  The 6 hour troponin was reassuring and unchanging.  The patient was then discharged home with follow-up precautions and instructions follow-up with a primary care provider.

                                                After the first dose on 2-23, I experienced a tickle in my throat within minutes. It was difficult to swallow but I did not have trouble breathing. My tongue and throat felt swollen. The nurse suggested I stay longer. I drank a bottle of water, which helped. I stayed 45 minutes until the symptoms seemed to start to go away. The nurse directed me to take Benadryl before the second shot. I took Benadryl and still experienced the symptoms above, but to a lesser extent. I looked at my throat and tongue in the mirror and saw what looks like a rash/pustules on the back of my throat and top of my tongue way in the back of my mouth. The symptoms are slowing going away (I received the second dose 7.5 hours ago), but I thought reporting them may help in some way. Thank you for making this vaccine available and thank you for all you?re doing to help keep others safe.

Client noticed an instant metallic taste in her mouth with tingling after injection but didn&#39;t really think to report it.  She was home at 4:10 and started to experience burning and swelling in her mouth and throat.  She took 25 mgs of Benadryl at home.  Symptoms did not improve and seemed to be getting worse so she called 911 and was transported to Medical Center for treatment.  Reproted getting more benadryl and epinephrine in her IV followed by a steroid.

                                                On 3/1/2021, received second dose at 3:15pm and at 3:45pm driving home from work I developed chest pains and went to urgent care. I got there by 5:30pm and they ran an EKG; results were normal. On 3/2/2021, I left work at 2:30pm feeling ill and when I got home by 3:30pm I had flu symptoms. Symptoms were body aches, headache, fever, chills, nausea. This lasted for 24 hours. When I woke up on 3/4/2021, I was just tired with chest pains. I went to work and on my way home at 3:45pm shortness of breath started with increased chest pains. I went to urgent care and they told me to head to the ER. I got to the ER by 6pm. They ran blood work, EKG and Chest X-ray; results all normal. I followed up with PCP. I was out of work from 3/5/2021 to 3/12/2021. PCP thought I might have COVID. Took PCP test on 3/9 and results were negative. I was able to return to work on 3/15/2020 but still had shortness of breath and chest pains as well as feeling exhausted all the time. Due to no change, PCP provided me with script for Echocardiogram, Exercise Stress Test, inhaler as needed and to see Pulmologist.  Waiting on insurance company to approve echocardiogram and pulmologist appointment is 3/29/2021. It has been challenging to complete daily living activities like washing dishes, showering, climbing 20 stairs to my apartment, laundry, walking to the postal mailbox, etc. I get easily tired and winded. Prior to 3/1, I was healthy and exercising 3x&#39;s a week, walking 4 miles and hiked with no issues for the past year ranging 3.5-7 miles with incline.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

                                                The vaccine was received at 1:12 PM, and I felt fairly fine, aside from injection site pain and some tingling in my left arm  until I had sudden significant elevation of heart rate, with shortness of breath, and throat swelling/tightening at approximately 1:26PM.  I cold compress was applied to my forehead and I was put in a reclining position &amp; then received Epinephrine at 1:28PM. EMS (present onsite) arrived for transport at 1:31PM. 4L of oxygen was applied after O2 sat of 89% noted by EMS. Blood pressure was elevated to &gt;200/100 initially by EMS. Symptoms improved quickly following epinephrine, with some residual feelings of very mild throat fullness, and I developed chills which improved over time.  I was transported to emergency department where I was evaluated (symptoms mostly resolved at that time, but ED physician noted a little swelling remaining in my uvula), then IV Benadryl and Decadron were given. Later acetaminophen was also given for headache that developed during my ED stay.  My vitals were monitored throughout and observation occurred until I was discharged at approximately 5:00PM, as symptoms had not recurred.

Very tired all week post vaccine,.  Day 5-6 noticed ipsilateral axillary lymph node swelling.  On day 7 post vaccine I got a localized area of itching swelling and redness as if I had been bitten by a few mosquitoes at injection site that was new. Milder on day 8, less itchy and swollen, but still red and a little raised.  Mild shortness of breath.

Left hospital feeling ok- on drive home began to feel flushed in my face, tingling in my lips and began to wheeze.  It felt like my peanut allergy but on a smaller scale.  I took my Albuterol inhaler and some Benadryl once I got home and felt better.  The next day I still have some itchiness and  fullness in my throat but nothing like yesterday.

Within one hour, pt had high fever, rigors, malaise and felt like throat was swelling.  Tmax 103.8.  She has had to take tylenol and benadryl around the clock since that time to combat these symptoms.  I saw her 4 days after vaccine administration and tested her for covid with NAAT.  This came back positive.  She had a test 3 days prior to vaccine administration at her work that was negative.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                About five minutes after the vaccine, my throat started to itch and a cough began. At 15 minutes I started to get hot, cough persisted, and a feeling of fatigue (I didn?t want to talk...very unusual). At 30 minutes the scratch in the throat turned to a lump, the cough was worse, and itching began on neck &amp; face. The doctor on site gave an oral Benadryl tablet but in two minutes symptoms were worsening and vomiting started. My chest was tight and sweat began. The doctor administered 50 mg benadryl shot &amp; a steroid. The lump was growing bigger, so they administered an epinephrine. Then I was sent to the ER. Upon arrival I received 25 mg of benadryl due to the whole body itching, but throat had relaxed. Also received IV fluids.

I slept for one hour and woke up with intense chills, muscle aches, and pins and needles all throughout my body. I developed a headache and became short of breath an hour later, and was unable to walk more than a few feet without becoming extremely fatigued. 15 hours later I&#39;m still experiencing the same symptoms.

                                                5 min post injection, shoulder pain. 23 hours post injection Fatigue, dizziness, lightheaded, shortness of breath, low blood pressure (85/53). Symptoms lasted 6 days post injection diminishing on day 5 to include only moderate fatigue. On day 7 post injection, the first phyical activity (skiing) immediatly resulted in heart pain (angina) and inability to take a deep breath. Assessment at the ER for a heart attack showed higher than normal range of troponin (.031)but a clear x-ray and EKG. Tests were repeated 4 hours after initial tests and troponin was within normal limits (.020). I was discharged with a 2/100 risk of heart attack in the next 30 days and a follow up stress test. I believe this was a direct result of the Covid-19 Maderna shot. I believe is reduced my hearts ability to work at a normal capacity and respond to physical activity.

                                                Temperature was 102 F; Lips turned blue; Wheezing; Heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm; A spontaneous report was received from a dentist, a 37-year old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm, wheezing, lips turned blue, and temperature was 102 F.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included monk fruit allergy and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications reported included hydrochlorothiazide.  On an unknown date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273.   On 28 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Jan 2021, following vaccination, the patient experienced an elevated heart rate of 105-112 beats per minute (bpm). The patient stated that 80 bpm was normal for her. At 7:30 pm, she began wheezing and her lips turned blue, both of which resolved within 2 hours. The patient took ibuprofen, naproxen, and diphenhydramine and sat in a warm tub for an hour and felt better after she covered up in bed.  On 29 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit (F) at midnight and 99 degrees F at 5:00 am.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, wheezing and lips turned blue, were considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm and temperature was 102, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 37-year-old, female patient, with medical history of high blood pressure and allergies to monk fruit, who experienced serious unexpected event of cyanosis, non-serious unexpected event of wheezing, heart rate increased, and non-serious expected event of pyrexia. The event of cyanosis, wheezing, heart rate increased occurred 1 day (same day) and fever occurred 2 days after mRNA-1273 (Lot# 030L20A). Treatment included Ibuprofen, Benadryl and Naprosyn. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

She was pretty much herself on morning of 2/13/2021 - got up, had shower.  caregivers noted her extremities were cool and face was red.  temp was 97.4.  She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.  CPR was continued until family could be reached and decision was made to stop resuscitation.

They had to administer an epi-pen. My throat did not feel better so I was transported by EMS to the hospital and was treated with IV Benadryl, steroids and Pepcid. I was prescribed Pepcid and Medrol 6 day dose pack to take home to prevent a delayed reaction.

By the third day I began feeling short of breath while talking.  The shortness of breath (SOB) lasted 3 days and was present for about half a day each. Then it all went away. On tuesday, Feb 16th, I began to feel SOB again but this time under my L breast I had pain. I tried to see if it was muscle (I am a PT) but could not tell. The next day the pain moved near where my sternum meets my ribs and then I worked on that and it has been there ever since. It feel heavy and I get chest discomfort on inhalation. I have seen primary care, they said to wait a few weeks and let them know if it is still there. I decided to report my symptoms now because I thought it would go away but it still has not and it does not seem normal to me. I did notice if I take an aleve it feels better but today that has not helped either. I hear that this vaccine can cause inflammation and so I am just wondering is this normal for what I am feeling?

She stated the following symptoms came on &#34;Like a wave&#34;: Dizziness, light headedness, ears ringing, sound pulsing, and her vision began to go black. She described the field of vision closing like that of a loony toons show ending (coming from the outside in).   Patient was found to have her eyes closed, hyperventilating at a rate of 28 breaths per minute. Ice pack placed on her neck. She was coached to slow her breathing, instructed to hold her breath for 10 seconds, then to release it slowly. She did this for 3 minutes. She related her body felt tingly all over. Encouraged patient to continue the slow breathing. As patient began to feel better, she related that she has a known needle phobia. She expressed that she becomes anxious even when she is not the one receiving a shot, and this fear stems from a traumatic experience of her son having a seizure after a shot. She works at a school and when they do first aid training and cover the diabetes section, the pictures of needles make her anxious. Patient provided with therapeutic communication, encouraged to discuss fears with her counselor. Patient remained seated in clinic until she felt well enough for her husband to drive her home.

                                                A few minutes after inoculation, the patient felt chest tightness.  She rested for a few minutes.  Her chest tightness did not ease.  She used her asthma inhaler to try to relieve the symptoms.  Immediately (but not necessarily because of the inhaler) her symptoms worsened.  I called over the attending EMTs, who put the patient on 02.  Soon after, a pulse oximeter showed the patient&#39;s 02 sat at 100, pulse at 110.The feeling of tightness continue but the oxygen immediately relieved the patient&#39;s distress.  After a few more minutes, the patient took another hit of albuterol.  That brought immediate relief.  Her pulse gradually slowed to the mid-70s.  She said she felt tired, as often she does after an asthma attack, but soon felt well enough to leave.  She planned to take an cab or equivalent to home, and said she had taken the day off.  She said her doctor warned her that because she has a history of reactions (details unknown) to vaccines, she might react badly to Moderna, but the doctor and patient agreed that it was worth the risk. She said her reaction to NSAIDs has been anaphylaxis.

Most of those symptoms lasted for 36 hours, however the headache and the chills remained. The following Tuesday (2/16) I starting having severe difficulty breathing and was gasping often. I tried my inhaler and that did nothing. This persisted. On 3pm Thurs (2/18) I started feeling dizzy and by 4:30pm I could not stand. Went to the doctor on Friday (2/19) with a fever of about 100, inability to walk without assistance. I&#39;ve also been having memory problems. I went to a balance center EMT on 3/10 for a repositioning procedure and I still Additional information for Item 18: feel dizzy, so there were no results to date.

                                                About 12 hours exactly after getting the 2nd dose I got extreme POTS flare up and a mild occular migraine.  I had a fever that kept going from the mid 99s to the 101s for 36 hrs.  Was freezing and burning and had lots of joint and body pain.  Most people I know had all of that, but the reason I?m reporting is the tachycardia.  My tachy has been fairly well controlled with meds and after my second dose it was so bad any time I sat up, I couldn?t breath, my tachy got so bad, my heart rate would jump from up to 70bpms, just sitting up.  My resting heart rate on meds has been 60-80, and for those 36 hours was 80-110.  Anytime I did anything my heart rate would jump to 130-150 and I could NOT BREATH.  My SpO2 was fine, so I know that the issue was my POTS flaring up and that it was the tachy.  I just want to report that it could cause issues with people with dysautonomia, so they don?t freak out if it happens.  My heart rate is still elevated, but is slowly going back down.

                                                I had an immediate reaction with dizziness, and tightness in throat within less than a minute of vaccine administration. That whole incident maybe lasted 10 seconds with throat tightness peaking at 6-7 seconds. I didn?t require epiPen or emergency care and the tightness went away 90% after 10 seconds with some minor difficulty swallowing for about additional 15 mins or so. I felt completely normal after 30 mins and have not had any other reactions since.

I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

                                                Patient was waiting 15 minutes post vaccination and began coughing. Staff noticed her coughing and asked how she was feeling. She described her throat at closing and difficulty breathing. She was vaccinated at roughly 9:40 am on 4/4/21 and at 9:46 am she reported these symptoms. The staff alerted the pharmacist on duty, and the patient was moved to a private area with a pharmacy technician as the translator. Pharmacy clerk was directed to call 911 at this time. She assessed patients symptom and patient said she had difficulty breathing and felt her throat closing and was coughing continuously. The patient had history of an allergic reaction to bee stings and had used epipens in the past. She felt that her symptoms were similar to what she had experienced in the past. It was determined to use the Epipen. The epipen was administered at roughly 9:50am. Patient was told to remain calm. The fire medic showed up at this point. The pharmacist then got a BP reading (205/193 and pulse of 95). The patient complained of feeling really cold and was visibly shaking. She did say that she was beginning to be able to breathe better. Her husband showed up about 2 minutes later. The paramedics arrived at about 9:55am and took a BP, pulse, and pulse ox reading. She was able to walk with assistance to a gurney and taken to the ambulance where she was transported to the Hospital.

                                                Shot given at 3:47- approximately 3-5 minutes later started to experience blurred vision, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.   Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                Just about 15 mins after recieving vaccination, I  experienced increased shortness of breath, feeling weak, slight headache, and my heart seemed to race.  When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

Friday = slept all day, very tired. Saturday night I went to ER because it hurt so bad: they gave me Lidocaine patches to help with pain but it didn&#39;t help. Monday, the 4th of January, saw my dr. - he was prescribed pain -Percocet 10/325 .That helped me so I could raise my arm finally. January 5th, I was still sick and woke up with a huge migraine; nauseous and fatigue/ I vomited once that night. Jan 6, I could work that day - but still fatigued, short of breath, but no fever at all, nauseous. January 7th - everything was gone (all symptoms resolved) and I felt fine.

                                                Approximately 10 hrs after the vaccine, I woke up very thirsty. When I went to get water, my brain and body felt disjointed. My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

I felt nauseous and out of it. I had shivers. My throat felt like it was swelling whenever I tried to take a drink or eat anything to feel better. I had to be monitored for over an hour and then driven home. I was too dizzy to walk.

                                                Towards the evening of the day of the vaccine, I got headache and body aches. Next day, it was like full blown Covid all over again - joint aches; fever - 101.6; sweats; body aches; rash around the injection site; headache; redness and warmness around injection site, too. I had extreme fatigue.I had a terrible cough. I didn&#39;t have a sore throat. I had a lot of shortness of breath. My shortness of breath and my cough was still lingering (from when I had COVID before the vaccine). Went to URGENT Care on Friday, 8th; They Took chest x-ray - COVID pneumonia -was what DR called - antibiotics  - took one course but didn&#39;t finish the second and prednisone - did finish the course of the asteroids. Next day they said the radiologist said it wasn&#39;t pneumonia.  I still felt pretty crappy the following week and then I was fine. I didn&#39;t work 11th or 12th but as the week went on I started feeling better. Symptoms have resolved. I had the second vaccine on February 2nd, 2021. It went better then first - but I had joint aches; fatigue; headache;chills on the day after and then they slowly tapered off the next two days and then I felt fine.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

The second day, I also had  body aches.  It&#39;s been about 3  weeks and I have some pain on my back and chest. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s related. l seemed to have it after the vaccine.  I also feel out of breath often.  I am now fearful of getting the second vaccine,  since the first one was so bad for me.

                                                I developed left arm site pain. I would say by the evening. Not  unbearable/ no meds for it. I woke up with trouble breathing 25th - used my inhaler 7 times that day. Increase in amount of post nasal drip and sinus congestion in my head. Which has previous triggered asthma attacks which has taken me to the hospital. I didn&#39;t have to go to Hospital. Was fatigued that day. Saturday, the 26th, I was feeling better. I was fatigued. I didn&#39;t have the extensive shortness of breath. 27th, I woke up with painful sinuses - I couldn&#39;t touch my face. Because there was a gap between that one day of symptoms - couldn&#39;t touch my maxillary - I did go get a COVID swab. They came back negative. I had to use my inhaler every day and continued with post nasal drip to the point I lost my voice for weeks. Which happens with post nasal drip because it irritates my throat. Nothing was taking care of it.I had a lot of thick phlegm. There is a lot of congestion in my sinuses which triggers my asthma. I did saline spray; allergy pills and there was such swelling in my sinuses -  nothing came out my nose - just went down my throat.  History of Atrial Flutter - I have been needed to shocked before but this was different. I had missed one of my meds that controls heart rate and not the rhythm - I went into the Atrial flutter - on January 19th - early morning. I took extra medication to chemically break it which it didn&#39;t do. it. After 8 hours, I didn&#39;t convert so I started Zyratol 20 mg daily - and I couldn&#39;t break and I continued to take an extra dose once a day of the Flecainide - I still didn&#39;t break. I stayed in it until the 23rd .  January 21st vaccine at 09:30 am.  I didn&#39;t go to the ER because I am use to trying to break it.  Talked to doctor on the Phone - around the 20th or 21st of January.

                                                Received vaccine Thursday afternoon. Waited for a half hour after receiving the vaccine, as there is a history of anaphylaxis. On the drive home lips began to swell and the lips felt numb. Patient went home and took some Benadryl which seemed to help.  Friday 3/5  Patient woke and her arm was swollen at the injection site and was very painful. Patient also complained of a headache at that time. Later that same day, Patient developed a rash at the injection site and intense itching all over her body including her face. Patient went to the Medical Center ER. At ER the staff evaluated her and administered IV steroids and Benadryl and sent her home with instructions to return in worsens. Saturday Patient complained that her throat began swelling and so she went back to the ER. The  ER gave more IV steroids and Benadryl, a breathing treatment (nebulizer), and gave 2 doses of epinephrine. Due to Patient&#39;s continued symptoms and gradual worsening condition the medical provider at ER felt  it necessary for Patient to be admitted, however, due to the smaller size and limited resources at ER it was decided for Patient to be transported to Hospital. Patient has remained admitted at Hospital since then, and yesterday (Sunday) she required another dose of epinephrine due to tongue swelling.  Patient reports that she is being given IV Benadryl and steroids, and she will not be discharged today. Today Patient is also reporting a burning sensation with urination.

Another 15 minutes or so later it had become hard to swallow, I was given another 25mg dose of Benadryl. After the second dose  it became hard to breathe, started coughing and chest started to hurt. I didn?t realize but had broke out in sweat. Nurse checked my eyes. Called paramedics and had epi pen ready. I thought a third dose of Benadryl had been administered but that I am not certain of. Blood pressure was higher than my usual but still considered normal (113/82 I think?) pulse was 120 something, at rest I am usually at 70. I became lightheaded. Paramedics did an ekg, it was normal. They monitored me while I stabilized. Was released when pulse was in the 80?s range. Residual chest pain after. 8 days after vaccination I broke out in sweat and became nauseous. Vomited. I then noticed below the vaccination injection (still bruised) and around where last dose of Benadryl was injected there was a large red welp, hot to the touch. The heat eventually went away but the welp remained a few days. 11 days after vaccination is when the cluster headache appeared. Shortness of breath was noticeable on day 12. Day 14 fever and nasal congestion with slight irritation in throat, occasional cough. Day 15 sore throat, coughing progressed (non productive) in to fits that led to vomiting. It is day 18 and shortness of breath is present at rest, chest pain, rash near injection site and bruise is still present. Temp has been low grade fever, hadn?t gone above 100. Normal is 96.9/97.1 for me. Oddly day 13 (the day before fever became present) my temp was lower than usual 95.6/95.7 yet I wasn?t cold.

I waited 15 minutes in the lobby, felt fine, and left.  While I was still driving, about 7:45am, I noticed that it had become difficult to swallow.  My throat felt swollen.   I decided to stay close to the hospital, and ended up driving to Pharmacy and taking 50 mg benedryl and 400 mg ibuprofen at 8:00am.  I called my primary care provider and left a message, and decided to go to work (started at 9am). I took another 50 mg of benedryl at noon.  My provider called me early in the afternoon, and was unable to give me advice.  He recommended contacting Hospital (vaccine clinic).  I experienced chills in the afternoon, and after I left work at 3pm, I took another 400 mg of ibuprofen, a hot shower, and slept for 3 hours.  I felt much better after the nap.  I reported all of this to the CDC yesterday afternoon through their &#34;check-in&#34; feature.&#34;

                                                On my 12th minute in the waiting area, I started having itchiness on my legs then it spread to my arms and face. I felt lightheaded and started having difficulty breathing. I approached the paramedic nearby. By then, the itchiness was all over my body from head to toe. They alerted 911 and monitored my vital signs. My 02 sat was 100% and BP was 140/90 mmHg. I asked if I can take Benadryl. They said wait for the ambulance. I declined to go to the hospital unless my symptoms get worse. I then took 25 mg of Benadryl. Shortness of breath and lightheaded ness was slightly relieved but the itchiness was still there. I waited for 30 more minutes in the waiting area. When the itchiness subsided a little bit, I went home. After 3 hours, the itchiness and SOB returned so I called my PCP and I was informed to take Benadryl q4 hrs until symptoms are resolved. As of today, 1/12/21 at 7:18pm, I still have itchiness but not as bad as yesterday.

She felt flushing throughout her entire body as well as some tingling. At 7:05 pm, her oxygen saturation was 97% and her blood pressure was 115/80.  She also had red, irregular-shaped  spots on her right, upper arm  (non-vaccinated arm) and upper back.  At 7:13 pm her oxygen saturation was 98% and her heart rate was 111. She then described the tightness when swallowing from earlier as if the muscles in her throat were numbed, which made it hard to swallow, but not hard to breathe. The tightness improved slightly during the 30 minutes that she was observed, but it did not go away. She felt comfortable leaving and knew which signs to look for that would indicate that she needed to seek medical attention.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

Feel better the next day, with daily prednisone and over-the-counter Claritin, Pepcid and Benadryl.

Upon returning to work in the pharmacy, she sat down at her desk and noted her HR to be 159 via her Apple watch. She felt slightly lightheaded, so returned to  Auditorium for monitoring. On arrival, she complained only of high HR, no other symptoms. We checked her VS: BP 140/78, HR 132, RR 20, SaO2 94. She denied chest pain or SOB. We monitored her for about 15 minutes, and her HR decreased to 103-110. We monitored her for another 15 minutes or so, at which time her HR spiked again to 132, and she felt heavy in her chest and tight in her throat. At that point, we moved her to a gurney and called a Rapid Response. We administered 50mg of Benadryl IM per protocol, foregoing the Epinephrine, due to her tachycardic state. The Rapid Response team arrived and she was transported to the ED for evaluation. She maintained consciousness and was A&amp;Ox3 the entire time.

                                                About 3 hours after the injection, I began to feel like my asthma was acting up and felt itchy on my face so took my inhaler and a zyrtec, which helped.  Then 8 days after the shot, I got a raised, firm, red, and extremely itchy circle around the injection site. I contacted my doctor who advised antihistamine. I took another zyrtec,  This lasted for about 48hrs and now (4 days after it began) it is still a bit itchy, but not visible anymore.

I was in the middle of treating a PT. Scratchy throat; mild cough; persistent moderate headache; runny nose; diarrhea; very pale. Never had a fever. I had weird neurological side affects (didn&#39;t lose taste or smell  ) issues with facial recognition - didn&#39;t recognize my own face and finding words for every day objects and making sentences was difficult . I was easily winded and had tightness in my lungs. I called Public Health office - and asked them what to do. She told me to go home. Dr  (telehealth visit) told me to take a test in the parking lot that day for COVID January 6. Treatment  - none. All o f my symptoms lasted until Friday January 8 except being winded and fatigued. Those last two symptoms lasted until January 19.  Verbal issues also lasted until the 19th of January. Facial recognition came back around January 12.  On January 27 I had second dose.

                                                40 minutes after injection my tongue and throat began to swell and then close.  I had no saliva and could not swallow without sipping on water.  I stopped at a clinic to be near a facility in case I could not breath anymore.  They watched me for a bit (though I did not fully &#34;check in&#34;.  The doctor suggested I get checked at an ER.  I went to ER and sat in the ER parking lot for two hours waiting to see if my symptoms got worse.  I did not want to use the ER unless I felt like I was in dire need.  After the couple of hours my symptoms weekend (but were still there).  I went to a friends place to not be alone in case the swelling increased again.  The next night I felt back to normal.  I have never had that reaction to anything, so I was a bit scared.

                                                Once vaccine was administered I felt short of breath but didn?t pay any mind. I thought it was my anxiety. About 6 I started to feel tired with a headache. About 8 pm my throat started to feel itchy. Next day I woke up with my chest feeling tight with a cough and phlegm. I thought it was just a side affect of vaccine and took my inhaler. On Saturday I woke up with a bad migraine and my chest still hurting. I knew something was wrong. I went to urgent care. I had ekg and X-ray and Covid test done. The ekg numbers came back low so dr requested a CT. My results came back as me having Covid in my left lung. Covid testing came back positive the next day. Prior to vaccine I did not feel sick or have any symptoms of being sick.

                                                Patient received her Covid-19 vaccination  and waited in the store for about 30 minutes.  She then approached me and stated she had mild SOB but was not sure if it was due to her anxiety about the vaccine or if it was a reaction.  She had no other complaints of dizziness, throat swelling, hives, sweating, etc.  She was able to speak without hesitation or difficulty, but I asked her to remain in the store a little longer to be monitored and not to drive home.  Her BP was 123/68 and HR was 66.  She decided to take a alprazolam tablet which she uses for her anxiety.  About 15 minutes later, she did not feel any improvement in breathing, but was still able to speak.  Her BP was 122/68 and HR was 70.  I decided to call paramedics to be safe and evaluate the patient.  The paramedics arrived in about 5 minutes and assessed her.  They stated all her vitals were stable and felt she did not need further intervention unless her symptoms worsened.    She was advised to follow up with her physician.

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!
