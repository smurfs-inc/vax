                                                I was given the shot around 1 pm and didn?t have any reaction throughout the day besides my arm becoming sore around the injection area. I later went to bed and woke up from my sleep at 12am, shaking uncontrollably (It?s like I had the chills but the shaking was much worse that I contemplated going to the emergency room ). I felt very cold, my heart was racing,&amp; I couldn?t catch my breath. The shaking lasted for about two hours. I finally fell back asleep and woke up again at 1am and woke up sweating, my whole body was hot and fighting off one of the worse fevers I had. Another hour passed as I tried to fall asleep and not soon after I was awoken from my sleep. At 3 am I woke up very nausea  and also had to use the restroom , it felt like everything wanted to come out both ways. During this time time on the toilet I felt exhausted, dizzy, &amp; my whole body was just aching. 2 hours later I finally fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning I still felt nauseous, had horrible body aches, &amp; had the chills. I genuinely hope this helps someone else who May experience the same symptoms!

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: OU520A/011520A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.     On 23 Dec 2020, within minutes of receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction and was rushed to the emergency room (ER). When transported to the ER she began to experience throat swelling, redness of arms and chest, trouble breathing with lower chest pain shooting into lungs, and numbness with tingling in her right arm. Treatment for the event included epinephrine, steroids, and diphenhydramine.  She was released from the ER on 23 Dec 2020.

                                                Within 1 hour of receiving the vaccine the patient developed asthma symptoms,dizziness, tingling in mouth and swollen tongue. She presented at a walk-in clinic and received Epi-Pen 0.3mg, Solu-Medrol and Benadryl, while there she received 2 additional doses and was transferred to the nearest ED by ambulance. At the ED  she received a 4th dose of Epi-Pen 0.3mg and albuterol and DuoNeb treatments. She was admitted for observation. She went home and needed to return within 24 hours to the ED because her lips and tongue started to swell and she turned blue. She subsequently needed 3 additional doses of Epi-Pen over the next 24-48 hours. She has been on Benadryl 50mg every 6 hours and Famodine 20mg until present.

                                                On Dec 28 - three hours after vaccine - started getting pain near injection site. It ached. 8:30PM that night I started getting itching from the midback to top of head on left side. Not left arm just the back, neck and face of left side. No rashes but a little red because I scratched. Then I noticed some bumps on my left side of my face and one hive on each knee and one hive on left shoulder. Telemed visit with dr. - took Benadryl - 25 mg. - within one hour of symptoms - at 9:00 pm per dr. Woke up next morning and had intense fatigue; muscles and back were really achy. Couldn&#39;t move my muscles very well. Felt like the wind had been knocked out of me. Bouts of itchiness. Slept throughout the day. That helped. But then had headache start - felt like a circle where my temples are to the back of my head and that is where is stayed. Next day - no fever and  but my symptoms improved except still had the symptoms but they had improved. Went to work on Wednesday because it started to go away - on and off headache - felt foggy. Bouts of itchiness and felt physically weak because my muscles had gotten so so tight. Felt a physical weakness for five more days. Headache went away by Wednesday night (Dec 30th). Itchiness went away. Three days symptoms went away although the physical weakness lingered until 5th  day. Used a heating pad for my muscles to help relax them.

                                                about ten minutes after the second dose, i got dizzy, felt like my heart was pounding out of my chest, hives around the injection site, and my tongue went numb. after the nurses checked my vitals, my blood pressure was elevated, i was tachycardic, so they administered oral Benadryl. after an hour of being closely monitored i was cleared to go. the next day, i was still really dizzy, nauseous, had body aches and bad headaches. that saturday, i went to the er at hospital for the same symptoms just worsening and now at this point my lymphnodes under my left armpit were very large. they proceeded to do blood work, gave me 2 liters of fluids, iv zofran and iv pepsid. the blood work had no signs of infection and was completely normal. the doctor then sent me home with zofran to help with the nausea and pepsid 2 times dailey to try to get the lymph node to come down. 1/27/21 i returned back to the er for chest pains and still dizzy, body aches, and headaches. all chest x-rays, blood work, and ekg were normal and they sent me home. still today 1/28/21 i am still very dixxy, have body aches, bad headaches, nauseous, have no appetite, short of breathe when walking short distances, and have swollen lymph nodes.

                                                About 2 to 3 minutes after receiving my injection, I began to feel a burning sensation in my nostrils. It felt like a 4/10 pain. The burning sensation worsened when breathing through my nose. When trying breathing techniques to calm down (breathing deeply through the nose, exhaling out the mouth), the burning sensation deepened towards the back of my throat - but I never felt it in my lower throat and chest - only the top of my throat and nose.  The nurse on staff took me to a corner for closer evaluation. She had me remove my mask and checked my body for hives. I had no hives and the burning sensation occurred even after my mask was removed. She asked if I had trouble breathing or itchiness, I had neither of those symptoms. My heart rate was high and I began to hyperventilate because I was having a panic attack. I had no other symptoms besides the panic attack symptoms (tight chest, tingly face and hands, rapid heart rate, and dizziness) and the burning nostrils.  The sensation lasted about 5-10 minutes, then dissipated. I then put my mask back on after it was requested. I continued to be monitored by the nurse for another 20 minutes until I gained back my normal breathing and my heart rate lowered. I was scheduled for a 2nd dose and was dismissed with no other treatment or issues. I drove myself back home and rested for the remainder of the day.  I had no other symptoms that day, other than the typical sore arm, fatigue, and mild chills, which resolved themselves in a couple days. I had no other complications.

My throat started to hurt really bad and I felt like I could not breathe I looked in my mouth and my tonsils were swelling  and I had to give myself an epi pen so I could breathe. Went home called my doctor and told him what happen I was very flushed, headache, sore throat cough, and I started to warm up several hours later to 100.9. He told me to take steroids I was given when I had COVID and told me if I start to have other symptoms to go to the emergency room. He also said since I recently had gotten COVID I was not suppose to get the second vaccine yet.

Was able to sleep off and on every time I turned over onto my vaccine arm I woke because of the pain. Next morning I spent the day in bed with lingering chills, muscle aches, headache, and spasms, but less than night before. High Fever persisted (101.4) and a cough with mild shortness of breath developed. The night of 2/28 I took ibuprofen (same dose as before) and Benadryl which allowed me to sleep all night. This morning (3/1) I feel better, with fatigue, lightheaded, a mild fever of  99.3, and minimal muscle aches. Cough persists.

                                                Around 6 pm I got a severe headache, very bad body aches, trouble breathing, and a very fast heart rate. I felt faint and had cold sweats so I went to ER after work. The ER doctor gave me fluids, a vial of tylenol through IV, and just observed me to make sure my heart rate and blood pressure came down. They said it sounded like a normal reaction. Fever of 101. I am getting a MRI of my brain on Tuesday 3/9/21 for continued severe headaches.

                                                Starting about 1 minute after vaccination I became extremely dizzy, blacked out/lost vision, had shortness of breath and a tight chest, lost feeling in my hand and fingers on my left side (the side I got the vaccine), was sweating but felt cold flowing through my body. These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

                                                The adverse event began as a feeling that there was an air bubble stuck in my throat. It then manifested into feeling like there was swelling in my throat. Eventually, there was external swelling on the left side of my throat. This lasted for a couple weeks, and would happen off and on. I visited the Nurse Practitioner at my doctor&#39;s office, and she confirmed that there indeed was some minor swelling in the lymph node on the left side of my throat. She ordered an ultrasound for my head/neck, but because of the cost, I was unable to get the ultrasound. The swelling has since subsided. I made the correlation that the swelling was on the same side as both of my Moderna injections, so I figure the swelling is due to the COVID vaccine.

                                                When I first got home about an hour after the vaccine I just have chills and sore arm. At 9pm that night when I took out my dog outside for a couple minutes I started uncontrollably shaking and I couldn?t stop. My chest started hurting and my breathing was difficult. I went back inside and laid on the floor and waited for the symptoms to stop. Once they finally stopped after about 10 minutes I just had the sore arm and chills again. It?s now been 2 days sense the vaccine and the chills hasn?t gone away. But I don?t have the uncontrollable shaking anymore.

                                                One hour after vaccination on Saturday got lethargic and so tired. Same the next day. Monday, the fatigue improved but Instartes to get muscle aches and stiffness. Soreness in my joints. By Wednesday evening my chest started to hurt for a few minutes and my heart rate temporarily Increased. As the days went on the symptoms became more regular. I also got extreme anxiety, a very fast heartbeat (up to 130 BPM), insomnia, sweating palms and feet, and very difficult to breathe. I couldn?t even get up to take a shower sometimes or sit up. I was admitted to the ER on I believe Tuesday the 23rd of March. This is all in the records. All tests came back normal  aside from low iron, but anemia tests came back negative. After all doctors refused to give me medication to directly treat it, I finally went to an urgent care where they gave me prednisone. It?s currently helping me. I was finally able to go for a walk today.

After 15 minutes I was told I was fine to leave, so I left and headed home. Almost halfway home my throat began to feel swollen and tighter, like a rock was in it. My lips and face continued to itch and tingle. My face also was bright red. I have experienced anaphylaxis before, and was on Bactrim for days before I had the reaction. I waited it out to see if I needed to go to the hospital, but felt I was okay. The next couple days however I still felt like there was a rock in my throat and it was still a little tight, but no longer itchy or feeling hard to swallow so I didn&#39;t take myself in.

                                                IM shot given at 2:52.  Took 4-5 alcohol prep pads to stop continuous blood dribbling.  Within 30 seconds, patient showed a slight bump at site of injection.  Just as the bleeding concluded and I was about to apply bandaid, patient blacked out, eyes began to flutter, body straighten and began to slouch in chair as I held her up, and fingers fluttered a bit as well.  Patient came about with 30 seconds, moderate hyperventilating, and with clammy sweat, unaware of where abouts.  Monitored patient for 30 minutes, but she did go home after re-attempting to work once again (got a ride from family).

                                                The Patient has an anaphylactic history to an oral pain medication she didn&#39;t know the name of, food allergies, and to the flu vaccine (with eggs). She has gotten the flu shot without eggs and been fine. The administering RN asked the med led to further assess. We discussed that she is at a higher risk for anaphylaxis than most people given her allergy history. She said that she was not Allergic to any component of the covid 19 vaccine when shown the list, and this was double checked. We discussed that if she gets the vaccine and has a reaction, she will need emergency room treatment and that she may want to consider being vaccinated at a hospital where they have more resources. However, given she did have known anaphylaxis to a component of the vaccine we will give it to her if she so chooses. It was explained that if she gets the vaccine, we will monitor her for 45 minutes, and if she has a reaction, she will be treated and sent to the E.R. She verbalized consenting to getting the vaccine after being thoroughly educated.  She was vaccinated at 1337 with 0.5 ml of Moderna Vaccine in the left deltoid. I was not present upon the administration. I was informed shortly after administration that she had cold sweaty palms and felt a little lightheaded. She was placed in a wheelchair and taken to a private observation tent to be further assessed. Initially in the tent she was not showing alarming signs of anaphylaxis and appeared stable. She had clear lung sounds and her oxygen level was 99% with no respiratory distress or airway compromise. At 1405 she felt her lips and throat get tingly and slightly bigger, although upon assessment they did not appear swollen. She was fasting and refused to swallow water or Benadryl when offered. She was able to swallow her spit with no issues. We explained to her that we are going to keep monitoring her, but if things change at all we are going to have to call 911 and administer epinephrine. She kept saying she is fine and that she did not want it and that her boyfriend would take her home. Currently her VS were BP 94/70, HR 72, O2 99%, RR 22. She was rubbing her back and her lungs were clear.  At 1410 her bp was 90/62, HR 74, o2 98% and RR 24. Again, she was rubbing her back. Her lungs sounded clear. At 1415 her BP was 84/60, HR 80, O2 93%, and RR rate of 30. She had small expiratory wheezes when listening to her breath sounds. She appeared to be in respiratory distress as she was coughing and rubbing her chest. She stated her chest felt back, neck, and chest felt tight. She still stated she was fine, and she did not have insurance. She was informed that this was a life-threatening emergency  At this time 911 was called as it was determined she was having an anaphylactic reaction needing epinephrine. Her Emergency contact was notified as he was on the phone with her. At 1417 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered into the left deltoid, which is where I was informed, she had received the vaccine. At 1420 her VS read 118/74, HR 122, O2 99%. Her respiratory distress appeared to be improving, and her VS improving. She stated she felt better, and she wanted to go home, but per policy she was taken to EMS in a wheelchair. She was handed off to EMS around 225 and verbal report was given. She was transferred to her emergency contact was present for transfer and filled in of the events.

                                                On Thursday 19th, around 6pm I started to feel my face itching and there were hives around my eyes. Similar to mosquitoes or aunts bits. At 10pm on the same day my lips got swollen and I decided not to take anything for it since I thought it was just an allergic reaction. When I went to sleep, it seemed to have gone better; however the next day when I woke up to go to work. Not only I had my face swollen and with hives but it had spread towards my arms and legs, still similar to mosquitoes bits. I decided then to take Benadryl and around 10 AM while I was working my chest got tight and my throat started to close. It was difficult for me to breathe and speak. They took me to the ER were I was given an IV with anti inflammatory and an allergy medication.

                                                Vaccine provided at 4:35pm. Patient was asked to wait 30 minutes observation time due to history of allergies, facial swelling/throat tightness in the past. At 30 minutes she stated she had some numbness in her hand that had gone away, but her heart was racing still and a little bit of throat issues. She waited in the pharmacy longer and intermittently checked on her. She took her heart rate at one point and it was 127. Asked around 1 hour wait time if she wanted to inform her doctor of her symptoms and any next steps. Around 5:50pm the patient reported she was having trouble breathing so 911 was called and an epinephrine pen was administered. The paramedics came shortly after and took the patient to hospital where she stayed around 4 hours.

Went back to sleep and woke up at 0730 and still had heart palpitations and chest felt uncomfortable with palpitations. Heart palpitations continued to get worse and went to Urgent care where the physician said I had a heart murmur and PVCs were noted when listening to my chest. I was send to the ER where PVCs were noted on heart monitoring multiple times per minute with shortness of breath. I got a chest X-ray and lab work that came back normal and was told to follow up with cardiology and get an ECHO done. The heart palpitations continued until the following day where they only were occurring once an hour or so and by today 6/19 I am no longer having heart palpitations.

                                                Client received her 1st dose of Moderna COVID vaccine lot # 021C21A at 1852 by agency.  At 1901, ancillary stayed with client as Medic came to Lead office to alert Co-Lead RN that the client was complaining of dizziness and shortness of breath. 15 seconds later, Co-lead arrived in vaccination room #10 and visualized the client sitting in a chair, drinking a bottle of water.  Client stated &#34;I feel a little warm&#34; and asked &#34;can I lay down?&#34; Zero-gravity chair was retrieved as well as an EMT at 1904.  We then assisted client to the zero-gravity chair and placed her in trandelenberg position with her feet elevated. Client denied headache, nausea, and chest pain.  She stated that the dizziness had passed, she was no longer short of breath and she was feeling better.  She stated she had eaten and drank fluids within the past couple of hours before her vaccination. Client explained that &#34;this happens sometimes with medical stuff&#34;, &#34;I&#39;m sometimes anxious&#34; and &#34;just last week I almost passed out when I donated blood&#34;.  Client denied any medical hx, current conditions, medications, or allergies.  Preliminary vital signs were taken at 1906 and were: BP 110/86, HR 58 (her normal, she stated she is a runner), O2 Sat 100%, and RR 18.  Client was then asked if she felt well enough to walk, and when she responded yes and was then escorted to the Observation Room which she ambulated to with a normal, steady gait.  Client denied needing a ride home, and stated she lived 7 minutes away and would have no problem driving as she felt fine.  Co-lead RN consulted Clinical Care Coordinator who advised IR but no VERP as this was a near syncopal episode with client&#39;s history of anxiety with medical procedures. Client was educated by Co-lead RN to stay for 30 minutes and to call 911 or go to the ED if she experienced any signs or symptoms of a vaccine reaction after she left the vaccination site with examples provided such as SOB, hives, tachycardia, and chest pain.  Co-lead also advised client to f/up with her PCP for further evaluation if needed.   EMT took a final set of vitals at 1930: BP 116/82, HR 68, O2 Sat 99%, and RR 16.  Co-lead observed client with an improved color and no complaints as she departed the Observation Room independently with a normal, steady gait at 1933.

The rash looked like little raised bumps and was itchy.  I applied some Benadryl cream on it and it hasn&#39;t improved.  About a week after my vaccination, I had flu like symptoms- shortness of breath, cough, low grade fever,  body aches and joint pain.  I went to the ER (Hospital) and was given  oxygen, breathing treatments and was diagnosed with pneumonia.  I was given a prescription of Z-pak azithromycin and discharged to follow up with my PCP.

HR elevated; having difficulty breathing so EpiPen 1:1000 given IM in left thigh.  Adult code blue called.  Code team arrived within 30 seconds to one minute and employee transported to ER via gurney.    Per ER Notes: DEXAmethasone (DECADRON) 10 mg/mL injection for oral use 10 mg (10 mg Oral Given 12/28/20 1301)  Patient is in no acute distress, states that she feels well.  History and physical exam as above.  Patient states that her symptoms have resolved as of arriving in the emergency department.  We will assume that this was an anaphylactic reaction, she was not given time to develop all signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, however she was given an EpiPen and her dyspnea rapidly improved and therefore we will treat her as if she experience anaphylaxis.  She will be kept in the emergency department for 6 hours for observation, she was given 10 mg of p.o. Decadron.  At the time of my shift change she continued to be hemodynamically stable, awake, and talkative. She still required ~3 hours of observation at that time. I saw this patient with attending physician, please see her note for ultimate disposition or further developments.

                                                Began with extreme fatigue. Within a couple of hours developed shortness of breath walking up stairs (never an issue prior) and palpitations. 01/26-walked to my gyno appointment two blocks away. After 20 minutes of rest had elevated blood pressure of 148/90, never had an issue w/ blood pressure. Woke up everyday with palpitations, shortness of breath and a headache that would last 10-15 minutes (not similar to any of my previous migraines). My palpitations and shortness of breath worsened over time and I started to feel them while lying flat or even slight movements such as standing up. My fatigue was pretty unbearable. I would need to take several naps a day and even then I never felt fully rested. I received my 2nd dose 02/27 and my symptoms increased in frequency and intensity. I was having more episodes a day and even walking within my own home I was out of breath. I went to the hospital and they were not able to find a cause for immediate danger so I was sent home. Originally they thought possible autoimmune issue such as Rheumatoid arthritis or lupus (prior to my RF, C-proteins and sedimentation rate results). My symptoms worsened from that visit; I began experiencing episodes of light headedness, brain fog, almost loss of consciousness, numbness in hands, muscle weakness, joint pain in knee, ankles and wrists. I am at a point now where even talking I can get out of breath or while showering I have difficulty breathing. Recently my brain fogs have become more frequent and noticeable. I have started seeing a cardiologist and am getting echo, exercise test and had a halter monitor placed, but still waiting on the results. During that visit the cardiologist noticed a slight aortic murmur, which was not present prior to this situation  This is has been completely debilitating to the point where I am on temporary leave from medical school.

The shortness of breath began about an hour after injection (3/24), and has continued through the next day (3/25). So far treatment has involved taking ibuprofen at 10:30pm (3/24).

                                                I was called at approximately 11:40. I went to evaluate the patient who was c/o feeling itchy, having bumps come up on her forearms, and feeling short of breath. Pt denied feeling pressure on chest of having trouble getting air in, but did describe it like she had just gotten done climbing a flight of stairs. Denies any trouble swallowing. Discussed with patient that the safest option would be for her to be transported to Emergency Department via EMS for further evaluation and possible treatment. Patient preferred not to go if she did not need to and was also informed of OTC treatment options for possible allergic reactions. Discussed OTC Benadryl and Pepcid to be taken when she gets home if she is declining transportation to ED. Again informed the patient that safest option would be for her to be in ED but with normal SpO2, good breath sounds, no trouble swallowing, and rather benign exam that she could go home if she wanted to and take OTC Benadryl and Pepcid as directed on packaging. I did recommend that patient monitor for additional symptoms, that she have an extended wait in observation area, and that she be monitored. Pt instructed to present to ED should she have any issues after leaving the facility.

                                                Vaccine given around 4pm.  Within 30 seconds, the patient began having muscle spasm.  She initially had tightness in her throat, but it did not progress into an anaphylactic reaction.  The muscles in her hands and arms contracted severely- her hands into fists.  With pain.  She began to sweat profusely.  After a few minutes, her symptoms did not abate and the pain/spasms became worse.  We contacted EMS Ambulance who arrived and began monitoring.  They treated her with oxygen, then a nebulizer treatment with albuterol and ipratropium.  At around 5pm she was recovering and the EMS left.  We kept track of her until about 5:30pm when she felt well enough to drive home.  I checked on her at 7pm and she was feeling fine.

A few minutes after administration, patient stated feeling a racing heart rate. We had her sit down. Checked on patient a few minutes later, she stated trouble breathing, feeling dizzy, nauseous, and jaw pain. My partner called 911 and EMS came to check on patient, they then took her by ambulance to medical services.

I think because I was panicking at some point it was hard to breath. I laid on the floor for a while until I felt better. My pressure was taken and it was 150/90. I felt dizzy and lightheaded the rest of the day.   At night and the next day I had a joint pain and a sore throat. I got a mild fever at night the next day and on the third day I just had a sore throat.

Aft this point she left, but reported that she immediately felt difficulty with breathing.

After a couple of hours of observation she was sent home without further issue.  She was given instructions to use Benadryl prior to her second vaccine and given an Epi pen to have just in case.  After discussion, this writer also recommended she follow up with her PCP to discuss having the vaccine in clinic vs at our facility.

                                                My throat started to feel dry, scratchy about 20 minutes after I received my second Moderna dose. These symptoms continued and my throat gradually started to swell, as well. I took a Benadryl after about 30-35 minutes, which made the symptoms go away. My throat started to swell again after about five hours, so I took another dose of Benadryl.  Throat symptoms feel very similar to when I am stung by a bee, which I am allergic to. So far, have not needed to use epinephrine.

                                                I am a 27 year old female with no medical conditions. Received my first Moderna shot Friday 5:30 pm, and I felt fine immediately afterwards but developed a sore arm (at injection site) within 2-3 hours, which intensified Saturday. No redness nor swelling in the arm, just the pain. Saturday I had stronger arm pain accompanied by constant neck pain, lymph node pain and headache. I also experienced random intermittent pains in the left chest (I have occasionally experienced chest pain in the past), side (left), and lower back. After these appeared I experienced what felt like an anxiety attack, with uncontrollable crying, shortness of breath and worry. My partner helped calm me. Today, Sunday, body aches are gone minus the sore arm, for which the pain is about 75% reduced.

I called 911 and asked for an ambulance because of difficulty breathing. Arrived at Hospital Center ER around 5:00am, given oxygen and several tests (blood, urine, EKG) and also IV fluids in my left arm. Vomited a second time around 8:00am. Continued difficulty breathing until around 11:00am and chest pain improved somewhat. Got chest x rays done and monitored until I could breathe more regularly without oxygen. Discharged around 12:26pm. Heartbeat was abnormally fast for this whole duration and did not return to resting heart rate until about 5:00pm later that evening, 24 hours after vaccine. All symptoms subsided within 48 hours. Diagnosis was nonspecific chest pain and UTI.

He was trying to lie down and go to sleep and couldn&#39;t breath, and progressively it got worse.  He did check his pulse and other VS and they were not unusual.   Yesterday it was worse, tingling in his hands and felt like they were asleep.  He was about to go to the ER and was out of breath while lying down and trying to rest.

                                                Dose 1:   45 minutes after shot: slight swelling of airways; breathing difficulty. Congestion lasted roughly an hour.   10 hours: slight nausea, dizziness and possible fever. Slept it off and woke up fine.   Dose 2:   About 3 hours after injection the worst swelling of airways I&#39;ve experienced. Slight panic arose from being unable to breathe freely. Was making plans to go to the ER when breathing became easier. It was all in all a very strange experience. Airways remained somewhat contracted for about an hour but faded without anything noteworthy.   6 hours after injection severe arm pain.   About 10 hours after the shot i experienced the worst feeling fever i have had. Did not take temp. Serious chills. I was under piles of blankets. Quite disoriented. Felt the need to move but was completely wracked with pain in all my joints.  Despite that I couldn&#39;t sit still. I am a complete stranger to insomnia. No medication has ever induced it.  However, this night I simply couldnt sleep more than 10 minutes at a time.  Finally took extra ibuprofen and my body seemed to respond well and the pain and chill subsided. I was achey and exhausted but couldn&#39;t sleep. I was also quite nauseous. About 36 hours after first dose i mostly seemed back to normal.    I think it was 6 days later i got hit with the same vertigo and dizziness that preceded my fevers. It&#39;s so bizarre. It happens mildly throughout the day but around 10pm or later it hits me hard and is debilitating. I have to stop whatever I&#39;m doing just to lay down. There&#39;s no chance of walking without falling unless I have a wall to guide me. The worst of it passes in about 10-15 minutes but lasts about a full hour. Then I&#39;m just nauseous but otherwise fine.

                                                Normal post vaccine symptoms for 2 days, then on day 3 I developed: Tachycardia at baseline in the low 100s which worsens when vertical and/or active (120&#39;s when standing, up to 170&#39;s when active), dyspnea and diaphoresis when vertical, body aches, headache extending into neck, low grade fever, severe fatigue, night sweats &amp; brain fog. Symptoms worsen with: eating, staying vertical for longer than a few minutes, exercise, not enough sleep, dehydration. Symptoms improve with: increased fluid intake (&gt;4.5L/day of Gatorade), increased salt intake &amp; rest/laying down.  Symptoms have forced me to quit working as an ICU nurse and move home with my parents.  I am now awaiting an appointment with a dysautonomia specialist out of town.

                                                First dose went fine with just some arm soreness. About one week after second dose I began having a lot of trouble breathing, feeling like I couldn?t get nearly enough oxygen. I am active, never have had asthma, I run - I never felt anything like it before.  Now it has been about 8 days and symptoms have not improved. I went to urgent care the other day and they tested me for covid, x-rayed my lungs, and gave me an EKG - all tests came back fine and they sent me home. I am sure that this is not anxiety, and I suspect that it is related to my heart and not my lungs - for when I jog in place and get my heart rate up, my breathing improves. It is my understanding that if it were a lung issue, that my breath would get worse with exercise.  I miss breathing and am quite frightened that this will stay with me. I also had to spend several hundred dollars at urgent care. I would like to know any and all info available on this.

The following day when I woke up, I had a bad cough that produced a green/yellow mucus, body aches through my chest and shoulders, runny nose, congestion, sneezing, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. I went to my local urgent care because my primary care doctor&#39;s office was closed. I was diagnosed with bronchitis. I was prescribed ten 20mg tablets of prednisone and six 250mg tablets of zithromax z-pack. After finishing both prescriptions, I still have a slight cough which occasionally produces clear mucus and an occasional runny nose.

                                                Day 1 Slight pinkish hue under the injection area on left arm with pain. 1 1/2  hours after injection. Feeling of tightness accompanied by sharp pains in same area. 2 hours after injection. Feeling of tightness/lack of circulation (as if the arm was falling asleep). Left arm. 3 hours after injection. Experiencing pain/ area has become warm. Pinkish hue has turned to reddish hue. 4 hours after injection. Arm has become heavy. 6 hours after injection.  Day 2 Advised to rest. Take a Tylenol. Relax arm. Did just so. No flu-like symptoms.  Day 3 Slight inability to breathe: Experienced weird inability to breathe that lasted for only 20 minutes.  Took a Benadryl. Stepped outside for some fresh air. Breathed in and out slowly. Sharp pains below injection area. Pinkish hue below injection area. Arm is warm. Experienced no flu-like symptoms though.  Day 4 Reddish hue still there below the injection area. Arm is slightly warm. Experiencing No Flu-like symptoms.  Day 5 Reddish bump has grown 3 more inches around arm in length. Feeling tightness. Experiencing slight swelling. Slight Itchiness. No Sharp Pain.  Day 6  Reddish hue still under injection spot. Area Has become extremely itchy.  No Sharp Pains. Contacted Rx. Advised to apply anti-itch cream and to ice the arm.  Day 7 Applied anti-itch cream. Not working. Trying best to not scratch the arm. Bump feels hard and HOT. Icing arm: Area all around bump is Cold. Bump itself feels HOT.  May have a fever.  Days 8-12 No flu-like symptoms. Bump feels hard and HOTTTTT. Concerned about arm. Applying anti-itch cream and periodically taking Benadryl. Feeling drowsy. Staying active. Icing arm: Area all around bump is Cold. Bump itself still feels HOTTTTT. Itchiness has not left. Reddish bump has changed to a dark pink color. Seeing it slightly brownish too. Around the bump there is a ring that has formed. Light pink in color it has permeated day by day. Still icing arm. Avoiding the sun so as not to irritate arm.  Day 13 AM Bump still there. Pinkish hue. Slight irritation..not as intense. Concerned about the ring around the arm that keeps permeating. Resolved to show up at the Rx so they could see for themselves what I have.  Day 13 PM Arrived at Rx. Attempted to show my left arm area to pharmacist that gave injection but it nearly cleared by the afternoon and by the time I got there?  Pinkish hue was there along with the ring but it was almost clear! I showed pictures as proof of my concern. Was given assurance that I am okay. (Concerned because every person I spoke with that got the vaccine never experienced what I did with Moderna), Was given Cortizone (with Aloe) to purchase to help with itchiness that remains. Was instructed  for my 2nd Dose to stay longer for them to check for any allergic reactions.  Day 14-19 Experienced Periodic itchiness. Applying anti-itch cream was enough. Iced only on Day 14 just in case any fever remained on arm that I could not feel. Arm immediately felt cold from icing. Concluded icing was no longer necessary. No bump on arm. Large Brownish spot has remained where the pinkish bump used to be. Resembles a slight bruise. Darker than  arm color. Hopefully original look of arm will return.

                                                Sudden extreme fatigue and mild nausea for about 2 hours. Then felt tachycardia and palpitations. Heart rate was checked by medical professional in household and was found to be 120 and irregular. This lasted approximately 2 minutes. At this time also felt shortness of breath which lasted 30 minutes. Once the tachycardia and shortness of breath ended, I was getting chills and continued to have nausea and extreme fatigue. Since the vaccination my arm has continued to be very sore. When I woke up on 1/8/2021 I am still very fatigued and still have a sore arm.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning her co-worker, a 28 year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced anaphylaxis reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I am a MD student who got the first dose of the moderna vaccine on 1/4/2021. I had no immediate reaction other than arm soreness. A couple weeks after my first vaccine, I had a reaction when drinking miralax. Within ~5 minutes of having a few sips of a 17g solution, I had throat tingling/tightening, sense of impending doom, cough, dyspnea, nausea, fecal urgency, and intense chills with shivering. I stopped drinking the solution and my symptoms eventually resolved on their own (the chills and nausea took the longest, about 1.5 hours) - I didn&#39;t even think to take benadryl because it wasn&#39;t clear to me at the time if I was really having an allergic reaction (no hives, no vomiting - but in retrospect I&#39;m concerned). I&#39;ve had miralax in the past without any issues. I&#39;ve never had a vaccine adverse reaction. I have no history of atopy.

The following day, 1/6/21, saw a PA for the blisters and hives due to the itchiness and hydrocortisone was not helping.  Then had a headache, body aches and flushes for at least a week.  She did have shortness of breath and by the weekend she was feeling confused like the feeling of waking up from anesthesia.  She started loosing her balance, could not go up the stairs, trip and fall.  They did lab work, told her that she was fine.  She was having confusion and forgetful and let it run it&#39;s course.  She did have the 2nd vaccine, but is still having hot flushes from it.

                                                I received my shot at 6:53pm. I went to the waiting room and waited until my time was up, I was released from my observation station at 7:11pm. Staff did ask me how I was feeling I had no signs or symptoms upon being released. I left the facility feeling great had no issues at all. I went to pick up my dinner at 7:45pm drove home. When I arrived home my lips started to tingle, and my face was starting to swell up. I inspected the rest of my body for any rash called my mom and read over the fact sheet that was given to me at time of shot. As per the directions regarding the risk of an allergic reaction I called my primary care doctor because my face was beginning to swell, and my throat started to feel scratchy. My primary care doctor called me back and advise I go to the ER immediately to be monitored for an allergic reaction.  I arrived in a Hospital just before 9pm and checked in at the ER. The doctor saw me quickly.  By the time the doctor saw me at the ER my face was bright red I had developed a rash all over my chest and back and on the injection site, my lips were swollen and had mild throat swelling. She gave me a high dose of prednisone and 2 Benadryl&#39;s.  They continued to monitor me for a while until they felt better and discharged me with a epi pen and other meds.

The fever went away that night but I still felt very fatigued for the next 3 days. By Wednesday, I was feeling better but still had some heart palpatations/racing heart. But Thursday, I was feeling good enough to go for a short run/walk, but Friday I woke up  feeling fatigue, nausea and headache again. My body does not feel strong enough to do simple things like walks outside. This morning i woke up with slight headache and a feeling that is hard to describe, but mainly fatigue and slight nausea.

I have had a steroid shot on 2/18/2021 and was started on a Medrol dose pack, no relief and the rash got worse. I contacted my doctor/dermatologist over the weekend and was prescribed Prenisone 60 mg. I have been taking Prednisone 60 mg daily since Sunday 2/21/2021, with Zyrtec tid, Pepcid tid and Benadryl twice daily. I have been using my bronchodilator (Albuterol) about 3-4 times daily with my daily Brillinta (diskus inhaler) to prevent airway issues. I have had no relief. My rash and hives are not fully suppressed and I they move over my body. They burn, and get hot. Ice helps but doesn&#39;t seem to make them go away.

I began feeling as though I couldn&#39;t breath approximately 5-6 minutes after I received the vaccine. The difficulty breathing began to get worse and I got the attention of the nurse. She administered my first epi-pen at 10:18 am. I was transported from the observation room to the emergency department. On my way to the emergency department I  began to have difficulty breathing again and received a second dose of epinephrine. When I arrived at the emergency department I was given Benadryl, Zyrtec, and another medication.  I was monitored in the emergency department for 3 hours without further incident.

I also got hives on the bottom of my neck. I noticed slight difficulty in breathing, but it was not significant enough to require emergency care. The hives persisted overnight and showed up on both hands as well. The hives on my arms lasted about 4 days. The hives on my hands lasted about 6 days and are  only slightly itchy now. The hives are still on my neck and now under my eyes and throughout my face/jawline (1 week after vaccination).

I had an estimated date of 03/17/2021 but delivered on 02/26/2021.

                                                Dizziness and rapid heartbeat five minutes after shot with lightheadedness continuing for a few days after.  Sore throat and swollen throat glands twenty minutes after shot that continued for a couple hours after.  Swollen breasts leading to back pain twenty minutes after shot continuing for a week following.  Headache, fatigue, and joint pain for 48 hours after shot.  Nausea and acid reflux for several days after shot.  Menstrual spotting occurring one week after shot (had period the week before).  I saw a doctor at an urgent care and he suspects I may have anemia that was worsened due to being on my period right before shot and that likely contributed to the dizziness and rapid heartbeat.  No explanation for other symptoms but I am healthy.

Symptoms mostly disappeared the next day except for body aches, sensitive inner ears (some difficulty draining the eustachian tube, they randomly pop, and some pressure is released). 3rd day most symptoms gone except still cannot fully release eustachian tubes, still mild swelling in arm light, and started menstrual spotting (day 15 of the cycle, my previous cycle started 4/1 and was regular.). 4th-day post vaccine and I am starting to spot more heavily, I think the cycle is about to start. I wonder if my body was stressed enough I did not ovulate. I experienced a change in discharge on days 2 and 3 but when I took an ovulation test it came up negative on both days,   After the first shot, I felt like I couldn&#39;t take a full breath and I felt like something was in my lungs like phlegm or something ( I don&#39;t Smoke FYI) but I noticed the symptoms went away after the second dose.

Seen by epilepsy specialist on 4/12 and was admitted to hospital for video EEG and MRI and found to have significant both focal and generalized seizure activity despite my usual anti-seizure medications that had been working for 14 years. My medications were changed and I was discharge home after 6 days.

                                                Same day as vaccine (Wednesday): expected achy arm, spreading to aching all over. Overnight (Wednesday night): Woke in the night with aches strong enough to prevent me from sleeping. Near-hallucination sensations of being able to &#34;feel&#34; my body warring with my left arm (injection site). Able to stand and walk around. Fever unknown. Next day (Thursday): Extreme fatigue, slept most of the day. Unable to stand for very long before the world started to go grey as if I was going to faint (I always sat down before I had a chance to faint). Feeling of breathlessness as if I was at a higher altitude than usual. Home O2 monitor repeatedly read at 97% throughout the day. Low-grade fever of 100.7ºF. Nauseous. Friday: Able to stand for longer but not indefinitely before the world went grey. Limbs and extremities easily got pins-and-needles tingling sensation after a couple moments of rest. Saturday: Hands tingling without any rest or constriction. Able to stand and walk. Still fatigued, still a bit breathless. Sunday: Tingling better but still present. Still fatigued. Breathlessness gone, standing nearly normal but still tiring. [Next few days too vague to describe, but symptoms are mostly gone by the following Wednesday except for occasional tingling in hands and arms.]

                                                After 40 minutes, my entire body was uncomfortably itchy and I could not stop scratching. I had a cough along with it. Also, I could not ride in a car without getting car sick. I was told to take 50mg Benadryl and call 9-1-1 if my throat started closing up. After discussions with a few of my regular health care providers, I was instructed not to get the second vaccine.

                                                Adverse Events:  I went to the emergency room on 5/18 after experiencing major back pain, sharp pain in ribs, chest pains, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and chronic coughing.   Outcome:  After x-rays, EKG, D-Dimer Test and a CT scan the doctor determined that I have Pulmonary Embolism (blood clots in my lungs).   I&#39;ve never had any symptoms prior to receiving the covid vaccine. Today is 5/24 and I am still experiencing most of the same symptoms despite taking my medications as prescribed. The worst symptoms are difficulty breathing and chronic coughing.   Treatment:  -No longer taking birth control (Azurette) since that can cause blood cots -Xarelto (to treat and prevent blood clots)  -Gabapentin 100MG 3x Day (for pain) -Benzonatate 200MG 3x Day (for cough) -Tizanidine 2MG 1X day (for pain) -Albuterol Inhaler Every 4 hours

                                                Immediately after the vaccine I felt very faint, and I was very flush. I had trouble breathing and I felt like I was gasping for air. I waited for 45 minutes until I left but I did not receive treatment. I took a Benadryl after one hour and I felt better. It did not happen again. Later that night I had flu-like symptoms that resolved quickly. I took a Tylenol that night. After the vaccine I was fine.

I started to feel chest pain when I woke up Monday (6/07) from 4 am- 10 am and then again Tuesday (6/08) when I woke up from (2 am-4 am). I went to my PCP Monday around 3 pm and they thought I had acid reflux or body aches. I called an ER Tuesday morning and was told chest pain was an emergency and should go to the ER. I went to the ER Tuesday at 4 am and was admitted for elevated heart enzymes and heart inflammation.

                                                I received the first dose of the COVID 19 (Moderna) on 01/15/2021 in the evening. The next morning I woke up at 05:45am with a sore arm, which I was told was one of the side effect. However I was sore and aching all over my body. As my day continued, I became tired and feeling flushed within the face. I felt my heart rate beating faster than normal. I began having cold chills and the aching within my body progressed through out the day (12 hr shift). When I clocked out at 07:08 pm and got home from work, I was unable to hardly move with out hurting and I felt like I had a fever. My husband checked my temperature and I had a low grade temp of 99.4 with an increase work of breathing and had ,a difficult time catching a breath. My husband took me to the hospital ER and before arriving to the ER I was having a stridor episode and when the nurse checked my temperature it read 102.3. I could not complete a full sentence and began vomiting. I was given epinephrine nebulized, solumedrol, benadryl, zofran, lidocaine nebulized. I had a CT with contrast of my neck and a chest xray. All images came back normal, I had been treated for an allergic reaction from the COVID vaccine and discharged home once the symptoms and stridor subsided.

                                                Strep throat like symptoms began 3 days after my 2nd covid vaccine (Friday January 29, 2021). Sore, red, and swollen throat, white patches on tonsils, low grade fever (max temp 100.5), chills, body aches beginning Friday, January 29, 2021.  I initially went to urgent on Sunday, January 31, 2021 for a strep test. The test was negative and the nurse practitioner told me to return if my symptoms didn?t improve in a few days.  On Tuesday February 2,2021, after my symptoms worsened, I went to Urgent Care for a second opinion/strep test as this is generally the hospital I use for treatment as opposed to the urgent care that I mentioned previously. The nurse practitioner did not swab me for strep, but rather observed my red, swollen, white patch filled throat and ordered me a round of steroids and antibiotics. I started both the antibiotics and steroids today, February 2,2021.

Patient did not complain of any shortness of breath, itching, hives, etc. BP and pulse ox were normal, but some wheezing was noted by a physician in the vaccine clinic. Patient was transferred to our ED for further evaluation. The ED did not hear any wheezing, and the patient&#39;s caregiver said that the swelling of her eye appeared to lessen. She was treated in the ED with IV Benadryl, Solu-Medrol, and Pepcid. Was discharged approximately 2 hours later.

This was also present after the first dose of the vaccine, but much milder. I also experienced, chills, headache, and body aches. I took Tylenol for these symptoms and took 2 zyrtec for the shortness of breath. All symptoms lasted only about 24 hours. They seem much better on 2 days after the vaccine.

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

                                                On  01/09/2021 I woke up around 10AM and felt chills, I had to be in bed, I had fever (103F) and once I started taking Advil it went down to 100F. I felt body aches, a horrible headache. The next day I had the fever (it went away on the 13th). the body aches were better.  I also had pain in my arm and the symptoms were all back in the evening. On 01/09 I was tested and was negative but on the 20th I was tested again and was positive. I was seen by the Doctor  on the 13th and he prescribed me something that helped me with the fever. He also diagnosed me with pharyngitis. After the 20th, when I was diagnosed positive I also started with shortness of breath and anxiety attacks.

Reactions continued daily until around 1 month after 2nd Moderna vaccine and then declined, but are still occurring infrequently and unpredictably as of present time.

                                                Within a few hours from getting the vaccine I was very tired. But the severe reactions started around 9 hours after I received the shot. I had the chills and then a fever. I had nausea so bad I couldn?t hardly eat all day. I was dizzy, short of breath, exhausted, and had a sore throat. I was so tired and so dizzy I couldn?t get out of bed all day. These symptoms lasted at least 24 hours. I am still slightly tired today and dealing with a mild sore throat and headache. The adverse effects I had from the moderna vaccine were awful. I couldn?t take care of my kid or do anything all day. I didn?t even have the energy to look for a thermometer.

                                                The night of the shot I had a headache and some fatigue with some nausea. The next morning when I woke up around 8 am my arm was sore and my entire body felt achy. Over the next couple hours my body was progressively achy to the point of not wanting to move. By 12 pm I was in tears of just how much my body hurt. This is also around the time I had a fever of 101.3. I took a double dose of ibuprofen and attempted to sleep it off however I was only able to fade in and out of sleep because despite taking medicine my fever started to climb more and more high and the chills started to intensify. I recorded my fever through out the day and watched it climb more and more high until about 6 pm it was at 103.4. My head was pounding, my ears were hearting, my body aches so much and despite having chills I felt as if my body was over heating to the point where I had to put a bag of ice on my neck and a cool wash cloth on my head to cool down. I took more ibuprofen and eventually my fever went down again. By 11 pm it was back down to 101.3 and I felt so exhausted o went to bed however I woke up about every 2 hours and tossed and turned all night as my fever went back up to about 102 and I had chills. I woke up today about 7 am feeling better from yesterday but my body is still slightly achy, fever is low grade at 100.6 and the chills have eased. The sides in the back of my throat are very swollen and painful still though and have been since the night I received the shot.

The pain extended through all of it - from my elbow through both my little finger and ring finger, and I could barely move my arm without it making it hurt more. The intense pain slowly went away within the next 3 hours.  - About an hour later I was really exhausted.  -Around 4pm, I was extremely tired, had a really fast heartbeat, and I was having difficulty breathing (similar to when I have asthma). The fast heart rate and the breathing difficulties went away around 6/6:30pm. The fatigue went away the next day.

                                                At around roughly 7:00 pm my regular achy arm became body aches followed by chest pain and shortness of breath. I know I do not have COVID 19 I haven?t left my house since March 2020 until October 2020 to have my baby and since then haven?t been out again except to get vaccinated in March 2021. I also do not have any underlying conditions I?ve had full check ups because I had a baby 6 months ago.  The only side effect concerning me are the shortness of breath and chest pain.

I had a phone appointment with an online doctor. The doctor said to go to urgent care. The urgent care doctor gave me prednisone and a script for an epipen. The doctor also sent a referral to an allergy specialist to determine what actually cause the reaction and to tell me whether I should get the second dose or not.

                                                I experienced what I felt was a panic attack a little over two days after I received my second dose of Moderna.  I had shortness of breath, mind fogginess, chest pressure, and dizziness when standing up.  It didn&#39;t seem to go away fully that night as I went to bed with slight shortness of breath and I woke up with chest pressure the next morning.  I continued to have slight chest pressure/pains that came &amp; went as well as a bad headache so I went to go see my doctor.  He suggested that it was from anxiety &amp; side effects from the shot since I had Covid in March of 2020.  I still have chest pressure/pain and headache that comes and goes.

I was a little lightheaded, but I thought it was normal, so I didn&#39;t notify the healthcare workers. Approximately, 20 to 30 minutes after the shot and after leaving vaccination facility, I had chest pain and shortness of breath, which stopped after about an hour. About 6 or 7 hours after the vaccine (9 or 10 pm), I started having shortness of breath, cough, mucus in my throat, slight chest pain, shivers and trembling (temperature was about 36.8 Celsius). At some point, for a few minutes, I felt lightheaded, dizzy, my speech was slow, slurry and I had brain fog. After some hours, the symptoms receded. I was able to fall asleep at about 3 am. The next day, I only felt a little shortness of breath and body aches. The second day after the vaccine, I felt almost normal except for a lingering, occasional shortness of breath.

Then for several days after that, my heart would randomly ?flutter? but it only lasted a couple seconds, I assumed it was anxiety. 4/11/21 I was on a walk and my heart started beating really fast and it was hard to breathe. I went back home. 4/12/21 I was at work when suddenly my chest felt tight and  it was hard to breathe for a few seconds. Then following that for days it was the fluttering again, off and on, maybe once every other day, but now my chest had started hurting and feeling tight without the heart palpitations. Just all of a sudden a tight chest, this continues every day including today . 4/26/21 I was at work sitting at my desk when my heart started beating wildly, I?ve never experienced anything like that before. It lasted longer than the others and was stronger, and towards the end it was hard to breathe. I spoke to my doctor and she ordered bloodwork. I went to urgent care and they listened to my heart and lungs, and did an EKG and said everything looks good at the moment. I can still feel the chest tightness. I bought a heart monitor so I can track these flutters.

                                                Day 2 - Extreme fatigue and disorientation/vertigo, and felt like I could not breathe. Went to Urgent Care and was told it was an allergic reaction. Was prescribed an over the counter antihistamine and told not to receive the second vaccine.   Over the course of the following week pain throughout my body worsened - the most painful being in my ovaries, in my muscles, and (believe it or not) feeling like in my blood! I eventually stopped sleeping and psychosis developed. I was voluntarily hospitalized in an ER first, then in a Psych unit at Hospital where my psychosis was stabilized along as the primary concern while my physical health symptoms were monitored and managed with (what I assume was) patient-lead care. During my time in-patient I requested to stop taking my birth control pills, which was heard.   Upon leaving the hospital (currently 2 days out), I have continued taking prescribed mental health medications (Geodon 20mg in the evening, Prozac 40mg in the morning) and continue to monitor and manage my pain with over-the-counter Tylenol. Since leaving in-patient the pain is localized to pelvis/ovaries.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the 1st dose of moderna, I got extremely shaky, weak, hot (started sweating), and felt as if I would pass out.  These symptoms mostly subsided within the 15 minute waiting period. The exhaustion/weakness lasted about 2-3 hours after the injection. I noticed upon eating afterwards (within 1 hour of vaccine) that it was harder to swallow and my throat just felt a little swollen.  By that evening, around 6 pm all of these symptoms had subsided and I just had a very sore arm (in the muscle) and tightness/swelling in my trapezius muscle for a few days.

                                                I went to the hospital due to shortness of breath and extreme pressure and pain in my chest, specifically surrounding my heart, diaphram, and radiating up to my collar bones and shoulders. After blood work and EKG, they found that my EKG was irregular and I had an elevated D-DIMER blood result at 1600. I was taken for a CAT scan of my upper abdomen and they found that I had a large (650ml) pericardial effusion causing cardiac tampenade. I underwent a procedure that inserted a needle into my pericardium, sucked out the fluid, and inserted a drain tube for 48 hours to drain excess fluid. Upon additional testing, it was determined that I had none of the usual causes for a pericardial effusion (no heart attack or trauma, no infection either viral or bacterial, no cancer, no autoimmune conditions.) My inflammation markers were extremely elevated and my lymph nodes in CAT scan were swollen. As a result, I now have constrictive pericarditis, scar like tissue surrounding my heart constricting its function.

                                                Well the next day I felt like I couldn&#39;t breath and I was very pail and cold and clammy. The people that I live with told me I passed out for about 30 seconds. I had that tingly feeling all over my body and could not breath still. They called the ambulance and went to the hospital, they gave me Ativan, but they told me I needed to see a DR and get checked out. So after I left the hospital I was fine but every day since the 11th on June 2021 I have had similar symptoms but just a little smaller intensity. Eventually the shortness of breath it started to go away. Then on the 19th of June I was very light headed and just feeling very week for about 4 hours and then on Monday the 21st of June I had a &#34;normal&#34; day so apparently I am starting to feel better. On the 15th of June I also had a very bad heavy breathing panic attack like symptoms. She prescribed me the generic of Ativan. I went to the DR yesterday 6/22/2021 to follow up, but am feeling better so far. I have felt fine ever since the 21st June 2021, but that has been only a few days since then.

I was taken to the ER and given an IV. Then a few days later, I felt unsteadiness/lightheadedness for approximately two weeks. Then that subsided and then I was experiencing shortness of breath for one to two weeks. Ever since the second dose of the vaccine, I&#39;ve felt off.

My vision is foggy, my eyes hurt. I have low back pain and I feel like my kidneys hurt. I get confused very easily now. My neck and my head hurt. I feel like a big ball of pain. I have been to ER 3 times since the 2nd dose. My normal doctor believes I had an autoimmune response to vaccine.

                                                On 01/29/2021 I began to have severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, right arm numbness, severely low BP. I was taken to the ED on 01/30/2021, 02/04/2021, and 02/18/2021. Each time I was cleared for COVID-19, heart attack and stroke. I was given bags of IV to help increase my BP because it was (on average between the 3 visits) 90/55. Other than that I was not &#34;treated&#34; for anything. I followed up with Cardiology and Endocrinology and continue to follow up to hopefully find an answer and a &#34;cure&#34; to start to feel better.

It was never severe enough to go to doctor.  It never got better so I saw my PCP. She ordered lab tests and Holter monitor which came back fine.  I chalked it up to my zoloft not working and had her increase my dose in case it was anxiety related. I saw that we should report things if they seem odd so just wanted to make you aware

                                                The onset of symptoms started around 9:15am. I experienced numbness and tingling to bilateral feet and lower legs. I experienced dizziness. I also experienced an increased heart rate (160s-170s BPM). I was hyperventilating and had difficulty with breathing. I was pale and cold.  I had uncontrollable shakes. My BP was a bit higher than my normal but not hypertensive.  I was given candy and juice after onset of symptoms. ( I did have an English muffin prior to receiving the vaccine). My symptoms subsided for some time but then came back about 15 minutes later. These symptoms continued to occur about every 15 minutes for a period of close to 2 hours. I was given Benadryl 50mg PO after the first hour of symptoms. I continued to experience the symptoms for up to about 45 minutes after being given Benadryl. My symptoms began to subside and eventually stopped after the 2 hour mark.

She was scared to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Then she said she did feel SOB and throat feels tight. I grabbed the EPI pen and injected 0.3mg into lateral right thigh. Brought patient to our emergency room, administered Benadryl 25mg (2 caps) po. Started IV NaCl 1000 mL in RAC. Administered famotidine 20mg/2ml IPV over 2 minutes. Currently on slow IV drip, 2nd bag. Patient is doing well. She was initially shaky after the EPI pen but throat did not feel tight less than 10 minutes after injection. Currently is relaxed as I monitor her. Vitals have been stable.

                                                I received my vaccination at my place of work. Local pharmacy came in to administer them.  In less then a minute of recieving the vaccination I experienced a tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  I told my symptoms to the  pharmacist that was there.  I had to take my mask off due to the difficulty breathing.  I sat down and was trying to catch my breath.  Roughly 10 -15 minutes passes then my throat began to swell.  My extremities were feeling tingly and I was very dizzy.  I sat with my neck extended to maintain my airway until they could locate some benedryl.  My voice was wheezy when attempting to answer questions the pharmacist was asking.  The pharmacist wanted to administer the EpiPen but I would not allow her to because then they would have to call 911.  It took about 45 minutes in total to locate benedryl.  I took 50 mg.  Roughly 15 -20 minutes after taking the benedryl I was able to breath with ease.  I waited about another 15 minutes at the facility to ensure I was ok.  I was told I would not be recieving the second dose due to my anaphylactic reaction.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

                                                I started feeling generally unwell around 9:00 PM. I developed chills and fever around 10:30 PM. I went to bed and fell asleep until 12:00 AM. I fell back asleep until 3:30 AM. I woke up with a racing heartbeat, chills and shortness of breath. My oxygen saturation which is usually normal was in the high 80?s. I took another dose of Motrin 800 mg and was able to break my fever and this reduced my heart rate. My oxygen saturation was still low. I fell back sleep around 4:10 AM and was able to sleep until 7:00 AM. I took another dose of Motrin around 8:00. I had a persistent headache and general malaise the day following vaccination. 2 days after vaccination I still felt very tired and weak and had a persistent headache. Day 3 was symptom free.

                                                After the vaccine I got chills beginning at 10pm.  About 1am I got a fever but was already taking started tylenol and motrin because I developed a headache also.  The fever went as high as 101.2.  On Tuesday I woke at 2am soaked in sweat and the fever had broke.  Later that day the fever returned at 100.5 but broke on its on.  By Saturday I woke up again with SOB and super cold.  Fever had returned at 101 so I went to Urgent Care  because the fever just kept returning.  A chest xray was done and it showed my lungs were really inflammed.  The fever returned later but went away.  The SOB is still here.  And on  1/19 I got the same feeling with SOB, 101.1 fever and felt awful all over again. So I visited with my PCP and another chest Xray and blood work was done again.  The chest xray showed normal but was started on a Flovent enhaler to help with the breathing and SOB.

About 1am I developed a fever of 101.5 which had went to 102.1 and for 24 hrs I could not get it down below 101.   On Tues I woke up at 2am soaked in sweat but the fever had broke for about 12 hrs. I developed another fever of 100.5 but it went away with no medication.  I felt better the next day but the fever returned later along with SOB and because the fever returned it prompted me to go to the urgent care where a chest xray was done.  The xray showed my lungs were inflamed.  On 1/19 I developed the same SOB, chest tighness and another fever of 101.  I reached out to my doctor and had an office visit where another xray was done but normal and was started on the Flovent enhaler to help with the SOB and breathing.

As a result, I had mild nausea. If went away after 20 minutes. As the expected chills, headache, and fever continued, I started to develop tachycardia at rest (107-172bpm) with heart palpitations around 9:30am. The palpitations went away approximately 2 hours later. I still continue to have tachycardia with minor shortness of breath sensation.  My heart rate is currently 115bpm at rest.

                                                Before vaccine I did take Benadryl and took my advice 500 inhaler concerned about previous anaphylaxis. I was fine in observation and about 1hour after my heart started racing and I became flushed with hives on my chest and mild difficulty breathing. My mother is a nurse and I had her stay with me and took 50mg more Benadryl and my albuterol inhalers and breathing issues subsided  and  I went to sleep for about 4 hours. When I woke up my heart rate was fine, flush was gone but I still had mild hives. For the next 4 weeks I have had hives on and off and itching. I have had this happen before during almond harvest but never this time of year. I am currently breast feeding and hives have resolved everywhere except for my chest.

                                                About 4 hours after the injection I began experiencing arm pain. In the middle of the night the muscle aches, headache, and nausea started. The whole next day I hardly left my bed due to extreme fatigue. The injection site was hard to the touch and so swollen you could visibly see a lump on my deltoid. My highest temperature taken was 100.8 and I had chills. I had a cough and could not take a full breath without coughing. I was congested. Later on in the day I had diarrhea. The following day I continued to have fatigue, muscle aches, headache, chills, and cough. I also had a rash on the area around the injection site that spread up to my shoulder, neck, and chest. The fatigue has continued until now, which is 50.5 hours after injection. I took ibuprofen 400-800 mg at a time 4 times throughout yesterday and today with little effect. I also took an antihistamine 4 times.

I was having severe chills - never experienced these kinds of chills before. I took Tylenol. I tried to still go to work but I by was having difficulty breathing and on January 11, I called my primary care Dr. and waited for appt but on January 13, there was no appt available and she told me to go ER. ER  part of medical group/hospital. They told me I might have COVID.  Dr said severe reaction to vaccine. I was still having trouble breathing. I have albuterol inhaler that I use as needed. I had it in my bag and I used that (and I had been using it when I was having trouble breathing but it wasn&#39;t helping like it could have ). They sent me home but I was still having trouble breathing. I had difficulty breathing for about about three days and then it resolved. I followed up with my PCP - video visit after two days after ER and then I had an office visit with her. After two weeks, I felt recovered. Although my right arm still have pain - pinching sharp pain in my arm that comes.

                                                after the shot, back pain intensified.  Throughout the day, the back pain turned into severe stomach issues.  Took stomach meds (pepto bismol) with no effect.  Went to sleep and woke up in the middle of night with stabbing pain in my stomach. used a heating pad to help me go back to sleep.  the 2nd day my stomach felt as if it was a balloon- extremely bloated and it hurt to breath deep, and stand straight. Took pepto, gas x, and also tried tums- nothing helped.  Today is day 3, and I am back to feeling normal aside from still being very tired, and hazy.  No more stomach issues.  Called doctor to see what I should do today, and was advised to not take the second dose.  Would like a second opinion.

                                                Immediately after injection, arm felt some tingling that subsided. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my throat began to feel tight with my tongue feeling a heaviness. I experienced some difficulty swallowing and my heart began to race. Swelling did not worsen but face became flushed and entire mouth had a stinging/numbness. Took 25mg benadryl and 20 mg Pepcid about 25 minutes after vaccine and swelling is improved. Still some residual flushed feeling in my face and tongue still feels weird but am swallowing okay despite some dry mouth.

Patient denies any lip swelling, tongue swelling, throat tightness, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, and other related symptoms not mentioned above.

Then I started to feel very dizzy and light headed. My body could not hold me up so I fell to the floor. My heart started to palpitate very fast, and I could not catch my breath to try to regulated my self. I was like this for maybe 20 minutes. While this was happening the clinic called 911 for a ambulance. While this was happening I could not talk, my words and my thoughts could not connect for lack of a better world. I was like THIS FOR 4 hours not being able to talk. After this my word get getting confused with other word and switching them around with other words.

Currently feels like there is a block or something in my right leg. Massaging it now.  -Hard to swallow/ swelling on right side of throat (I think my thyroid nodules are inflamed). Caused me to feel like my throat is closing. But I?m able to breathe fine when I don?t panic and concentrate on my breathing.  -Sense of impending doom, which relaxes when I focus on my breathing  -tingling right foot  2.5 hours after injection: left arm is starting to feel numb as well. Other symptoms persist, though oxygen levels are back to  98% and bpm is down to 88-90

                                                April 6th, 2021     Today at about 2:43pm, one of our technicians came to me and stated that a customer (employee too) had just got her second COVID-19 shot (Moderna), and she was at her car and not feeling well. The patient&#39;s co-worker had told us that her finger tips were numb and that she had a headache. The technician asked the customer to come back in, which she did and sat down in a chair immediately in front of me. I went directly to talk to her, as another technician was helping in the clinical services room, drawing up more shots.       I asked the patient how she was feeling, and what she was feeling.  She said she did not feel well, that her finger tips were numb, and she had this incredible pounding in the back of her head, and she ran her hand over the lower back part of her head and neck.  She looked down and I asked her again how she was doing, she said not well, that she was beginning to get light headed and was looking a little pale.  I called to the pharmacy team for help, to clear out the clinical services room and asked the technician to help me slowly walk her to the room.  As we got her in the room I asked her if she would be ok to lay down on the floor and put her feet up in a chair, briefly explaining that this would help with the dizziness and keep her safe should she faint, because she would already be on the floor. another technician popped in and asked her if she could get her a cold cloth for her forehead, Patient said yes and the technician did so. an employee was working at the computer and just quietly stayed working (for another store).  I moved around him and got the Blood Pressure Machine.  I asked the patient if it would be ok it I monitored her blood pressure, she said yes. Patient was always 100% coherent and helped move her arm for me. I asked the employee for a piece of paper to document the reading, but the technician ran and got me one.  Her first set of vitals were high.  I marked them down and the employee told me the time.  I just sat on my knees next to the patient for a while and tried to comfort her. I asked her a couple of times if she felt any change, and she said yes,     Shot given 2:40pm     2:45pm BP 149/99 Pulse 71   SX:  fingers numb, pounding in the back of her head  cool cloth placed on forehead  calmed area down &amp; quietly talked to the patient to determine how she was doing  ************************************************  (Patient volunteered that she had just gotten tested for COVID-19 and that she tested negative.) I asked patient how she was feeling and she said that she was feeling a little worse.  She said she was starting to get the shakes.  I asked her if she had gotten anything to eat on her lunch and she said no. I asked her if she felt like it and if her BP was good, how would she like a sip of juice.      ********************************************     I asked the patient how she was feeling and she stated that her tight felt ever so slightly tight, but she said &#34;I am asthmatic, and it did not feel any different than what she had experienced before.   I took her BP/P again...  2:55pm BP 157/105 Pulse 68  I looked at the employee and he looked at me, and I told the patient that I would be right back.  I quickly went and consulted with the technician and we decided that we should call 911 due to the increased in BP, pulse lower and the change in symptoms.  The technician called 611 and talked to an employee and I called 911 and explained what was going on and what our need was.  (The technician and I quickly discussed that neither of us felt that she was having an allergic reaction, just an adverse reaction, Epi was not called for. ) Employee stated that the clinic recommended we give her Benadryl.  I did a fast check w/ the technician, it was not on our standing order/ protocol. Antihistamines can exacerbate asthma.) Then I went back to the patient.  By the time I had gotten off the phone with 911, 2 more employees were in the room, and the patient was just getting off the phone with her father.  Once I got positioned in the room, one employee left,  I asked one employee sit down in a chair and the other employee was by the door leading to the pharmacy.  I told the patient that we had called for an ambulance.  I briefly explained due to her BP/P and her symptoms changing.  I asked her if she wanted another cool cloth and she said yes.  I asked an employee to get one for her from the sink in the pharmacy.  I was again kneeling at her side.  I saw her eyes well up with tears and a few tears were running down her face.  I asked another employee to get me a paper towel, which he did, and I handed it to the patient.  I tried to reassure her that things would be ok and this was just to ensure that she was safe.  She stated that she felt a little nauseated.  I then took her BP/P again.  3:05PM  BP 146/99 P 66 2 employees and I remained with the patient, all calm and I made sure she knew we were there for her.  I am not sure the time the EMTs arrived, but another employee let us know and we opened the door to let them in.  They asked the patient a lot of questions and I gave them my sheet of what I had recorded for her blood pressure and pulse (BP/P).  They asked the patient if they would help her into a sitting position, she said yes, but it was an awkward position, so I asked the patient if it would be ok if I helped support her back, she said yes, and I did just that.  I stayed with the patient until they got her situated on the gurney and I helped cover up her legs.  I went back to work when the EMT&#39;s wheeled the patient away.     The BP/P is the best of my recollection, as the EMT&#39;s took my sheet of paper.     At no time did the patient ever exhibit difficulty breathing, labored breathing or any change in her breathing.  She was calm and her chief complaint was the numbness in her fingers and the pounding headache at the back of her head.

We did keep patient in the pharmacy for 30 minutes monitoring. Did tell patient to go to her primary doctor to discuss whether she should receive the second dose and if she may need to pre-medicate.

I got bloodwork done on 3/26 and my thyroid antibodies (TPO) were in the 270s (higher than I have ever seen). I got the TPO retested on 4/7 to see if they had come down any, and they were even higher, in the 350s. I still have increased symptoms of hashimotos thyroiditis including headache, exhaustion, and swollen/pressure feeling in my throat today 4/12.

                                                Saturday April 10th at 5 pm: Back pain in the thoracic area, pain when breathing, breathing was short, pain when taking deep breaths. Monday 12th at 2 am: abdominal pain and bloating: pain similar to gastritis around the Cardia or diaphragm area. Pain in my intestines as I feel my digestion move, probably the large intestine. Pain in my back, in the lumbar area related to the abdominal pain.  All pain was manageable. I didn&#39;t go to the doctor.

After a few minutes she started coughing and having difficulty breathing and felt as if her throat was starting to close up. Her sister urged her to come back to the pharmacy. We had her come sit in the counseling room and have her tell us what was happening. Since her chest and throat felt tight and she she was having breathing issues we gave her a dose of epinephrine and called 911. She did state her breathing got easier after the epipen was administered. At no time did she lose consciousness or the ability to speak. She did go with EMS to the ER for observation.

                                                About two hours after my second shot, I started feeling tingling in my legs.  Within half an hour, the tingling spread to my arms and face and my lips and tongue started to swell and my throat felt like it was closing.  I called 911, and they gave me an epipen, shot of steroids, and a shot of benadryl and said I went into anaphylaxis shock.  I was released from the hospital Friday night, but on Monday night I had another (milder) allergic reaction and the following day began to have shortness of breath.  I went to my doctor&#39;s on Tuesday, who prescribed me steroids and histamine blockers.  I began taking them but on Wednesday my difficulty breathing increased and it got to the point where I had difficultly swallowing and couldn&#39;t eat so I went to the ER again.  I have had some sort of rash and hives every day since my second shot, which my doctor says is a continuing allergic reaction from the shot.  I am going to see an allergist, but I have no history of allergies or allergic reactions to vaccines.

                                                Day 2 after the 1st dosage of the Covid 19 vaccine (Moderna) I noticed that I had a slight cough. I was not feeling ill. Other than the tiredness. The cough would come and go. It was in no sense persistent. Day 3 after the vaccine, my cough returned in morning, around 10:00AM. I was no longer feeling any of the described side effects but this cough was now noticeable. It went away in the afternoon, around 2:00pm. It returned at night, briefly before bed time at around 11:00pm. Day 4 the cough was all day. On and off. If I got excited and if I moved around too much it felt like an asthma cough. I would then feel uncomfortable in my breathing. It persisted all day. At night I could not lay down to sleep. I needed to be propped up. I needed to use my Alvesco inhaler. Day 5, In the morning the cough was not immediate, I used an air purifier the entire night and day. Used the Inhaler again. My breathing felt unconformable but it was not as bad as day 4. Day 6, the cough was gone. Only when going up stairs or moving around too much did it come back for a few mins then would go away. Inhaler used again at night. No air purifier. Am able to sleep laying down again. Day 7 I am feeling better now and no longer have discomfort breathing. No longer need inhaler.

                                                Day 1: Woke up at 5:30 am achy and tired. Hungry. Obtained food. Was going okay. Arm was expectedly sore. A couple hours later chills set in, aching, joint pain, and fatigue increased. Occasionally had a running nose, pain in abdomen when bending over like knife being drawn in a line across my hips. by 4:00 pm, so achy, tired, and nauseous. Terrible chills, followed by occasional hot flashes. No fever anytime it was taken. Could not do more than lay on floor and turn a quart of the way over. By 8:00 pm, symptoms start to ease. Am able to walk again. Back to chills/hot flashes, aches, joint pain, fatigue, runny nose, and shortness of breath. Day 2: Wake at 6 am feeling achy like my whole body had been tensed for a day, was awake off and on during the night with hot flashes/chills and body pain. Went through the day achy and fatigued, with no temperature control. Started feeling worse around 5 pm, but tolerable. Still short of breath. Day 3: Wake at 3:50 am with horrible aching in lymph nodes from armpits up through neck. Still rapidly rotating from chills to hot flashes. Do not sleep until 6 am. Get up at 7:30. Go through day mostly fatigued and a little achy. Had chills/hot flashes till approximately 11 am. Around 2 am aching in neck started to set in and increased throughout evening to the time of this report. Neck is so still and sore I can barely turn my head.

She has Biphasic delayed protracted anaphylaxis as a result of multi drug allergy syndrome and her symptoms were consistent with that in this case as she has had this kind of on going response to other anaphylaxis events in the past.  She had severe joint pain for more than 2 weeks and has ongoing recurrent hives on the injection site that have not completely subsided yet.  She developed additional allergic responses and ultimately ended up in the ER after this and was seen by local allergist who advised DO NOT take next shot/vaccination.

I still have fatigue and muscle weakness chest tightness and a swollen face after 22 days.

                                                My entire upper body began breaking out in a hives like rash. My skin began to burn and my breathing became difficult. It was a true allergic reaction, my injection site was hot to the touch for hours. My skin did turn a little purple once in the hospital and I?ve missed two days of work looking like three due to this reaction to the vaccine.

                                                Exactly 2 weeks after having the second moderna COVID vaccine, the patient developed acute chest pain and shortness of breath. She was evaluated in the ER. Negative troponins, normal EKG, negative CT angio PE. She followed up with a cardiologist. Echocardiogram was normal. She was treated for presumed pericarditis with colchicine and NSAIDS with no improvement in symptoms. She had very severe chest pain and shortness of breath at times to the point that it was difficult to breathe and do light exertion. There was a second ER visit a month later for the same symptoms negative for acute MI/ heart failure. Cardiac event monitor showed many PVCs and there is slight symptom improvement with metoprolol but she is still symptomatic to some degree 2.5 months later. She is following up with general cardiology and electophysiology. There was also a TSH elevation at the time that symptoms started. This resolved upon recheck about 6 weeks later with no change in levothyroxine dose and a thyroid ultrasound was normal.

So I did today and got it done. Within few minutes of getting it administered, I developed a rash on my left arm (injection site), my heart began to beat rapidly, &amp; I was experiencing shortness of breathe. They asked me to stay an additional 15-30 minutes and so I did until I felt a little better to leave.  I called my sister, considering we received our first dose on the same day but different place and she questioned why I got mines early and I explained that?s what my card said.  We hung up and I did some additional research, went on the CDC website and saw I was to get my second dose 28 days from my first dose and today made 21 days!   Same administrator the first time gave me my second dose today. She failed to correctly time my dose and didn?t not double check it was correct.  I never knew about the timing until today and as a healthcare professional, she should have known considering she would have been properly trained and now I?m experiencing difficulty breathing, chest pains, &amp; heart beat feels off!

Within 5 minutes of waking up I got dizzy, felt like I had to throw up, my heart felt weird and my lips were going numb. I fell and blacked out for a few seconds. I fell so hard I scraped my knees really bad. After that I went back inside and fell on the couch because it was difficult to breath for about 5 minutes. I ended up falling back asleep for about 4 hours. And during all this my head was pounding like crazy and my vision was kind of blurry.

After 30 minutes I was feeling my tongue becoming bigger.  The same day I started having problems with my heart. My pulses are super high even when I am laying on bed and I have a chest pain. My cardiologist Dr. at Hospital has ordered a lot of tests but he still doesn&#39;t know what the heart muscle reacts like that. I have put Holter, I have done stress treatmill, many blood tests while I have scheduled the table exam and an exam to test my lungs because after the vaccine I have a big difficulty in breathing.

                                                After receiving the shot on my upper left arm near the shoulder, I had a severe allergic reaction. After 2 hours, a painful rash formed around the injection site and the other parts of the upper arm. I still have markings left from the rash. After 4 hours I was feeling nauseous and dizzy to the point I decided to just lay down and rest. I woke up from the nap as the symptoms worsen and threw up multiple times. About 11 hours after the injection, I was having trouble with breathing and it gradually worsened. I tried breathing by doing heavy breathing for two hours. As I felt like dying from suffocation, my partner decided to call 911 and also called the emergency room nearby to speak to the nurse.  We are informed that this is a serious reaction and I needed to be treated ASAP. I took an antihistamine as recommended by a paramedic and the emergency room nurse. I was able to breathe normally after 30 minutes. The day after, I couldn&#39;t breathe in deep since my lung felt as it was bruised from heavy breathing. As of now, I still have some marks from the rash, and muscle tension/sore on my left armpit.

                                                SO the following day I was extremely tired and nauseous. I was shaky didn&#39;t have much of an appetite either. Those symptoms lasted for about two days, I was also a little bit out of breath and I thought at the time that it was just my asthma flaring up. On Sunday I contacted the employee health and talked to them about it and they told me it was &#34;normal&#34;. I saw them in the beginning of February, I couldn&#39;t walk 50 steps in my living room without my chest getting really tight, they said not to worry about it and that it was &#34;normal&#34;. My Oxygen levels were also going low like 91/92 for my blood oxygen levels. My pulse would go up to 102 at the lowest and jump up to 160/170 just to walk from my couch to my kitchen. That and the oxygen dropping lasted for 2 to 2.5 weeks. I also got a Covid test and that was negative.

                                                Patient requesting walk-in COVID-19 vaccine. Patient reported history of anaphylaxis to shellfish and iodine products during pre-vaccine screening and was told she would be observed for 30 minutes post vaccine, per protocol. Patient verbalized understanding. Vaccine administered. Patient observed for adverse reactions and verbally asked by nurse how she was feeling. Patient stated she was fine.  Approximately 15 minutes after vaccine was administered, patient requested some water, which she was given.  Nurse asked how she was feeling. Patient reported &#34;It feels like I have something stuck in my throat.&#34; Sensation did not resolve with sips of water, nurse instructed clerk to call 911. Emergency cart was brought next to patient. Nurse drew up Epi. Patient was not in distress and continued to breathe unlabored. Nurse took patient&#39;s vital signs: heart beat was strong, steady, and a normal rate. BP was slightly elevated. Nurse uncertain whether clinical picture was consistent with anaphylaxis. Patient continued to breathe unlabored and stated throat felt the same: no better, no worse. Nurse called Clinic Nurse Supervisor by phone. Nurse Supervisor stated ?don?t give Epi unless you have to.? Nurse drew up IM Benadryl. Nurse used flashlight to look into patient?s throat and saw swelling. Nurse quickly explained to patient that this did appear to be mild anaphylaxis and that she did need the medications. Nurse administered Epi and then IM Benadryl, both to L thigh. EMS arrived shortly after and assessed patient. Vitals continued to be stable. Patient was transported to hospital.   Nurse called patient today (2 days post event). Patient reports is now doing fine. Patient reports at hospital she developed &#34;itchy rash&#34; on her neck. Patient was given additional dose of Benadryl prior to being discharged.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

                                                During the first 15 minutes after the vaccine I started feeling cold, light headed and slowed body functions. A half hour after I started feeling breathing difficulty. Shortly after I felt swelling in my throat. I then started having anxiety and laid down. This lasted for about a half hour to hour then stopped once I started having diahrea. I then continued feeling chilled, nauseated and fatigued. The following day I didn&#39;t do much activity. Had arm pain, chills the first part of the day and some feelings of nausea, fatigue, weakness and continued diahrea. I felt dehydrated and was drinking fluids. Sunday 1/10 still felt weak with little energy but was able to go to the grocery store. Monday 1/11 I attempted to work but felt light headed and weak with activity and continued to have diahrea. Went home from work early and took today 1/12 off from work. Today my throat is sore and feels inflamed and I continue to feel lethargic but not as dehydrated or fuzzy headed. I notified my PCP Dr. and the physician I work with Dr. Dr. expressed concern about me getting the second vaccine and encouraged me to report my experience for further guidance. Dr. thinks it could be possible for me to get the second dose with allergy meds and an epipen just in case. I have never reacted to a vaccine in the past and have never required an epipen. Guidance would be appreciated. I&#39;m supposed to receive my second dose on 2/5/21.

                                                At about 0130 on 01/13/21, I woke up not feeling well (I had also not been sleeping well prior due to arm pain and minor aches). I became extremely dizzy and lightheaded feeling like passing out, I was tachycardic, had increased respirations, pale (per my husband), felt hot and cold, and was sweating. I also became very anxious. I had to go lay on the bathroom floor - my husband woke up with me and got me some water, Ibuprofen, and a cool rag for my head. He also said I wasn&#39;t sleeping well - moving around and making noises before then. I laid on the floor about 15 minutes until the symptoms had improved, but still didn&#39;t feel well.  No further episodes at this time. Only other issues are the continued expected possible side effects (arm pain, body aches). I did notify our Nurse Manager this morning as well.

At around 9PM, the patient took diphenhydramine 50mg x 1 and acetaminophen 1000mg x1. The patient then laid down for the evening and awoke around 10 AM feeling much better.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

Worse when lying down and almost felt short of breath. The heart palpitations continued until Monday night and Tuesday I woke up and palpitations resolved. I have only ever had this reaction one other time when had the Mirena. Symptoms resolved after having it removed but wasn?t sure what ingredients caused it. Now I believe there may be a common ingredient.

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

                                                Awakened with L superolateral chest pain radiating to L inframammary region in anterior axillary line on post-vaccination  day 3 (Moderna dose #2).  Pt presented for care on post-vaccination day 4.  Pleuritic chest pain, 4-5/10, accompanied by lightheadedness and dyspnea on exertion.  Chest wall locally tender, but pt also on ocp and with positive D-dimer and mildly elevated BNP, so chest CT angio obtained to evaluate for PE.  Symptoms ongoing at time of discharge but treated with OTC analgesics. ***Concern here is (as noted in CT read) raised by interpreting radiologist not just for this patient, but for women with chest wall adenopathy in addition to axillary lymphadenopathy may be difficult to distinguish from malignancy on screening mammography and may lead to increased numbers of biopsies following this screening study if done within a few weeks of COVID-19 vaccination.

                                                -Initially I had moderate side effects to my 2nd shot, shortness of breath/increase of asthma symptoms, severe joint pain, flu-like symptoms (slight fever, chills, loss of appetite, inability to sleep) lasting for a total of 4 days. I have anaphylaxis to Walnuts (2x needed epipen and hospitalization) and asthma, many seasonal allergies, and am highly biologically sensitive (have broken out in hives several times),  -8 days later I traveled to a high altitude location (Aspen, CO), and had 4 glasses of wine over a 8 hour period. For the next two days I skiied for 5 hours, going up to 12,500 ft in altitude. On the first morning after arrival I started feeling badly, with symptoms including dizziness, asthma symptoms (unusual for me as it is only exercise-induced), a headache in the front of my head, and a slight redness in my left eye. As the days increase my symptoms increased to the point of inability to leave the house. After 3 days I received an IV, oxygen, that did not help. On day 4 I went to the hospital after a virtual appointment with a clinician and had chest xrays taken as Hospital (never received the results) and was put on Diamox 250MG 2x/day, this helped slightly. Day 6 I left and traveled back to CT at low altitude, my symptoms did not improve immediately and got worse (eyes became significantly more red by this point), asthma and dizziness increased). Two days after arriving home I went to two doctors who misdiagnosed me with a sinus infection, water in my middle left year and left lung, and conjunctivitis. I was given antibiotic eyedrops that had no improvement for 36 hours. Upon receiving a 1mg cortisone shot these symptoms improved, I was also given 500MG of a Z-pack type antibiotic 1x day/4 days. I went to my PCP, doctor who was able to accurately diagnose my symptoms as an immune response to being unable to acclimatize due to my moderate immune response to the 2nd shot. My body went through significant inflammation. He treated me with Prednisone and continued my antibiotic.

                                                Itching all over the body started about 2 hours after receiving the vaccine ( around 11:30am). At noon, I noticed I was dizzy and weak, and I couldn&#39;t stand up without holding onto something. The itching got worse as the day went on and became intense and painful around 3pm. At that time, I noticed a rash on both arms, my legs and my chest, so I took 25mg of hydroxyzine (prescribed by my doctor) which has been helpful in the past for itching and rashes. Around 7pm, I had hives on my arms and legs, and the itching was getting worse and more painful. I also had intense itching on my face, especially on/around my nose. I took another 25mg of hydroxyzine but the itching wasn&#39;t subsiding and at that point, it was so bad that I couldn&#39;t focus on anything else. At 9pm, I still had hives and itching but also noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and it felt as though my throat was closing up. This continued throughout the night, with it being at its worst between 1-3am on March 12th. I woke up and the rash was gone, but the itchiness is still present and I&#39;m having trouble breathing. I keep choking and gasping for air.

                                                It was 7 mins after the shot, I started feeling my throat closing up, like a golf ball. they gave me an epi pen it helped a little bit but went to the ER. When the epi wore off I was having issues, I had it again 4-5 times. I had a hard time getting air in and out. I was admitted to the ICU for an Epi drip. The stayed over night and they winged me off the Epi and sent me home.  I was home for a couple days, and in my kitchen not doing anything I felt like my air way was closing, my husband gave me Epi pen and took me to the ER. They have more IM Epi  (3x) and steroids and Benadryl.  I had  a CT of my brain because I had the worst headache and it came back ok. I was there for 6-8 hours and it cleared up after 3 doses of Epi.  A week after I was eating in the Cafeteria, my throat started to itch and took the Epi pen and gave myself a dose and took Benadryl, it did not get better. I ended up really struggling to catch my breath, I went down to the ER and they gave me another Epi and started Epi drip- I went again to the ICU for the night, more Epi, steroids and Benadryl. By the morning I felt a lot better and went home.  I have seen my PCP and waiting to see my Allergist.  Randomly I have just been getting rashes, my face, cheeks and nose, patchy rashes that will come and go.

                                                I have asthma that is primarily seasonal or exercise- induced.  About 2 days after the vaccination,  I experienced asthma symptoms that lasted for about 5 days. This was not related to exercise, humidity,  or seasonal allergies- I woke up struggling to breathe on day 3 after the vaccine.  I had shortness of breath,  wheezing,  resulting lightheadedness, and some dry coughing. Symptoms were worst first thing in the morning and at night. I am still experiencing some lingering difficulty breathing 10 days out from the vaccine, but no wheezing.   It is very likely that I had COVID-19 in early February 2020, before testing was available in the here (My coworker returned from abroad very ill; another coworker and I became sick shortly after,  and she lost her sense of taste and smell. I experienced low grade fever,  intense nausea,  diarrhea,  shortness of breath,  and extreme fatigue.  The fatigue lasted for about one month.) Following this illness,  I saw a sharp increase in my asthma symptoms for about 6-7 months,  which gradually tapered off. Again, there was no other trigger for these symptoms such as exercise or humidity. It seems likely that I contracted COVID-19, which damaged my lungs in some way,  and that the vaccine has resulted in irritating or &#34;re-activating&#34; that damage at a lesser intensity.

Wasn&#39;t sure if related to exercise-induced bronchospasm which I&#39;ve never been diagnosed with or Covid (healthcare worker) so I went to my PCP for a Covid test and to check my lungs.  Was given a prescription for rescue albuterol inhaler which did make the shortness of breath subside.  Used it every 4 hours for the rest of the day and the following day and have no had another occurrence.  Have exercised many times since and have not had to use the inhaler before or after exercise.

                                                I began having very mild tachycardia and occasional shortness of breath after I had Covid 19 in the middle of December. My symptoms were very mild and did not require a doctors visit. I improved and went to get my first covid vaccine on 1/26/21. I started noticing some more mild tachycardia and shortness of breath a few days after my vaccine but I assumed I was just out of shape from not working out &amp; being sick. I got my second vaccine on 2/26/21 and began having more severe tachycardia and shortness of breath with lightheadedness a few days later. I went to the ED March 12th due to heart rate in 160s at rest, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. I saw the cardiologist March 18 and was told I most likely have myocarditis. No treatment other than rest and no exercise. I began feeling back to normal again around the week of April 12.

I don&#39;t have a better description. I went into work (graveshift) because I felt alright, but by about 1am I felt like I was getting sick, the chills and slight nausea I was expecting. The soreness in my chest I was not. I&#39;ve been progressively worse each day being congested, in my sinuses as well as my lungs, Mucinex has helped some. It&#39;s Monday and I still can&#39;t breathe right, taste anything or go more than 20 minutes without my box of tissues.

                                                29 Jan 2021 9am - received first dose of Moderna 12:30pm - diarrhea  8pm - started to not feel well 9pm - feeling cold and shaky 10pm - Feeling very tired, ready to sleep 11pm - throws up about 10 times, more diarrhea  11:30pm - drinks some water and throws it up immediately. Continues throwing up but it turns into dry heaving.  11:45pm - starts to experience Acidosis or Metabolic Acidosis. Muscles cramp so much it?s hard to walk, talk or write. At this point I?m worried about dehydration. Breathing becomes short and heavy.  30 Jan 2021 Midnight - arrives at the ER 12:30am - my heart rate is 150. I have a low grade fever at around 100 degrees F.  1 am - 3am - 3 different nurses try to stick me with an IV but my veins are so small they were unsuccessful. They ended up giving me a pill for nausea and encourage me to take small sips of water and eat some crackers. During this time I calm down enough so my heart rate lowers back down into the 90s and muscle cramping subsides. My bloodwork came back normal so no infections. 3:30am - discharged from ER 4am - falls asleep 3pm - wakes up feeling much better but still feel exhausted from the rough night

                                                The evening on the day of my second vaccination I experienced mild side effects of body aches and fatigue. The following morning this was accompanied by a fever of 101 F and severe sharp chest pain. The chest pain lasted for several minutes at a time on and off throughout the day. When the chest pain was at its worst I also had shortness of breath and what felt like a fluttery heart beat and the pain radiated to my sternum and rib areas. The pain was severe enough that I could not sit or stand upright during these episodes, I cried, and asked not to be left alone in case something happened to me. It felt like sharp, knife-like pain not dull aching pain. Body aches and chills also continued throughout the entire day and evening. I used heat and cold packs, baths, and took Tylenol starting in the afternoon and again in the evening to help cope.

                                                Dose 1 was given on 1/9/21.  Dose 2 was given on 2/6/21 Lot #042L20A. 12 hours after receiving the 2nd dose I had chills, and had a fever that reached 103 degrees.  I was very tired &amp; had body aches.  The symptoms stopped approximately  24 hours later.   The morning of 6/29/21 at approximately 5:30 am, as I was getting ready for work, my upper body became numb &amp; collapsed.  I began coughing &amp; coughed up frank blood.  I was lethargic &amp; having difficulty keeping my eyes open, and chest pain on my right side.  I was transported to  Hospital via ambulance.    My troponin levels were elevated &amp; after a Chest CT, they found a lung nodule on my upper right lung.  I was diagnosed with myocarditis &amp; the lung nodule.  I was hospitalized &amp; had an echocardiogram the next day.  After being discharged home, I felt normal, other than some pain in my chest when I would cough or sneeze.   On July 7th, my chest pain became worse.  I was unable to contact my PCP, therefore I went back to the ER.  My troponin levels were normal &amp; was given tramadol and a lidocaine patch for the pain.  Since then I have had a &#34;dull&#34; pain in my right chest, however I have not had to take any medications for this.

She did not premedicate for covid vaccine. Approximately 20 minutes after her vaccination, she was observed in the post vaccine waiting area and  stated that she was a bit dizzy and tickling in her throat.  In addition, she had an itchy rash on her left forearm, the side in which her vaccine was given. She was escorted to the nearest exam room.  There, she began to have nearly non-stop coughing to the point of gagging.  She was given epi 0.3mg im with some improvement of symptoms. Continuous monitoring showed oxygen sats in the upper 90s, BP was in the 150s systolically. She was given 50 mg of Benadryl orally.  At that point, patient was taken to the procedure room via wheelchair.  After approximately 30 minutes, the ticking sensation in the throat returned and patient was having more difficulty breathing.  Another epi 0.3mg im  was given, along with pecid 40 mg po.  125 mg of Solumedrol was given IV, with saline lock left in place.  After 20 minutes, patient again was having difficulty.

                                                At 7:10am yesterday 1/7/21 I received the covid vaccine. Immediately my lips went numb, and my left arm and hand went numb. I waited at the hospital for 15 minutes and then attempted to drive home. I got about 2 blocks away and noticed my face was numb all the way from my chin to my nose. I went back into work into employee health and let them know. They called the pharmacist who instructed me to go to the ER. While walking to the ER I began to have difficulty breathing, and throat tightness. They called a rapid response alert and I was taken on a stretcher to the ER. I felt dizzy, nauseous and the numbness to my face was from my mid neck up to the top of my hairline at the top of my face. My left hand and arm were still numb. When they took my vitals I was hypertensive BP approximately 155/86, I was also tachycardia HR 104-110. EKG was abnormal-sinus tachycardia HR 104, and probable left atrial enlargement. I began to have severe chills/shaking for approximately 1 hour. I was given 1 liter of normal saline IV, Benadryl 25mg IV, and Zofran 4mg IV. After inspection by the doctor my throat was not swollen, or closing so an epi pen was not administered. My oxygen saturation remained above 91%. After 3 hours of being monitored in the ER my numbness to my face started to improve so I was discharged home. Labs were taken in the ER and my potassium was 3.1, calcium was 8.1. The day prior at my primary care doctors office labs were taken and all my labs were normal including my potassium and calcium. My primary care physician believes the low electrolytes the day of the reaction were due to the reaction to the vaccine. I also had a repeat EKG today (1/8/21) the day after the reaction at my primary cares office and it was normal sinus rhythm with no abnormalities. Vitals were all within normal limits. Today (1/8/21) approximately 36 hours after the vaccine administration I have mild numbness to my face as well as moderate body aches. My primary care physician believes I should not have the second dose of the covid vaccine as she fears I would have a anaphalactic reaction.

                                                Symptoms started to occur roughly an hour and a half after the injection. Symptoms included tingling of pins and needles throughout my body. A weird overwhelming feeling that something was wrong with my body but I did not know what and that my body was going to shut down. I would go through phases where my body would get overwhelmed flushed and hot and I would be confused or dazed in that moment until it passed. I started to have vision problems in my right eye with it going blurry and pain behind my left eye almost as if it was swollen. It felt like there was something in the back of my thought and I had to cough to get it out and it felt like that my bottom lip was swollen. When I got to the ER because I did not know what was going on when waiting in the waiting room my symptoms worsened. In the ER lobby I started having issues with my speech with not being able to say what I wanted to say and repeating the somethings over and over again. The tingling starting going into my throat, neck, and head area and I started getting sharp pain in my head. When everything started to intensify the knot in my throat got worse and I started coughing more. Before I knew it I was unable to swallow, I was unable to breath, it felt like my throat was closing shut and I had to tell medical staff due to still being in the ER lobbing and not having any type of medication. I felt like I was going to pass out and was seeing flying dots due to having a hard time breathing, it felt like I was going to choke on my tongue and my throat was completely impeded.   After being taken back in the ER they provided me with the following medications. diphenhydraAMINE 50 MG/ML, dexAMETHasone sodium phos, famotidine 20 mg/2 mL ink, EPINEPHrine 1 mg/mL. 1 mL inj. And was monitored until my vitals were stable to go home.

My pulse and blood pressure went up. I got dizzy and lightheaded. Maybe 5-7 minutes after the onset, it started to get better on its own. No medicine was given. The paramedic did an ekg which was normal. My blood pressure and pulse also went back to normal.  My oxygen level was normal. Later that evening and the following day, the only noticeable difference was extreme fatigue and a headache. I was dizzy and lightheaded for a few hours after.

                                                About 30-40 min after getting shot my breathing felt weird. It felt like I was breathing in hot scratchy air through my nose and throat.  I felt like my breathing was abnormal and it felt like I was possibly going to start wheezing. I became worried I was having an airway reaction and would need to go to the hospital but I did not end up needing to. The breathing issue did seem to resolve after 15-20 min even though my throat remained scratchy feeling that day. I have had panic attacks before and extreme anxiety and have never experienced any sort of airway reaction before. I am concerned I had a mild allergic reaction and am worried about getting the next shot. I did have Zyrtec in my system so I don?t know if that ha d any affect or not.

I had a headache. A couple hours after vaccine I was told I was exposed to COVID. Got tested on 31st - I tested positive for COVID. Got shortness of breath, the bad muscle ache, the loss of smell and taste; coughing, sore throat, headache; fever. I still have headaches and I still have some congestion sometimes. It is getting better but my sense of smell and taste aren&#39;t back. Fever, shortness of breath, cough etc lasted 10 days. I was out of work for two weeks. Called the doctor  (January 4th, 2021)- for Oxygen levels - were dropping - they were in the high 80&#39;s - the doctor let me stay home and monitor on my own as I have a nebulizer and inhaler at home.

                                                Pt received shot at 3:30 pm on 2/17/21  and was sitting in the 15 minute observation area when she expressed that she was having a tightness across her chest and was having difficulty breathing.  After speaking with the patient I learned she had a ventolin  inhaler and asked her to use it.  I told her to stay for another 10 min to be watched and assess if she needed further care.  After 5 min she expressed that she was not improving.  The decision was made to call 911 so that she could evaluated.  Paramedics arrived and evaluated her, and decided to transport  her to Kaiser hospital as they said they &#34;couldn&#39;t rule anything out in the field&#34;.

After about 20 minutes, I couldn&#39;t feel the left side of my face and the left side of my body was like with you go to the dentist and have lidocaine.  The next day I felt like I had been hit by a mack truck. I felt like that until about January 6, 2021. I also had SOB, joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue and body aches, sore arm and redness at the injection site.

Fatigue and headache present by 3:00 PM on 3/3/21. Began hydrating with water and Gatorade at this time. Muscle pain and join soreness present from right shoulder to right hand by 4:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and stiffness in fingers of right hand by 5:00 PM on 3/3/21. Mild congestion, brain fog by 6:00 PM on 3/3/21. Any contact between right arm and other objects or surfaces caused significant pain by 8:00 PM on 3/3/21. Took 800 mg ibuprofin to alleviate pain (pre-existing tolerance to NSAIDs necessitates higher than normal dosages). Swelling of the right arm and hand identified by 9:00 PM on 3/3/21. Swelling was most significant in the hand, and accompanied worsening joint pain and stiffness in the fingers. Applied a cold pack to address swelling (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off). Could not identify these specific side effects in the information available online, took a Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Swelling decreased overnight and was gone by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21. Diarrhea began at 6:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Will continue to hydrate with water and Gatorade. At the time of this report, pain in right arm still present from shoulder to wrist and entire arm is tender to the touch, but pain level has lessened. Pain and stiffness in right side of neck present by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Lymph nodes in right underarm swollen by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and swelling is still present at the time of this report. Will continue with regimen of ibuprofin as needed.  * I am recovering fine at home, but I wanted to log these side effects for data collection purposes. I couldn&#39;t find any information about these side effects online and that really freaked me out, so I hope that writing this report will help people in a similar situation.

                                                Symptoms from vaccine did not start until Day 5. I woke up at 0900 with a sore arm, nausea, headache, generalized aches, chills. By that evening (unsure of time), started with my usual asthma flare-up symptoms. These include, soreness of breath, chest tightness and pain, wheezing. I started treatment at home with q4h DuoNeb breathing treatments and a decreasing prednisone prescription.  This treatment did not work so I followed up with my pulmonologist and his PA-C for a follow-up. They made the decision that this flare up was caused &#34;by my immune response to the covid vaccine.&#34;

                                                Shortly after vaccination, patient started experiencing shortness of breath, closure of airway, itchy/scratchy throat and lips. The first dose of Epipen was given at 10:42AM after symptoms began to progress. EMS arrived at 10:50AM to check out the patient. Patient&#39;s SpO2 was &gt;98%, and patient refused to go with EMS personnel. As soon as EMS left, patient began experiencing the same allergic reaction symptoms again so a 2nd dose of EpiPen was given at 10:57AM. The patient&#39;s friend then walked out of the store after the patient began feeling better and stated she would take the patient to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

                                                Two days after the injection I had a series of bumps that looked like bug bites all over both of my arms and even onto my fingers. They were itchy and I applied topical antihistamines and also had (1) 24 hr over-the-counter antihistamine.  Now, exactly one week later, I am having difficulty breathing. It feels like someone jumped on my chest. This pain started around noon and is still continuing now (7:00 PM). When I turn my head to the right, it seems to get worse; I have pain also in my neck and down my spine until equivalent to my chest.

                                                On 4/8 the expected flu like symptoms began. On 4/9 around 10am my back and chest hurt. Around 12pm on 4/8 I had severe nerve like pain in my neck, back, chest that was radiating throughout my arms and body. I went to the ER they did an EKG, X-ray, blood test, contrasted CT scan to rule out blood clots. My blood pressure and pulse and respiratory were all high. I was given morphine, toradol and a steroid through IV to control the pain. The pain caused me to feel immobile due to the more I moved the more it hurt. I was discharged after no life threatening issues were found even still with an elevated bp and pulse. The doctor did say he was concerned of the pain radiating but was unable to state from what. I was sent home with morphine pills (which I have no taken any as we are in a large opioid pandemic as well and I am a clinical therapist). I could not sleep when I returned home. I had to sit straight up. I took Tylenol and it relieved the pain slightly. On 4/10 I attempted a car ride to get out of the house. Shortly after leaving my house my face became bright red, I couldn?t breathe well, I felt extremely hot and the pain was no radiating down my legs. I went to the pharmacy that gave me the shot as they have a clinic. My bp was 147/97 with a pulse of 116 and a fever now of 101.4 ( I havent had the fever until this point). They advised me to go back to the ER. Upon arriving to the ER for the second time in two days. Same test were given besides the CT.  I was given toradol by IV and saline again. The pain continues to radiate though my body. I can barely move. Again it is not muscle pain but nerve pain! I can barely move my neck or legs. The hospital discharged me again as administer a Covid test. The rapid was negative. These are symptoms from the shot there is  no coincidence. My wbc was 7.2 on 4/9 but 17.1 on 4/10

                                                Right after I got my shot, my tongue started swelling but that eased up a couple hours later. About two weeks after the shot, about 20 bruises of different color and severity appeared on my legs and then I broke out in a full body rash with hives and intense itch. The rash was all down my legs, under my arms, on my stomach and the back of my neck mostly. I felt a little short of breath for the few days I had the rash. My injection site also burned and itched through this reaction.

                                                About 30 minutes after the vaccine was administered, the skin on my throat started itching. About a minute later, my throat got right and it was hard to breathe. Just as I was about to safely pull over and administer my epi pen, the constriction eased. My chest remained tight, causing a cough for about 30 more minutes, and mt lips were slightly swollen for about that long as well.

                                                15 minutes post-vaccine: some dizziness, slight spots in vision; resolved before leaving clinic. I felt no abnormal anxiety prior or within the 15 minute wait time. 35 minutes post-vaccine, driving home: Dizziness returned, more pronounced visual disturbances, hand tremor, tachycardia, feeling disoriented, confused, extreme brain fog, racing thoughts, panicky. Throat started to swell but resolved itself in about 10 minutes.  1.5 hours post-vaccine: Mentally and emotionally overwhelmed with this unexpected reaction, couldn&#39;t keep eyes open due to extreme fatigue - took a nap. After 3 hour nap: Remaining dude effects were brain fog, fatigue, general feelings of confusion, some dizziness, not myself. Moderate insomnia despite the fatigue. Day after, 4/16: Upon waking, left arm (injection site) extremely sore and stiff, moderately swollen, warm to the touch.  4/16, around 6 PM: I found small, raised red bumps that weren&#39;t itchy on upper left chest, spreading down onto top of breasts. I watched as similar bumps but darker in color appeared on upper shins, knees, and halfway up thighs on both legs. Both legs and feet showed unusual discoloration presenting as purple/ruddy with splotches of normal skintone peaking through. The little red bumps next appeared spreading up the left side of my throat/left side of neck, on both forearms (top of right forearm is where I will most frequently find hives indicating a reaction), and just a few on right hand and on thumb and index finger. I started to experience unbearable itchiness and feeling of skin crawling all over, on areas with or without the little bumps. Throat felt tight and swallowing became slightly more difficult; I took 37.5 mg of Benadryl as precaution for my throat and to ease the itching.  4/20: Contacted my doctor&#39;s office about my reaction including in-depth details. 4/21: Advised not to get the second dose by a physician standing in for my PCP on leave, and told to report

                                                Immediately after injection (seconds after the band aid was placed on shot area), I started to see spots and felt faint, then I progressively felt like it was  getting harder and harder to breath, I felt like my throat was slowly closing in, the EMT gave me oxygen which helped, then I started to feel a numbing sensation start in my hands, work down my spine and then to my feet. My hands continued to get stiffer until they formed claw like shapes and completely stiffened, the EMT had a monitor on my finger to gauge my pulse and they said it was a shooting up and down. My body was sweating profusely. After 20 minutes I felt my hands loosen and my body started to return to normal. The ambulance checked me on site and offered me to go to hospital, but since I was feeling better by that point, so I declined. Once I was feeling better, they tried to take my sugar level, but could not draw any blood when pricking my finger (they assumed this was because all my blood rushed to my vital organs, so blood would be hard to draw/they said this was probably also why my limbs went numb). They told me that I  could possibly be allergic to the vaccine based on the reaction. I was driven home 30-40 minutes later, I felt a bit light headed in the car, but slept for the rest of the day. The following day I just felt very tired, which is probably to be expected after the first shot.

                                                Within  a couple hours of dose, I was feeling really awful as if I had the flu with a pounding headache, all of my body hurt, naseau as if I was going to vomit, and my arm was really hurting. It progressively got worse throughout the day with feeling hot and cold so I took an Extra Strength Tylenol in case of fever. I went to bed around 10 pm and woke up out of a dead sleep around 2 am feeling like I was having trouble breathing. All of my body hurt, I was freezing cold and shaking with chills, and really dizzy and my head was still pounding. My arm where the injection site was also felt like it was burning. I thought I would take a hot bath to ease the chills and go back to sleep, but when I got out my naseau was even worse, my head was really hurting, and I began getting really dizzy sitting on the floor. I called my roommate in and said, &#34;I think something&#39;s wrong. I&#39;m going to vomit or black out&#34; and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. I did black out and my roommate said I had what looked like three seizures and he called 911. I was shaking for several hours after that at the hospital.  It is now the same day, 4.27.2021, 9 am and I am home from the hospital. I still feel weak, dizzy and nauseaous and my entire body hurts.

Took a Pepcid then my Epi-pen around 1500, called 911 for ambulance. EMTs gave me 50mg of Benadryl through IV at 1530. Heartrate persisted above 140. At ER was given another Epi injection and Decadron at 1630. Heartrate very slowly decreased each hour following the second Epi; at 1730 it was consistently reading under 130bpm, at 1830 under 120bpm, at 1930 under 110bpm. Discharged around 2030, heartrate around 100bpm. Heart rate has been consistently under 100 at rest since I&#39;ve been home and then today (May 1) it&#39;s been consistently under 80 at rest.

Patient was monitored closely for other signs of trouble breathing but patient reported feeling better and stable. First responders arrived at the scene. First responders took patients vital signs. Patients blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen were all in normal range.

                                                Outcome: unexpected/unexplained death Had first dose Moderna Vaccine 3/31/21. She described body aches and mild fever ? ?like I had COVID again for a day? ? lasting about 36 hours, and then felt fine.  Had dose # 2 Moderna vaccine about 6:50 PM at Community vaccination site. She was driver, received left deltoid injection from Doctor. During observation period reported no symptoms, was happy and talkative with family and staff.  Family reports later that evening she did not feel well ? ?just not hungry? and wanting to lie down. Slept well, then woke up feeling better except for left arm achiness at injection site. Did not report redness, rash, or any difficulty breathing. Was talkative, walking around, took a shower, and was planning to drive to the grocery store later that day.  Mid morning ? maybe beginning about 11 AM, family said she went in and out of bathroom several times. She told them she had vomited three times and was feeling shaky. Her oral temperature was 101.3.   About 1:30 PM, she was in her room and called out for her mother. When family went into the room, she was shaking ?like she was having a seizure? and then her eyes rolled back and she fell to her side and stopped breathing. Family called 911 and started CPR. CPR was continued by EMT?s once they arrived, but they were not able to resuscitate her.

Had fever, arm ache, and weakness as expected on day after and the next day. Remained fatigued after normal vaccine response subsided.   For the next week, had severe brain fog and difficulty processing/remembering/communicating; dry eyes; facial swelling; extreme fatigue; difficulty breathing.  After first week, brain fog lessened and became able to have short conversations. Fatigue lessened but continues (difficulty walking more than ~0.25 miles, difficulty breathing, get tired going up stairs).

                                                I started having  a swollen throat after the vaccine later in the night I noticed it was more difficult to breathe I felt like I wasn&#39;t able to catch as much air. I wasn&#39;t able to do much. The next day, Sunday , it was even harder I couldn&#39;t walk It wasn&#39;t that my throat was closing up I just felt like something heavy was on my chest. On Monday I went to work and I could not walk even three ft. I went to the hospital I then followed up with my primary care. I was given an inhaler which I used for 2 days after which things began to return to normal. It was about a week total from the vaccine that I began to feel better.

I took some allergy meds and I was able to breathe and swallow easily so I wasn&#39;t too concerned. After 24 hours it was pretty much gone.

I went to the emergency room on Tuesday evening because my throat was starting to swell as well and I was worried I was having an allergic reaction. They said it was not an allergic reaction and gave me steroids. I was on steroids for 4 days. My body continues to be swollen. On  Saturday it started to feel a little harder to breathe, but still possible. On Sunday, most of the lymph nodes in my body became very tender. My lymph nodes are still very tender and my neck and throat are swollen.

She said it resolves with benydrl and I offered it to her. I gave her 25 mg and told her to stay for 30 minutes to monitor her in case of more severe reaction. She described it as minor and said she feels like she will be ok based on her history dealing with allergies followed up with patient. she said throat feels the same not worse.  she has an itch.  I told her to stay.  She said she would go to electronic but stay in the store for longer.  I told her to check out with me before leaving to ensure okay patient checked back before leaving. She said her throat feels better but still slightly itchy.  She said she feels fine and feels like the benydrl is working.

                                                About 10 days after the second dose of vaccine, I started to experience the shorten of breath, and abnormal heart pulsation.  I thought it was temporary it will be gone soon, but it didn?t. On March I went to the doctor, and told her about my symptoms and said that they started after the vaccination. My doctor said that these kind of symptoms were not reported, so it shouldn?t be related to the vaccine and suggested me to check my thyroid function as I have a history of hyperthyroidism.  So I made an appointment with Dr., she prescribed me a beta blockers to calm my heart down. I did a comprehensive blood test, and my thyroid is normal, so my shorten of breath and heartbeat is unrelated to the thyroid.  My symptoms is still present, even while I?m typing this message I have a hard time to make a deep breath.  Today I saw an article, that people experience the same symptoms as I had and they encouraged to report them to this site.

                                                The night of my vaccine dose (5/26/2021), I experienced chills, aches, and a low grade fever. The next day, the symptoms continued but lessened. However, beginning on 5/28/2021, I was experiencing shortness of breath. I would feel like I would need to catch my breath even when I was just sitting down. For the following two days (5/29 and 5/30), I experienced shortness of breath but it slowly lessened with each passing day. I&#39;m feeling fine now but it was scary especially since shortness of breath isn?t listed as a common symptom. I also wanted to mention that I did have momentary bouts of  shortness  of breath with my first covid-19 moderna dose (4/28/2021) but it was much less severe and went away quickly.

On Sunday she started having trouble breathing. She went to a Medical Center and they checked her vitals. They gave her an inhaler (Albuterol). She used that on Sunday. She still was having issues on Monday. She took a Benadryl hoping that would help. Tuesday she was still having breathing issues. She then went to her PCP, who ordered a chest X ray. It came back normal. Her doctor was concerned it may be a pulmonary issue.  The doctor told her to continue to take her inhaler. She tried taking a shower to get steam. She then took a medicine she was prescribed for her allergies to tree pollen called Montelukast 10 MG 1x daily. She also tried a daytime allergy medicine taken during pollen season. She started feeling better.

                                                I have a history of prior anaphylaxis in 2009 when I received (separate arms, same date and time) the 2009 seasonal flu vaccine and the 2009 H1N1 vaccine. Both were from multi-dose vials and providers I established care with following the reaction believed I likely had a reaction to a preservative. I?ve received single-dose flu vaccines with no issues since then. When I received the Moderna covid vaccine on 1/8/21 I had some right-sided throat swelling about 15 minutes after injection. It did not worsen and I was monitored for 1 hour after shot time. I went home and the feeling in my throat resolved after about 4-5 hours with no medication or intervention needed. I did not have any other symptoms until 3pm on 1/9/21. Started with mild abdominal pain, an hour and a half later I had chills, headache, fatigue and fever around 100.8F. No medication taken. The fever resolved within about 6-7 hours. On Sunday 1/10/21 the abdominal pain worsened and was a constant pain around umbilical region that felt as if it radiated outward, LLQ slightly worse. It was severe, directly affected normal daily functions. I could not walk, move, eat or drink room-temp water without pain increasing.  Walking 20ft at one point even caused me to crumble to the floor and cry, had to stay there for 5 minutes before even attempting to get back to the couch. No diarrhea, no vomiting, no fever, no nausea. I did have loss of appetite. The pain continued through the night and was constant. I could not find a comfortable position to lay in and tossed and turned most of the night. At 0430 on 1/11/21 I got up out of bed to pee, abdominal pain was so bad it kept me awake for about an hour after. Pain finally started to improve and I was able to sleep from 0530-0930. When I woke up on 1/11/21 around 0930 my abdominal pain was very mild and continued to improve as the day went on. Currently (1600 on 1/11/21) my abdomen feels about 90% better, I have no other symptoms. The symptoms, specifically the fever and abdominal pain, caused me to miss 2 days of work (Sunday 1/10/21 and Monday 1/11/21).

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                About three days after I received my first dose of the vaccine I began to feel symptoms similar to those described as side effects on the Moderna Covid 19 Fact Sheet. I was short of breath and as the day progressed I experienced what felt like irritation on the right side of my chest (mild pain in my lungs even when I was not taking deep breaths). My throat and nasal passages were irritated as well. I could tell that my tonsils (yes I still have them) were swollen. I was dizzy even when I was seated and I had a mild fever. The feeling of being disoriented came and went.   These symptoms started around 7 am and continued through the day, off and on at first, then worsening in the evening after 4-4:30p. After I took some Advil the symptoms went away but then returned maybe 45-60mins later. The symptoms finally subsided around 8p. I woke this morning with no symptoms whatsoever.   I wanted to make you all aware because I was told the first dose had no side effects and if we did experience them they were supposed to happen immediately or the next day.

                                                At 1:17 PM, I received the vaccine. Around 1:30 PM I started itching and breaking out in hives. I did not say anything because I thought it was my eczema reacting to my nerves. I went home and felt fine for a while. Around 5:30 PM I told my husband my stomach hurt and I had a slight headache, and I was going to lie down. Around 8:30 PM I woke up. Around 11 PM I was feeling kind of light-headed but did not say anything to my husband because I just thought it was my thoughts. I went to bed. Around 3:45 AM I woke up feeling sick, went to bathroom in master bedroom and dry heaved. I returned to the bed from our bathroom, and told my husband I thought I was going to pass out. I have no recollection of the following events, this is information my husband (Brian) shared with me. He said I then stayed standing on the floor, laid my head over on my pillow, and started breathing heavily, and it became progressively heavier to where he stated I sounded like a &#34;wart hog.&#34; He said he jokingly said to me, &#34;Are you mutating,&#34; then I collapsed onto our bedroom floor. He said he got up immediately, was saying my name as he was walking to me, and I was not responding. He then got on the floor by me, and was rubbing me and trying to wake me, and it took about a minute before I came to. When I came to I was laying on our floor, keep in mind I feel approximately 5 feet as our bed sits 4 to 4.5 feet in the air, and I am 5&#39;8&#34;. I hit my hit on our floor, and when I came to I could barely hear him calling my name as there was a loud rushing noise like water in my head. It took about 2-3 minutes before the ringing was completely gone. I then had cold chills off and on for the next 24 hours with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. On Tuesday following the initial encounter, I went to the ER due to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe headache on right side of head. The ER doctor diagnosed me after a CT with a closed head injury that occurred at initial encounter, so Thursday around 4 AM.

                                                I was vaccinated on the 14th of January. Initially I just had a sore arm and fatigue on the 15th. The night of the 17th I was working out and had a vasovagal type episode (never had this before). By the morning of the 18th I was fatigued and had a cough that can be described as a bronchial spasm type cough, I assumed that it had to do with the work out and the episode the night before. I woke up on the 19th very sick. Fever, chills, fatigue, nausea. Because I am a healthcare provider I was able to go strait to the hospital and get an expedited COVID Test. By that afternoon I had my test back with positive results. Over the next few days the symptoms progressed. I had extreme headache, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath if I moved around at all, cough, loss of taste and smell, nausea, abdominal px, diarrhea, lac of apatite, extrema &#34;brain fog&#34;. These symptoms continued for about a week. Most of the symptoms subsided after that time except for the fatigue off and on and a continuous cough that as of 2/11/2021 has still not gone away.

                                                The patient is a 34yo female seen about 1 month ago for SOB - it developed 1 week after the COVID vaccine. She was sent to Cardiology and they diagnosed her with pericarditis and she was started on scheduled NSAIDS. - Cardiology recommended ESR, CRP and CBC and they were negative. - CXR was normal - Echocardiogram was suggestive of pericarditis. Cardiology told her to follow up in 1 month is symptoms did not improve and they have not. Also she stated she has developed mild, intermittent peripheral edema that resolves without intervention but this is new.  I am also ordering the cardiac MRI which the cardiologist recommended if symptoms did not improve with NSAIDs.

Four days later at midnight I was at work and my heart rate was 140-150 and was very SOB and chest tightness,lightheaded and numbness/tingling of the mouth and had to be wheeled down by wheelchair to the ER. Then they drew my labs and potassium was 2.9. I have been in the ER three times since the vaccine. Since I have had the vaccine my blood pressure goes up very high for me 168/105,170/100,186/96,163,103 and I get chest tightness,SOB and lightheaded on and off also very dry mouth at times still. Heart starts racing out of now where and my normal heart rate is 60-80 and I have been very tachy since the vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine around noon on Thursday, March 4, and by Friday night started experiencing postnasal drip/sore throat. My arm was sore from Thursday night - Saturday morning, and I kept it moving to help with the soreness. By Sunday night I had developed a cough and nasal/chest congestion and have had cold symptoms throughout the week (but feeling slightly better each day). My sore throat disappeared by Tuesday. No fever, loss of taste/smell, or shortness of breath. I?ve been taking Sudafed and Mucinex daily, and NyQuil and Afrin at night. On Wednesday, March 10 I went to receive a rapid test for COVID-19 and tested negative, and was told to continue using OTC medications to treat my symptoms, but to take antibiotics if symptoms worsened over the next 3 days. As of Friday, March 12, I?m feeling much better with less cough and congestion but still fatigued and do not plan on using the antibiotics.

Was given an IM injection of epinephrine alone with albuterol nebs which didn&#39;t improve her symptoms. She was not responsive to 4 albuterol nebs and an epinephrine drip and ultimately require intubation and mechanical ventilation. She stabilized on the ventilator but required a MEDEVAC to a civilian hospital for ongoing care.

I was taken to the ER, later that day was admitted to the hospital. I spent 5 days there getting tested. I was released with 0 use of my left arm or hand, and my left leg was weak. It?s been 3 months and I still can?t use my left arm. I am seeing multiple different doctors to try &amp; help me.

                                                1/23/2021 - The first Moderna vaccine. I had flu like symptoms, which included fatigue, muscles aches, muscle spasms, joint aches, chills, and shortness of breath for 2-3 days afterward.  2/20/2021 - The second Moderna vaccine. The side effects were much worse, including muscle aches, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, chills,  fatigue, and shortness of breath. I also found myself limping. 2/21, 2/22, 2/23 - I rested and stayed home from work. Most of my symptoms had improved by the evening of the 23rd, and I felt like the shortness of breath was also improving if I took it easy.  2/24 - I went to work where the shortness of breath became much worse after working for a couple of hours. I began to get dizzy, and my hands and feet were cold and tingling. The school nurse checked my temperature (which was normal) and oxygen levels (99%). I was sent home and told to take another day or two off.  I was fine if I was sitting still and doing nothing, but talking caused me to become winded. Walking and exertion of any kind caused me to become winded. Once winded, it would take 15 minutes of sitting still to get my breathing back under control. Then I would be hit by a wave of fatigue. Also, when my breathing was bad, I walked with a limp. 2/25 - I went to  the shortness of breath was still bad. They were concerned. They took a chest x-ray (which came back clear), did blood work (which was normal), and gave me a Rapid Covid test (which was negative). My oxygen levels were at 99%. They prescribed a 6 day pack of MethylPREDNISolon. If I was not better by Saturday, they wanted me to return. They also did a PCR test (this came back negative on 2/28).  2/26 - The steroid did not help, and by the evening, I was worse.  I went to the ER . The doctors there were concerned about a pulmonary embolism. They did blood work (which was normal), a chest x-ray (which came back clear), and an EKG (which was normal). My vitals were good, though my blood pressure was high for me (113/64). The doctor told me to continue the steroid pack and prescribed an albuterol inhaler. I was directed to contact a pulmonary specialist on 3/1 if symptoms did not improve. The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/5. 3/1 - The shortness of breath did not improve. I almost passed out while driving after I picked up my two small children from school. I could not catch my breath in the car and started to get lightheaded. When I parked, I stayed in the car huffing and puffing for several minutes. I was seeing spot, was dizzy, and my hands and feet were tingling. When I climbed out of the car, my legs buckled beneath me. I was able to grab onto the car and not fall. I had some really bad breathing episodes between 3/1-and 3/3. At these times, the breathing was so rough, that I couldn?t even talk. It would take 30 minutes or more of sitting still for me to be able to bring my breathing under control. 3/3 - Appointment with Pulmonary Specialist. I had an appointment  He ruled out asthma, as the inhaler and steroid were both ineffective. He considered anxiety, but the problem was clearly not a panic or anxiety attack. (I have experienced those before and know the difference.) He ruled that out. He ran a pulmonary function test (which was normal) and a CT scan with contrast (which was normal). The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/10.  3/4 and on - My breathing was better some days than others. The less energy I exerted, the better I did. If I did too much one day, my breathing would be worse the next day.  3/7 - Ajovy injection. I was past due for this monthly injection. Once injected, I had an allergic reaction to it for the first time ever (this was the 7th time I used it). A few minutes after the injection, the injection area had a rash and was itching like crazy. I put ice on it and took benadryl. It was fine by the next morning.  3/9 - Appointment #2 with Pulmonary Specialist. The specialist was not sure what the problem was with my breathing. I was the first patient with these vaccine side effects that he had seen. He scheduled more tests and said he wanted to read more literature. He wrote a note for me to work from home through 4/6.

                                                On 4/8/21 Physician was administering Covid-19 vaccines at our clinic in the lawn and garden center.  She had a patient who was there to receive her first dose of the vaccine.  After the vaccine was administered, she was okay and went to sit in the waiting area.  Shortly later she came back up to the pharmacist table and reported feeling dizzy, lightheaded and nauseous.  Physician then told the patient to sit right by her so she could keep a better eye on her.  The patient said she was okay and then suddenly she passed out.  Physician was able to catch her as she was falling out of the chair and was able to lay her down on the floor.  She may have bumped her head slightly on the ground during this process.  Physician then reports that the patient&#39;s breathing sounded labored, and the patient was not conscious.  At that point Emergency department was called.  Physician removed the patients mask and was preparing to administer an EpiPen due to the labored breathing but then the patient regained consciousness.  The Emergency operator advised her to keep the patient on the ground until EMS arrived on scene.  Patient was conscious and okay on the ground.  EMS then came and took care of the patient.  It was deemed that the patient gets lightheaded when she gets bloodwork done usually and believes this may have been an anxiety event. She did not want to go to the hospital.  She felt a bit dizzy once she was sitting back upright and EMS approved the patient drinking some water.  This seemed to help, and the patients color came back.  The patient sat with Physician for a while and then felt back to normal and left on her own accord.

                                                Late in the night following the vaccination I experienced moderate shortness of breath that lasted for approximately 2 hours accompanied by cough and wheezing on exhale. My airways felt constricted with each exhale which caused me to cough.  The following morning I began experiencing mild to moderate headaches which came and went throughout the upcoming days and lasted 3 weeks in total.

                                                Sudden onset of heart palpitations and tachycardia at rest. Intermittent palpitations/dyspnea of unclear etiology. Symptoms began at rest on 3/30/21. I went to the ER and had normal basic workup. I started propranolol 10mg PO BID and the symptoms have largely improved, but can recur if i miss a dose of propranolol.  It is unclear if there is a relation to the vaccine, however, knowing about 3 other people who developed palpitations after the Moderna vaccine I thought it should be reported. I am a family physician.

I could feel how the vaccine traveled through my veins, my left arm up, go down to my heart and then go up my throat. I started feeling nauseous. I said I didn&#39;t feel well. They instructed me to go sit but I barely made it there. I felt as if I was about to faint, I was sweating. A nurse came and offered water. I couldn?t breathe well. I had to remove my mask because I wasn&#39;t getting enough air. The water came and I started feeling better. Within 5 minutes I was feeling well.   That day outlet a bit of body ache. Took a NyQuil and went to bed. The next day my arm was sore and had a small headache. The third day I was perfect.

Arm Soreness happened 3-4 hours after injection  My SECOND SHOT is where I had the Severe reaction: I decided to treat at home because I had my tens units, leg massager, and pain relievers.  Symptoms: extreme fatigue, sore muscles (aching) and some hardness at injection site, muscle weakness, joint pain, diarrhea, dizziness, fever, one case of the sweats (due to fever), headache, increased heart beat, sore throat (from dripping nose and yet it was also stopped up making the headache happen), and (some short breathing-but I have an inhaler for that, so I was fine).   I began feeling them in the evening about 8-9 hours after the shot. I didn?t sleep well that night, and spent most of it in pure agony and searing pain. I have fibromyalgia and the shot clearly aggravated that condition so I felt like my veins were on fire. -and still do.  Third day after symptoms have lessened, but still persist. Doing all I can to rest and get better.   HOW I TREATED: -Took Tylenol -Took an episome salt bath ?? first. Soaped and rinsed after. -Used a Cain or a family member help me walk to and from the bathroom so I didn?t fall over due to dizziness.  -Called my Dr. And asked for a limited dose of Tramadol-pain meds (I?m allergic to narcotics and opiate pain treatments) -I used 2 at home tens units and had them all over my body. (That I got originally for my back pain and fibromyalgia) -I used my top of the line leg massager (that I got originally for my fibromyalgia)  -My family made chicken soup -I drank water, Pedialite with juice, and mint tea. -Took my temperature regularly to keep up with Tylenol -Eventually used over the counter lidocaine and Aspercream all over my body. -Had a pressure cuff at home to monitor vitals

On 19th started something I can not explain and never felt anything like this before. I felt dizzy, nausea, fever without a temperature, felt overheated, hard to breathe. It felt like I am on drugs to the point I could put clothes on and was feeling like I am passing out. I could think or talk or anything. My boyfriend drove me to the ER but unfortunately all they could say it is the side effects after the vaccine..Nothing helped, I was dizzy and felt like my heart will stop any second... Today is April 24, I feel better however feeling of nausea, headache, and a foggy mind is coming back in the different moments. I noticed that my ears and throat are still burning but I don&#39;t feel sick, it is something else. I tried to go out for lunch but couldn&#39;t spend there even an hour, the feeling coming back, I can&#39;t focus and the noise bothers me... I used to be a completely healthy person. I afraid nothing will help me. I would like to report these cruel side effects.

                                                I am a recovering long covid patient (since March 2020). I improved greatly around December 2020. After the vaccine, my symptoms returned. Sinus tachycardia, brain fog, extreme fatigue, sleeping 20 hours a day, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation, SOB, joint and muscle pain, ocular changes. In addition, I started having terrible headaches, pain at injection site (left arm was virtually unusable for 3 weeks), and tinnitus. No menstruation since vaccination (2 confirmed negative pregnancy tests, and I was supposed to have my period right around the time I was vaccinated), intermittent uterine pain. Went to the ER and had 160 resting HR, and plan to go back on a beta blocker. Symptoms have waned somewhat, but I am still nowhere near where I was before the vaccine.

Patient presented to the ED via EMS on 5/11/21 after receiving her first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Shortly after receiving the dose, the patient developed chest tightness, lip swelling, and diffuse hives. She immediately received 0.3mg EPI (@9:50am) and 50mg Benadryl PO with no symptom relief. Paramedics were called, and upon arrival to the field, administered 0.5mg EPI (@10:10am), 50mg Benadryl IV, and 10mg Decadron. The patient presented to the ED at 10:25am, and at that time, the patient reported that her symptoms mostly resolved, however with lingering abnormal sensations in her chest and lips. She notes that in her past allergic reactions, she had required two EPI doses, Decadron, Benadryl, and a prednisone taper.  Of note, the patient was given Zofran by EMS for nausea en route to BWMC. The patient states to being allergic to the medication, but believes it to be from the aspartame found in Zofran&#39;s ODT formulation.  The patient was noted to have urticarial-like rashes (mouth and chin area) without uvulitis, tongue swelling, lip swellling, strides, wheezes/rales/rhonci, or respiratory distress. The patient was tachycardic, talking in full sentences, and is A/O x4. Roughly 10 to 15 minutes later, the patient started to experience refractory allergy symptoms - throat tightness or return of facial hives. Her airways were noted to be patent and her lungs were noted to be clear. She was given Ativan 1mg and placed on EPI gtt (rate: 0.05mcg/min). Thereafter, the patient states to improving symptoms. Transferred to the ICU for further management respiratory distress in the setting of anaphylactic reaction.

Pain worsened when attempting any activity and subsided somewhat when lying down. Went to the emergency room around 1:00 PM on the 20th, where my initial heart rate was at 163 bpm. The emergency staff gave me an EKG, fluids, and potassium pills. All my blood work and a cat scan came back ok. My heart rate eventually got down to about 120, and they sent me home.

In an hour, I started to get cold, I was shaking, and I used heating pads - but it didn&#39;t provide much relief. I took Benadryl as a result.   On Sunday morning, I was lethargic and tired. By Monday, my face was swollen, I had trouble breathing, and had a rash all over my face &amp; neck. I went to Urgent care that day. I received allergy &amp; steroid medication by the doctor.   I was urged by the doctor not to take my second dose.

                                                I had a little bit of pain - like a tetanus shot when I first got the shot. That lasted overnight. I took Tylenol after the shot. Then about two weeks after, I had pain that felt like kidney stones (which run in my family). My mom got me to ER. They told me it was my appendix - in my lower right quadrant from back to front. I was tested for COVID and it was positive result but I was asymptomatic. I ate lunch and then it got really bad and I had surgery about 05:00 pm. on March 27th. It felt like I did a million sit-ups after the surgery. Everything checked out okay in follow up visit. I&#39;m still not doing running at full strength - breathing isn&#39;t quite back to normal with my distance running. I can do 1 and 1/2 miles but if I try to do more, I get more easily winded. It&#39;s slowly getting better. I was 10 days in isolation after the surgery because of the COVID diagnosis. Had a COVID test after the quarantine and it was negative results (had it done at the fairgrounds on 4/7/2021)

I have been taking 2 Zyrtec in the morning and Benadryl at night and I have been using my inhaler. It seems to be helping but sometimes I still have tightness in my chest. And sometimes it feels painful in my upper chest area. Today I had an appt with a specialist, he suggested I had an EKG but I do not know the results for that test yet. They also did a chest x-ray on the first day and my lung were clear.

She reports symptoms of Anaphylaxis - chest discomfort, palpitations, tachycardia, shortness of breath, feeling of tightness in the throat.  I have observed patient was mildy anxious, with shallow rapid respirations. Patient then disclosed having similar reaction after previous covid vaccination. Per the vaccinator patient had stated having an &#34;issue&#34; with her first vaccination, but that she had spoke with her primary and was told it would be ok to proceed&#34; . No report of allergic reaction was reported at this vaccination. Patient described previous reaction as tightness in the chest &#34;menthol feeling&#34; with some shortness of approximately 40 minutes post initial vaccination lasting 7 hours.   This reaction remained mild initially.

                                                On June, 9, 2021, the day after I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced intense pain in my left arm.  I expected pain in my arm again since that is how it felt the first time.  The pain felt as if someone punched me extremely hard, leaving me feeling like I needed a sling to support the injury.  The pain in my left arm felt had a throbbing, pulsing, almost numbing feel all on the outside and although it did feel a little different than the first time, I figured it would get better like after the first vaccine I received on May 11, 2021.   Other symptoms I experienced were: waxing and waning low-grade fevers all day, severe fatigue and brain fog, dizziness,  little appetite, shakiness, rapid breathing and then shallow breathing (in line with my heart pounding or slowing down), and nausea. The symptoms were familiar to me, and it felt like deja vu but a milder version of when I had Covid-19 in August 2020.  As a reference to what I will mention next, when I had Covid-19 last year I developed subacute thyroiditis from the acute respiratory virus, and this was supported by a blood test.  My levels appeared to be normal going into the vaccine, and since I never have had thyroid challenges the past I didn&#39;t expect to have fluctuating hormones post Covid or post-vaccine.   As of now, July 14, 2021, I still am experiencing some of the milder symptoms on occasion (brain fog, dizziness, shakiness), and the hormone regulation has been a bit off too.  My left arm has a dull ache/pain and numbness the starts at the vaccine site in my shoulder down the outside of the arm, pulses pain in my left wrist, and stops at the last two fingers on my left hand.  As far as I can tell, I do have full range of motion and can still exercise.  My recovery time is slower and the tingling feeling doesn&#39;t subside, and if anything it increases randomly.  I was hoping the dull ache and numb feeling would subside by this point, but it hasn&#39;t.  My best guess is that I have neurological damage in my left arm, and I have a long term recovery in my hormonal health.

                                                On Sunday, January 3rd, I woke up to find a rash about 3 inches long, starting at the vaccination site. By Tuesday it had widened. I have photos of both Sunday and Tuesday?s rash, if you would like me to forward those to you. Wednesday night the rash had lightened in color, it was mostly just the outline, but had grown larger than my hand. It crept up towards my shoulder, underarm, and about half way down to my elbow.   Thursday morning (yesterday) I called medical provider to make a Virtual Visit at 5:30pm same day. APRN, called me at about 12:20pm and told me to go to the ER right away. My throat felt swollen and constricted at the time, though I was able to breathe, drink and eat. Swallowing was a bit difficult.  I was seen by PA, at the ER at MC. She evaluated me and said the reaction was bad, but not severe, and on the mend. She prescribed oral prednisone 20mg for the next five days. I did not need any steroid or Benadryl shots. She also said she feels comfortable with me getting the second COVID-19 vaccination, which is scheduled for 1/25.

                                                I received my vaccination at approximately 7pm on Friday January 15th. Upon receiving my vaccinations I felt light headed, but after fifteen minutes I was okay to stand up and leave the facility. At around 12:05am  I began coughing and body aches and it continued throughout the night. By morning my cough had subsided, and I felt okay. By 11:30 am on 16th my body and skin began to tingle all over and I felt a burning sensation under my skin. My head began pound and a feeling of nausea came over me. I started feeling very warm about 10 minutes later and decided to take off my sweater and found that I had a large red rash across my chest. My temperature began to rise and my tongue and face began to swell and a feeling of shortness of breath came over me. By 4:00 my fever hit 104.2 and my body began to stiffen up  and my jaw began to clench involuntarily In small bursts for a total of what my family believes to have been 5-10 minutes. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol my fever dropped to 103 for the next two hours and I began to shake uncontrollably, then it began to spike a again reaching 103.6. My spouse put cold towels on me and opened the windows to our bedroom to cool me down. Slowly my temperature started dropping and it finally reached 101 by 11pm. The next morning, Sunday, I woke with blisters on my mouth and severe body aches.

                                                At 3am on 1/26/2021 I woke up feeling sick I had a fever of 102F, chills, muscle aches, nausea. I understand that these were expected with the second dose. However at 9:40am I began vomiting. By 11am my throat started to close so I went to the ER. I had a minor asthma attack while I was there (coughing fit and slight wheezing). I was evaluated and they gave me IV fluids as well as other medications through the IV. I received solu-medrol, Benadryl, antacid, and anti-nausea. They took blood tests, urinalysis, and chest x-ray, all of which were normal. I did not have a rash around the injection site this time. I was discharged at about 3:10pm

Heart rate jumped up to 179 BPM using a pulse oximeter to read and was breathing heavily. Was assisted to a wheelchair and spent a few minutes breathing in through my nose and out through my mouth and after a few minutes of this, my heart rate went back down and the symptoms subsided. As of today (1/27/2021) I am very exhausted.

The paramedics was contacted and came. She reported that once she was in the emergency department all her tests were clear, including her CT scan. The MD felt it was most likely a &#34;mini TIA&#34;. She has fully recovered and denies any other symptoms at this time, but was instructed by her MD to contact the facility that administered her MODERNA covid vaccine.

Also reported neck pain, chest/throat tightness, slightly itchy throat, clogged ears, and a cold feeling. I took her BP and it was elevated at 156/94. I monitored patient over the next 30-35 minutes and she asked for water and crackers. She was not having any difficulty breathing, did not complain of throat closing so epi pen was NOT administered. She slowly improved over those 30-35 minutes. She declined me calling 911. She left with her boyfriend approx 45 minutes after onset of symptoms. I called her at approx 7pm the same night and she reported feeling &#34;fine&#34;.

                                                The patient received the Moderna vaccine on January 21, 2021. She waited at the pharmacy for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine to be sure she would be okay.  She felt fine after 15 minutes and so left the store.  As she was walking to her car in the parking lot, she started to feel &#34;weird&#34; as if something was very wrong but she could not figure out why she felt this way.  She got in her car and drove back to work.  The feeling that something was very wrong worsened during the drive and she started itching on her arms and legs approximately 25 minutes after receipt of the vaccination.  She did not have a rash or hives but the itching became very intense and spread to her entire body within a few minutes.  She started to feel that her throat was tight or swollen but thought perhaps it was due to something else.  However, within another 15 minutes she was having difficulty swallowing and her voice changed as she was talking to patients (hoarse).  The throat symptoms continued for 30 to 45 minutes and were quite uncomfortable but she did not seek medical attention.  They started to resolve after 30 to 45 minutes.  However, her intense itching continued for several hours.  She took Benadryl but it did not help.  All her symptoms resolved after several hours and she slept well.  The following day, within 24 hours, she felt her throat swelling again.  This lasted for a few hours but she did not seek medical care because she could breathe.  She developed a temperature of 100.8 degrees Farenheit which resolved after 4 hours but then the intense itching started again and continued into the next day.   She saw her PCP (third day after receiving the Moderna vaccination) and received a steroid shot and started taking Claritin 10mg daily and Pepcid 20mg twice daily which helped some but did not relieve the itching.  The itching worsened again on January 26th, 2021 and she was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg which helps but makes her extremely sleepy.  She continues to have varying degrees of itching off and on since then.

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

                                                I am the patient. I do not have the lot number. I received it and was fine initially. I felt a little euphoric in my head. Light headed I guess you could say. After about 10 mins of that I felt a little sensation in my legs. It did not last long. I thought maybe just nerves. After about 15-20 minutes I walked outside to maybe leave. I started feeling a little Soreness (none painful or severe) in my throat. I looked in the mirror and saw two small red patches in the very back of the throat. I looked at my phone to text who followed me and looked back in the mirror to see they had no connected that quickly. With in 10 seconds. I walked back in and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl. I could still breath and had a good air way. My throat a little tight. I remember feeling this euphoric feeling in my head. After about 15 mins of the Benadryl I was getting bettter. I hung around for a little while and left. I know it was a allergy but honestly considered going back for the second dose of that is how it could be handled again. I felt some small dull none painful sharp pains if that makes sense in my sides and stomach that didn?t not linger. Over all it wasn?t so bad. This is my first day however and if more arises I?ll be sure to let you know. I did experience a very sore arm tonight. To even lift it hurt. Worse than other vaccines. I have never had any reactions to other vaccines.

Pain increased over the course of the next 1.5 days until I found it was necessary to go to the hospital.  Trouble taking deep breaths and moving around was painful. Wheezing and crackling in lungs would occur if exposed to cold. Increased temp  occurred on day 4 (99.8). Currently am on day 8 and am mostly back to normal with occasionally chest pains/wheezing. I believe pleurisy was the final diagnosis.

After the vaccine, her arm was first sore and a couple of days later, the soreness turned into an itching. The itch is local around injection site on left arm. Potential allergic reaction, lasting for days post injection.

                                                Client was administered her second dose of COVID-19 vaccine and immediately afterwards she stated her mouth was dry, her heart was racing, her throat felt dry and she found it difficult to breathe. She stated that she had the same symptoms after she received her first dose. 911 was immediately called. Her vital signs were as follows: BP=108/80, Pulse=88, Respiration=18. She denied any history of allergies but said she had asthma, for which she took Ventolin. She did not have any dizziness. The EMT personnel arrived shortly thereafter and determined she was having a panic attack. The client as well as the EMT did not think it was necessary to transport her to the hospital. They spoke with her until she felt calm and ready to leave the POD site. She was told to call 911 if the symptoms occurred again and she verbalized understanding.

I stayed in an observation room for about 3 hours. Next day, I couldn&#39;t feel my right arm. I started getting fever, chills. I had all symptoms of the coronavirus. Saturday at 03:00 am - I woke up and I couldn&#39;t feel my arm or my fingers on my right side. I called the Emergency number. I stayed home and took Tylenol. Couldn&#39;t feel my arm at all that Saturday - dead. Sunday - same thing. Monday morning, I woke up, I could feel a little bit of my fingers but I noticed that I had blisters full of blood between your index finger and your thumb. I didn&#39;t go to work that day. The doctor wrote me out of work for the rest of the week. I didn&#39;t have any sensation on my pinkie or ring finger. I had a little bit of sensation on the rest of my fingers. I stayed at home and I didn&#39;t do anything with my arm and it slowly started getting better. That whole week I was having symptoms that were just like coronavirus. They came and went. the following Saturday, I started being able to move my arm around and doing more stuff and slowly it came back but I&#39;m not 100%. I can&#39;t lay on the right hand side too long - it starts feeling like my arm is asleep. I got the second dose February 12th.  I spoke to an allergy doctor and an anesthesiology doctor (video and telephone visits) - they told me I was having common side affects that people were having from the vaccine but they didn&#39;t know why.

Squeezing sensation self-resolved after call. Paramedics arrived about 1 hr post-vaccination. BP 89/66. (Note my normal BP runs 90-110s/50s-70s.) HR 70s-90s. Pulse Ox high 90s. Paramedics not concerned that reaction was allergic, no rescue meds advised. I felt well enough to drive home despite persisting facial tingling and tight breathing. Allegra and albuterol taken upon arrival home, resolved breathing but not facial tingling. Facial tingling better but not resolved after about 24 hrs.

Pt stated in was administered in the L arm, but ALERT IIS stated R arm.) After the second dose, she reported immediate nausea, milder than after the first vaccine, and then  &#34;breathing trouble&#34;--a &#34;squeezing heart&#34; sensation that began about 10 minutes after vaccination and lasted for close to one hour. She also immediately began to have pain in her Left arm (the 2nd vaccine dose was administered in her Right arm). This pain has continued to grow and intensify; she called in on 2/24/21 and on 2/25/21 reported that it is even worse. She is planning to go to an urgent care but finds it difficult as she has 5 children at home.

                                                Pt has history of anaphylactic allergic reaction (not to vaccine or contraindicated material), made aware of risk (was told she would have to stay 30 minutes) and decided to be vaccinated. Approximately 20-25 minutes after her vaccination, she mentioned to the living facility manager that she wasn&#39;t feeling well. I checked her blood pressure (142/111) and pulse (82) at 8:27am. She said that was elevated for her and she felt as though she was having difficulty breathing. I had the living facility staff member call 911. At 8:29, I proceeded to help the patient self inject in her right upper leg with a generic epipen (this was her preference since she has used before) - I added with counting to 10. I then gave her 50mg diphenhydramine IM in her left upper arm (Moderna injection was in right upper arm). Within 1-2 minutes, she said that she could tell the epipen was working and helping her to breathe more easily. At 8:34am, I took her blood pressure (148/111) and pulse (90). By 8:38am, she said she was starting to struggle to breath again. Per the pharmacy emergencey protocol, epipen can be given again in 10-20 minutes. At 10 minutes, since she still said her breathing was getting more difficult and the EMS had not arrived, she was given a second dose of a generic epipen in the left upper leg. EMS arrived 2-3 minutes later and was provided with all above information. Follow up phone call with doctor at the emergency department, said that she was monitored for an hour and then sent home. He advised that she not get the second Moderna shot or if determined necessary by her PCP to get it in a doctor&#39;s office setting.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

After 1.5 hours I felt very weightless and felt like I was going to pass out.  Then a wave of nausea came over me.  That went back and forth for about 20 minutes.  The following 2 days, I had those same rounds of nausea and thinking I&#39;m going to pass out.  My left arm got a large red, itchy and red bump and red streaks going up my arm.

                                                About 20 minutes after receiving vaccine, started to get a rash on chest and neck and began to have itchy feelings. After about 25 minutes, chest started to feel tight and breathing difficulty. Used Xopenex (Albuterol rescue inhaler, two puffs). 30 minutes after vaccine told nurse at vaccination clinic that I was getting itchier and asked for Benadryl. Received 50mg benadryl intramuscular shot in left arm approx 35 minutes after vaccine. Just a few minutes later throat started to feel tight and kept on coughing. They administered epi in left arm intramuscular. I believe they said it was 0.5 (maybe 5?). A few minutes after that the tightness started to improve and they had called EMS. While in ambulance, it started to get more itchy again, neck and chest and down arms. In ambulance they gave through IV some type of steroid and pepcid. No more medication was given at hospital, monitored for heart and breathing  for approx 2 hours. Discharged home with 5 days of prednisone and benadryl as needed.

                                                Patient received her second COVID shot today around 3.40p. She said she had a history of anaphylaxis in the past with an allergy shot she received as well as with Lovenox. I asked the patient to wait 30 minutes after administering the vaccine. After 10 minutes she began having tingling of the lips and some swelling near her cheeks, breathing was fine. I gave 50mg of oral Benadryl to patient at 3:50p. Patient said she felt as if her tongue was beginning to swell and her cheeks were getting more swollen. She said her symptoms resembled what happened with her first anaphylaxis response and that it also was very gradual. Patient was awake and alert and could breathe normally so no reason to administer Epipen but called EMS due to patient saying her tongue was swelling more and could feel her throat getting narrower. EMS arrived and accessed the patient. I told them about her condition and the dose of Benadryl that I gave. They checked her blood pressure, heart rate, looked at her tongue and accessed her breathing and said she is okay and no need to be taken to hospital unless patient wanted to be taken. Patient agreed not to go and signed a refusal form by EMS. EMS told her she was fine to go home and patient was fine and bought liquid Benadryl to take with her and went home.

                                                Within 48 hours of second dose of vaccine I had severe difficulty breathing. I was using accessory muscles to try to get a satisfying breath. I also developed a painful, hot rash (&#39;COVID arm&#39;) within 48 hours of final vaccination. Three days (1/24/2021) after the vaccine I went to Urgent Care for breathing difficulty. A home SpO2 monitor showed O2 sats 93-98 and HR 80-120 upon minimal exertion. I continued to have breathing difficulty and contacted my PCP for further guidance on 1/28/2021. I did take a short burst of prednisone starting 1/24/2021 (40 mg X 5 days), Bactrim DS X 7 days, and began scheduling 6 puffs of albuterol HFA every 4 hours (per guidance from my physician) without relief. The rash on my arm cleared up within 2 days of starting prednisone. I stopped using the albuterol inhaler in February as it was not improving my symptoms. As time progresses I continue to have difficulty breathing but it has been slowly improving. I feel the difficulty breathing is due to an overreaction of my immune system from the second COVID-19 vaccination.

                                                Had seizure symptoms at 2:30 am the following day.  Husband woke to our dog whining.  I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

                                                About 14 hours after my shot I started to experience cramping in the chest.  It felt almost like I had swallowed something and couldn&#39;t get it down.  The cramping was on the front and back of my ribs and lasted for about an hour and a half.  It was never difficult to breathe, but it was painful and disconcerting.  After using my albuterol a couple of times and doing some stretching the cramping subsided.  I had other normal reactions such as chills, tiredness, and fatigue as well.

                                                Severe throat tightening, itching body, mild hives on hands. I have to take Benadryl every 4 hours to keep these side effects tolerable. I emailed my doctor to see how long this would last or if there is anything I need to be doing. They called me and told me to come in right away. I was unable to see my doctor but was seen by another doctor. She said I was definitely having an allergic reaction after scratching my skin, looking in my nose, ears, and mouth.  She asked if I had changed anything like soaps or laundry detergent recently, which I told her I did not. I said the only thing out of the ordinary that I have done in the past YEAR has been getting the COVID vaccine. She then told me it was probably just seasonal allergies.. which I have never had before. She wrote on my after care summary that I could use OTC eye drops for my eye symptoms (and I don?t have ANY eye symptoms), she also wrote that I could use Flonase for my nose symptoms (which I don?t have any nose symptoms), and to buy Zyrtec for keeping the seasonal allergies at bay. She didn?t even consider the vaccine to be an issue. I also didn?t even know throat tightness could be a vaccine side effect until I looked it up. I don?t know why I was brushed off and told seasonal allergies when my side effects don?t line up with that. I don?t think it was a coincidence I received the vaccine and started to have ?seasonal allergies?. I asked if I should be getting an allergy test to see what ?seasonal? things I?m having this reaction to and she said that doesn?t matter, just to keep treating the symptoms.  So no tests were given.

                                                Within 15 minutes of the injection, I got very light headed and vertigo, sweaty palms and the shakes and then my blood pressure went up to 144 over 97 when it&#39;s usually 110 over 70. They gave me Benadryl, called the medics and monitored me for a time - probably an hour. My blood pressure continued to spike for 18 hours, I continued to get the shakes, chills, sweat and get vertigo. I never had a fever. I did have seasonal asthma and a cough at the time that got worse after the injection and 4 weeks later I haven&#39;t not improved much. My GP has put me on prednisone because I have not been able to recover. The asthma has gotten so much worse that even symbicort and an emergency inhaler has not done the trick. I never had asthma before this year. I never had a positive covid test, but I do plan to get tested for antibodies this week.

                                                Almost immediately post injection, experienced tingling around lips, whole oral area, ears, quickly followed by generalized facial swelling to a moderate degree.  By approx 30 min post, throat started to tighten. Staff quickly administered Epi-Pen, with resolution of throat symptoms, no change in facial swelling with tongue swelling also evident. Developed a few abdominal small petechiae. Monitored at site for additional 30 min, while experiencing increased throat mucus and metallic taste. Sent home with instructions to report to ER for continued monitoring. Did so, admitted to ER for approx 1.5 hours of monitoring, given IV Benadryl , and discharged home in stable condition. Still no change in facial swelling and swollen tongue. Today, 20 hours later, I have weakness, fatigue and minor loss of sensation in tongue.

                                                Within a few hours, I had a bad headache, severe congestion, sore arm, tiredness, muscle aches, fatigue- expected, but then it didn&#39;t go away. Three days later I had joint pain/swelling and tingling/numbness in my right big toe intermittently. A week following numbness and tingling in the right middle, ring, pinky fingers intermittently. Every few days I would have a low-grade fever for about 3-4 hours. I was taking Ibphrophen for pain and fever during this time. This lasted in total about 2.5 weeks before I saw a doctor. Following the doctor&#39;s appointment, the trouble moved from mostly being in the upper sinuses into the chest which has caused me some trouble with breathing. Using an inhaler has not helped. Though the symptoms have faded, muscle soreness, fatigue, and difficulty breathing remain more than one month post the shot. I still plan to get the second shot once the symptoms have ceased.

                                                Patient received 1st dose Moderna Covid vaccine at 4pm, sat in pharmacy for 15 minutes and was about to drive home with her mother.  She took off her mask in the car and noticed that her face was swollen and red so came back to pharmacy.  By 4:30pm patient stated that she felt constriction in the throat so I gave her 1 Epi-pen in the left thigh.  She felt better almost immediately and then felt jittery within 5 minutes but still had a lot of mucus in her throat. Checked in with patient periodically, patient seemed to feel significantly better. We had a conversation about contacting primary care provider, future COVID vaccines and the event that of the allergic reaction coming back in the next few hours, patient needs to go to ER, Patient&#39;s mother who was with her is a retired nurse and has an Epi-pen at home and both know to keep alert for return of symptoms. I also advised getting some liquid Benadryl to have on-hand.  By 5:15pm patient felt confident to leave.  At 5:20pm I called patient to let her know that she should go to ER per protocol and patient stated that she&#39;ll tell her mom.  I called patient again at 5:35pm to try to urge her to go to ER and patient state that she is heading to the ER and that she now noticed some red spots on her stomach.

Her legs became heavy followed by stiffness in her legs and arms.  Her eyes were wide open and she became unresponsive to our questions.  Patient&#39;s breathing shallowed and was given one dose of an Epi-Pen.  The patient immediately responded and she could again control her eyes and was talking.  The patient slowly started to stiffen up,  losing control of her eye movement and her breathing was once again shallow with her lips becoming bluish in color.   We administered a second Epi-Pen and the patient responded for about three minutes when the paramedics arrived.

                                                A few minutes after getting the vaccine I had a fast heart rate and my throat felt like it was closing up. I let the personnel know and the EMTs hooked my up to O2, blood pressure and EKG, I had a jump in heart rate on EKG every couple minutes and my blood pressure started off very high. It gradually decreased. I then had the feeling after about 20 minutes that I needed to poop. I was unhooked and went to the bathroom. I proceeded to have diarrhea for the next 2-3 hours. The EMT let me go home after about 40minutes of total care because my oxygen level never dropped below 100.  I would have feelings of flushing and throat tightening until about 6pm. They did not reoccur after that. I have never had a reaction like this before to a vaccine or any medication.

They monitored for me for an hour while I got two bags of IVs. I still felt nauseated when I left for lunch. I couldn&#39;t eat. I started throwing up again after lunch and I had two episodes of diarrhea. Felt short of breath (not wheezing) and face felt like it was burning. I rash and it was red and burning around my mouth and face. I felt really dizzy and light headed and they took me back to a treatment room. I felt like I was going to pass out. I couldn&#39;t stop throwing up at all - at that point. They put the vital signs machine on my - O2 was 84; I had low blood pressure; and I was really tachycardia - it was 135 - was very high. They gave epinephrine; Benadryl - 50 mg; solumedrol - 125 mg. I have an anaphylactic care plan in my chart because of my latex allergies. I think they gave me everything off of that. I started wheezing. I believe I passed out. When I came coherent again - I was in an ambulance with breathing mask and IVs.  They took me to ER  to monitor me.  They monitored me for three hours - I don&#39;t believe they did an epi-drip but they were seeing if they needed to start one. I think they gave me a second epi-injection in the ambulance.  They gave me steroids and told me to use my antihistamine (already had Zyrtec). They gave me a higher dose of prednisone - they dosed me to 20mg instead of my daily 5. Those helped with my symptoms. On the 4th, I had a negative result for COVID - my heart rate was still crazy - super high - felt like I was having palpitations . So On Tuesday, the 5th, when I went back to follow up, I had COVID. I was still feeling horrible and having all kinds of symptoms. They had tested me for COVID before coming into clinic - and I was positive. I took OTC stuff at home for COVID. I still have ongoing heart palpitations/ tachycardia.  that I experience. I saw an allergy specialist after getting a doctor referral - he just said don&#39;t take the Moderna vaccine again.  I still have to see a cardiologist . I have a repeat cardio/echogram tomorrow. They put me on Pepcid.

A chest x-ray was done to rule out a PE.  None was found.  The following day the patient was called back and found to have a blood clot in her left calf muscle.  She was treated and is now ok. I do not know specific test and dates. Hospital was the treatment facility.  Patient did not know the name of the Doctor who treated her. We only found out about this adverse effect when we called her to schedule her 2nd dose.

After vomiting, throat felt tight, like it had closed up a bit because there was a lump in it, but didn?t affect my breathing much. It just felt extremely dry even after having drank a lot of water. I constantly felt the need to swallow. An hour after this, my skin began to have a flushed appearance on my upper and lower body, specifically my face, shoulders, and upper and lower legs. My body felt hot to the touch and looked as if it had a rash. Legs were tingly. I felt dizzy.

After trying to lower my heart rate at home for approx. 45 minutes, I went to the ER based on CDC recommendation as well as not having a primary caregiver. 1 1/2 hours into being there I felt my heart slow down back to normal as well as the hot/cold sensations ease up. Once my vitals became normal they released me.

                                                On 5.7.2021, the skin on my arms and neck started itching and burning. Hives began to appear all over my upper body and face. I was exercising when this happened. Then my face started to swell. The same thing happened on 5.10.2021, only with more swelling and some difficulty catching a deep breath. I figured out the laundry detergent used on my work-out towels was the culprit; however, I have been using this detergent for 10&#43; years. I wonder if the immune response triggered by the vaccine also triggered an allergy to this detergent.

                                                The Moderna covid vaccine was the first vaccine I ever had.  On the evening of the 18th, I was sitting alone after work, scrolling my phone when my heart started beating very fast, hard, and irregularly. I felt pressure in my chest and a wave of tingling wash over my head. My vision went funny and grey around the edges as if I was about to pass out. It felt lie something was squeezing my heart. I sat on the floor, put my head between my knees and took deep breaths. The heart rate spikes seemed to come in waves with a feeling of pressure every few minutes. I called someone to take me to the ER and they arrived about 45 minutes after initial symptom onset. My heart rate had slowed slightly and the spikes were coming farther apart by then. It was cold in the car and it gave me chills, but I felt that it made me feel a little better. At the ER, they kept me from about 9:30 pm to after 3:00 am. My symptoms slowly abated, with heart rate spikes coming about every 15 to 30 minutes, but shorter, and not going as high. I sat there and watched the pulse monitor for abot 5 hours, varying between the 60s and 108.  I was discharged after several tests without a diagnosis and told to follow up with a cardiologist in 2 days. The attending physician verbally told me the tests were normal and I was fine, but when I viewed my test results online, it said I had an abnormal ECG, left atrial inflammation, and a possible heart attack. I was uninsured at the time, so they declined to run expensive tests. I also did not have a primary care provider.  Around midnight on the evening of the 20th/morning of the 21st, a similar thing occurred while I had a late night snack and watched a TV show. I did not feel as if I was going to pass out, but had regular heart rate spikes, and a rapid, irregular heartbeat with pressure in my chest. This time I also had nausea and burning in my stomach. I did deep breathing all night. Managed to doze for about an hour. This episode lasted until 6 am. I felt better then and tried to find a cardiologist, but was referred to the ER. By the time a friend took me there (around 7-7:30 am, I think), my symptoms had largely abated, but I was very fatigued and short of breath just standing. I was again discharged after testing with no diagnosis, but told to follow-up with a cardiologist. Again, I was verbally told again that the tests were normal and I was fine, but the notes said possible biatrial inflammation. By this point, my chest ached constantly.  A close friend came to help take care of me on the evening of the 22nd, and I got so excited to see her that my heart rate spiked again. I lay down and did deep breathing and couldn?t talk to her or look at her until the next day without intense heart rate spikes, nausea, chest pain, and chest pressure.   I saw Dr. on the 23rd. He diagnosed me with orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia. He took my pulse while sitting (about 80, which is high for me, because my average resting pulse is usually in the high 40s/low 50s), and when standing. When I stood up, my pulse went to 120 and I became short of breath. He told me to drink pedialyte, ingest a lot of salt (he declined to recommend a specific amount), wear compression stockings, exercise while lying down, and ease myself back into activity. I should also keep my feet up as much as possible. I immediately started drinking a lot of pedialyte (a gallon to a gallon and a half a day), eating salty foods, and keeping my feet elevated.  I continued to be very fatigued with episodes of rapid heartbeat (though not as bad as I went to the ER for). I frequently got a squeezing feeling in my chest as if my heartbeat was irregular. I took my blood pressure regularly and it was usually low (90s/?). Anything that was remotely exciting spiked my heart rate. I could not watch TV, listen to music, game, talk on the phone, or even sit upright.All I could do was lie flat and play boring, unexciting games on my phone. This continued for weeks. I could only sleep on my back because sleeping on my side gave me a feeling that my heart was compressed and increased my heart rate. When I got out of bed, after a few seconds I would get black spots in my vision and a wave of tingling over my scalp and feel as if I were abot to pass out. Bending over and leaning on the counter for about 5-10 seconds makes this abate.  My friend had made me an appointment on April 28th, so I went to this appointment because I was not feeling better and wanted a second opinion. Dr. did not communicate as well, but seemed to agree with Dr. assessment. He prescribed fludrocortisone, metaprolol, and sertraline. He told me to take the fludrocortisone for two days before starting the metaprolol. The metaprolol seemed to help. It started keeping my heart beat irregularity/spike episodes from getting as high or lasting as long. Those have slowly diminished, though I still have a lesser version of them. The metaprolol also seemed to mostly end the squeezing feeling to my heart and irregular beat.  On the evening of the May 6th, my heart started beating very hard and fast. My blood pressure was 140/?. I stopped taking the fludrocortisone and ingesting salt. I also had a squeezing feeling at the bottom of my sternum. On the 7th, I was unable to take a full breath. Whenever I tried to inflate my lungs, the squeezing feeling at the bottom of my sternum would worsen and  keep my lungs from expanding. If I lay flat and only took shallow breaths, I didn?t notice anything, but as soon as I sat up or tried to stand, I could barely breathe. Dr. office referred me to the ER . At the ER, my blood pressure was 160/?. I was admitted to the hospital on the evening of the 7th and discharged on the 10th. During my stay, I was able to get temporary Medicaid to cover my hospital bills. Insurance through get covered would start on the first of June.  During my hospital stay, I lay flat constantly so I could breathe, and that symptom slowly lessened, though did not go away completely. I also started experiencing tension in my throat and jaw while lying flat on my back and could not find a comfortable sleeping position. I was seen by a cardiologist who ordered tests for me on the 8th and the tests were administered on the 10th.  I was briefly seen by a cardiologist, that morning and he said it was possible I had a hiatal hernia that was physically irritating my heart. At that time, my admitting doctor, told me nothing matched my symptoms and maybe it was anxiety. The discharge paper listed anxiety, depression, increased risk of falls, decreased cardiac output, high risk of bleeding, and orthostatic hypotension. Verbally, I was told I was a clot risk, but it was not on my discharge papers. I was not referred to psych or prescribed medication, or referred for an endoscopy, but discharged with the exact same symptoms I had been admitted for and told to follow up with a cardiologist in a couple weeks.  Over the course of the next couple weeks, without treatment, the tension in my chest slowly eased until I could breathe almost normally. Taking a deep breath still gives me a weird feeling of uncomfortableness and pressure in my chest, but only a deep one. I still get winded easily, but not fromstanding up or walking around my apartment. Bending over is hard. I started being able to carry things as long as they weren&#39;t heavy.  On May 18th and June 8th, I saw a primary care provider, who ordered more tests and referred me to a pulmonologist, endocrinologist (next week and the week after), psychiatrist and psychologist (but I am having trouble finding ones who will work with my insurance). I also saw a gastroenterologist, on the 21st, was prescribed Prilosec, and scheduled an endoscopy in early July.  I still have a lot of the same symptoms, some of them have lessened a little, and some are mostly gone. Fatigue is constant, shortness of breath, tightness in my throat, tightness at the bottom of my esophagus, and increased heartbeat are common. Nausea and stomach burning only occur occasionally, but I still have nearly constant discomfort at the bottom of my esophagus/top of my stomach. I constantly feel as if something is squeezing my throat. The very rapid heartbeat spikes seem to be almost entirely gone, thanks to the metaprolol, but there are still mild ones. Chest pressure occurs frequently, but usually goes away when I change position. Tightness at my jaw occurs cocurrently with the chest pressure. I can sleep on my side again, though it is still feels as if it increases my heart rate sometimes. I consider it an accomplishment that I can now sit upright most of the time most days. I sometimes have a few good hours in a day where I feel almost normal. I can walk on a flat surface for a short period of time, but going up even a slight incline causes heartbeat spikes and a feeling of my heart being squeezed and I have to stop immediately. Harder work like carrying heavy groceries or an extended period walking around a store would be impossible for me.  I still get black spots in my vision when I stand up, but only sometimes and have just kind of gotten used to it and expect to have to stop and bend over. Sitting upright without back support is uncomfortable and slumping at all increases the pressure at the bottom of my esophagus.  I am a massage therapist, but have been unable to work since this started. I can?t even take care of myself without the assistance of friends. I still don?t have a diagnosis that explains my symptoms.

                                                First received my 1st dose of Moderna Vaccine for Covid-19 on 01/15/2021 with slight headache few hours after vaccination, which I treated with counter the counter pain reliever. Second dose was on 02/21, with body chills and headaches that lasted 3 days. From waist up I also experienced upper body aches and soreness for 4 days, treated with over the counter pain reliever, symptoms were stubborn but went away after 4 days.  2 weeks later experienced chills between my right hips, that last about a week. Fast forward to 2 weeks at the ending of April 2021, I have been experiencing pains and aches in my heart, right on the left side of my chest. The pain, aches are heavy and tight, sometimes it last all day none stop like yesterday and today, most of the time it keeps me up all night, very achy, heavy and uncomfortable to sleep. Sometimes I wake up with the same pain. It has causes shortness of breath for me,  fast heart beats and flutters with no reasonable explanation other than the Modern Covid-19 vaccine I took in 02/2021. I have never experienced anything like this in my entire life, was not sick before the vaccination either.  Went to the Emergency room last week, and currently waiting on my cardiologist appointment which I was referred to by the attending ER medical doctor.

I had my husband bring me to the ER immediately. There I they checked my BP and it went down to 130/90 my normal BP Is usually 110/60-70. They started an iV I got a blood draw abs it showed an elevated d dimer of .6 so they completed a Chest X-ray and CT scan came back normal. Not sure what was going on but it felt like my heart was rubbing on something and had slight pains. I eventually got discharged home. Fr time to time my chest still feels a ?rub? but not anymore. I then completed my second set of covid vaccine a month later.

Dry cough developed as well at that time. Through the day severe body aches, fatigue and fever/chills developed and progressed. I was unable to sleep as a result. Today severs body aches and fever/chills continue as well as headache that does not resemble the chronic migraines I normally have. Tightness in chest and dry, nonproductive cough continue as well. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue. Injection site is hot, red, and raised- pain with left arm movement as a result.

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after first covid vaccine I was nauseous, muscle cramps in whole right arm (the side I was given the shot), migraine, dizzy, trouble lifting arm, redness swelling and pain at injection site.  Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes, but no more than 7 minutes after I received the vaccine I felt odd, like something was about to happen. I felt a bit detached from my body and my surroundings.  I then felt a flush of heat and my throat suddenly closed up. I felt frozen, as if I couldn?t have drawn in a breath if I had wanted to. I quickly removed my mask and sat up in my chair and leaned forward. After approximately 8-10 seconds my throat opened up and I could breathe.  At this time I felt my heart was racing; I could feel my pulse in my neck without putting my hand to my throat. I started to take my pulse at this time and I could feel that my heart rate was beating fast, but was slowing down back to a normal rate. It took approximately 2 minutes for my heart rate to normalize.  I could now breathe, but my throat still felt a little tight, but I wasn?t completely sure. My throat felt as though I had a lump in it and it felt a little difficult to swallow. I wasn?t completely sure it was the vaccination or that I may have been thirsty. I sat for 15 minutes and I felt fine, no other issues. I had to go to a doctor?s appointment where they took my blood pressure (approximately 1 hour after the vaccination) and said that my bp was normal.   I left the appointment at 4:00 pm and noticed that it was no longer difficult to swallow. I noticed that my throat felt different. The feeling of the ?lump? was gone and I could swallow much more easily. It was at this time that I realized my throat had still been swollen. It had taken almost 2 hours from the time of injection for my throat to feel normal again.  I am healthy, have had several vaccinations in the past and have no known allergies. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I contacted my PCP the next day once they were open to describe my symptoms. She said that I should proceed with the second dose next month, but should take some precautions first.   I didn?t alert anyone immediately after the vaccination as I?ve never had this sort of reaction and wasn?t entirely sure of what it was. I was also in route to a doctor?s appointment and figured if necessary, could receive treatment there. My PCP advised me to take 2 Benadryl and a Zyrtec one hour before the next vaccination. She also advised that I wait for 30 minutes in the observation area following the next dose.   It is Monday evening and as of now I have had no other adverse effects. I have had minimal arm pain and no other effects at all.

                                                After my 15 min wait, I ate a yogurt and then my throat started feeling funny. A coworker told me I had hives. I couldn&#39;t swallow, couldn&#39;t feel my lips. I went back to where I received the vaccine and was given Benadryl. I waited 30 min and my throat closed again. I was given more Benadryl and I had to wait again. I eventually went home and slept the rest of the day. I woke up feeling like  I was hit by a bus. I was sweating with chills for two days.  I slowly got better. The muscle ache took longer to go away and I was eventually able to return to work on Monday. I was having problems with my throat. The allergy specialist had me doing breathing exercises and it eventually got better.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

                                                I began having mild, localized left axilla pain and anterior shoulder joint pain at 24 hours post injection.   Over the next 24 hours (ie 48 hours post injection) the symptoms progressed to severe sharp, stabbing pain radiating to the left lateral neck along the jaw line, left anterior shoulder, left chest wall and along the left ribcage approximately T2/3 down to T9/10.  Also experienced gnawing-type stomach pain with some nausea at this time.  At the height of symptoms (approx 36 hours post injection), pain level was 9/10 and described as knifelike, sharp, and stabbing.  It was exacerbated by movement, particularly cough, sneeze, and hiccup.  Relieving factors included heat to the ice, but mild relief.  Pain levels began to diminish between hours 48 and 72 post-injection. By 72 hours post injection the jaw and left neck pain had resolved.  The left anterior shoulder/axilla and chest wall pain persisted, but severity had reduced from 9/10 to 4-5/10.  At 96 hours post injection severity had diminished to 2/10 with pain only at the left chest wall approximately T4/5 down to T9/10.  I am now 3.5 days out from injection and have pain level of 1/10 to the left chest wall with hiccup, sneeze, cough, and deep breath.

                                                20 min later of vaccination the back of my tongue started getting swollen. I felt like my throat was closing. I felt like I was going to pass out &amp; I felt very dizzy. I went to the Hospital the same day and they said that everything looked red inside my mouth and to follow up with my primary the next day. They gave me an IV. The dizziness continued for a few days &amp; then I got very shaky the next day it lasted for a week but the swelling came down the next day.

                                                Client received her second dose of Moderna vaccine and was sitting in her car for the 15 minutes post-vaccination period. Ten minutes into the wait time, she started experiencing difficulty breathing and stated: ?I felt like something was going through my body.? She also stated that she felt ?shaky.? Her first dose of the vaccine was uneventful and she has no history of anaphylaxis. She denied any itching or rash. Her vital signs were as follows: BP=136/83; Pulse=80; Respiration=18. 911 was called and the Medical staff arrived and evaluated her. They decided, with the client, that she did not need to be transported to the hospital.

                                                I received my vaccine, sat in a chair facing the clock and noted it said 5:00pm.  Within a minute I notice tingling and slight numbness of my soft palate.  I found this odd, but didn&#39;t notice any swelling or difficulty breathing.  At 5:02 I texted my husband to make sure my Epipen was in the glove compartment in case I needed it later after leaving the vaccination clinic.  Over the next few minutes the numbness increased and started to spread to my oropharynx area.  I noticed my heart beating faster and wondered if my body was subconsciously anxious about the numb feeling even though I didn&#39;t feel worried because I was breathing fine.  Very suddenly my heart started to pound very hard, my entire laryngopharynx went numb and I felt like a deck of cards was sitting in the back of my throat.  I looked at the clock, it was 5:07.  I started to feel dizzy and weak, my heart felt like it was about to explode, my hands were suddenly cold, clammy and shaking, I started to get sharp stomach pains similar to other anaphylactic events, but still no effects on my breathing. I looked at the clock, 5:09, I knew I had to tell someone before I couldn&#39;t get up to walk.  As I started to talk to a staff member I felt very disoriented and suddenly went from feeling like I was going to faint to very hypertensive with pain shooting into my left arm.  The staff quickly tooth my BP and HR, I noted my BP was 166/100 (I am normally 114/72) and the doctor stated I was too tachycardic and needed to go to the ER.  At the ER I received Benadryl, Pepcid and an IV, but never needed any epinephrine.  The medications resolved numbness and stomach pain.  I left with the feeling of a tight turtleneck around my throat and it continues to come and go.  Every 6-8 hours I have had to take Benadry and a steroid to keep the intense itching numb feeling in my soft palate away.  I still have tightness around my neck that returns every 6-8 hours, but still no airway or edema issue.  I felt like I had anaphylaxis without the edema.

                                                Within a minute, there was a different taste in my mouth. Shortly after, began to feel incredibly hot, flushed, burning, and tingling throughout body. Throat and tongue also became tingly. It was like a wave that moved through my body. After waiting it for a few minutes to see if there was improvement, there was a strong ?wave? that came with all of the above, but my heart started racing with palpitations. HR was 120. The heat feeling became worse. Would describe the feeling as a CT contrast feeling, including the feeling of voiding or heat/burning of the bladder. Tongue and throat more tingly. A few minutes later the feeling all became stronger and this is what became the strongest ?wave? of the feeling with my heart beating incredibly fast. The heat/burning/tingling (including the mouth and tongue) were severe. HR 148. Nauseated and lightheaded/dizzy. Transferred to ED.   In the ER, epi was administered due to the persisting flushing/burning of the skin/and tingling of the throat and tongue with tachycardia. IV fluid bolus, Benadryl, and zofran were also administered. Tryptase was obtained approximately 35 - 45 minutes after injection. Tryptase 10.8. Improvement in all symptoms following epi/benadryl.    Was monitored in the ER and within approximately 1.5 hours, the burning feeling returned, but was centralized in my core (felt internal versus skin). Abdomen/chest area with intermittent burning. At approximately 2-3 hours, the tingling began to return. Slight tingling of the tongue, lip. The burning feeling continued to worsen, now back to the skin as well as the core, and additional benadryl was administered in addition to solu-medrol. Prior to this, the attending physician was concerned that my heart rate remained elevated into the 110/120s 3 hours after the epi administration and she recommended transfer to an adult facility for further evaluation. Due to the burning in my chest, EKG was obtained. Sinus tachycardia. Slight chest tightness, duoneb provided. Had not taken inhalers throughout the day and felt similar to tight chest/difficulty getting deep breath in relation to asthma. Relief after the second dose of benadryl and duoneb.   BP remains elevated from shortly after vaccine administration.   Transferred to MVH at 4-5 hours post vaccine. En route to facility, HR 130s and BP lower (90s/60 and 90s/50s) - Medic did not think was accurate BP. At MVH, cardiac rule out completed with additional EKG due to development of some chest pains and return of core burning sensation as well as ongoing tachycardia. EKG remains sinus tach, troponins normal. Requested anxiety medication to see if that would help with heart rate. Low dose ativan given. Minimal change to resting heart rate, still elevated. Also received 4 baby aspirin and tylenol for extreme headache. Oxygen saturations  were 97-100%. Oxygen saturation at MVH was 90-93%. Attending physician not concerned with going home and saturation still being low 90s as long as there was no shortness of breath. Discharged home with methylprednisone 4 mg 6 day pack and pepcid prescriptions. Resting HR was low 100s at time of discharge. Instructed to continue with antihistamines every 6 hours. DX anaphylactic reaction.    Husband checking on me while sleeping, oxygen saturation in sleep 89-91%. After awakening, saturation improved to 94-95%.   At home, burning skin and core feelings persisted. Tingling of the throat/tongue/lips continued to be intermittent. Antihistamines helped to relieve symptoms. 26-28 hours after vaccine, symptoms were very strong, was suffering from extreme burning and tingling of the mouth/lips. Considered return to ER but oxygen saturation was okay. HR elevated. 125 at rest. MVH attending physician encouraged me to try to not use the prednisone packet unless necessary/return of symptoms. Started prednisone with the return of symptoms.    Continued on routine Benadryl until myoclonic jerking became too pronounced, discontinued on 12/25/2020 and changed to hydroxyzine. Jerking remained but improved and was less bothersome. Continued taking daily dose of Claritin, daily pepcid, daily aspirin. Hives developed 12/25/2020.   Return to ER on 12/29/2020 as the jerking was intense and felt to be in chest along with palpitations. EKG and troponin was good, only notable thing physician reported on labs was an elevated WBC count. Did not discuss jerking.    To PCP on 1/4/2020 - discussed adverse reaction. Continued problems after vaccine include: intermittent tachycardia (low 100s at rest occasionally vs norm of 70s/ low 80s), higher heart rate when active, burning skin (feels similar to bad sunburn feeling), random pains and occasional brief numbness/tingling/tremoring in muscles/extremities, jerking (continues to improve - recommended change off of benadryl/hydroxyzine to zyrtec), increased need for inhaler, bubbling sensation in left lower abdomen. It does feel as if it comes in waves.    Burning sensation, internal tremors of left upper thigh, and intermittent tachycardia continue, 1 month post vax.   Antihistamines do help, but discontinued due to jerking. Continue on daily claritin.

I was unable to lay down, sit, walk, or stand without being in extreme pain. I had difficulty breathing and was gasping for air. My asthma pump was not effective. Drinking water made it feel worst. Using the bathroom had no benefit. I called 911.  The Fire Department arrived first and administered oxygen, which was ineffective and the pain was increasing.  I was taken via ambulance to Hospital. When I arrived to the hospital; I submitted to a urine sample. I was given Saline in an IV in my right arm.  I was given 3 Tylenol tablets of 975mg. I did a series of blood work, Covid-19 testing, had an X-Ray of my chest, Ultrasound of my abdomen; CT scan of my chest, abdomen, and pelvis w/contrast, and an EKG was performed.  The outcome was a 3mm right middle lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule and negative for Covid-19.  The hospital gave me a pamphlet for shortness of breath and told me to follow up with my primary doctor.

She had a tingling inside her mouth behind her teeth.  She was administered Benadryl.  She then got a tingling inside of the throat that moved down into her chest.  First Response team  was called.  She was having SOB.  She was moved to the ER where she was given more Benadryl and prednisone.  After that she had tingling in her lips as they were warm and puffy.  She was released around noon.  About 1:00 PM the same day pt started having SOB and the same bad taste in her mouth along with all of the other symptoms.  She took another Benadryl at 1:54 PM.

                                                I did initially feel a little light headed while waiting the 15 minutes post vaccine, but thought I was anxious. As I was driving home at 3:50 pm I suddenly started to feel tingling in my lips and my throat felt swollen and my chest tight. I was halfway home and panicked so I went home and stayed put. My throat started to relax but my chest felt tight and I was dizzy and light headed till about 9pm. My lips ended up getting a little swollen and I?m still having a burning sensation in my cheeks and chin and my lips are still itchy.  I am a nurse and my husband is a physician and we had an epi pen on hand so I didn?t feel the need to go to the hospital as I was in good care but it was terrifying.

Woke up at 4 am Tuesday morning with shortness of breath, sweating, headache, dizziness and nausea. Waited it out until I felt I could breathe normally and went back to sleep. Felt a little better after a few hours of rest but some chills continued throughout the day.  Currently experiencing a sore throat as well. I have also developed 3 ulcers in my mouth since getting the vaccine.

Patient wasn&#39;t sure but was thinking her throat might be tightening up, at which point I gave her 50mg of liquid oral Benadryl (7:40pm) just to see how patient will respond and EMT was alerted.  Patient said she was feeling better but few minutes later she said that she felt that her throat might be getting worse, at which point I gave her Epipen 0.3mg (7:45pm) just as EMT arrived. EMT automatically took over and few minutes later took the patient to the hospital.

                                                I received the vaccination on 3/25. On 3/26 and 3/27 I experienced vaccination site soreness, which began to dissipate on 3/28. On 3/29 and 3/30 I experienced a persistent headache and also newly appearing red splotches at the injection site that went away within 48 hours. Then, on 3/30 I also began to experience extreme fatigue and felt &#34;foggy,&#34; which persisted on 3/31. During the night of 3/31-morning of 4/1, I woke up multiple times during the night alternating between hot flashes and cold sweats and feeling slightly short of breath, and my eyes were very bloodshot upon fully awakening. I recorded a temperature of 99.9 degrees F the morning of 4/1 and still felt fatigued, so I called off of work and slept most of the day. By the evening of 4/1 I felt entirely better, as if nothing had happened. I want to note that I was diagnosed with a mild case of COVID-19 during early December 2020, so I wanted to submit my vaccination experience in case you are disaggregating side effect data by whether or not patients have previously had COVID-19. Of course I cannot be sure that my symptoms were definitively related to the vaccine, but if they were then the duration of symptoms seems quite lengthy.

Had some breaking out on her face along with small amount of injection site pain. Hasn&#39;t had any reactions in the past. Discussed based on timing and symptoms, likely was reaction to COVID vaccine. Little chance of anaphylaxis at this point but call 911 if this happens. Steroids and hydroxyzine prescribed.

Then the next day, I was in tachycardia while resting. Climbing the stairs at home, my heart rate was above 140 BPM. I was trying to not move around alot to  keep my heart rate down. It was an uncomfortable feeling. I called my doctor and had a video visit on 01/18/2021 and the on 01/21/2021 my heart rate was up over 100 BPM while just sitting. It felt like something was off with the biochemistry of my body. I saw Cardiology on 01/22/2021 and on 01/23/2021 they sent me to see a POTTS specialists. When I took a shower on 01/25/2021 my heart rate went up and my nervous system was activated. I started taking cold showers afterwards. It seems to help. On 01/29/2021 I started getting tingling in my feet that moved to my hands. It flairs up when I am stressed. On 02/27/2021 I had bloodwork that shows my ANA as POS with the numbers greater than 2,560.  I know that 6 months prior, I had NEG ANA results.  I also experienced fatigue, trouble sleeping and brain fog.

                                                Initially pain all over and muscle and joint pain that started passing over first 3 days, on 4th day symptoms subsided but noticed charley horse in right leg, persisted for 4 days and started treating as if blood clot by drinking water, raising leg, taking Aleeve, and hot pad so symptoms subsided. Began having difficulty breathing even though symptoms passing so still concerned by the 10th day sought medical treatment and testing for clot. Diagnosis was dehydration likely caused by menstruating at same time as vaccination. Prescribed nsaid and muscle relaxer to reduce symptoms and action plan for increasing water and natural iron intake prior to next dose to prevent more dangerous complications. Had hospitalization for SARS in 2009 and also treated for dehydration, did not consider the vaccine might have a similar effect to the prior infection since I was coughing so hard I was vomiting up all water for 3 days, but my vaccine symptoms were VERY similar to the 2009 illness in slow mo without the coughing including the pain and nausea (hospital could only confirm it was an unknown coronavirus at the time my roommate brought from another county, he was a another race native and very ill but was not hospitalized and didn?t disclose he was sick so he wouldn?t miss the start of the semester in quarantine, flew anyway and didn?t tell us until I was hospitalized). Still dehydrated at 2 weeks after vaccine (today) but functionally symptom free at this time. Menstruation was normal, lighter flow than usual, and lasted 7 days which is normal for me post-IUD. Symptoms persisted after period stopped but progressively improved thereafter, unclear if because of home care for potential clot or because no longer menstruating so better able to retain water.

No hx of nosebleeds (ever), no history of trauma of the toenail bed.  No other bruising or bleeding noted.   Timeline: I started to have chills ~8hours after receiving the 2nd vaccine on 2/5 and took a baby aspirin.  For the next 24-36 hours, I had severe chills, myalgias, my joints felt like they were going to dislocate, hyperesthesia, severe pounding (9/10) headache like my head was about to burst.  On 2/7 the bleeding occurred, and was short of breath when walking, neck/trunk spasms, partial numbness of my upper back, with those symptoms lasting about 24 hours.

Sunday morning, all had resolved except sore arm and fatigue. Sunday evening, I was laying in bed and found everytime I took a deep breath- even a shallow one- I had shooting  debilitating and sharp pain in my lung . It was absolutely terrible and I have never experienced this prior or since.  The episode lasted about an hour, and then resolved. Visited my doctor and she said it was likely due to the vaccine.

                                                2 days after the vaccine (on 2 May), I woke with an accelerated heart rate, chest pain, tightness of chest and shortness of breath.  I presented to MD where they took my vitals and an EKG.  The doctor called an ambulance for me as she assessed I was potentially displaying signs of pulmonary embolism.  The ambulance took me to the emergency department.  I ultimately stayed there two nights, and following many tests was diagnosed with acute pericarditis versus myopericarditis.  My admitting doctor and the cardiologist both advised that while they could not be 100% certain, the pericarditis could very well be an adverse reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  The admitting doctor told me she would report it as an adverse reaction. I am now on colchacine anti-inflammatory medication for 3 months and have one follow-up with the cardiologist to come.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS (felt out of it) and ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) in a 35-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 053C27A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below. Concurrent medical conditions included Smoker and Detergent sensitivity (Thirteen years ago, contact allergies with Woolite and Tide laundry detergent) since 2008. Concomitant products included AMFETAMINE ASPARTATE, AMPHETAMINE SULFATE, DEXAMFETAMINE SACCHARATE, DEXAMFETAMINE SULFATE (ADDERALL) for an unknown indication. On 30-Apr-2021 at 11:12 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 30-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS (felt out of it) (seriousness criteria medically significant), ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy), FEEDING DISORDER (unable to eat until 4pm) and DYSPNOEA (hard time breathing). On 30-Apr-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient experienced OROPHARYNGEAL DISCOMFORT (throat started to clamp up). On 01-May-2021, the patient experienced PHARYNGEAL SWELLING (throat started to get a little swollen), THROAT IRRITATION (throat started to get a little itchy) and OROPHARYNGEAL PAIN (Sore throat). On 30-Apr-2021 at 4:00 PM, FEEDING DISORDER (unable to eat until 4pm) had resolved. At the time of the report, ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS (felt out of it), ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy) and OROPHARYNGEAL DISCOMFORT (throat started to clamp up) was resolving and DYSPNOEA (hard time breathing), PHARYNGEAL SWELLING (throat started to get a little swollen), THROAT IRRITATION (throat started to get a little itchy) and OROPHARYNGEAL PAIN (Sore throat) outcome was unknown. The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown. The patient has never had a reaction to vaccines or latex.  After waiting in the vaccinating provider&#39;s observation area, she felt fine. On the drive home she felt dizzy and a little out of it. Her Epi-Pen had expired. She took Claritin and laid down to see if the reaction would get better or worse. The symptoms got better 2.5-3 hours (3:30-4pm) later. Things were better and she felt fine. She took Claritin for a total of 4 days following the injection. She did contact her healthcare professional, who referred her to an allergist and her appointment with the allergist is pending. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Anaphylactic reaction is consistent with the product safety profile; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Anaphylactic reaction is consistent with the product safety profile.

                                                After the 1st dose, I had chills and had trouble walking. My legs moved incredibly slow. The arm pain lasted for 2-3 weeks and was INCREIDBLY bad. Soon after I got the additional vaccine (second dose) 5/4/21. I?ve been having bowel issues since then, and some numbing in limbs on and off.. but stomach issues every day... yesterday morning I thought I woke up with a HUGE migraine and nausea. Soon after I felt like my breathing was difficult. I felt like something was on my chest. I got up and took a shower/ didn?t work and I felt too weak. So I headed downstairs because my husband had just left. I grabbed my phone and felt like I should call an ambulance. My arm was going numb and my legs too. I woke up on the bathroom floor and dialed 911. My body was shutting down on me and I could feel it. Tingles all over my body. By the time the paramedics got there I couldn?t control my arms or legs AT ALL. My arms curled up into my chest mangled looking and so much pain. I couldn?t get words out and had ZERO ability to move my arms or legs, paramedics told me my PaC02 was 10. I am currently being evaluated and treated for a stroke with ZERO prior heart conditions. Additionally, I have a pain in my left arm where the injection was. Anything magnetic hurts it. Anything metal sticks to it. Forks, knives, Bobby pins, coins, magnets. They all stick to the site.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of ANAPHYLACTOID REACTION (Anaphylactoid reaction) in a 35-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 041L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: FLU VACCINE VII. Concurrent medical conditions included Egg allergy and Allergy to vaccine (flu vaccine).   On 04-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 04-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTOID REACTION (Anaphylactoid reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DYSPNOEA (Dyspnoea), SWOLLEN TONGUE (Swollen tongue) and THROAT TIGHTNESS (Throat tightness). At the time of the report, ANAPHYLACTOID REACTION (Anaphylactoid reaction), DYSPNOEA (Dyspnoea), SWOLLEN TONGUE (Swollen tongue) and THROAT TIGHTNESS (Throat tightness) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medication reported. Waiting on the EMS to arrive the patient started having rebound anaphylaxis so was given shot of another EpiPen. Patient was then put into EMS and left for the hospital.

Within 2 hours my whole body turned into one big hive and my asthma flared up. This lasted approximately 30 hours. 3 days after receiving the shot I developed &#34;Covid arm&#34; that lasted 3 days. I took consistent doses of Benadryl and Proair (albuterol) inhaler. I chose not to go to the ER because there was a reported 9 hour wait to be seen.

                                                Less than an hour after I received the shot, I started feeling nauseous, dizzy, lightheaded, confused/brain fog (I literally felt drunk), hot and cold flashes and generally unwell. The next day, I woke up with a sore throat and a head cold. The brain fog, bad nausea, internal temp issues and general unwell feeling lasted through Saturday. The SCARIEST part was that it felt like my heart hurt when I was breathing on the fourth day. The entire experience was the exact same as the first shot, except that it took a little longer to feel sick and that my heart hurt MUCH worse. It was terrifying, because it hurt to breathe and I literally feared for my life. I currently have a shoulder injury, so I took ibuprofen (800 mg) and the heart pain went away and stayed away. I also experienced visual hallucinations!! It was kind of scary because I live alone. I strongly believe my body responded to the vaccine with inflammation - hence the heart issues and hallucinations. I&#39;m really concerned about these things for future covid vaccines, so please contact me about this. Thanks!

                                                An hour and a half after receiving the first dose of the vaccine, I started experiencing pressure on the front of my throat, but I ignored it. I thought it was just a sore throat that I was getting. I had been having sore throats on and off for months. Now that I&#39;m thinking about it, I could have had a reaction immediately after getting the vaccine. I dismissed my high heart rate as anxiety. I started to feel weak and I have an apple watch and I checked my heart rate and it jumped to the mid 130&#39;s right after I received the vaccine. I had a weird day where I felt like I had insomnia. My stomach was hurting and I couldn&#39;t sleep. The next day, my arm swelled from my elbow to my shoulder. I was very tired throughout the day and had a headache. On 03/29/2021, I went to see my doctor and he told me that I had COVID arm. He told me to not worry about it and told me to make sure I received my 2nd dose. My arm became worse after that. The following day, I started having joint pain, with heart palpitations. I experience costochondritis, from time to time, and when I would breathe in, I would have pressure. During all of this time, the pressure in my throat continued for all of these days. My PCP, ordered me to have a test to have my throat looked at. I started having numbness and pinching pains on my left side. The left side of my face became numb. I felt like someone had run me over with a car on my left side. My whole left side of my body was in pain. I went to have my throat ultrasound. They noticed a small nodule and did a biopsy. The doctor said that he thought I had a lot of inflammation in my throat because I felt the needle as he injected it into my throat. I started to become very worried about choking to death. I went to and ENT and he took a scope down my throat and said that I have a lot of inflammation. I went to the ER on 04/15 at 11PM and I was there until 5AM on 04/16. I went because of the constant pain I was experiencing. I was having to swallow to breathe. They provided me with some medicine in an IV, maybe an anti-inflammatory, and it helped. After receiving this I could feel things starting to slow down. I&#39;m not sure if it was the medicine or that this had run it course. I could finally breath again though. By the time this has happened, it was time for my second dose. I called my allergist and asked him to test me before I got my 2nd dose. I went in and that is when he confirmed that I am allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG). My doctor and I decided to do an antibody test to see if the first vaccine helped at all. I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;m able to receive a booster vaccine.

                                                So the day after my vaccine, in the morning, I was so exhausted and felt horrible I had a temperature of around 101. I was just like so tired and loss my sense of smell and taste. I had a little shortness of breath at first, headache, body aches and sore throat. I also experienced chest pain. This all slowly started and as the days went on I also experienced blurry vision and brain fog and swelling in my joints. For about the first three weeks after my injection I was literally in bed. I took unpaid leave because I just could not work and I maxed out my leave. I have a 2 and a 6 year old and it was just so painful that I could not move or get out of bed much. The pain in my body was horrible. After I lost my senses on that Monday, on May 3rd 2021 I went to get a Covid test and sure enough it came back positive on the rapid test. The fatigue is debilitating and I am still not working. On May 12 2021 I went to the ER for chest tightness, shortness of breath and fatigue, my oxygen levels were low. The ER DR took me off work for another week and then I ended up seeing my PCD on I think May 18th 2021, she ordered speech and physically therapy for me. PEM (protein-energy malnutrition) is what she diagnosed me with, specific to Covid-19. I am now on FMLA leave and that started on I think the 12th or the 18th of May 2021, this really messed me up with my memory and stuff so I am not sure. I have 8 weeks of physical therapy scheduled once per week. I was also referred to a Cardiologist. I saw a nutritionist on June 9th 2021 because I gained weight due to being in bed long term. They started me on an anti-inflammatory diet. On June 10 2021 I saw a speech therapist. I was supposed to return June 18th 2021 but I could not begin again. I am only allowed to worked one day per week right now and am supposed to start on Friday. On July 14th 2021 I also have another cardiologist appointment scheduled.

                                                Got my second shot on June 14. On June 16 from the very morning started feeling extremely dizzy, had heart palpitations, chest pain when breathing and high heart rate (100 at rest). Spent the day in bed. Each time I would get up, I would feel as if I were going to faint. The next day felt better BUT when I was walking outside, I would get extremely dizzy, would have difficulties breathing, heart palpitations and my legs would become very heavy. At rest most of the symptoms would go away.  On June 18 I saw a doctor addressing my symptoms. The doctor suspected acid reflux but still wanted to do CT scan of lungs because I had stopped birth control pills a month or so before the vaccination. Also I was prescribed Pantoprazole. During the next two weeks I was getting much worse. The heart rate was racing ? 100-120 at rest, I was dizzy, not able to walk my dog or walk around the house at some days. Each time I walked I felt as if I was going to faint.  On June 1 I felt very dizzy walking around the house. Basically I could not take 5 steps without feeling dizzy. So I called an urgent care doctor. I was sent to have a blood test (to look for thrombosis signs) and EKG. The blood test came back normal. EKG was ?borderline? ? ?Borderline Right Axis Deviation Cors Axis &gt;90?.  On June 9 I got CT scan which came back normal. Still, I was very weak and dizzy.  On June 14 I was given a Holter monitor for 3 days (ending June 17). As if today, June 23 I don?t have the results from the monitor.  Today I feel better, however, I still have joint pain and my legs get extremely heavy and painful after performing daily routine activities.

                                                - First COVID shot on April 22. No immediate symptoms  - On May 2 morning, woke up with very strange chest/heart pain that I&#39;ve never felt before in my life. Few hours later felt strange sensations in chest area, almost sharp/stabbing. I had to stop working to walk around for several minutes before I started feeling better. Entire day felt light headed with chest pain  - May 3, felt the same thing. - May 4, same thing, so called my doctor. She said to come back if lasted more than 2 weeks - For the next few days (total about a week) I continued to experience strange heart symptoms: strange chest pain/sensation, heart palpitations, feelings of weakness, shortness of breath, light headedness. Overall, my heart felt &#34;weak&#34;

                                                I received the COVID-19 Moderna second dose vaccine on May 5, 2021, at around 1 pm. The night after the vaccine, I had the typical side effects from the vaccine, which are chills, arm pain, severe fatigue, headache, slight fever. By the second day, chills were subsiding but I still feel very fatigued until the afternoon. Then by the third day, which was May 7, 2021, at around 2 am, I started feeling some chest tightness, which at first I associated with back pain.  However, as the day progresses, I started feeling short of breath, on and off chest pain, and palpitations. I decided to go to the ED around 10:15 pm, due to shortness of breath, and chest pain was more pronounced. Upon my arrival in the ED, I was tachycardic at 110. I was triaged and the ED physician ordered did blood work including D-Dimer, EKG. EKG reveals sinus tachycardia. The blood work reveals an elevated D-Dimer which was 1.06. And due to elevated dimer, the physician ordered a CT scan chest which was negative for PE. Since I was still having some shortness of breath and chest pain, I was admitted as observation, for telemetry monitoring and repeat EKG. The following day, I was discharged since the chest pain was resolving. However, I continued to have palpitations for at least a week after the vaccination. At that time, the ED physicians were not sure if my symptoms and elevated dimer were related to the vaccination. I followed up with a cardiologist and my PCP a few days after the hospitalization. I followed up with the cardiologists because of my history of pulmonary hypertension 5 years ago which I believe was resolved, however, it was a concern for the ED physician, because at the time they were not sure of what is the cause of my symptoms. During my visit with the cardiologists, he believed that my elevated dimer was due to the vaccination (possibly due to the inflammatory response), as well as the symptoms I have which was pericardial pain. I did my echo last week, and I will need to do another blood test this week, to check my dimer, and cardiac enzymes.   And now, since I had the vaccination, I have not had my period for 18 days, which is very uncommon to me. I had my period a few days after the vaccine. All my pregnancy tests are negative. So I am scheduled to follow up with my OB-GYN. I believe that my delayed period is also related to the vaccine, but of course, I cannot conclude that until I see my physician and conduct all the tests needed.

                                                I received the vaccine at work Thursday {December 31st} morning, and started feeling sick that same evening. Including malaise, low grade fever..not higher than 99.6, mild sore throat, shortness of breath, dehydration/dry mouth, light-headedness/dizziness, runny nose, and coughing. These symptoms continued on and off from {12/31-and continued all throughout the weekend and continue as of today-01/04}. Fevers don&#39;t last long, they come and go. The main symptoms that are chronic and consistent are the runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath, and feeling tired/lethargic, just low energy.

I felt like my heart rate has been rapid all day and my rate of breathing has been slightly increased. The pain in my left arm, where I was given the injection is very sore to the point where it is difficult to lift or to touch. I was too weak to attempt to go to follow up with medical professionals today and opted to wait to see if symptoms resolved.

It lasted for about 30 minutes. The symptoms subsided while sitting back in a chair and drinking 2.5 bottles of water. I was able to walk out and proceed with grocery shopping slowly. Have taken it easy the rest of the day but able to be upright. Now just fatigue, muscle aches, feeling cold, abnormal teeth and tongue sensation x 2 hrs). The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt a warm tingling sensation in my throat. I alerted the nurse and about another 3-5 minutes afterwards felt like a rising sensation up toward my ears. It almost felt like I was being filled with something but could still breathe. I start to have a fast heartbeat and felt like I was sweating. I received Benadryl (IM) and felt relief about 1-2 minutes. After about 7-10 minutes I felt like it was coming back and the feeling rising back to my ears. I received another dose of Benadryl. I went home and made sure I continued the Benadryl  for 24 hours. My throat appeared swollen from the outside of my neck when I woke up from a nap about 3-4 hours after receiving the vaccine shot. My chest did have a little redness like hives but not full blown. Just red and irritated. The next morning my voice was very hoarse for a day and a half.

The patient was kept in observation until her symptoms subsided.

                                                MODERATE PAIN (6/10) AT INJECTION SITE began within 30 minutes of vaccine administration. Ibuprofen provided no pain relief, taken once 4 hours post-vaccine administration, and again 8 hours after. 24 hours after initial injection given, at work (I am a medical student rotating in neurology at the clinical site where the vaccine was administered), I felt severe pain at injection site (10/10), radiating toward my left shoulder blade. The pain was so severe, I could not continue my work. I applied an ice pack to my arm and took Ibuprofen, sat on the floor in the dark to wait for relief. I felt my heart racing, hyperventilating (likely due to pain), became diaphoretic, and experienced photophobia as well as tremulous shaking. After approximately 30 minutes, a supervisor found me and alerted emergency med techs on staff, who measured vitals and rushed me to the Emergency Department of our hospital. The pain began to subside to 5/10 after an hour in the ED, where I was treated with intravenous fluid (NS), diphenhydramine PO, and metoclopramide PO. I was stabilized, pain under control (3/10), and released approximately 3 hours after admission, at 3:15 PM.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

The above symptoms subsided some approximately 24 hours post vaccine and were resolved by approximately 40 hours post vaccine. However, 1 p.m. on 1/22, noticed injection site was itchy, red, swollen, and sore. Took Benadryl that evening and swelling subsided some by next morning and completely resolved by 1/25.

                                                Beginning the night of the 27th, I had a headache and a low-grade fever. I woke up in the middle of the night with a 102.7 fever, severe migraine, severe body aches, leg cramps, sore throat/swelling, and chills. I alternated taking ibuprofen and tylenol to try to control the pain, to no avail. I used bengay and cool washcloths for pain and to cool off. These did not help either. I made sure to keep drinking water and pedialyte. I took benadryl to try to sleep and help with my throat swelling up, it did not help.  All of this was non-stop until the morning of the 30th. That morning when I woke up my fever was going down and I no longer had the chills. I still had the severe headache, body pains, cramping, swollen/sore throat, and now diarrhea. Today is 2/1 and I am still experiencing severe body aches, severe headache, leg cramps, &#34;nerve pain&#34; type feeling in my arms, GI issues, and a sore/swollen throat.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

                                                Pt verbalized that she felt like her throat was tight. Pt assessed from head to toe, Distress denied. Pt had taken Benadryl 25 and prednisone prior to making room attendant RN aware. Upon auscultation, no wheezing noted. Pt blood pressure was 158/100, HR 128, o2 sat was 98%. Pt verbalized that her baseline HR was around 118 and that she had anxiety. Pt was diaphoretic upon exam and asked for a bottle of water. Pt&#39;s request was honored. Pt walked around the room to relieve her anxiety and said she felt better.   Her HR went down to 90 after walking around the room. Pt was offered IM diphenhydramine and refused. Pt also refused Ambulance to transfer her to ER. At 4:30 pm patient took another Benadryl PO without medical advice. Pt is a registered nurse and wanted to be transferred to ER, where she works, by another RN.  Pt left facility against medical advice and declined EMS at 4:40 pm.

I recovered very quickly, the illness lasted about 24 hours. Five days later (1/28) the same exact thing happened only worse, I experienced all symptoms listed above in addition to vomiting and extreme dizziness.  Again, my symptoms subsided pretty quickly but then 24 hours later I became achy, fatigued and developed a minor cough with shortness of breath.

At 9pm I was in bed and started to have chest tightness and pain with breathing. Both arms and hands started to go numb and tingling. I got to ER around midnight and all testing was negative.  I was hooked up to IV fluids which seemed to calm the chest pain and numbness. I got home around 3am and went to sleep.  By 7am I was having sore muscles and body aches. I was fatigued and having chills.  I was also running a low grade fever.   I continue on like this for 24 hours.  The next 24 hours I was fatigued.  By day 3 I felt like I was getting back to normal.

                                                Initial On Call Documentation 2/5/21 at 20:36:  Patient called after-hours line with complaint of swollen tongue 5 hours after her second Covid vaccine.  She reported initial lip swelling with the first vaccine.  She took Benadryl when she had lip tingling initially this afternoon.  However, now she is noting indentations on her tongue.  Heart rate around 125. Patient with no previous history of allergy and anaphylaxis. No epi-pen in home. Patient is tearful over the phone requesting advice. Discussed with patient that the safest option would be for her to report to urgent care versus ED for further evaluation and potential management for impending anaphylaxis, especially given lack of EpiPen in the home.  Patient voiced understanding and is getting a ride to an urgent care.  Follow Up Message from Patient 2/8/21 at 11:23:  Update: I developed sudden swelling of my tongue on Friday night approx. 4 hours after receiving my second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I spoke to on call Dr. She advised me to go to urgent care if still open or ER. Throat started to tingle on the way their urgent care. I was given a dose of EpiPen, Pepcid, Benadryl, and Solu-Medrol. They wrote prescriptions and recommended following up with you this week. I&#39;ve been taking prednisone, Benadryl, and Pepcid. Tongue is still a bit swollen, but it has not worsened. I now have two EpiPen&#39;s to use if needed.  Follow Up PCP Appt 2/11/21 at 15:46: S/O: Patient had the second COVID 19 vaccine on Friday 2/5 and she premedicated with 10mg of Pepcid 10mg and post medicated with Benadryl 25mg. Later that evening she was resting when she felt some swelling of her tongue.  She called the Dr who was on call and she was advised to go to the urgent care.  She felt some tingling of her throat on the way there.  She had no rash, difficulty breathing, or difficulty swallowing.  She was given Solu-Medrol, Benadryl and Pepcid IV and was given a dose of an Epi-pen.  She took Benadryl for 3 days.  She finished a round of 60mg daily prednisone (for 5 days) yesterday.  She felt jittery on the prednisone and this has persisted but is improving. She continues to have a feeling of chest pressure.  First dose Moderna 025J20A 1/8/21; second dose Moderna 031L20A 2/5/21.  She continues to note some mild swelling of her tongue but is otherwise improved.  She does continue to have some pressure type pain in her chest which is also somewhat improved and more diffuse in nature.  A/P: She is okay to taper off of her Benadryl.  She has an EpiPen should she need it, though I do not anticipate this being necessary.  She should note continued improvement in her symptoms to include the mild swelling that is persistent in her tongue.

On 2/9 those symptoms subsided, but I started to get right-sided flank pain with pain on inhalation. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital. I was admitted to a different hospital on 2/12 and continue to antibiotic s and a heparin drip

I, became aware at about 1:15 there was some concern.  I spoke with patient she was having some trouble answering questions and appeared in moderate distress.  She reported to me having some SOB after her first dose.  Dr. had been contacted already.  At 1:19PM the patient appeared to have trouble catching her breath and reported SOB was worse than with first dose.  At this point I decided to administer 0.3mg of epinephrine as a precaution due to significant SOB.  Dr. came on the scene shortly after, the patient was monitored a bit longer, HR increased then decreased with oxygen.  The decision was made to contact EMS.

                                                After my vaccine the Aid didn?t have any chairs or places to wait so they suggested I go to my car and wait 10 min.  I went to my car and about 5 min after my shot I began to feel tingling in my cheeks like they were going numb  and weak and constriction in my throat.  Swallowing water took effort.  I was scared my throat was closing so I immediately went to urgent care.  They took my vitals and gave me Benadryl and steroids (medrol dose pack).  I went home and had flu symptoms (chills, fatigue etc, which was expected).  But the tightness in my throat didn?t release.  Could breathe through my nose but more difficult through my mouth.   My cheeks and face were numb making it difficult to chew food for at least  2 weeks and I had tightness in my throat as well during that time including difficulty swallowing due to weakness.

She called her PCP on 3/11/21 and did  a virtual visit.   Her PCP gave her  steroid eye drops.  (She neglected to tell her PCP that she recently had  the COVID vaccine). Symptoms progressed with eyes swelling shut, itchy throat, wheezing and on  3/14 her throat started closing and she could not breath.  She went to urgent care on  3/14 and was given oral steroids. Today she is feeling much better.

At 11:00 a.m. this morning she received her 1st dose of the COVID vaccine and began to feel her throat closing.  Immediately she received 1 dose of IM epinephrine.  Approximately 15 minutes after that she received a 2nd dose of epinephrine by IM.  EMS was activated and she was brought to the emergency room.  She was stable and received 50 mg of Benadryl by IV during transport.  She denies shortness of breath or nausea.  was rather concerning that her chest pressure began after the administration of the epinephrine.  She denies shortness of breath, nausea, or other concerning findings for anaphylaxis minus the throat swelling.  It is unclear whether this was truly anaphylaxis or other.  Upon arrival to the emergency room she was rather stable and a thorough workup was initiated.  With her reports of the chest pressure I felt that a cardiac workup was indicated with concerns that the epinephrine may have caused her a cardiac event.  Initial troponin was negative, and a 2 hour troponin was warranted as her symptoms were less than an hour prior to arrival to the emergency room.  The 2 hour troponin did show a delta of 16 and changing.  At this time I informed the patient of the results and recommended a 6 hour troponin.  She was understandable and willing to comply.  She did have a low potassium at 2.9 and received to 40 mEq doses of oral potassium replacement.  Her magnesium is 1.6, and a corrected magnesium was calculated at 1.78 with her albumin at 4.4.  The patient was stable and comfortable throughout the evaluation in the emergency room.  She did not exhibit hypotension, nausea, vomiting or other concerning findings for anaphylaxis.  She did receive Solu-Medrol, and Pepcid while in the emergency room.  I did consider administering Benadryl, but she did receive 50 mg of IV Benadryl in the ambulance on the way to the emergency room.  The 6 hour troponin was reassuring and unchanging.  The patient was then discharged home with follow-up precautions and instructions follow-up with a primary care provider.

                                                After the first dose on 2-23, I experienced a tickle in my throat within minutes. It was difficult to swallow but I did not have trouble breathing. My tongue and throat felt swollen. The nurse suggested I stay longer. I drank a bottle of water, which helped. I stayed 45 minutes until the symptoms seemed to start to go away. The nurse directed me to take Benadryl before the second shot. I took Benadryl and still experienced the symptoms above, but to a lesser extent. I looked at my throat and tongue in the mirror and saw what looks like a rash/pustules on the back of my throat and top of my tongue way in the back of my mouth. The symptoms are slowing going away (I received the second dose 7.5 hours ago), but I thought reporting them may help in some way. Thank you for making this vaccine available and thank you for all you?re doing to help keep others safe.

Client noticed an instant metallic taste in her mouth with tingling after injection but didn&#39;t really think to report it.  She was home at 4:10 and started to experience burning and swelling in her mouth and throat.  She took 25 mgs of Benadryl at home.  Symptoms did not improve and seemed to be getting worse so she called 911 and was transported to Medical Center for treatment.

                                                On 3/1/2021, received second dose at 3:15pm and at 3:45pm driving home from work I developed chest pains and went to urgent care. I got there by 5:30pm and they ran an EKG; results were normal. On 3/2/2021, I left work at 2:30pm feeling ill and when I got home by 3:30pm I had flu symptoms. Symptoms were body aches, headache, fever, chills, nausea. This lasted for 24 hours. When I woke up on 3/4/2021, I was just tired with chest pains. I went to work and on my way home at 3:45pm shortness of breath started with increased chest pains. I went to urgent care and they told me to head to the ER. I got to the ER by 6pm. They ran blood work, EKG and Chest X-ray; results all normal. I followed up with PCP. I was out of work from 3/5/2021 to 3/12/2021. PCP thought I might have COVID. Took PCP test on 3/9 and results were negative. I was able to return to work on 3/15/2020 but still had shortness of breath and chest pains as well as feeling exhausted all the time. Due to no change, PCP provided me with script for Echocardiogram, Exercise Stress Test, inhaler as needed and to see Pulmologist.  Waiting on insurance company to approve echocardiogram and pulmologist appointment is 3/29/2021. It has been challenging to complete daily living activities like washing dishes, showering, climbing 20 stairs to my apartment, laundry, walking to the postal mailbox, etc. I get easily tired and winded. Prior to 3/1, I was healthy and exercising 3x&#39;s a week, walking 4 miles and hiked with no issues for the past year ranging 3.5-7 miles with incline.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

                                                Chest pain began on 3/22 around 2 pm with what initially felt like allergies--chest congestion and heaviness in chest. As the day progressed, pain set in to the degree that sleeping was uncomfortable both because of challenges breathing and because finding a spot that wasn&#39;t painful was challenging. Upon waking on 3/23, the pain was significant and continued to worsen between waking at 7 am with trouble breathing and being in a high level of pain along with disorientation by 9 am. I went to the emergency room at this time, where they performed a series of lab tests, imaging tests, cardiac monitoring, EKG 12 lead, and administered medications. No cause was found and I was sent home with prescriptions for an NSAID and an inhaler. The chest pain persisted off and on for two weeks prior to the emergency room visit.

The patient is on clonazepam, she took a pill, but she insisted on getting the Epipen as well as she was getting worse and worse. I had to give her a dose of IM Epinephrine. Few minutes later, she started breathing normally again. I monitored her for two hours at the pharmacy and I was checking her vitals and heart rate. Everything was back to normal by 11 am. She went home safe afterwards.

This persisted throughout the day. The fainting feeling was accompanied by dizziness, nausea, drop in BP, and needing to lay down to catch my breath. I had a fever that day and took NyQuil which allowed me do sleep and broke my fever. But the fainting feeling persisted throughout the day until 8 pm when I was able to sit up and eat.

My heart started pounding, my throat and mouth were tingling and tightening, my face and ears turned red and flushed.  At about 45 mins, I became extremely dizzy like I was intoxicated .  My mouth and throat kept tightening and tingling in waves. My skin was itchy and red in patches.  I felt like I was having a stroke on the right side of my face. My right eye and face felt odd. Over the night and next days, my chest was tight on the left side and pain in my left arm and sharp stabbing pain in my left back and side.  The next day I had heavy chest and shortness of breath and remained dizzy.

                                                Within 1 hour started to feel all of the COVID19 symptoms again- extremely tired, dry cough and dry throat, headache, backache, no motivation, and overwhelming anxiety (never had anxiety before getting COVID19, then after quarantine, anxiety came on; positive COVID19 Jan4th), rapid heart beat,  never ran a fever but constantly felt hot and then had chills, no energy, chest tightness, short of breath. Severe arm pain. All of this worsened the Thursday night I received the 1st vaccine and lasted until Sunday April 4th.  The anxiety seemed to go away by Saturday night, but the arm pain was still present 4/5/21.

                                                Initially I had arm soreness at the area of the shot.  Saturday evening following the vaccine I had pain in my left side of the neck.  Sunday the pain went from the left side of my neck down to the base of my ribs and then progressed to include the back and chest almost constantly instead of just on inhalation.  I went to the ER on Sunday evening, assuming very bad costochondritis; however, was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the left lung, areas of possible infarction, and pleurisy.  I had a CT scan at a Medical Center prior to receiving the Moderna vaccine for a suspected PE and it was negative.

Wanted to pass out, throw up and rip off my clothes.Then rapid breathing. And more hot and sweaty snd shaky. And then my hands went numb and stiff. And then my lips turned blue/grey and my face went white. They couldn?t register my pulse ox and it wouldn?t register on my watch for awhile.  Things improved and I was cold and shaky. About half an hour to 45 minutes after the shot I got better and was allowed to leave an hour after the shot. Was very tired and went home to sleep for a few hours. Did not appear to be allergic no itching, rashing, or swelling, or throat closing. The site monitored me and I drank sips of water and reclined my chair and ran the AC full. I don&#39;t think they were equipped to handled adverse responses. So far I&#39;m ok other than the feeling like I have the flu from the vaccine feelings

                                                I had my first vaccine (Moderna, V00120) on February 26. About a week after,  I started feeling paresthesia, numbness in the right side of my body, specifically in the right leg and arm, and I started having difficulties walking.  Since the symptoms persisted, I went to the Dr. on March 23. I told him that I thought my symptom were out of the blue and I linked them to the vaccine, so I was visiting him to see if I should put my second vaccine in those circumstances, few days after. Doctor said that there was no relation between nerve damage and the vaccine and he recommended me to put it.  He sent me test thinking that could be multiple esclerosis. I did my brain MRI on Thursday 25 and on Friday March 26 I put my second dose.  About a week after the second dose my symptoms  were dramatically aggravated. I first started experiencing  a sudden fatigue that didn&#39;t even allow me to hold the cellphone or a spoon and I had to lie down. I couldn&#39;t hold my 8 months daughter because I felt such a strong weakness. This fatigue didn&#39;t allow me to work. This happened few days in a raw for few hours. On April 8th I started to feel needles and strong neuropathic pain that I had never experience in my whole life. On April 9th in the evening I had a massive crisis. I started to feel a sudden  having a lot of cold, starting shivering and then chattering teeth and strong headache. (Same reaction I had 12 hours after putting the second dose of the vaccine).  I had to lie down in bed and my husband had to cover me with a jumper and eiderdown, but I still was cold. I couldn&#39;t stop shivering. Then I had difficulty swallowing. And the worst part started when I felt all over my body an intense pins and needles, burning, electricity, very profoundly and spread all over in a very intense way., I thought I was dying. I started panicking, I didn&#39;t have control over my body. I had difficulty breathing and such a weakness that didn&#39;t make me speak because I couldn&#39;t stop chattering my teeth. Was the worst life experience ever until that moment. The situation lasted about 90 minutes and then went away. The next day, Sunday April 10th, I spent the whole day in bed to rest, but at night time I experienced the same crisis as the night before. It started with the sudden cold as well.  After that I didn&#39;t have more crises but the pins and needles pain remains and it made it difficult to sleep because of the pain and discomfort and I wonder if I would have it my entire life. I returned to the doctor. To a different one specialized in multiple esclerosis. Brain MRI came out negative but it was done one day before the second dose, so we cannot be sure. I did 3 MRI of my whole spine and some muscular tests to check the response of the nerves. They also took 8 tubes of blood. We are waiting for the results but doctor think is Guillain Barrel syndrome. She thinks I am suffering peripheral neuropathy.

                                                An hour after getting the vaccine I started to get chills. As the chills set in, a deep itch started jumping to different parts of my body, head to toe. My eyes also started watering profusely. I got very tired and went to lay down.  At 1:30/2:00p ( 1.5-2 hrs post vaccine) my throat started to tickle/itch. It felt like I needed to clear my throat. Then it started to feel thick in my throat. Almost as if I had mucous or something in my throat, but could not cough it up. I also felt the constant need to swallow. This lasted about 6 hrs, with the eye watering and itchiness starting to wane around hour 4, and the rest dropping off slowly after. 12 hrs after the shot, the symptoms I was experiencing were gone. My left shoulder has felt like it was bruised ever since the morning after the vaccine (4/3/2021). Today, 4 wks later,  it still hurts to the touch.

                                                I had a sudden onset of racing heart, shortness of breath, and a crackling sound when I would exhale starting on 4/19/21. I went to the doctor on 4/22/21 where they did a COVID swab (negative), a chest x-ray, and a d-dimer blood test. My d-dimer value was 4520, so the clinic immediately sent me to the ER. At the ER, they did another COVID swab (negative), a chest x-ray, a CT scan with contrast dye, and an EKG. The CT scan found multiple pulmonary emboli in my lungs, including a large one near my heart. I was admitted to the hospital from 4/22/21-4/24/21. They started me on blood thinners (Xarelto) and did an ultrasound of my heart, in which they determined my heart has not sustained damage. The shortness of breath subsided in about a week post-hospitalization. I am still on daily blood thinners.

                                                In 30 minutes after the vaccine, my mouth and tongue were swelling up and tingling in my face, neck and tongue. I called my colleague and they told me to come back and they walked me to ER (I had only stayed 15minutes). When I was at ER and met with Dr., he didn&#39;t see any swelling in my tongue or face or neck. So I went home after being discharged. I did&#39;nt have any issues for a week. On 18th of January, I started to have tingling return to my face: started along the jawline up to ear and my ear started to get plugged up. On the 19th, the tingling moved all over my face and on my tongue. On the 20th, I went back to ER. It was impacting my breathing when I was trying to breathe - my mouth, throat and tongue felt so tingly I was having trouble swallowing and breathing. When I went in - they didn&#39;t see any physical swelling and they weren&#39;t sure what was going on and what to do. It had dissipated after the wait at ER before seeing the doctor. So the pattern was, that they would go away after an hour or two. Tingling started in my mid spine.  From the 21st - 27th, I had tingling in my face, right leg felt very heavy with tingling, and slight tingling around my left knee. The tingling was more mild in the morning but increased during the day. I cut out all coffee because I didn&#39;t know what was  happening. I had to stop some conference calls because my mouth was so tingly that I had trouble with speech because I had to really think about what I was saying. It required a huge amount of energy to be able to speak clearly - when the tingling would get real worked up. I would try to do yoga or a meditation to not be focused on it. I have never had any health challenges and so it was challenging. 26th, I had fallen asleep but I would wake up because I was having a hard time swallowing and would gasp after the swallow. My  husband took me to ED - a different doctor did an MRI -with contrast dye. I had a follow up appt on the 7th of February with a neurologist. By that time, the symptoms were getting a little bit more mild -the symptoms were in: face, neck, mouth, arm and leg . By the time I saw neurologist, the symptoms were more mild and would only be at an hour or two a day. He said to come back for follow up. For a month it was good. But I still I get it every now and then. Last week  - right arm was tingly for three days. Intermittently, maybe once a week, something will be tingly. And then I&#39;ll be fine for several days. It&#39;s very out of the blue when it happens now but still consistent to what initially happened. I will be seeing the neurologist next Monday for a follow up.

This all went away and i thought it was nothing. Shot 1: Less than 2 weeks after first shot I broke out in body rash suddenly during thr middle of my work day and felt like my throat was closing up. I have no allergies and was hoping it was due to a food- but I ate nothing new. Had to go to urgent care, took Benadryl and was prescribed 2 other prescriptions. Rash went away within 24hrs. Lots of pain at injection but no swelling at injection with shot 1. Also had bloody nose 1 week later.  Shot 2: I informed the pharmacist of what happened after first shot. After receiving 2nd shot everything was fine. I left and again 30mins later i noticed heaviness of breathing - but it immediately went away.  The next day i developed covid arm that lasted 3 days and was itchy everywhere including injection site swelling but this time no rash only covid arm. Fever of 101 2 days after shot #2.  I took Benadryl for a couple of days for on and off itchyness. I got a bloody nose again 3rd day. Felt itchy everywhere  on and off for 2 weeks after 2nd shot.

March 9th I was driving with my 7 year old in the car and had to pull over and call 911.  First month symptoms were dizzyness and shortness of breath, tachycardia and chest pain.  I went from being a healthy runner/weight training to no working out.  I cut coffee and caffeine and kept a food diary to see if anything helped, nothing did.  At month two tachycardia slowed and is now more regulated.  My current  symptoms remainining are chest pain/pressure.  Cardiology believes this is inflammation post vaccine, as my overall cardiac workup was healthy.  Cardiac MRI is an option.  No medication was given.  I have completely changed my diet to anti inflammatory, changed my workouts to yoga, and am dealing with residual symptoms that have altered my life.

This second dose seems to have given me ongoing lung issues.

No notable reactions on the first or 2nd day.  On 9May I woke up with spasming back pain. I fainted about 6 minutes later and proceeded to have a tonic seizure.  My husband placed me on the floor after I fainted. I was still for 30 seconds then I contracted into a dramatic arch on the floor and emitted a long strange exhalation. During this arching of my back, I was supported by the top of my head and my feet with the rest of my body off the ground. This lasted for 20 seconds. Then, I was unconscious for 60 seconds after this. When I woke I couldn&#39;t move my hands and I had loud humming noise in both ears. We called an ambulance. From the time I woke in pain to the time we called the ambulance was 12 mins. I&#39;ve never had a seizure of any type before this event. Nor do I suffer from fainting spells.

Hives and rash developed at 4:30 pm. A large red rash appeared in the center of my neck. Hives spread up my face. No rash or redness at the injection site. Benadryl was taken. The rash did not go away. Asthma continued to be uncontrolled as well with wheezing 24/7.   2/3/21: Telehealth appointment with a physician to discuss the reaction to the vaccine. The doctor believed the reaction was happening internally due to the vaccine. Prescribed an oral steroid and directed to take Benadryl every 4-6 hours.   2/24/21: Allergy testing to determine if I should get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Everything was fine at first and I had the headache and normal stuff. I didn&#39;t have sensation I had with first vaccine because of the Benadryl (30 minutes prior to vaccine). The main problems started probably 2-3 weeks after (unsure of exact date/time). I started having headaches I used to get. I had an autoimmune disorder prior to being pregnant that they thought was maybe lupus but it wasn&#39;t definitive. I was fine after pregnancies until after this vaccine (not currently pregnant or at time of vaccine). I started getting the headaches and I could just tell it was the symptoms of fatigue. I started getting chest pain and shortness of breath and I could feel my heart pounding really fast. My doctor saw me and at that time it seemed more like it was costochondritis and not so much my heart but he went ahead and did a troponin blood test that came back slightly elevated and I was seen in ER because my chest pain was becoming more intense. After 1st test my troponin was normal. I did get an echo after 5 days and it came back stating I had left ventricular hypertrophy and there was swelling in left ventricular wall so now I&#39;m waiting to see cardiologist to see how they want to go about doing that. I have had previous heart problems that went away with pregnancies. I still have chest pain off and on and shortness of breath.

                                                When they injected it into arm I had a warming sensation going into shoulder and front of neck. It was almost like when they give an MRI and give the contrast. It was just my shoulder and into neck. I thought it was just me, and the pharmacist checked my shoulder and it was hot to the touch. We waited and the temperature got better and around 15 mins it was gone. I waited at pharmacy for 30 minutes since I do have allergies to antibiotics. I went ahead and left and as I was walking out the store I got light headed. When I was driving the left side of throat felt like it was getting larger and it was swelling. When I got home it wasn&#39;t going away and I was drinking water and hadn&#39;t really eaten anything and a couple hours after I ended up eating and couldn&#39;t really swallow the food. I called my Doctor and they thought it was weird because it was 2-3 hours after vaccine. Solid foods were hard to swallow but liquids was OK. It wasn&#39;t getting better so after around 4 hours my Doctor told me to take Benadryl and within 5 minutes it was gone and I could swallow again and the swelling went down. My Doctor thinks I had a slight reaction but not enough to have full anaphylactic reaction. I had Benadryl for 2 days. They told me to take Benadryl for 2nd dose.

(I?m not sure the right term, but I have a ton of pictures). On June 18th 2021 the most severe appeared mysteriously on the back of my leg behind my right knee (I was previously bitten by a tick years ago and treated for Lyme w/ this same knee - and it was suggested there could be a connection and maybe my immune system did not fully recover - but this is the weakest area of my body). There was no plausible cause for what an orthopedist described as a hamstring hematoma protruding the size of a golf ball. I had ultrasounds of both legs that day to check and make sure it was not blood clots. I was told to seek additional care when my husband returned home (I was alone with my daughter and uncomfortable leaving her to go to the hospital that day - the paramedics found me a home technician to do the mobile ultrasounds)? the next day, my husband was home and took me to urgent care, where they tried to transport me to the hospital via ambulance. We elected not to go then and discussed the symptoms with my cardiologist, neurologist, and orthopedist who all advised me to go to the hospital. I decided to go for an outpatient visit with the orthopedist to take a look at my leg. Things were a bit blurry at that time because I was experiencing a lot more than just leg pain. A home physical therapist came to see me the next day I believe (I kept a diary of medication taken symptoms etc because I was afraid I might die after all these strange symptoms but still averse from going to the hospital thinking it was just panic attacks)? The home PT came and took my BP and called 911. I was taken to allegedly to be stabilized and transported to .  found a UTI and discharged me with Keflex. The next day I ended up back in the hospital this time  and discharged with Nitroglycerin. Shortly thereafter collapsed again and hospitalized again admitted to  Cardiac.

                                                The day after the first vaccine, I had a sore left arm. After the second vaccine, I had sore left, lower back pain, and fatigue for a few hours the day after the injection. On 4/12/2021, I started having pretty strong heart palpitations. It felt like fluttering. The next day, the palpitations were extremely strong and I couldn&#39;t get a good breath. I had difficulty talking and concentrating. The symptoms continued the next day. That Thursday, 4/15/2021, I went to the emergency room. They did a second EKG, which showed premature ventricular contractions (PVC). They did a chest X-ray to make sure I didn&#39;t have pneumonia; everything looked fine there. They checked my electrolyte levels in lab work; they were perfect. They sent me home. I did another EKG at my PCP&#39;s office later on; it also showed PVC. She ordered me a halter monitor. I had the halter monitor 4/26. I wore it from 4/25 til 4/27. It showed 49,000 PVC; that was considered extremely frequent and necessitated an echocardiogram, which I was scheduled to undergo 5/21/2021. The result of that echocardiogram was normal/clear. Everything has been back to normal since then.

I cold compress was applied to my forehead and I was put in a reclining position &amp; then received Epinephrine at 1:28PM. EMS (present onsite) arrived for transport at 1:31PM. 4L of oxygen was applied after O2 sat of 89% noted by EMS. Blood pressure was elevated to &gt;200/100 initially by EMS. Symptoms improved quickly following epinephrine, with some residual feelings of very mild throat fullness, and I developed chills which improved over time.  I was transported to emergency department where I was evaluated (symptoms mostly resolved at that time, but ED physician noted a little swelling remaining in my uvula), then IV Benadryl and Decadron were given. Later acetaminophen was also given for headache that developed during my ED stay.  My vitals were monitored throughout and observation occurred until I was discharged at approximately 5:00PM, as symptoms had not recurred.

                                                I got moderna COVID19 vaccine on 12/26/2020. Day 1-3 local pain and swelling, no redness. All resolved after day 3-4. Very tired all week post vaccine,.  Day 5-6 noticed ipsilateral axillary lymph node swelling.  On day 7 post vaccine I got a localized area of itching swelling and redness as if I had been bitten by a few mosquitoes at injection site that was new. Milder on day 8, less itchy and swollen, but still red and a little raised.  Mild shortness of breath.

                                                I waited a full 30 min after my injection due to my peanut allergy.  Left hospital feeling ok- on drive home began to feel flushed in my face, tingling in my lips and began to wheeze.  It felt like my peanut allergy but on a smaller scale.  I took my Albuterol inhaler and some Benadryl once I got home and felt better.  The next day I still have some itchiness and  fullness in my throat but nothing like yesterday.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms.

                                                About five minutes after the vaccine, my throat started to itch and a cough began. At 15 minutes I started to get hot, cough persisted, and a feeling of fatigue (I didn?t want to talk...very unusual). At 30 minutes the scratch in the throat turned to a lump, the cough was worse, and itching began on neck &amp; face. The doctor on site gave an oral Benadryl tablet but in two minutes symptoms were worsening and vomiting started. My chest was tight and sweat began. The doctor administered 50 mg benadryl shot &amp; a steroid. The lump was growing bigger, so they administered an epinephrine. Then I was sent to the ER. Upon arrival I received 25 mg of benadryl due to the whole body itching, but throat had relaxed. Also received IV fluids.

Symptoms lasted 6 days post injection diminishing on day 5 to include only moderate fatigue. On day 7 post injection, the first phyical activity (skiing) immediatly resulted in heart pain (angina) and inability to take a deep breath. Assessment at the ER for a heart attack showed higher than normal range of troponin (.031)but a clear x-ray and EKG. Tests were repeated 4 hours after initial tests and troponin was within normal limits (.020). I was discharged with a 2/100 risk of heart attack in the next 30 days and a follow up stress test. I believe this was a direct result of the Covid-19 Maderna shot. I believe is reduced my hearts ability to work at a normal capacity and respond to physical activity.

                                                Within 5 minutes, my throat started to feel tight, however, I thought I might be experiecing anxiety, so I didn&#39;t do or say anything. Over the course of 30 minutes, my throat got tighter, and my tongue started to feel big. However, I could breathe, so I, again, convinced myself it was anxiety, and tried some breathing exercises to try to alleviate any sort of anxiety-which in retrospect, I realize was not anxiety. On my way out, I actually stopped and turned around because I could feel it was getting bigger, and I was worried about driving home. I was treated by EMTs, who gave me an iv, and then Benadryl. Within a few minutes, my throat and tongue started to decrease in size. By this point, I believe I may have been experiencing some mild shock, and didn&#39;t really understand how potentially serious it could have been. I think this may have led some medical providers to believe it was anxiety, since I expressed that I was concerned initially it was that.  I was transported to the hospital, given a steriod injection, a prescription of prednisone, and observed for an hour. I was not given any blood tests. I was told that if it was a reaction, since they couldn&#39;t tell if it was or not, that it may come back later. About 5 hours after the initially Benadryl shot, I could feel the beginning of throat tightening and tongue swelling. I took a Benadryl and that seemed to control it.

                                                My lymph nodes in my neck and my throat swelled up. My throat became red and swollen. (The throat symptoms were within 2 hours and lymph nodes swelled up overnight) I became congested and started sneezing and coughing. I got a fever, chills, headache - within two hours, body aches, fatigue. The rest of the symptoms came within 24 hours. On Saturday morning, I called URGENT CARE - and they had me talk to  an Urgent Respiratory Care 50 mg of Benadryl and ibuprofen - 800 mg every 8hours   - Following Monday still very sick and I was seen on Monday at Urgent Respiratory Clinic and at that point of time they did a COVID test (January 11th). Told to take: Mucinex and nasal spray and antibiotic because my ears were so full at that time they were not draining. They helped reduce the symptoms. I was sick for the entire week. It took me out of work for a week.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included monk fruit allergy and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications reported included hydrochlorothiazide.  On an unknown date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273.   On 28 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Jan 2021, following vaccination, the patient experienced an elevated heart rate of 105-112 beats per minute (bpm). The patient stated that 80 bpm was normal for her. At 7:30 pm, she began wheezing and her lips turned blue, both of which resolved within 2 hours. The patient took ibuprofen, naproxen, and diphenhydramine and sat in a warm tub for an hour and felt better after she covered up in bed.  On 29 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102 degrees Fahrenheit (F) at midnight and 99 degrees F at 5:00 am.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The events, wheezing and lips turned blue, were considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, heart rate was elevated to 105-112 bpm and temperature was 102, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 37-year-old, female patient, with medical history of high blood pressure and allergies to monk fruit, who experienced serious unexpected event of cyanosis, non-serious unexpected event of wheezing, heart rate increased, and non-serious expected event of pyrexia. The event of cyanosis, wheezing, heart rate increased occurred 1 day (same day) and fever occurred 2 days after mRNA-1273 (Lot# 030L20A). Treatment included Ibuprofen, Benadryl and Naprosyn. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.

They had to administer an epi-pen. My throat did not feel better so I was transported by EMS to the hospital and was treated with IV Benadryl, steroids and Pepcid. I was prescribed Pepcid and Medrol 6 day dose pack to take home to prevent a delayed reaction.

                                                I got the normal fever, aches, chills, headache 2 hours after I got the shot and it lasted 2 days. By the third day I began feeling short of breath while talking.  The shortness of breath (SOB) lasted 3 days and was present for about half a day each. Then it all went away. On tuesday, Feb 16th, I began to feel SOB again but this time under my L breast I had pain. I tried to see if it was muscle (I am a PT) but could not tell. The next day the pain moved near where my sternum meets my ribs and then I worked on that and it has been there ever since. It feel heavy and I get chest discomfort on inhalation. I have seen primary care, they said to wait a few weeks and let them know if it is still there. I decided to report my symptoms now because I thought it would go away but it still has not and it does not seem normal to me. I did notice if I take an aleve it feels better but today that has not helped either. I hear that this vaccine can cause inflammation and so I am just wondering is this normal for what I am feeling?

She was coached to slow her breathing, instructed to hold her breath for 10 seconds, then to release it slowly. She did this for 3 minutes. She related her body felt tingly all over. Encouraged patient to continue the slow breathing. As patient began to feel better, she related that she has a known needle phobia. She expressed that she becomes anxious even when she is not the one receiving a shot, and this fear stems from a traumatic experience of her son having a seizure after a shot. She works at a school and when they do first aid training and cover the diabetes section, the pictures of needles make her anxious. Patient provided with therapeutic communication, encouraged to discuss fears with her counselor. Patient remained seated in clinic until she felt well enough for her husband to drive her home.

                                                A few minutes after inoculation, the patient felt chest tightness.  She rested for a few minutes.  Her chest tightness did not ease.  She used her asthma inhaler to try to relieve the symptoms.  Immediately (but not necessarily because of the inhaler) her symptoms worsened.  I called over the attending EMTs, who put the patient on 02.  Soon after, a pulse oximeter showed the patient&#39;s 02 sat at 100, pulse at 110.The feeling of tightness continue but the oxygen immediately relieved the patient&#39;s distress.  After a few more minutes, the patient took another hit of albuterol.  That brought immediate relief.  Her pulse gradually slowed to the mid-70s.  She said she felt tired, as often she does after an asthma attack, but soon felt well enough to leave.  She planned to take an cab or equivalent to home, and said she had taken the day off.  She said her doctor warned her that because she has a history of reactions (details unknown) to vaccines, she might react badly to Moderna, but the doctor and patient agreed that it was worth the risk. She said her reaction to NSAIDs has been anaphylaxis.

Most of those symptoms lasted for 36 hours, however the headache and the chills remained. The following Tuesday (2/16) I starting having severe difficulty breathing and was gasping often. I tried my inhaler and that did nothing. This persisted. On 3pm Thurs (2/18) I started feeling dizzy and by 4:30pm I could not stand. Went to the doctor on Friday (2/19) with a fever of about 100, inability to walk without assistance. I&#39;ve also been having memory problems. I went to a balance center EMT on 3/10 for a repositioning procedure and I still Additional information for Item 18: feel dizzy, so there were no results to date.

                                                About 12 hours exactly after getting the 2nd dose I got extreme POTS flare up and a mild occular migraine.  I had a fever that kept going from the mid 99s to the 101s for 36 hrs.  Was freezing and burning and had lots of joint and body pain.  Most people I know had all of that, but the reason I?m reporting is the tachycardia.  My tachy has been fairly well controlled with meds and after my second dose it was so bad any time I sat up, I couldn?t breath, my tachy got so bad, my heart rate would jump from up to 70bpms, just sitting up.  My resting heart rate on meds has been 60-80, and for those 36 hours was 80-110.  Anytime I did anything my heart rate would jump to 130-150 and I could NOT BREATH.  My SpO2 was fine, so I know that the issue was my POTS flaring up and that it was the tachy.  I just want to report that it could cause issues with people with dysautonomia, so they don?t freak out if it happens.  My heart rate is still elevated, but is slowly going back down.

                                                I had an immediate reaction with dizziness, and tightness in throat within less than a minute of vaccine administration. That whole incident maybe lasted 10 seconds with throat tightness peaking at 6-7 seconds. I didn?t require epiPen or emergency care and the tightness went away 90% after 10 seconds with some minor difficulty swallowing for about additional 15 mins or so. I felt completely normal after 30 mins and have not had any other reactions since.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

                                                Patient described having lightheadedness, the began to experience dyspnea saying her breathing felt strange.  This began approximately 5 minutes after her dose was administered.  We had her sit down in our injection room and began to monitor her symptoms.    I immediately got out our protocol for Treatment of an Allergic Reaction as part of our vaccination program protocol.   the patient remained conscious and responsive throughout the encounter.  A pulse oximeter was placed on her left pointer finger.  Her heart rate fluctuated in the 110s to 130s during the encounter.  Her pulse ox remained 97% throughout the encounter.  Patient reported having a history of hypertension treated with lisinopril.  We placed a blood pressure monitor on her left wrist to take her blood pressure.  Her initial blood pressure was 164/105, which she reported was &#34;just a little bit over normal&#34; for her.  After taking the initial blood pressure, she described that her symptoms were beginning to subside a bit.  We discussed the signs/symptoms that we would be looking for in an anaphylaxis type reaction, some of which were present (i.e. tachycardia, dyspnea) and some of which were not (i.e. hives, swelling of the face/lips, throat, etc.).  We then began to take her blood pressure again.  The second blood pressure measurement was 156/104.  Shortly after taking the second blood pressure, she described having feelings of dyspnea again.  At that time, I notified another staff member to contact EMS/call 911 and let them know we potentially had an allergic reaction to the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  When the symptoms came back for the second time, I got out the Epipen Two Pack in the case that we would need to administer a dose.  We continued to monitor her symptoms and kept her responsive over the next few minutes, until the first set of EMS arrived from the local fire department.  The EMS staff began taking her vitals and took over care of that patient at that point.  Patient was still responsive and describing only dyspnea and having clinical symptoms of tachycardia and hypertension.  Patient got nauseated around 10 minutes after the first set of EMS arrived, and experienced a bit of vomiting.  About 10-15 minutes after the first set of EMS arrived and took over care of the patient, the ambulance and second set of EMS arrived and took over care.  They began monitoring the patients symptoms and placed an IV line.  The patient was then transported to the local Emergency Department.  At around 5PM, the patient called the pharmacy to report that the physicians at the emergency department had ruled that she had experienced an allergic, non-anaphylactic reaction to the dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                Patient was waiting 15 minutes post vaccination and began coughing. Staff noticed her coughing and asked how she was feeling. She described her throat at closing and difficulty breathing. She was vaccinated at roughly 9:40 am on 4/4/21 and at 9:46 am she reported these symptoms. The staff alerted the pharmacist on duty, and the patient was moved to a private area with a pharmacy technician as the translator. Pharmacy clerk was directed to call 911 at this time. She assessed patients symptom and patient said she had difficulty breathing and felt her throat closing and was coughing continuously. The patient had history of an allergic reaction to bee stings and had used epipens in the past. She felt that her symptoms were similar to what she had experienced in the past. It was determined to use the Epipen. The epipen was administered at roughly 9:50am. Patient was told to remain calm. The fire medic showed up at this point. The pharmacist then got a BP reading (205/193 and pulse of 95). The patient complained of feeling really cold and was visibly shaking. She did say that she was beginning to be able to breathe better. Her husband showed up about 2 minutes later. The paramedics arrived at about 9:55am and took a BP, pulse, and pulse ox reading. She was able to walk with assistance to a gurney and taken to the ambulance where she was transported to the Hospital.

                                                Shot received at 9:40. At 10:15 on my way to work my heart started to race, body got hot and got dizzy, felt like I was going to faint. Pulled over to get my breathing under control and turned my AC on high to cool body down. Symptoms still existed but got back on the road towards my work office. Throat started to feel like it had a gum all in it and felt like it was constricting. Chest started to hurt like there was a weight on it. 10:30am went to closet urgent care to where i was. Was there for 2 hours. They gave me IV fluids, steroid push through IV Oort, Benadryl through IV port and monitored the symptoms. They did not subside so they gave me a shot of epinephrine. When symptoms still did not go away they called EMS and I was transferred. They monitored my vitals and gave me lidocaine to drink and another liquid to relax my throat abs airway. Symptoms stated to subside but did not fully go away. Was discharged at 3:30 pm and a prescription for prednisone was called into my pharmacy. As of 9:40 on the same day vaccine was administered (4/6/21) throat is sore and chest is still tight, headache and sweats. Was advised to follow up with primary doctor.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) in a 37-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 011M20A and 011J20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) and TOPIRAMATE (TOPAMAX) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, the patient experienced TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird). On 03-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma) and ASTHENIA (Could not get up). On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg) and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg), TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia), DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma), CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg), ASTHENIA (Could not get up), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine), HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Haemoglobin: low gram per litre (Low) LOW. In March 2021, Red blood cell count: low cells per microlitre (Low) LOW.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment informations reported were Levalbuterol tartrate  and Rivaroxaba 20 mg   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059897 (Patient Link).

Blood pressure was taken and was low 86/52.  Pulse rate was 110.  Became increasingly dizzy, stabbing chest pain, and lethargic.  Was transferred to an ambulance with great assistance, because when I stood up I became so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stand.  In the ambulance the chest pain/ stabbing became unbearable.  I was started on IV fluids, and also had an EKG done, and was put on oxygen.  While en route to the hospital I had a horrible feeling of nausea and dry heaving.    Upon arriving at the hospital  I was worked up for cardiac issues and everything came back normal.  I was also given benadryl.  Nothing helped the dizziness or nausea and I still felt short of breath when I was discharged.  I was able to get some interrupted sleep.  This morning I am still feeling very dizzy and light headed.  I&#39;m extremely cold and have the worst headache I have ever had.  I feel foggy and I am having trouble concentrating.  I have been drinking a lot of fluids and also been taking tylenol.

                                                Patient started to feel dizzy, shaky and said she was having some trouble breathing about 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. She had been drinking water but did not have anything to eat that morning. Upon talking to patient she did not seem to be out of breath and could talk normally. We had her sit and try drinking some orange juice but it did not seem to improve her symptoms. She eventually asked to take a walk and get a small snack. A pharmacy technician went with her and after sitting back down and eating something she was started to feel better. About 10 minutes after eating the patient was feeling fine. This was about 1 hr and 30mintues after receiving the vaccine.

                                                About 12 hours after injection, was woken up with sever sweating. Enough sweat to drench clothing. Temperature was aprox. 102.4 F. Later I started to have body aches, headache, nausea, loss of appetite. Later in the evening I began to experience dizzy spells that would come and go. I continued to experience the fluctuating temperature but did not exceed a temperature of 102.6. After going to bed at around 1:00am on April 14, I continued to have severe sweating. The sweating continued until 12:30pm this afternoon. I was unable to get out of bed and felt like I was paralyzed. I was able to hear my family awake around me but could not respond. I also started to feel a sharp pain that started u set my right breast and radiated into my chest. After the pain started, I became short of breath. After waking up, again drenched in sweat, I showered and felt better. I am still experiencing a headache, dizzy spells and a tightness in my chest that makes it difficult to breath. My head feels like it gets flushes of pressure that causes me to be dizzy. Then I have a headache for an hour. I am taking 15mg meloxicam because of my hip surgery so I can?t take any aspirin. I have taken Tylenol but it does not relieve my symptoms.

She gave Benadryl. Waited another 30 minutes. At that stage my throat started feeling tight. Nurse put on finger monitor and blood pressure cuff then gave me a dose of Epi and called 911. Once at hospital ER doctor said I was having an allergic response and gave more Benadryl, famotadine, and prednisone. Then they monitored me for a couple of hours and released me. He prescribed those meds to be continued for 5 days after. I&#39;m itchy an feel very heavy.

                                                The vaccine was given on 4-23-2021 at about 11:30 AM at the Pharmacy. I came home and worked on my computer for about an hour. By 2 PM that day, I had the typical reactions expected of constant chills, fatigue, and soreness at the injection site of my left arm. I took a nap and covered up under many blankets. I drank lots of fluids to help. By 10 PM, I already felt lots of severe body aches and stiffness. Before midnight I started having chest pain. The chest pain continued all night making it difficult to sleep. I woke up completely around 7 AM on 4-24-2021 still feeling all body aches with difficulty moving, continued intensifying chest pain with palpitations, and now also felt nausea. I only ate a piece of fruit. I went with my family to our kid?s soccer games, but I was completely fatigued. I came home and took a nap, but felt chilled, the chest pain continuing, and soreness. When I woke up things were feeling even worse with the chest pain. They started to feel like a real heaviness on my chest, almost as if someone was sitting on me. I also felt a huge tightness the length of my sternum. I had palpitations. I started also having shortness of breath and could not walk up and down my stairs (which is never otherwise a problem).  I was very hot and sweating through my clothese. My sister took me to the ER because the pain became intolerable. I went to the Clinic, Hospital ER for the chest pain (lot so heaviness and tightness in the sternum) and shortness of breath. My blood pressure was really high in the 140s/90s. I was in a lot of pain. I had a temperature. They did an EKG immediately that showed PVCs and a slight pause. Then, I had an XRay of the chest and lots of bloodwork. They did give me fluids and pain medication. The bloodwork had elevated d-dimer and low potassium levels, so they did a CAT scan with contrast to rule out a clot. It showed no clot, but had very enlarged lymph nodes on the left. They believed all of this response and chest pain was due to my 2nd dose of Moderna&#39;s COVID 19 vaccine. I am still not completely recovered. I am feeling ill and chest pain with tightness, but at home now. I go back to my cardiologist for a repeat EKG and repeat bloodwork this week.

                                                The evening of the injection, began to feel a headache, achy muscles, and sore arm. Next morning, felt these same symptoms more severely and felt feverish; lasted all day. Had to take melatonin and Tylenol to fall asleep. Next day, continued feeling sore arm, feverish, and headache as well as general exhaustion/tiredness. On day 3, the headache and tired feelings lingered and I noticed I would easily be out of breath doing things that didn&#39;t cause me this issue previously, like climbing a flight of stairs. Today (1 week since vaccine), the only thing I am still experiencing is shortness of breath at mild levels of activity.

                                                I received my vaccine Saturday the 24th. High Fever 104 degrees starting at 1:30am on April 25th lasting until 9:35 am. I took tylenol around 9 am so my fever went down to 102 degrees at approximately 9:35am on April 25th. Same day around 3:30pm my temp went back up to 103 degrees. That night was rough again with the fever staying steady at 103. Took tylenol again around 3 am and fell back asleep. At 5:40 am April 26th, (Monday) my temp was down to 102 degrees. Finally went down to 99.8 Monday April 26th in the afternoon. Around 8:10pm it went back up to 100.4 and about 30 minutes later it was back to 101. Held steady through the night around 101 degrees. It&#39;s now Tuesday but my temp is back down to 99 degrees. Sunday and Monday I had extreme body aches, sweating fits, unbearable headache, sore arm, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, loss of appetite. It&#39;s now Tuesday April 27th and I still have the headache (not as bad), shortness of breath, and loss of appetite. I no longer have body aches and my arm is slowly feeling better where I had the injection.

Feel it spreading thru my arm, the pain radiating, Really lightheaded, SOB, tingly in arms, racing HR. SOB subsided and possible anxiety? In car line and the SOB was coming in waves. Within 5-10 months, redness on neck was seen by nurse and it was spreading. The nurse had me pull over and called the EMTs. They cleared me to go home. But I had driven 45 minutes to get the vaccine, if anything feels &#39;off&#39; to pull over and call 911. Less then a mile later, I had intense SOB. I called 911 and transported to the ER. They monitored me at hospital for 2 hours, I felt increase HR and lightheadedness stop. Sent home. I felt fine but out of sorts. 4/1/2021 very sore, nauseous all day. 4/2/2021 felt fine.

                                                5/1/2021 Vaccination  Within 10 minutes, I experienced glazed over look, rash, minor SOB. Feeling of needing to slow down but not struggling to breathe. They gave me Benadryl within 10 minutes and that seems to knock those symptoms away. They observed me for 45 minutes and I was better.

Because I am allergic to Dexamethasone, there were two nurses watching me and I had to wait for 30minutes prior to leaving. Within a few hours, I had extreme fatigue, worsening migraines, rapid heart rate and difficulty breathing, fever, chills, and nausea. I was in bed for about 48hours with a fever over 102F before taking tylenol to reduce symptoms. I had lingering migraines for a week post 2nd dose, and rapid heart rate for about 2-3 weeks before it subsided. I also had a bladder infection that wasn&#39;t diagnosed until about a month later

                                                A few days after the first vaccine I had chest tightness, especially on the left side and middle of my chest that came out of nowhere (no runny nose or anything). It felt like my lungs were irritated and I was short of breath, very tired. Worried it might be covid I went to get tested and it came back negative. Monocytes were high and the doctor suspected early pneumonia. Chest x ray came back without signs of pneumonia (but I continued the antibiotics for 10 days just in case it had been too early to show on the X-ray). Chest discomfort especially on left side, especially with deep inhale and when moving or laying on my side persisted.  Lungs felt better but still left side chest discomfort. Followed up with a chest CT after three weeks and it showed pericardial effusion and splenomegaly in addition to micro nodules in left lung. Pulmonologist cleared me for lung issues, infectious disease tested many things all came back negative. The source of the random chest pain especially on inhaling, shortness of breathe, etc has not been solidly determined and all symptoms started after getting the first moderna shot. After the second shot I felt extremely unwell with high fever for many days. Chest CT was done after the second shot so it is hard to know if the pericardial effusion and splenomegaly came from both shots.

I woke up at 3:15am because I couldn&#39;t feel my feet and hands.  It spread so that I could not feel my shins or my arms. And then I couldn&#39;t open my eyes. I told my husband to call 911. When they arrived my HR and respirations were 100-120. My BP was elevated. I couldn&#39;t move my limbs and the paramedics said they were contracted. They were unable to get oxygen saturation from my finger, but stuck something in my ear and my saturations were 100% They walked me through breathing exercises for hyperventilation. HR, respirations, and BP all started to come down. I&#39;ve never had anything like this happen before and, like I said, I was completely asleep prior to this event. But, of note, one of the paramedics said this happened to him after his second dose of the vaccine.

No recent injury. Went to urgent care. Doctor said it was muscle spasms. Was given a shot of Toradol for the pain and prescribed muscle relaxers. Was advised to take pain killers. After a week the pain decreased.

My arm just felt sore. I went to work right after that. By the time I got to work, my arm was a little sore like the flu shot. I work in business services and customer service. My right arm just kept getting more sore and sore. I was having more body aches. I was getting sluggish. They thought I wasn&#39;t feeling well because of my sickle cell. They offered for me to go home and I decided to work until 3. Towards the end of my shift, my arm was hurting, my back was hurting, and my head was hurting. I felt like I needed to lay down. When I got home, I crashed and it was only about 5pm. I started sweating real bad. I didn&#39;t eat or anything like that. I felt like I need to go to the ER, but I didn&#39;t want to. When things settle in that quickly they can normally turn real bad so I was told to call my PCP. It was over a period of time. It gradually increased. Any medicine I was taking was not helping. I had a pain crisis for 2 weeks and stayed in bed for 3 or 4 days. I ended up falling and hurting my elbow. I ended up in rehab (03/07). I still have headaches. I was taking my migraine medication every other day. I was also having a hard time breathing. My PCP thought that&#39;s what was making my head hurt. The headaches have been gradually intensifying. I have asthma. I believe that my headache caused me to fall. The headaches have been gradually intensifying. He has tried a few different medications and finally we found out that it&#39;s not responding to any of the medications. Turns out, it&#39;s not a headache. I didn&#39;t have any kind of nerve problems before any of this. Even my blood pressure was normal. They are trying to figure out what&#39;s caused the change and what&#39;s causing it. On the 18th, I completely loss the use of my left eye. I was admitted from the 18th-22nd. My right eye started having the same problems that my left eye had about a week later.

I had respiratory symptoms like wheezing shortness of breath, cough, muscle aches, and headaches. A week and 1/2 after the vaccination I went to the ER because I had respiratory symptoms and I passed out in the ER. I was diagnosed with pneumonia.

                                                patient called at 145, states she got covid vaccine at 1250.  She describes having dizziness, lightheadedness, and &#34;feeling of overheating&#34; that is continuing.  She stated she had a little dizziness at time of vaccine but it has worsened after leaving.  She is not driving (father is driving).  I asked if there was any trouble breathing and she stated &#34;a little&#34;.  I advised to lie down and elevate feet, and remain in cool place.  The patient stated the dizziness was worsening still.  I advised to either go to the Emergency department/urgent care or return to pharmacy for us to monitor her.  She will do one of the above. I spoke to patient about 237 pm, she ended up going to ER for observation, and is currently there being monitored.   spoke to patient today 6/25/21, patient was in ER for a while but has been discharged.  Pt states she was feeling hot for a while then later felt cold (could be because hospitals are cold).  Patient states ER gave her a breathing treatment and something to relax the nerves (not sure of medication).  She still has some dizziness and arm soreness but it has improved significantly since yesterday.

Then I felt a heat that traveled from the top of my head to me throughout my body. It caused my eyes, nose, ears, and throat to itch and burning. My eyes were itching and burning and I had an uncontrollable cough that I couldn?t control and had the feeling of my throat getting tight. I made it to get help from employee health nurse, I was given Benadryl po. And my vitals were checked. My blood pressure and heart rate was extremely elevated. The Benadryl didn?t help the coughing , so I was sent to the emergency room and given over Benadryl and steroids. The iv Benadryl was not effective so they gave my the iv steroid which helped some. I had to take  steroids for two weeks to keep form coughing. I also had to got to the emergency and doctors office due to recurring elevated blood pressure, headaches, dizziness, fatigue. I was put on blood pressure medication for 3 months.

A couple days after I missed my plane because I couldn&#39;t move and the next day I went to my Doctor and referred me to an ENT.  For maybe a week I wasn&#39;t eating because my throat was almost closing.

                                                Just about 15 mins after recieving vaccination, I  experienced increased shortness of breath, feeling weak, slight headache, and my heart seemed to race.  When I shared this with the pharmasist, she did not offer to take vitals nor seemed concerned.  She suggested that I was experiencing anxiety, and that it was not a typical reaction to the vaccine.  However, each day since vaccine I have continued to have episodes of shortness of breath.  Today, 3 days after the vaccine, I had more shortness of breath than I had since first contracting Covid-19(which was on 10th of Dec).  I also was having to stop walking several times every 5 mins or so in order to catch my breath, feeling weakness and fatigue.  My sense or taste/smell is gone as well. I was so short of breath today, work was worried anough about me they urged me to go home and call my doctor.  I now have a tele-visit set up with my doctor today.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

Friday = slept all day, very tired. Saturday night I went to ER because it hurt so bad: they gave me Lidocaine patches to help with pain but it didn&#39;t help. Monday, the 4th of January, saw my dr. - he was prescribed pain -Percocet 10/325 .That helped me so I could raise my arm finally. January 5th, I was still sick and woke up with a huge migraine; nauseous and fatigue/ I vomited once that night. Jan 6, I could work that day - but still fatigued, short of breath, but no fever at all, nauseous. January 7th - everything was gone (all symptoms resolved) and I felt fine.

                                                Approximately 10 hrs after the vaccine, I woke up very thirsty. When I went to get water, my brain and body felt disjointed. My brain was telling me to walk forward and my legs were stumbling all over as I tried to walk. I went back to sleep and woke up hours later more stable but still with my head feeling very light(not quite dizzy). I was slightly nauseous and just blah most of the next day. I?d get slightly out of breath when talking for awhile. I was in a deep fog. To the point it took a few minute to process the sound my dog made with it coming from him. Overall, I felt like I was drugged or really intoxicated. I worry about my 2nd dose!

She then was watched out in observation where she began to shiver, became clamy and would respond but eyes closed and would not open them. Vitals were taken BP 189/147, HR 87, O2 97 room air. Oxygen was applied for comfort, she stated her throat was not closing up like it did with first dose. Staff from her company then decided to call 911 where LAFD took over, she was then released home as she refused any care from them.

                                                Towards the evening of the day of the vaccine, I got headache and body aches. Next day, it was like full blown Covid all over again - joint aches; fever - 101.6; sweats; body aches; rash around the injection site; headache; redness and warmness around injection site, too. I had extreme fatigue.I had a terrible cough. I didn&#39;t have a sore throat. I had a lot of shortness of breath. My shortness of breath and my cough was still lingering (from when I had COVID before the vaccine). Went to URGENT Care on Friday, 8th; They Took chest x-ray - COVID pneumonia -was what DR called - antibiotics  - took one course but didn&#39;t finish the second and prednisone - did finish the course of the asteroids. Next day they said the radiologist said it wasn&#39;t pneumonia.  I still felt pretty crappy the following week and then I was fine. I didn&#39;t work 11th or 12th but as the week went on I started feeling better. Symptoms have resolved. I had the second vaccine on February 2nd, 2021. It went better then first - but I had joint aches; fatigue; headache;chills on the day after and then they slowly tapered off the next two days and then I felt fine.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

                                                Very painful arm and back pain for 2 days.  The day after the vaccine  I had very bad headache and my eyes were hurting so much.  The second day, I also had  body aches.  It&#39;s been about 3  weeks and I have some pain on my back and chest. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s related. l seemed to have it after the vaccine.  I also feel out of breath often.  I am now fearful of getting the second vaccine,  since the first one was so bad for me.

It didn&#39;t last long but it was very frightening.  My husband also said I had shallow breathing and he had to wake me up twice to check up on me.  This is very out of character for me.

                                                I developed left arm site pain. I would say by the evening. Not  unbearable/ no meds for it. I woke up with trouble breathing 25th - used my inhaler 7 times that day. Increase in amount of post nasal drip and sinus congestion in my head. Which has previous triggered asthma attacks which has taken me to the hospital. I didn&#39;t have to go to Hospital. Was fatigued that day. Saturday, the 26th, I was feeling better. I was fatigued. I didn&#39;t have the extensive shortness of breath. 27th, I woke up with painful sinuses - I couldn&#39;t touch my face. Because there was a gap between that one day of symptoms - couldn&#39;t touch my maxillary - I did go get a COVID swab. They came back negative. I had to use my inhaler every day and continued with post nasal drip to the point I lost my voice for weeks. Which happens with post nasal drip because it irritates my throat. Nothing was taking care of it.I had a lot of thick phlegm. There is a lot of congestion in my sinuses which triggers my asthma. I did saline spray; allergy pills and there was such swelling in my sinuses -  nothing came out my nose - just went down my throat.  History of Atrial Flutter - I have been needed to shocked before but this was different. I had missed one of my meds that controls heart rate and not the rhythm - I went into the Atrial flutter - on January 19th - early morning. I took extra medication to chemically break it which it didn&#39;t do. it. After 8 hours, I didn&#39;t convert so I started Zyratol 20 mg daily - and I couldn&#39;t break and I continued to take an extra dose once a day of the Flecainide - I still didn&#39;t break. I stayed in it until the 23rd .  January 21st vaccine at 09:30 am.  I didn&#39;t go to the ER because I am use to trying to break it.  Talked to doctor on the Phone - around the 20th or 21st of January.

                                                Received vaccine Thursday afternoon. Waited for a half hour after receiving the vaccine, as there is a history of anaphylaxis. On the drive home lips began to swell and the lips felt numb. Patient went home and took some Benadryl which seemed to help.  Friday 3/5  Patient woke and her arm was swollen at the injection site and was very painful. Patient also complained of a headache at that time. Later that same day, Patient developed a rash at the injection site and intense itching all over her body including her face. Patient went to the Medical Center ER. At ER the staff evaluated her and administered IV steroids and Benadryl and sent her home with instructions to return in worsens. Saturday Patient complained that her throat began swelling and so she went back to the ER. The  ER gave more IV steroids and Benadryl, a breathing treatment (nebulizer), and gave 2 doses of epinephrine. Due to Patient&#39;s continued symptoms and gradual worsening condition the medical provider at ER felt  it necessary for Patient to be admitted, however, due to the smaller size and limited resources at ER it was decided for Patient to be transported to Hospital. Patient has remained admitted at Hospital since then, and yesterday (Sunday) she required another dose of epinephrine due to tongue swelling.  Patient reports that she is being given IV Benadryl and steroids, and she will not be discharged today. Today Patient is also reporting a burning sensation with urination.

Another 15 minutes or so later it had become hard to swallow, I was given another 25mg dose of Benadryl. After the second dose  it became hard to breathe, started coughing and chest started to hurt. I didn?t realize but had broke out in sweat. Nurse checked my eyes. Called paramedics and had epi pen ready. I thought a third dose of Benadryl had been administered but that I am not certain of. Blood pressure was higher than my usual but still considered normal (113/82 I think?) pulse was 120 something, at rest I am usually at 70. I became lightheaded. Paramedics did an ekg, it was normal. They monitored me while I stabilized. Was released when pulse was in the 80?s range. Residual chest pain after. 8 days after vaccination I broke out in sweat and became nauseous. Vomited. I then noticed below the vaccination injection (still bruised) and around where last dose of Benadryl was injected there was a large red welp, hot to the touch. The heat eventually went away but the welp remained a few days. 11 days after vaccination is when the cluster headache appeared. Shortness of breath was noticeable on day 12. Day 14 fever and nasal congestion with slight irritation in throat, occasional cough. Day 15 sore throat, coughing progressed (non productive) in to fits that led to vomiting. It is day 18 and shortness of breath is present at rest, chest pain, rash near injection site and bruise is still present. Temp has been low grade fever, hadn?t gone above 100. Normal is 96.9/97.1 for me. Oddly day 13 (the day before fever became present) my temp was lower than usual 95.6/95.7 yet I wasn?t cold.

                                                Saturday beginning at 11:00 AM - Severe headache over entire head and neck, extreme joint and bone pain especially through my back, hips, pubic bone, and knees. The pain reminded me of pre-labor. By the time I reached the urgent care facility around 1:30PM, I was experiencing weakness, dizziness, and fainting, and fever around 102. I was also having trouble breathing but that was due to my anxiety and fear from pain. Urgent care sent me directly to the ER. I arrived at the ER around 2:30 PM. I feel like I waited in the waiting room forever crying out for help because &#34;help me&#34; was all that I could utter. I was finally treated with IV fluids, a few rounds of toradol, Phenergan, benedryl, steroid, morphine. I was also given a spinal tap and kept over night for pain management and observation.

We chatted and joked around, and she was intermittently ok, then symptomatic.  Sx progressed very slowly over about 30 minutes, when she finally said sx were getting much worse and she felt like she was having trouble getting air in.  Medics called and one dose of epi was given, pt said she felt immediately better, but by the time medics arrived, pt was symptomatic again.  She was taken to ER in stable condition.

Symptoms subsided within 12 hours, treated at home otc symptomatic care. Did experience only a few hours of left arm, shoulder and hand pain which was only present with the above symptoms.  Last night (4/3/21, 6 days post vaccine) my left arm, shoulder,  and hand began a very strong ache,  near bedtime. An hour, or less later, I awoke with increased pain accompanied with left sided chest pain and sob. Treated at onset and 6 hours later with no relief, but increase in symptoms. Seen at the ED early 4/4/21 for chest pain and left arm pain. Thorough work up mostly negative with exception of elevated d-dimer levels as well as enlarged axillary nodes. Continue to have left sided chest and left arm pain, but a little less severe than arrival or DC from ED.

                                                Right after injection, I got really hot and flushed. I thought I am not a fan of needles - so I thought it was anxiety. My throat got really dry. They gave me a Dixie cup of water and I asked for more. After I had finished the one cup, I was clearing my throat and it felt like I couldn&#39;t swallow and my tongue had swollen up and I couldn&#39;t swallow any water from next Dixie cup. I couldn&#39;t swallow - it felt like it would get stuck at the back of my throat. The nurse said she was going to stab me with the epi-pen but had me lay down first and my face started to feel slightly numb and I told her that and she stabbed me in right hip with the epi-pen. They called the ambulance to take me to hospital and after the epi-pen was given they had me sit up and put a mask on my face and I was in a state of panic. I wore an oxygen full face mask and was breathing into it. The paramedics came in and put me on stretcher - monitored for six hours. Because of the adrenaline from the epi- pen - I had high blood pressure and heart rates - everything was really high. After a few hours, she told me that my tongue was looking better and there was better color in my tongue. I was sitting there every six hours - I was monitoring as how to I was doing. They gave me Benadryl and I think they gave me something else but I can&#39;t remember what it was. I came home and it was late at night - 11:00 or 11:30 and from there until February 1st, I was extremely sick. I went back to ER on 23rd; and did telehealth visits  - with my doctor  (right after ER visit from Injection was first one; and then I went to the hospital on the 23rd; Telehealth on 24th or 25th and I - I was running fevers of 104, 103 and went up to 105 almost- on 23rd of January - 3 days after injection - I&#39;m weak, I can&#39;t move - everything hurt. From head to toe. I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything. I was so weak, I couldn&#39;t even move. It was difficult just to use the bathroom. I had the fevers that was causing my chills and my body aches were bad. I had been trying to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen; I was finally prescribed Hydro Codone just to sleep. I was told to take this during the day and the Tylenol and Ibuprofen combo at night. Shoulder surgery was about a month after the vaccine - 18th of February - And on the 22nd of February I went to the hospital again for left side chest pains. - I couldn&#39;t breathe - I was discharged February 25th - I was on blood thinners for three months. - the surgeon said that I developed clots and I developed these shortly after surgery and ended up in the hospital for three days. The clots are unknown - blood clots started in the legs and then developed  the fluid/clot issue in the lungs  - I had a pulmonary embolism in my left lung. Surgeon said it could have been caused by vaccine as he did not work on the lower part of my body.

I wasn&#39;t feeling well, but was able to go to work. I had a fever of 101.2 for the next 3 days, along with body aches, no energy--basically felt like I had the flu. I continued to have low energy for the next two day, but was fine after that.  Dose 2 - By 6pm, I had a fever of 102.4. I alternated between Tylenol and Ibuprofen, but couldn&#39;t get it below 101. On 2/15, I got it down to 99. I also had flu-like symptoms and remained in bed up until around the 15th. I called doc on 2/16 and he said I had an upper respiratory infection. He gave me antibiotics and cough medicine and said I could return to work after a COVID test, which was negative. In March, I had a cough and sore throat, then was out of work again for bronchitis in April. I still have trouble breathing, but that could be due to my allergy induced asthma.

My hip joints hurt where I was not able to sleep or go for walks Monday - Wednesday. Tuesday evening (6/8/2021), I started experiencing left chest tightness, near my clavicle/sternum. I would get winded and felt the chest tightness while walking, especially up stairs. My head needed to remain upright because any movement resulted in very painful throbbing near the occipital lobe and upper neck. I felt fatigued and experience brain fog.   I called the respiratory, COVID hotline through the  Clinic and he advised me to be seen immediately. I went to (because we were out of town)

It?s starts off light in my knees and then gets more intense as it gets to my stomach and chest. Then it would start the cycle all over. Knees to chest with my whole body shaking. This went on for about 30 mins. It was so intense I had a hard time catching my breathe. My quad muscles hurt so bad because of the tremors.  This has never happened to me before so it was very scary. Then it happened again on Thursday, June 10th around 11:30pm. Except this time it lasted an hour. It was so painful having those tremors. I had no control of them.  It was hard to breathe at times. I thought I was going to have to go the hospital.

Later that evening had diarrhea.  Within 1 week had COVID-19 symptoms, which included heart palpitations, loss of appetite, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, headaches and fatigue. Was tested for COVID-19 one week after vaccine and was negative. Continued with these symptoms from January 2021 until approximately the end of March. Was seen in the ED twice during that time and seen by my PMD and cardiologist multiple times for evaluation.

About 10 minutes later she felt warm and her throat felt swollen, although it was never difficult to breath.    I asked patient if she would consider taking benedryl.  She said she would take it.  Patient was given 50 mg of benadryl liquid.  Patient stayed one hour past injection time.  Patient was stable after leaving the pharmacy.  Upon follow up the next day, patient said the sensations returned and her husband gave her an undisclosed amount of prednisone (from personal supply at home).  She was markedly improved after that.

On 6/15/21, patient&#39;s significant other discovered patient in bed, not breathing, with ashen appearance, uncertain how long it had been since patient was last breathing.  EMS was contacted, CPR was given and patient was transferred to Emergency Department at the hospital.  Diagnosis of Cardiologist is cardiac arrest, NSTEMI (suspects type 2).  Per cardiologist, patient appears to exhibit cardiomyopathy, etiology difficult to ascertain (patient&#39;s family/acquaintances have endorsed periodic use by patient of anabolic steroids in the past, making it more difficult to rule out source of cardiomyopathy. ). Physicians involved are reporting this case in the event that this may be a case of vaccine-induced myocarditis, although no diagnosis as such has been made.

                                                My asthma has been flaring more then it should be (have to use my rescue inhaler depending upon the activity for the day) since I took the 2nd dosage of the Moderna vaccine. My doctor asked me to take the vaccine because I had it and it would be worst if I had COVID again since I had it last year in May. I didn&#39;t go to the hospital because I didn&#39;t want to be put on a respirator just because I have asthma. Since taking the vaccine I went to urgent care to make sure that I&#39;m fine since I&#39;ve had COVID.

                                                Nearly exactly 24hrs after receiving the first (and only received) Moderna vaccine I suddenly felt incredible chest pain which originated as a dull ache in my left chest and quickly escalated to an immense sharper pain that radiated to my left shoulder and down my left arm. Then some numbness in that arm. I was vaccinated in my right arm. Some breathlessness likely from the pain and surprise itself. Sweating. Went to urgent care nearby and pain resolved within 15mins but would ache periodically. EKG was reportedly normal but my blood pressure was borderline hypertensive which for me is incredibly high and I?ve never seen that before with my vitals. Doctor urged me to go to the emergency dept for troponin labs which along with EKG and chest X-ray were insignificant. I?ve been undergoing cardiac work up sense, all checking out. I have a history of undiagnosed chest pain snd multiple workups in my medical history but this was like nothing I?ve ever experienced. The pain was dull and aching and quickly became debilitating. I?ve never been so scared. The ED physician did not know to order certain blood tests to check for inflammation since the myocarditis and pericarditis incidents were noted over a month since the event. I am too afraid to obtain the second dose. No physician this far, except the one I saw in urgent care will dare hear that this was a result of the vaccination but without a doubt, it was. I know my body. This was something else.

                                                I have, started on May 31, 2021 had very bad hive rash that flared up and traveled all over my body. I have also been experiencing worse than ever asthma attacks worse than ever, where my face gets very bright red, lips turn blue and can hardly breath. When I take my inhaler, and usually after about 15 minutes it calms down. I get headaches, get dizzy often and just feel very fatigued. I am also flushed in the face a lot, my lungs hurt like there is a lot of pressure on them and I also experience cold sweats. I contacted my DR on June 5th 2021 and I could not get in to see my DR so I went to Urgent care on June 6th 2021. They prescribed me with prednisone, a steroid to control the rash and asthma attacks. This did help a bit and then upon ending the steroid, when getting down to two per day, the symptoms came back. At that point I visited my PCD, on Tuesday June 15th 2021. She put me back on the steroids, 3x daily and that did help, she put me on those until I could see my pulmonologist. On Thursday June 17th 2021 and they took me off the steroids, and said there is nothing they can do. I have an appointment with an allergist and a dermatologist in August 2021, which is the earliest they could get me in.

                                                Started having chills and not feeling well about 9pm. Chills got stronger through the night and caused me not to sleep.  My blood pressure was elevated per my fitbit tracker readings and I was a little worried at times as well. Chills continued all night long and did not stop no matter how many blankets I put on while in bed. However, holding my hair dryer to my body and extremities did help the shivering, but then shortly returned for a while before I was able to fall asleep around 3-4am. The next day I did not feel myself, ended up having an anxiety attack and had to call 911 which they confirmed I probably hyper-vinylated. Still had chills for like 2 straight days on an off and no apatite at all during this time, not even warm soup and crackers.

I waited 15 minutes in the lobby, felt fine, and left.  While I was still driving, about 7:45am, I noticed that it had become difficult to swallow.  My throat felt swollen.   I decided to stay close to the hospital, and ended up driving to Pharmacy and taking 50 mg benedryl and 400 mg ibuprofen at 8:00am.  I called my primary care provider and left a message, and decided to go to work (started at 9am). I took another 50 mg of benedryl at noon.  My provider called me early in the afternoon, and was unable to give me advice.  He recommended contacting Hospital (vaccine clinic).  I experienced chills in the afternoon, and after I left work at 3pm, I took another 400 mg of ibuprofen, a hot shower, and slept for 3 hours.  I felt much better after the nap.  I reported all of this to the CDC yesterday afternoon through their &#34;check-in&#34; feature.&#34;

                                                On my 12th minute in the waiting area, I started having itchiness on my legs then it spread to my arms and face. I felt lightheaded and started having difficulty breathing. I approached the paramedic nearby. By then, the itchiness was all over my body from head to toe. They alerted 911 and monitored my vital signs. My 02 sat was 100% and BP was 140/90 mmHg. I asked if I can take Benadryl. They said wait for the ambulance. I declined to go to the hospital unless my symptoms get worse. I then took 25 mg of Benadryl. Shortness of breath and lightheaded ness was slightly relieved but the itchiness was still there. I waited for 30 more minutes in the waiting area. When the itchiness subsided a little bit, I went home. After 3 hours, the itchiness and SOB returned so I called my PCP and I was informed to take Benadryl q4 hrs until symptoms are resolved. As of today, 1/12/21 at 7:18pm, I still have itchiness but not as bad as yesterday.

She felt flushing throughout her entire body as well as some tingling. At 7:05 pm, her oxygen saturation was 97% and her blood pressure was 115/80.  She also had red, irregular-shaped  spots on her right, upper arm  (non-vaccinated arm) and upper back.  At 7:13 pm her oxygen saturation was 98% and her heart rate was 111. She then described the tightness when swallowing from earlier as if the muscles in her throat were numbed, which made it hard to swallow, but not hard to breathe. The tightness improved slightly during the 30 minutes that she was observed, but it did not go away. She felt comfortable leaving and knew which signs to look for that would indicate that she needed to seek medical attention.

Sweaty and flushed, nauseated, felt like I was going to faint, then tachycardia and shortness of breath. Nurses told me this was a normal reaction, took my vital signs, and watched for everything to return back to normal, and told me I could report experience to VAERS. Most of it went away within 10 minutes of onset. I still felt a little dizzy and lightheaded and weak for a couple of hours, and had short spurts of tachycardia the rest of the evening.

Within 20 minutes I was experiencing further shortness of breath, shakiness, and lip numbness and swelling. I received the vaccine through my workplace.  I called the employee health line who recommended that I stay with someone else until the symptoms resolved and for not less than an hour.  It took 2 hours for symptoms to resolve.  I also followed up with my primary care regarding my reaction.

                                                I had burning at the injection site immediately after receiving the vaccine. As I was leaving after 15 minutes I mentioned it to the person checking me out. At this time we noticed redness and hives starting at the injection site. I was told to sit for another 15 minutes but as soon as I sat down again the hives spread rapidly and I began to have dizziness and confusion. At this point I was taken to the ER and on the way I started having nausea and my throat started burning and felt tight. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl, Pepcid, and solumedrol and IM epinephrine. Since discharge I had one instance of hive and facial swelling and continued to take Benadryl for two days. I am now having episodes of shortness of breath and tachycardia.

                                                Hives, lips and throat swelling occurred about 30 minutes after vaccination. Over-the-counter antihistamines alleviated the symptoms temporarily but in 6 hours I had to go to the ER where prednisone was administered with good effect. Feel better the next day, with daily prednisone and over-the-counter Claritin, Pepcid and Benadryl.

Within a few minutes, my throat felt tight, I began sweating and my nose completely clogged. I took ceterizine and benedryl and within 30-45 minutes began to feel relief. My nose was congested for approximately 8 hours after.

Upon returning to work in the pharmacy, she sat down at her desk and noted her HR to be 159 via her Apple watch. She felt slightly lightheaded, so returned to  Auditorium for monitoring. On arrival, she complained only of high HR, no other symptoms. We checked her VS: BP 140/78, HR 132, RR 20, SaO2 94. She denied chest pain or SOB. We monitored her for about 15 minutes, and her HR decreased to 103-110. We monitored her for another 15 minutes or so, at which time her HR spiked again to 132, and she felt heavy in her chest and tight in her throat. At that point, we moved her to a gurney and called a Rapid Response. We administered 50mg of Benadryl IM per protocol, foregoing the Epinephrine, due to her tachycardic state. The Rapid Response team arrived and she was transported to the ED for evaluation. She maintained consciousness and was A&amp;Ox3 the entire time.

Then 8 days after the shot, I got a raised, firm, red, and extremely itchy circle around the injection site. I contacted my doctor who advised antihistamine. I took another zyrtec,  This lasted for about 48hrs and now (4 days after it began) it is still a bit itchy, but not visible anymore.

                                                Morning of vaccination I took a Benadryl 25mg and a zertec 10mg, because I was a little worried since I have previously gone in to anaphylaxis when starting immune boosting allergy shots, at my allergists office.  I took another Benadryl at 5pm that day and 20mg of zertec the evening of the 5th along with my normal medications. Other than a headache and a very sore arm, everything seemed fine.I was happy to get vaccinated.  The morning of the 6th I had planned on taking a Benadryl and zertec again, but got sidetracked and forgot. I had taken my normal morning thyroid pills, and drank my morning coffee, nothing else out of the normal. Nothing to eat, everything was fine until 11:30am (26 hours after vaccination shot) I noticed my throat &amp; tongue starting to shooting pain and then starting to swell. I immediately took a Benadryl &amp; zertec, took my albuterol inhaler and grabbed my epic pen. 15 mins later my pulse was at 139bpm (according to my iWatch) and I felt like I was going to pass out. I auto injected with epic pen, but didn?t know to hold it for 3-10 secs, so I didn?t receive a full dose of the medication. My heart rate started going up again and I was having to focus on my breathing and called 911. An ambulance came and I had to give myself another Epi Pen injection as I couldn?t breathe. The ambulance crew (two people -were not EMT?s and just a volunteer crew), so I had to inject myself, as they watched and I pulled the epi Pen away again, which I learned from them was incorrect to do. Just the little amount of medication I got from the Epi Pen semi calmed things down for around 20 mins, then 10 mins away from ER  - my HR went up to 149bpm (I was informed by ambulance attendant and verified with the heart monitor on iWatch later), I was fighting unconsciousness (was told by attendant my BP dropped out and I lost all my color) and could not breathe. I went limp and couldn?t hold my head up, the attendant helped to support my arm as I auto injected myself with the last Epi Pen, and held it for a 10sec count.   [ER report has misinformation. All of my Epi Pens were expired and I knew this, but its all I had. I also injected myself with all of them unlike the ER report says. For some reason the ER doctor was not fully listening to what had happened (from the ambulance crew and from me) and made mistakes in the ER Report. I have been advised to contact the hospital and address the ER Doc actions and report issues for my visit.]  As we pulled up to ER, the epi pen had calmed most everything down, my heart rate was just slightly elevated and my breathing was still difficult and I had to focus on that. I was administered Steroids and Pepcid AC, intravenously at the ER and was monitored. Then was released an hour or two later when all my functions where at a normal readings.   Everyday since I have continued a course of Benadryl, Zertec, Pepcid AC, albuterol, 200mg Celebrex, and 11mg ER Xeljanz. I have still been experiencing throat tightness and extra phlegm and have also started to take a daily 20mg steroid course to help with remanding allergic symptoms, I have been having as directed by my allergist. I?m hoping the vaccine clears my system soon as it still seems to be affecting my system and my body is very ?hyper vigilant? it seems. My allergist said he does feel it to be safe with the Johnson&amp;Johnson Vaccine (when/if) it gets approved for further vaccinating me, as I have had no issues with any other vaccines in the past.

I was in the middle of treating a PT. Scratchy throat; mild cough; persistent moderate headache; runny nose; diarrhea; very pale. Never had a fever. I had weird neurological side affects (didn&#39;t lose taste or smell  ) issues with facial recognition - didn&#39;t recognize my own face and finding words for every day objects and making sentences was difficult . I was easily winded and had tightness in my lungs. I called Public Health office - and asked them what to do. She told me to go home. Dr  (telehealth visit) told me to take a test in the parking lot that day for COVID January 6. Treatment  - none. All o f my symptoms lasted until Friday January 8 except being winded and fatigued. Those last two symptoms lasted until January 19.  Verbal issues also lasted until the 19th of January. Facial recognition came back around January 12.  On January 27 I had second dose.

                                                40 minutes after injection my tongue and throat began to swell and then close.  I had no saliva and could not swallow without sipping on water.  I stopped at a clinic to be near a facility in case I could not breath anymore.  They watched me for a bit (though I did not fully &#34;check in&#34;.  The doctor suggested I get checked at an ER.  I went to ER and sat in the ER parking lot for two hours waiting to see if my symptoms got worse.  I did not want to use the ER unless I felt like I was in dire need.  After the couple of hours my symptoms weekend (but were still there).  I went to a friends place to not be alone in case the swelling increased again.  The next night I felt back to normal.  I have never had that reaction to anything, so I was a bit scared.

                                                Once vaccine was administered I felt short of breath but didn?t pay any mind. I thought it was my anxiety. About 6 I started to feel tired with a headache. About 8 pm my throat started to feel itchy. Next day I woke up with my chest feeling tight with a cough and phlegm. I thought it was just a side affect of vaccine and took my inhaler. On Saturday I woke up with a bad migraine and my chest still hurting. I knew something was wrong. I went to urgent care. I had ekg and X-ray and Covid test done. The ekg numbers came back low so dr requested a CT. My results came back as me having Covid in my left lung. Covid testing came back positive the next day. Prior to vaccine I did not feel sick or have any symptoms of being sick.

She then approached me and stated she had mild SOB but was not sure if it was due to her anxiety about the vaccine or if it was a reaction.  She had no other complaints of dizziness, throat swelling, hives, sweating, etc.  She was able to speak without hesitation or difficulty, but I asked her to remain in the store a little longer to be monitored and not to drive home.  Her BP was 123/68 and HR was 66.  She decided to take a alprazolam tablet which she uses for her anxiety.  About 15 minutes later, she did not feel any improvement in breathing, but was still able to speak.  Her BP was 122/68 and HR was 70.  I decided to call paramedics to be safe and evaluate the patient.  The paramedics arrived in about 5 minutes and assessed her.  They stated all her vitals were stable and felt she did not need further intervention unless her symptoms worsened.    She was advised to follow up with her physician.

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

Patient was given  25mg of Benadryl orally with water and asked to wait in the pharmacy for an additional 30 minutes to determine if reaction was progressing.  At the completion of the additional 30 minutes, patient stated she felt fine and left the pharmacy with her friend who was with her the entire time.    At 5:31pm, I spoke to the patient over the phone and the patient stated she felt fine but was experiencing a mild rash on her chest.  Patient was advised to call 911 if any breathing difficulty was experienced.

She took a nap and when she woke up she could not lift her arm at all.  Had pain in the neck, wrist, arm.  She had pain/feelings in that arm.  She woke up sometime after midnight sitting up because she woke up and had a tingling sensation in her throat and felt as if her throat was going to close on her.  She did not go back to sleep fearing this.  She took 600 mg of Tylenol, as well as 600 mg today.  She has been better today, and thinks that she had the swelling and pain due to the way that the woman gave her the injection.   She has not notified her doctor.  She is not having any chills, and her arm is just sore right now, but able to use is otherwise.  When she lifts the arm it hurts, as well as shoulder/ball of her arm hurts.

Tried to make coffee/breakfast/get ready, but kept almost blacking out when I would stand more than a few minutes. Vision started blacking out, had a hard time breathing, weak, felt like I was about to faint, nauseated, felt like heart was trying to stop. Would lay down every time this would happen, then ears would ring and would have a headache. Finally was able to eat a banana after a couple of hours of almost blacking out multiple times and the banana seemed to help.  5pm: feel much better.  Wed 3/24: dizzy Thurs/Fri 3/25-26: dizzy and wee bit faint feeling. Didn?t feel right 4/03/21: still a little dizzy/vertigo  Could you shed light if this was an allergic reaction hours later, please?  I need to know so I can figure out what I am allergic to so this doesn?t happen again.

On the third day the fever decreased to 40% and the body aches decreased to 20% but the headache continued and the shortness of breath also. The day was no longer fever, the muscle aches were somewhat better, but the headache, chest pressure and breathing problems continued and I went to  and was evaluated by a doctor and treated with some injections. The headache improved almost 100%, but I continued with breathing problems and for 2 days I presented as bruises on the body and face. Breathing and chest are definitely what worry me the most because I already have treatment and I&#39;m not getting better.

Patient stated she was feeling &#34;weird and a little dizzy&#34; Jonetta had her recline her seat and open her window for air. She reported worsening dizziness and called APP (who happened to be very close).  APP arrived to car and asked for observation / emergency supply cart. Found patient reclined in passenger seat c/o feeling weird and dizzy. APP noted increased respiratory rate and patient said she felt faint. She then slumped in seat and appeared to lose consciousness for a few seconds. She was breathing although breathing appeared mildly labored. She opened her eyes after a few seconds and began to shiver significantly. Pre-epinephrine assessment by APP: BP WNL, tachycardia and elevated respiratory rate. Skin cold. No wheezes.  APP administered 0.3mg of epinephrine IM at 1237 to right thigh through jeans. Patient tolerated well. Vital signs post epinephrine showed an initially high BP and heart rate and then returned to within normal limits 5-10 minutes later. Patient feeling much better after epinephrine.  I was assigned clinical site lead, I arrived on scene 3-4 minutes after APP. I called 911 and ambulance arrived within 3-4 minutes. Patient did not want to go to hospital but agreed to get in ambulance for 12 lead EKG and vital signs, all of which were stable. Patient refused hospital. Husband drove her home at approximately 1:30pm.  APP called MD on call, they called patient at approximately 2:30pm and reported to APP that she was at home with no further symptoms

                                                I contracted Covid-19 a week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. I had all symptoms of the disease after the vaccine except for a fever and then I got tested and was positive. I got the second dose of the vaccine 23 days after testing positive with Covid-19. I started having Heart Palpitations three days after the second shot. Six days after the shot I started to have a high heart rate. It was 111-132 resting intermittently throughout the day. It is still doing that after 10 weeks and I am scheduled to be put on a heart monitor this week. I sometimes had shortness of breath when I was having Palpitations. I have a normal heart rate of 52-58 . My doctor is unsure whether it is a symptom of Covid-19 or from the vaccine. After twelve weeks the symptoms have been consistent since they started.

Day 2: fatigue, headache for half a day in the am and started developing heavy breathing and sudden changes in cardiac rhythm (mild). Days 3-6 heavy breathing and changes in cardiac rhythm continued increasing, particularly at night. Took ibuprofen, increased liquid intake, rested. Days 7-8: Symptoms were a bit milder. Day 9: Tachycardia at night, sensation of fainting. Day 10 to 19 (today): dizziness that varies from lightheadedness to vertigo to nausea every single day.  I went to the pharmacy on Day 16 and got Sea Band Accupressure bands, ginger Dramamine and ginger gum which have helped a little.  As a side note, I am a very healthy person who has never suffered a side effect like this one from any vaccine. I haven&#39;t even had a cold in the past year. I had to google the symptoms online and found a thread at VEDA (vestibular.org) with a very long list of people who are suffering from the same thing.

                                                Got vaccine and less than an hour later when driving down the road I had this strange sensation like something was stuck in my throat. I tried to cough to clear it multiple times and drank water with no result. Of note that I had not and was not eating. I then started to feel like my throat was closing up and it was hard to swallow. I have had anaphylaxis in the past from taking Bactrim, so I was very familiar with the feeling in my throat.  I drove straight to the emergency room where I was given IV Bendadryl and Pepcid. They watched me for a few hours and sent me home on Benadryl for 5 days. The doctor did say that my cervical lymph nodes were swollen as well.   I had COVID in November. I did get pretty sick with the first and second shot. No allergic reaction to first shot. It almost seems as if it put me back into a spiral of fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches and dry cough. I have been struggling with being dizzy, weak and fatigued again since vaccines.

                                                Client received first dose of Moderna at 0848. Per vaccinator who gave injection - client was tearful and reported anxiety about receiving injection. Per client she reports that her arm immediately felt &#34;heavy and tingly&#34;.  She did not tell anyone and proceded to post-vaccine monitoring area with her spouse. She reports that she started feeling &#34;more tingly&#34; at 0903. By 0908 she reported difficulty breathing and PHN responded.  She was making occasional gasping sounds and crying. She was able to speak and HR was  ~72 BPM per her wearable device. Respirations were shallow and frequent.  Spouse was supportive and stated that she was having a panic attack because she hadn&#39;t had a shot since her childhood and was very anxious about the vaccine. He also reported that they hadn&#39;t slept or eaten anything due to attending to elderly dog  and that &#34;this is what her panic attacks look like&#34;. PHN attempted to have client take deeper, slower breaths while continuing to assess. Client&#39;s breathing improved. Meanwhile 3 other PHNs responded and then client began to have difficulty breathing again. One PHN called 911. She then reported she was feeling  &#34;tingly everywhere&#34;  and her &#34;eyes felt like they were sweating&#34; Then her hands began to cramp and her face was pale. 0.5 mL epinephrine injected in RA at 0910 by another PHN. Vitals taken at 0910 were 120/85, 73bmp. She reported that her symptoms were beginning to alleviate.  EMS arrived at 0915 followed by paramedics at 0918. Vitals at 0918 were 110/68, 60 bmp, 100% SpO2. Vitals at 0922 were 131/98 and 62 BPM.  Paramedics discussed possibility of it being a panic attack but recommended going to hospital to be monitored - discussed spouse driving vs paramedic transport. At this point client shared that her HR at approx 0905 was 45 bpm per her wearable device. EMS discussed how this is another indicator of anaphylaxis and recommended ambulance transport. Client agreed and she was transported at 0930.

                                                Patient received vaccine at 2:15 pm at Public Health clinic. She waited the appropriate 15 minute observation period and was feeling well. She then came to PCP office for a routine medical exam and reported feeling well when she first came, although her blood pressure was slightly elevated but pulse was normal. She was taken to an exam room and left for approximately 5 minutes, at which time she presented to the nurses station reporting that she thought her tongue may be swelling. Nurse evaluated and got NP to evaluate immediately. Patient reported she could still breath normally and swallow but that she was still feeling the swelling increase. At this time NP left to get PCP while nurse elevated HOB as patient began to choke on her tongue. PCP ordered epinephrine, 1 mL administered immediately. 911 called. Patient reported she was starting to feel better, swelling began to decrease. She then started to feel shaky, was pale and diaphoretic. She lost consciousness for approximately 10 seconds and pulse was not palpable. Staff readied for CPR and AED brought to room but patient regained consciousness prior to any care being necessary. She began to speak in full, clear sentences and was alert and oriented. 2L o2 applied. She was speaking with staff normally for around 5 minutes while awaiting ambulance, began to feel hot and felt her heart racing. Her PCP advised her that this was a normal sensation brought on by epi. As EMS arrived, patient reported feeling intense chest pain radiating down left arm, intense headache, and tingling in her fingers. As she was being transported to stretcher, patient experienced a 1.5 minute seizure followed by an episode of vomiting. She then left the building via ambulance and was take to Hospital emergency department. There it appears that she received 2 more rounds of IM epinephrine, IV epi, CPR, and was intubated. She was transferred from there to ICU where she is currently admitted on ventilation under sedation and receiving cardiac testing due to continued hypoxia and tachycardia.

On the second day of the application they say that it has nothing to do but yes, because I did not bring any of that, 2nd dose that was on June 3, 2021 at the time I started with a headache, body, eyes, nausea, tiredness, sleepiness, temperature. On day 4 I was already there that I could not even breathe from the pain so strong that the 800 ibuprofen only calmed the pain for 3 hours and did not take it away completely, that same day I sent a message to my doc where they told me I had to go to the emergency room to help me, but I had no one to take me. By afternoon I could no longer bear the pain in my body, head, eyes, neck, armpits, and I had some bruises. Today the 6th I still have pain, head, body, neck.

Initially after the vaccine she had mild headache, low grade fever, fatigue and body aches which resolved within 2 days.  The SHOB and wheezing didn&#39;t begin until over a week later.  She can relate no other trigger for her asthma and has not had an exacerbation in several years until this.  Note, one letter on vaccine card is unreadable.

Sunday evening 6/6/21 around 8:00PM I thought I was experiencing heartburn &amp; took 20mg of famotadine which didn&#39;t alleviate my symptoms. Overnight the pain in my chest moved to my neck, back, &amp; left shoulder. I called the hotline &amp; was advised to go to the ER to be checked for a heart problem. The ER staff ran tests &amp; discovered nothing wrong with my heart. I was prescribed 500mg Acetaminophen &amp; 40mg Pantoprazole. The Acetaminophen helped with the muscle pain &amp; as the muscle pain eased, so did the pain that came with breathing so I think I never had heartburn, just bizarrely extreme muscle pain.

                                                I took Benadryl 5 minutes before  getting my vaccination since I had had a moderate allergic reaction to the first dose (itching at vaccine site, puffy lips, elevated heart rate, nausea, coughing). Within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I presented with a rash on my face, chest, elbows, and knees. After 30 minutes, I began feeling unwell and the nurse on site suggested I go to Urgent Care or an ER. My husband drove me to an Urgent Care nearby. As I was filling out the paperwork, I felt a rapid pulse, extreme nausea, confusion, trouble with motor skills like filling on intake paperwork. After completing the  paperwork at the Urgent Care, they informed us that they didn&#39;t want anything to do with the covid vaccine. My husband found an ER nearby and we went there. The ER offered me a wheel chair to wheel me back because I was feeling unsteady on my feet. They gave me intravenous fluids, steroids, and pepcid, and monitored me for about an hour until my rash dissipated  and my heart rate returned to normal. The doctor then gave me a prescription for 4 days worth of oral prednisone and  7 days of famotidine.  If I had had an epi-pen at the time (I now have one for my wheat allergy), I would have epi-penned myself while I was at the Urgent Care.  Additional effects post-vaccine:  the rash  and racing heart rate reappeared several times throughout the following week, increased cough and shortness of breath for 2 weeks, my following menstrual cycle began 5 days early (my menstrual cycle is typically very regular at 28 days).   After a 2-week recovery period from the vaccine, I saw some improvement in some of my long covid symptoms such as  cough and shortness of breath.  Likely related to long covid, I continue to have symptoms of chest pain, racing heart rate/palpitations, nausea, dizziness. Due to these symptoms, I am undergoing continued testing by my doctors and I had two ER visits during the month of June on 6/16/2021 and 6/18/2021. So far, we have no diagnosis or treatment plan.

                                                Starting on July 2nd my feet started tingling and going numb. On July 3rd my feet and lower legs were tingling and going numb in the evening. On the 3rd, I also got the worst headache I have ever experienced in my life. On the 4th I woke up with a lingering headache and the back of my neck was kind of stiff.  My feet and legs were tingling/feeling numb on and off during the day and my left arm started to go tingly/numb as well. At about 2:30 a.m. on July 5th, I woke up with difficulty breathing and all 4 legs and arms were numb and tingly, and I was very weak. I was taken to the E.R. by my family. At the E.R. they did a lumbar puncture and  blood work and sent me by ambulance to larger hospital. While there, I went through further testing including an MRI and additional blood work. The conclusion was that I was experiencing paresthesia possibly caused by a strong autoimmune reaction.
