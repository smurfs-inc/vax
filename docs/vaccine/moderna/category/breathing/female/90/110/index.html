The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 24-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) .5 milliliter.

On 16-Mar-2021, the patient experienced NAUSEA (nausea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and VOMITING (vomiting (thick mucusy stomach fluid)) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 21-Mar-2021, the patient experienced OESOPHAGITIS (esophagus is severely inflamed) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and FEEDING DISORDER (unable to eat or hold down fluids) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 21-Mar-2021 due to FEEDING DISORDER, NAUSEA, OESOPHAGITIS, PLEURAL EFFUSION and VOMITING.

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In February 2021, Blood test: normal (normal) blood work done shortly before getting COVID vaccine and everything came back normal.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Additional information: Patient was admitted to the hospital 10 days ago on 21Mar2021. Nausea and vomiting was continuing, patient&#39;s esophagus is severely inflamed, patient is unable to eat or hold down fluids, had to start TPN, has had Gastro-Intestinal biopsies performed, Computed Axial Tomography scans, endoscopy, esophagram, oncologist consulted-nothing showing up, fluid in bottom of lungs, ascites-pulling fluid off abdominal cavity with paracentesis (first on 5Mar2021, second paracentesis scheduled for today.) Doctors have been in touch with another facility.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She was totally dependent in her care needs. She received the vaccine on 1/2/2021 as part of the facility vaccination campaign. No adverse events noted initially. On 1/3/2021 at 6:06 pm, she was noted on vital sign checks (done every 4 hours for first 72 hours after vaccination) with BP 64/52 but otherwise asymptomatic. Subsequent BP improved. On 1/4/2021 at 4:45 am, pt found with respiratory rate of 30 with otherwise normal vital signs. Tachypnea persisted, so she received liquid morphine 2.5 mg without improvement. Supplemental oxygen was applied. Tachypnea persisted. She had poor oral intake after that point had persistent tachypnea and worsening hypoxemia despite clear lungs on exam. She remained under hospice care and comfort measures were continued. No blood testing or imaging tests were done. She required increasing amounts of oxygen, became hypotensive, and died peacefully on 1/8/2021 at 7:45 pm.

                                                Narrative:  Patient received dose 1 of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/11/21 from clinic. Vaccine was administered to patient without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without any adverse effects. No documentation as to any adverse effects following the 15 minutes post-vaccination. 11 days later on 3/22/21, EMS was dispatched to patient&#39;s home and patient was found lying supine, unconscious, and unresponsive to stimuli. Patient was noted to have shallow breathing per EMS staff, and was subsequently brought to the hospital. Per family, patient lives alone and was feeling well - they had spoken to her two days prior to the event. Per family patient did not have recent fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, or cough. Also no recent medication changes or trauma. PMH includes stroke approx. 8 years ago, gout, HLD, HTN, and RLS. BP upon admission was 126/93, HR 123, temp 37.1 degrees Celcius, RR 28. Patient noted to smell of urine. CT showed large completed right sided infarct consistent with MCA stroke. Per neurology the lesion was not recoverable and patient would be unlikely to regain any function. Family was notified and poor prognosis was discussed. Patient has been very clear in the past that she would prefer &#34;to go when her time came&#34;. She had a DNR And DNI as well. Daughter requested to pursue comfort measures for patient, therefore she was transferred to hospice care. Patient passed away the following day on 3/23/21. Death very unlikely due to COVID-19 vaccination since CT imaging clearly showed cerebral infarct and patient had a PMH of stroke.

Patient had no appetite, refused most food and spent many hours simply sitting in her chair.  She felt that she was having a heart attack and called 911 using her emergency response button on 2/21/2021.  Doctors indicated that the patient&#39;s life was in serious danger, but because of age they were hesitant to try to remove the clot pressing on her heart.  She was only allowed to go back home because we utilized Hospice.  When asked about her life expectancy, we were told she could die any minute or might live a few more months, but that she was not expected to live much longer.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION!
