                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient  is a 29 y.o.  with a history that includes # Asthma # Diabetes, recently diagnosed # Obstructive sleep apnea # Remote pulmonary embolism, no longer on anticoagulation who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of known COVID-19, since admitted to Hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -&gt; 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.

                                                Mild dry cough beginning Wednesday (about 24 hours after vaccination) and becoming a moderate cough on Thursday into Friday, calming back into a mild cough later on Friday and nearly gone as of now (Saturday afternoon). Throat felt dry during the same period, leading to unusually high water intake and frequent urination, and briefly some discomfort and slight pain around the front-right part of waist that I assume was due to too much water and urination. Also Thursday night, I had some potential chills ? but no fever when I checked Friday morning. Also during this three-day period I felt fatigue, and lay in bed most of the day Friday. Also during this three-day period  I was congested and had a runny nose, but I have had those for weeks presumably due to allergies  Today I feel mostly but not quite healthy.

                                                The day after the vaccine I had a fever and body aches, nothing too significant and it subsided after about 12 hours.  The following day, about 48 hours after vaccination I experienced blood and protein in my urine.  This happened with both doses.  Dose 1 was administered April 6th at the same facility.  Timeline was of event was consistent with dose 2, fever 24 hours later and blood in urine 48 hours later.  Dose 1 I did an online visit with a doctor,  to discuss issue and they informed me see if issue goes away in a day and if it does to not be concerned.  This did happen so I continued onwards.  Dose 2 I experienced blood in urine again and went to my family Doctor to be treated.  They found high amounts of blood and protein in urine and sent me to the lab for diagnostics.   about 32 hours from original onset urine appeared to be normal. On Monday the 10th I went in for an ultrasound.  Results came back normal with no sign of issue.  Due to the same complication occurring with identical timelines, I feel the vaccine interacts with my body negatively and possibly caused some type of acute kidney injury.  My physician is hesitant to diagnose, but I am hoping the CDC can help me understand further what is going on.  At minimum, I want to know if I should avoid further COVID vaccines, mRNA vaccines etc. and if I need to take any preventative measures protecting my kidney or body due to possible complications related to these events.

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

He blackout but I quickly got him to lay flat on floor. During that time (about a minute) he had some jerking and wet himself a bit. I elevated his feet and called my technician just in case needed to call 911 and perform CPR/Epi but we didn&#39;t need to go that route. He loss his consciousness and quickly regained it after about a minute. I had him continue to remain laying down for 15 mins and then after patient felt comfortable I helped him back into seat inside vaccine room to monitor patient for another 20 minutes. After monitoring he was fine and left thanking me that I stayed calm to help him.

It started with abdominal pain and the next day I had a fever.  I went to the ER it was discovered that I had elevated Liver Function tests and Eosinophilia.  There was Bilirubin in my Urine.  I was discharged the next day. The fever persisted and I returned to the ER. My levels were much worse and my Eosinophil levels were climbing. I also developed a rash on my hands and feet. After extensive testing nothing definitive was found. I have not had any problems like this before.

Patient was tensing up and unresponsive (looked like a mini-seizure). Patient peed on himself and after 3-4 seconds patient was fully responsive. Patient stated he was fine and didn&#39;t know what happened. Patient did not want me to call an ambulance and person with him told me not to call. We waited a little longer, patient complained of feeling really hot. He laid down on the floor and I gave him some water and a lollipop to increase sugar levels. After 3-5 minutes patient sat down on the chair and stated he was feeling much better. After a few minutes, he complained of wanting to vomit. As soon as I was able to give him a bag, he violently threw up. Patient stated that he was now feeling much better. He went to the bathroom and cleaned up. After a little longer observation, patient said he was fine and wanted to go home. They left. I called patient an hour later and he stated he felt fine and was just resting. Will follow up with patient tomorrow.

Each bout of pain would last to a maximum of 30 seconds, with varying lengths of time per bout. The pain radiating to the foot was pulsating per patient. Patient stated very sensitive chest feeling when the urge to urinate came. Through the emptying of the bladder, the sensitivity continues, and is gone after urination is finished. There can be some radiating pain from kidneys to the bladder at this point too.

                                                After my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on 12/31/2020 I had symptoms of a urinary tract infection, which I did not think was related at the time and considered it a fluke.  Today, however, after the second dose the symptoms are worse (more pain while urinating, lots of blood in urine, frequent urgency).  I have an appointment in the morning to see a doctor about the cause but this happened after both vaccine doses.

                                                I received my first shot on 1/12/21 and felt weakness and lethargy initially.  I was not able to lift the same amount of weight nor stay on a cardio machine as I once did (I exercise daily).  It never improved.  After my second shot on 2/9/21 I began to develop symptoms of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis).  I was awaking up at night, drinking a 40oz bottle of water and urinating every hour during hours of sleep.  I lost a significant amount of weight as well (I was questioned at work about it).  I have no family history of diabetes and I have always been lean and fit.  I went to the doctor on 2/27/21 because symptoms became overwhelming.

                                                I was diagnosed with UTI.  They said there was small traces of blood in my urine. They gave me prescription to this.  It seem to clear up.  I had served pain on July 5th in my groin area.  It felt like I was passing a kidney stone.  I went to the ER. They did blood work.  They gave me a CT scan, that was fine.  They gave me pain medicine.  They did not know what is causing it.  I had a cystoscopy done, that can back negative.  They did another urine sample, negative on infection.  They gave me antibiotic just in case.  They thought that my prostate was inflammation.  They gave me medicine for that, and it seem to help.
