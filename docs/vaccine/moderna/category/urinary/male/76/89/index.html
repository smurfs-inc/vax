                                                Reported via Nurse Triage / PCP:  Fainted earlier, eyes rolled back, mouth was drooping. Nausea, weakness, and chills. BP was 107/75, HR in the 70s. Currently alert and resting.  States that patient had his 2nd covid vaccine yesterday AM and then develop chills and clammy skin last night.  Symptoms worsened today and patient became weak and fainted.  Was unconscious for about 5 minutes and while unconscious, mouth was open and drooling and became incontinent and eyes rolled back in head.  Is awake and alert now, but still weak and only able to take 1 or 2 steps.  No chest pain or breathing difficulty and no fever.  Feeling very nauseous.  Caller requesting prescription for zofran.      Yesterday AM 2nd vaccine. Last night chills. This AM feeling weak. Today at 11am he felt weak with ambulation. He fainted. Was unconscious for 5 min. Had drooping of the face. He was unresponsive during this time. Had incontinence of urine. Then became awake but very weak still. Only able to walk a few steps. He is communicating. No chest pain. No current fever. No shortness of breath. BP 107/75 with HR 70. He has been very nauseated. He is drinking only small sips of water. Does not seem like a usually COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Given the LOC with urinary incontinence and sustained weakness, I advised ER evaluation to rule out neurological issues. Pt&#39;s daughter in agreement. They will go to ER.  From Emergency Department:  Patient presenting with chief complaint of syncopal episode which was witnessed by his wife.  He reported the got dizzy and lightheaded and then passed out while seated.  The reported duration of his loss of consciousness was somewhat inconsistent, unclear how long he passed out for, there was however no postictal state.  He was not noted have any shaking or seizure activity, he did have an episode of urinary incontinence.  He has not been feeling well ever since receiving his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.  By the time of my exam patient states that he is completely asymptomatic, he states he is feeling much better after receiving IV fluids.  His lab work is remarkable for a slightly low sodium, compared to his previous levels which were many months ago.  Unclear of the acuity of this, although upon further discussion with the patient he has been drinking large amounts of water since his vaccine trying to stay hydrated.  I advised him to substitute to some electrolyte balanced fluids and to have his sodium rechecked by his PCP to ensure that this is transient.  With negative testing and resolution of his symptoms he is stable for discharge home.  Close return precautions were given.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

He tried to stand up and then he passed out on the floor for about 10-15 minutes.  He went to sleep and woke up around 5 hours later.  He then tried it again and urinated on himself and he fell down on the floor, passed out without getting up until the morning.   He did call his doctor who was not available, spoke to the nurse and advised to go to the hospital.  He is weak and cannot drive so he did not go to the hospital.  He slept the rest of that day and the following day.  Then when he saw his doctor about 2 days ago, he described his reaction and told to report the reaction and that he would report it himself.  He was advised not to take the 2nd vaccination.  He is no longer having the heavy reaction, his muscles are aching and his vision is  blurred, especially on his back and the shoulder.   His doctor did do blood work at the office visit.

                                                UTI; Anemia; Colitis; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 77 years-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who developed anemia, colitis and Urinary Tract Infection (UTI).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039k208) on 29 Dec 2020. On 26 Jan 2021, approximately 6 days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 019K20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Feb 2021, the patient had a hospital visit for anemia and colitis for which patient was admitted and was discharged on 04 Feb 2021.The patient was again admitted to the hospital on 22 Feb 2021, for UTI and was at the hospital at the time of reporting.   Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information has been provided for this cases Although, a temporal association exist between the product use and the reported events of anemia and colitis, critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medication list lacking.  Urinary tract infection is of an infective etiology as  such a causal relationship is unlikely.

                                                Not sure if covid vaccine caused this, but this is what happened - Received covid vaccine.  two days later had violent shakes in the night.  Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine.

Later he was able to take a sit down shower and shampoo and   be an to feel &#34;nearly human&#34; again.  He has slowly progressed since then and Monday morning was able to navigate by himself and to descend and ascend a 13 stair step to the basement.    In discussing the 24 hours he spent in bed he was unaware of any of the things going  on such as not being able to move, but knew he was in pain if he moved his legs.  He also had a temperature of 102.3 which rose to 102.9 and then with cold compress on his forehead and time his fever dropped to 95.4 and the back up to a normal of 97.5.  These are similar symptoms he had after the first injection of the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine and he had had a similar reaction in 2017 from the first flu shot he ever had in his life.  He felt he needed to take this vaccine in order to be able to &#34;have a life&#34; even though we assumed he would have such a bad reaction.  He is slowly improving and if it is like the first injection it will take him nearly two weeks before he can ambulate at the level he was before the vaccination.  Still, he is grateful to Center for being so proactive as to have available the vaccine and it being more convenient for cancer patients than waiting in line at a mass inoculation center.   He would appreciate an acknowledgement that this information has been received and could possibly passed along to help others in his situation.  Thanks.

                                                Around 4:30am on the day after administration of the vaccination, patient went into ventricular tachycardia and his ICD attempted anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). Per electrophysiology note after interrogation of patient&#39;s ICD: &#34;Multiple VT episodes beginning around 4:30 AM, and continuing intermittently through 10:15 AM, approximately. There were 19 treated VT episodes, mostly terminated with ATP therapy. There was a single 24J shock delivered at 9:43 AM after a VT episode lasting 1 min, 4 seconds, with average ventricular rate 171 bpm. This appeared to be an appropriate shock after exhausting 8 ATP attempts. On 5 other occasions the patient required 4 or more ATP sequences to terminate VT. The remainder terminated with 1-2 ATPs. Reviewing the far field electrograms, there appear to be 2 distinct VT morphologies. Average ventricular rates for both are about 170-180 bpm.&#34;  Patient presented to the emergency room, where he received amiodarone IV, and was admitted to an inpatient cardiology service. He was restarted on amiodarone and was noted to be hemodynamically stable and not in VT; however, he opted to leave the hospital AMA on 3/15. As noted previously (item 11), he has a history of VT and had discontinued amiodarone due to side effects about 6 weeks prior to this episode. As amiodarone has a half-life of around 45 days, it is thought that his rhythm control was suboptimal at the time of this vaccination, and there is no evidence that it was the vaccination that caused the VT episodes on 3/14.

                                                Acute pancreatitis; Acute renal failure; Low blood pressure; Weakness; Decreased appetite; Fatigue; Alanine aminotransferase increased; Aspartate aminotransferase increased; Troponin increased; Lipase increased; Blood bilirubin increased; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning an 81-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed an odd presentation of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue.  The patient&#39;s medical history included advanced dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism and possible leukemia. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 08 Jan 2021, three days after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of weakness, decreased appetite, and fatigue.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted into the hospital with a diagnosis of low blood pressure,acute renal failure,acute pancreatitis,alanine aminotransferase increased,aspartate aminotransferase increased, troponin increased,lipase increased and blood bilirubin increased. Abnormal lab results included &#34;significantly elevated&#34; aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, lipase up to 1900, and &#34;slightly elevated&#34; troponin of 0.079.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had improved, and he was discharged. Treatment for the event included two liters of intravenous fluid and supportive care.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.    The events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, were considered resolved on 13 Jan 2021.   The physician assessed the events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, as not related to mRNA-1273. The physician&#39;s rationale was that the patient may have had a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct and once the stone passed, the patient got better with supportive care and slow administration of fluids.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 81-year-old male patient with medical history of dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and possible leukemia, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, the non-serious listed event of fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of weakness, decreased appetite, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine transaminase, elevated bilirubin, elevated lipase, and elevated troponin.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on the current available information and in agreement with the physician reporter&#39;s assessment, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273, noting the rapid improvement after administration of IV fluids.

                                                On Tuesday after receiving the vaccine Lowell fell out of bed and was unable to get up. I called 911 and the EMTs helped him up into his wheelchair. Since he has Parkinson&#39;s and has balance problems he is unable to stand on his own for very long. All day Tuesday he was incoherent and fell twice in the bathroom where on the floor he was incontinent of his bowels. Later in the day he was incontinent of urine while sitting in his chair and was unaware of it. Two days later he says he doesn&#39;t recall any of that but his cognition seems to be better now. I think this should be a warning for Parkinson&#39;s patients.

                                                death Narrative:  Patient received Moderna covid #1 on 1/9/21 and #2 on 2/8/21. On 2/24/21, he was sent to the ER at a facility from a nursing home where he was admitted for skilled nursing care. He was sent to the ER due to fever, decreased mental status, renal failure, possible UTI and possible pneumonia. He was admitted and received IV fluids, Zosyn and Solu Medrol. On 2/26/21, a consult was placed for hospice care and he was accepted for hospice care at a contract nursing home. Upon review of scanned records, it appears he had a stroke/intercranial hemorrhage on 2/10/21 and that is why he was admitted to the nursing home for skilled nursing services. A date of death of 3/18/21 is recorded. No autopsy results recorded. 38 days from vaccine #2 and date of death.

He started c/o discomfort and appetite decreased.  2/18/21 had low grade fever.  2/22  fever and generalized weakness and abnormal labs (elevated potassium).  2/22 hydration was started.  2/25 antibiotic started for UTI for 7 days.  Patient seem to improve except appetite.  Since vaccine, patient remained on frequent IV hydration and had poor appetite through February into March.  On 3/2/21, patient received 2nd dose of  Moderna Vaccine while on Augmentin for UTI, issue with dehydration and appetite.  By 3/4/21, patient was noticed to have trouble chewing and swallowing.  Speech was ordered.   On 3/5/21, it was noted patient had continued poor appetite, weakness, dehydration risk, debility.  On 3/8/21, it was noted patient had intermittent confusion.  By 3/10/21, patient was more alert.   Patient remained fairly consistent from that time with poor appetite, dehydration issue, weakness and dysphagia management.  Then on 3/27/21 he became disoriented, wheezing, labored breathing,   Vitals were 92% oxygen on room air, Temp 97.5, 158/62, pulse 94.  Oxygen started and sent to ER.  Family reported patient is admitted to hospital with mild stroke and UTI.   The vaccine seemed to change patient&#39;s state of health about 2 weeks post first dose with multiple sequelae.  This seems similar to timing of actual COVID infection pattern when it is the actual virus.

                                                He had the vaccine, everything was fine until he got up around 12:30 AM.  He was shaking really, really bad with tremors.  His wife got up and he had urinated on himself, and his wife felt his forehead and he did not feel hot.  Went back to bed, he went to sleep and the next morning 2/13/21, wife got up and when he got up around 7:30 he was dressed, but not buttoned right and had his hat on and was confused.  He sat in front of the fireplace not moving, and starting talking nonsense until 9:00 - 9:30 when he started talking to her.  He could not differentiate between morning and night, and then slowly progressed back to normal.  Did not eat much, and said that he could eat anymore.  He was pacing back and forth and then finally cleared mentally and was ok around 10:00 AM.   He is now back to his normal self today 2/16/21.   She gave him 250 mg of Tylenol around 9:30 AM on 2/13/21 as his temp was 100.1.  HIs blood pressure at that time was 103/59 and pulse 100.   She then checked it in the other arm and it was 104/60, pulse 99.  She then checked it again on Monday and it was 108/61 with 68 pulse rate which is normal for him.

He was discharged from hospital on 1/26/21 with admitting diagnosis of COVID pneumonia. He did not have any predisposing factors(PMH, allergies, etc.) for experiencing an adverse drug event. The ADR did not occur at the time of administration of the vaccine nor was there an ADR that occurred between the observation period and the date of death. Patient had made it through the COVID infection period but suffered complications including pneumonitis, lung, heart, and kidney failure requiring high flow oxygen. He required readmission to hospital for the complications in 3/2021 but ultimately passed away on 3/24/21 likely due to the multi organ failure complication of COVID

He has begun to have mild memory changes after suspected COVID illness (covid testing negative) in November, but daughter of patient, with whom he lives, states that his memory and orientation now significantly changed- he seems to have forgotten the last &#34;3 years&#34; of memory.  Presented to ER 1/16/21 as she checked his O2 and found him to be hypoxic in 60s. He is being treated for possible CAP with underlying perviously undiagnosed ILD vs post-covid lung changes (per pulmonology), and his energy and ability to walk have returned but memory is significantly impaired, confabulating and oriented only to self despite good oxygenation on 5L O2 by NC.
