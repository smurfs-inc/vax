No fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation, no visible blood in stool or urine, no abnormal color or volume of urine. No preceding illness of any kind.  He is tested for COVID weekly at college and was always negative including on 1-16-2021   He went to a freestanding ER where CT Abd without contrast showed normal appendix but mesenteric adenitis.  White count was normal but creatinine was 2.8!   He was given 2 L of fluid and recheck showed Cr 2.8 again. Urine dipstick 2&#43; proteinuria and microscopic hematuria.  He works out 6 days/week but nothing unusual in the recent workout history.  CPK was normal.  Serum myoglobin slightly elevated at 94.  He doesn?t take supplements, creatine, drugs, energy drinks, coffee or any medications. He was advised to hydrate copiously which he did.    He was admitted for work up two days later.  Repeat Cr was 3.1. ESR was 45 and CRP 2.26.   RF, ANA, ANCA negative.  Complement levels C3 and C4 normal.  Uric acid and LDH normal.  Amylase and Lipase normal.   UA showed no protein or blood.  IVF given overnight and kidney biopsy planned for the next day depending on that mornings labs.    That morning Cr came down to 2.4.   PTH was 127, Vit D 12.7, Calcium normal.  SPEP normal and UPEP normal.  Urine drug screen normal.    Kidney biopsy cancelled and he was discharged.    Cr two days later (2-10-2021) was 1.68

                                                Active IgA nephropathy; Gross hematuria; This literature-non-study case was reported in a literature article and describes the occurrence of IGA NEPHROPATHY (Active IgA nephropathy) in a 19-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.   LITERATURE REFERENCE: of gross hematuria following Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in patients with IgA nephropathy. Kidney Int. 2021     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Hematuria.   On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced IGA NEPHROPATHY (Active IgA nephropathy) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HAEMATURIA (Gross hematuria). At the time of the report, IGA NEPHROPATHY (Active IgA nephropathy) outcome was unknown and HAEMATURIA (Gross hematuria) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In 2021, Biopsy kidney: abnormal (abnormal) IgA nephropathy. Among 25 glomeruli sampled, 1 was globally sclerotic. there was mild to moderate, diffuse and global, mesangial hyper cellularity. two glomeruli had segmental endocapillary hyper cellularity including infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils. one glomerulus with an incipient segmental scar contained an overlying segmental fibrous crescent. mild tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis involved approximately 10% of the cortex.. In 2021, Blood creatinine: 1.2 (High) 1.2 mg/dl. In 2021, Glomerular filtration rate: abnormal (abnormal) 87 ml/min per 1.73 m2. In 2021, IgA nephropathy: abnormal (abnormal) M1E1S1T0C0. In 2021, Immunology test: positive (Positive) 1 to 2&#43; granular global mesangial staining for IgA, C3, kappa and lambda. In 2021, Urine analysis: abnormal (abnormal) numerous red blood cells and no proteinuria.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered IGA NEPHROPATHY (Active IgA nephropathy) and HAEMATURIA (Gross hematuria) to be possibly related.    No concomitant medications were reported. No treatment information was provided.

                                                My 20-year-old son received his first Moderna shot on March 16, 2021, at his college health clinic with no obvious side effects. He received the second Moderna shot at the same location on April 13, 2021. On the morning of April 14, 2021, he began running a high fever with repetitive vomiting and stomach cramping. He did not immediately seek medical attention because he had been told of side effects of the vaccine. When it was no longer tolerable, he reported to the local ER where it was later discovered he had a 4 mm kidney stone, which he passed two days later. We were told that the kidney stone would likely have begun forming about 31 days earlier, which would approximately coincide with his first COVID injection. There is no family history on either side of any kidney stones in the family. While my son&#39;s lifestyle may introduce some risk factors for kidney stones, I felt it was reasonable to report it as potentially relating to the vaccine.

Was sitting in the observation area, felt like vision was blacking out. Observers report that patient stiffened in chair and eyes rolled back. No one observed tonic-clonic movements of limbs, but patient did have bladder incontinence. He was unresponsive for several minutes, EMS was called and evaluated patient at the scene. He started to feel better fairly quickly after regaining consciousness and refused transport to hospital.

                                                He had the vaccine on 05/12/2021. It started at 1 am, he had a pretty normal night, he went to bed and woke up vomiting, that continued through the night, the vomiting continued, he had a head ache, he called me and told me that his stomach really hurt, I told him to check his blood sugar, he also had  hot flashes, chills, and body aches, but mainly he had vomiting, then the next day 5/14/2021 he was getting more sleepy and less responsive, his friends tried to give him water and different things, his blood sugar went up, his friends took him that afternoon to the ER because he started not responding to me, his friends would tell me he was sleeping, so they took him to the ER, they found that he was very dehydrated, they were giving him fluids and did blood work, he was very unresponsive when he arrived, he could not answer his questions, he had a friend that was there that told them he had the vaccine, the blood work said he had a very high white blood cell count they were worried he had sepsis, they found his kidneys were not working ok, because his levels were very crazy and chest pain and severe stomach pain, and he had pancreatitis, they ruled out a heart attack, he then was admitted because he was in DKA, diabetic keto acidosis, like a result of his type 1 diabetes that got flared up because of all his reactions. They admitted him to the ICU and he was there until 05/16/2021 and basically they were just giving him fluids, potassium and other things to help his body calm down and stabilize his blood sugar. He was released and he still continues that his heart hurts but doctors say that these things resolve after a while.

I then woke up Sunday  with a 103 degree fever that caused me to go the ER where I also received a diagnosis of an acute kidney injury from the vaccine as well and was then admitted for the next two nights. My fever then rose up to 104.7 degrees on Sunday night.  I also experienced intense body aches, especially in my legs and my back, a sore throat, and headaches. Once my fever went down,  I was able to leave the hospital on Tuesday morning.

Pt said he &#34;fainted recently&#34; from a shot where he fainted &#34;for a couple minutes&#34; according to his nurse, and he was sure it was psychologically induced by anxiety. He said he was more mentally prepared this time. After I gave the dose to him and his friend, he got lightheaded and slowly started losing consciousness in his seat after a few minutes.   Pt was alert and responded to our questions. I quickly stepped out to give the pt a bottle of water, and upon coming back to the IMZ room, his friend said he urinated himself. He was less responsive, but still alert. I notified the technician. He started to turn pale and felt more cold. He pulse was weak. I encouraged the pt&#39;s friend to keep him alert while we call EMS. I reminded the pt to keep breathing.   The technician called EMS, and I stayed with the patient to kept him calm, but alert until EMS arrived. Pt slowly felt better after a few minutes (color return, and temperature normalized). Pt said he was okay, and he was able to walk. EMS arrived and tested blood sugar; he was within normal range. Pt did not need EMS service, and went home with friend.

The pharmacist started to walk back to his station when he heard a thud. He turned to look at the patient and they were face down on the ground. The pharmacist put his hand on the patient&#39;s shoulder to check if they were okay. Patient had urinated and left a puddle on the ground. When the patient awoke, they stated that they were okay except for a sore head. The pharmacist checked their head for any scrapes, bruises, or bumps. None were found and the patient was asked to wait in a chair for an extra 25 minutes. Personally monitored for 5 minutes for additional syncope then had their companion stay close to them. After waiting for 30 minutes, the patient said they felt fine and asked to leave.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.
