                                                Patient developed gross hematuria one week after vaccine administration.  This continued until presentation to the office at around 3 weeks after vaccination.  Patient had normal blood pressure, normal vital signs, no swelling or edema.  Exam was unremarkable.  Renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys.  Bloodwork revealed normal kidney function, no anemia, and normal C3/4 with an elevated total complement and elevated speckled ANA, and CRP.  Referred to nephrology for further workup.  Appears to be glomerulonephritis at this time.

I then woke up Sunday  with a 103 degree fever that caused me to go the ER where I also received a diagnosis of an acute kidney injury from the vaccine as well and was then admitted for the next two nights. My fever then rose up to 104.7 degrees on Sunday night.  I also experienced intense body aches, especially in my legs and my back, a sore throat, and headaches. Once my fever went down,  I was able to leave the hospital on Tuesday morning.

                                                Pt Fainted shortly after receiving vaccination. Pt came for a moderna covid vaccine with his friend, both first doses. Pt said he &#34;fainted recently&#34; from a shot where he fainted &#34;for a couple minutes&#34; according to his nurse, and he was sure it was psychologically induced by anxiety. He said he was more mentally prepared this time. After I gave the dose to him and his friend, he got lightheaded and slowly started losing consciousness in his seat after a few minutes.   Pt was alert and responded to our questions. I quickly stepped out to give the pt a bottle of water, and upon coming back to the IMZ room, his friend said he urinated himself. He was less responsive, but still alert. I notified the technician. He started to turn pale and felt more cold. He pulse was weak. I encouraged the pt&#39;s friend to keep him alert while we call EMS. I reminded the pt to keep breathing.   The technician called EMS, and I stayed with the patient to kept him calm, but alert until EMS arrived. Pt slowly felt better after a few minutes (color return, and temperature normalized). Pt said he was okay, and he was able to walk. EMS arrived and tested blood sugar; he was within normal range. Pt did not need EMS service, and went home with friend.

The pharmacist started to walk back to his station when he heard a thud. He turned to look at the patient and they were face down on the ground. The pharmacist put his hand on the patient&#39;s shoulder to check if they were okay. Patient had urinated and left a puddle on the ground. When the patient awoke, they stated that they were okay except for a sore head. The pharmacist checked their head for any scrapes, bruises, or bumps. None were found and the patient was asked to wait in a chair for an extra 25 minutes. Personally monitored for 5 minutes for additional syncope then had their companion stay close to them. After waiting for 30 minutes, the patient said they felt fine and asked to leave.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.
