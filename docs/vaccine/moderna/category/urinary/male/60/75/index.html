                                                In summary this is a 60 year old male who was normal functioning presenting to hospital 4 days following second moderna COVID-19 vaccination with AKI, Rhabdomyolsis, Confusion/Delirium with agitation, multiple acute brain infarcts, DVT, and multilobar pulmonary embolism.  24 hours following vaccination patient began to become slightly confused while driving his wife to her vaccine appointment.  Symptoms progressed and included severe fatigue and muscle aches.  Patient was taking tizanidine and oxycodone to manage muscle / body aches which had been prescribed for his chronic back pain issues.  Patient was noted to be excessively sleeping, and also had fallen twice between vaccination and hospital presentation. 4 days following vaccination he presented to the emergency department with severe lethargy and confusion.  He was admitted with presumption of overdose of medication, given activated charcoal.  A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218. PT was 10.6, INR 0.99.  ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.22, co2 45, HCO3 18.4.  Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and a few weeks later he noticed jaundice and hematuria. He was admitted to the Hospital, and was noted to have dramatically elevated eosinophils (26.29 k/uL), elevated creatinine (2.36 mg/dL) and elevated LFTs (AST/AST/Alk Phos/Tbili all up, mostly direct). His eosinophils improved with pulse dose steroids and the diagnostic work up continues. There is diagnostic uncertainty about what caused this dramatic increase in eosinophilia, but it appears temporally related to getting the vaccination. Our working diagnosis is autoimmune vasculitis, but he is also being treated for possible parasitic infection, and will require very close follow-up. 61M with PMHx HTN p/w generalized fatigue, L flank pain, and decreased UOP.   He was in his usual state of health until 5 days prior to admission with onset of general fatigue/sluggishness. This was followed by a few days of dull abdominal pain, watery bowel movements, and increased frequency which spontaneously resolved, though the fatigue persisted. Yesterday evening, he noticed new L flank pain, red urine, and decreased UOP associated with mild dysuria (he describes it as needle-like pain in his urethra) which prompted him to call EMS. Denies fevers/chills/night sweats, myalgias, respiratory symptoms, melena/hematochezia. He&#39;s never had pyelonephritis or kidney stones before, no recent urinary instrumentation, antibiotic use, or hospital stays.    He recently received the first COVID vaccine and is due for the second COVID shot on Monday. He lives with his sister and works as a mechanic. He is not on any other medications or supplements. Not currently sexually active.

Notably has been afebrile and fairly well appearing. Symptoms were preceded by several days of watery diarrhea, cough with sputum production and subjective weight loss. Recently received moderna vaccine, and he was concerned it causes his symptoms.  Underwent extensive workup as below with involvement of multiple services including Renal, Pulm, Rheum, Allergy, ENT, and Cardiology. Had one nasal lesion biopsied by ENT, which was non-diagnostic. Renal bx prelim without clear e/o vaculitis, although obtained after steroids. Negative testing for primary hypereosinophilic syndrome. Extensive w/u notable for ANCA positive at 1:80 with  MPO only slightly elevated (20, uln 19) and PR3 wnl.  cMRI with eosinophilic cardiomyopathy, for which cards was consulted as below. Additionally, toxacara ab positive and schistosoma ab indeterminate, although per ID both schistosomiasis and toxacara infection unlikely. Per rheum, overall felt presentation 2/2 hypereosinophilic syndrome, potentially the eosinophilic stage of EGPA (given low &#43; ANCA, low &#43; MPO) vs.  End organ effects of idiopathic eosinophilia. Briefly received CTX 2g IV qd (4/10 - 4/12) until diagnostics returned. Treated with solumedrol 1g qd x3d (4/11-4/13) transitioned to prednisone 60 mg qd (4/14-) to be continued until rheum f/u, with rapid decline in eosinophilia. Received pre-treatment with PO ivermectin 20 mg before steroids. Treated with flonase nasal spray, symbicort and albuterol for respiratory symptoms. Deferred cyclophosphamide, with consideration of IL-5 or IL-5R targeted biologics as an outpatient. Treated with atovaquone for PCP ppx. Per ID, treated with praziquantel (for schistosomiasis) and albendazole (for toxacara) out of an abundance of caution, although low c/f visceral larva migrans given lack of compatible imaging findings and no known exposure to dogs and cats or schistosomiasis given remove travel history.  Data - CT A/P (4/10): Mild L hydroureteronephrosis with b/l periureteral and perinephric stranding and b/l urothelial thickening. Pericystic stranding. - 4/11 CT Chest with parasinus mucosal thickening and sclerotic 1 cm lesion likely benign lesion or bone island - 4/11 CT Face with parasinus mucosal thickening and small fluid levels and sclerotic ovoid 1 cm lesion in neck of right mandible potentially representing benign fibro osseous lesion or bone island - PFT with severe obstruction and elevated FeNO c/w eosinophilic infiltration - Heme review of smear with normal Eos - Echo TTE with LVH nl EF 52% - Vitamin B12 &gt;2000 - Urine Eos undetectable after steroids - SPEP with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia  - Sinus Bx equivocal - ANA, ANCA (1:80; MPO 20, PR3 3), ESR (128), CRP (66), RF (&lt;13), C3 (82, slightly low), C4 (10) - IgE 355 - Aspergillus IgG and IgE &lt;19 - HIV non-reactive - RHP with CHIP mutation which will need f/u - FIP1L1 negative - Schistosoma ab equivocal - Strongy ab negative - Toxacara ab positive - Leptospira ab negative - Tryptase wnl - RHP notable for CHIP mutation as below - BCR-ABL negative - FIP1L1-PDGFRA negative - peripheral blood flow cytometry unremarkable   #AKI on CKD #Nephritic syndrome #Urinary retention/hydronephrosis Cr 2.34 on admission.  Baseline Cr unknown but Cr was 1.5 (OSH BI) and urine alb:Cr was elevated to 36 in 6/2018, at which time CKD was thought to be 2/2 untreated HTN. Now presented with persistent hematuria, HTN and proteinuria with UCx without e/o infection, all favoring nephritic process. Renal and urology consulted MALB/CCR 994.5. CT scan with hydronephrosis, felt to be eosinophilic pyelonephritis. Pt underwent uncomplicated renal bx 4/14 (after steroids) which showed preliminary very mild focus of interstitial nephritis with scattered eosinophils and immunofluorescence evidence suggestive of a mild immune complex-mediated disease without current activity. EM pending. He was treated with sodium bicarb 1300 mg bid. Hematuria improved but did not resolved by time of discharge. Cr on discharge 1.6, close to baseline of 1.5 in 2018.    #Sclera Icterus #CBD Dilation on CT #Elevated LFT Sclera icteric and CBD dilation on RUQUS to 1.8cm with gallbladder sludge and small gallstones. MRCP with diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation to the level of ampulla, with associated ductal and gallbladder wall edema, complex material in the gallbladder lumen and CBD, and confluent periportal lymphadenopathy. No obstructing stone or discrete mass. Findings likely represent cholangitis such as eosinophilic cholangitis in light of severe eosinophilia.. No documented LFTs here, but OSH (BI) records indicate normal LFTs and viral hepatitis studies in 6/2018. Repeat Hep B non-reactive non immune, HCV non immune, HAV non-reactive.  BIli remained stable and ALT and AST continued to rise after initiation of steroids. GI was consulted. RUQUS 4/15 with dopplers with persistently dilated CBD to 1.4 cm with sludge in CBD but with patent portal vein and hepatic veins. Anti smooth muscle ab positive on day of discharge; antimitochondrial ab pending. LFT uptrending at time of discharge, although patient declined to stay inpatient for further workup. LFT at discharge ALT 194, AST 114, ALP 262, TBili 6.3, DBili 5.3. ERCP to be considered as an outpatient.     #HTN SBP on admission 160-180. History of HTN, not on any home anti-hypertensives. Per BI records, he was prescribed amlodipine 10/valsartan 160 in 6/2019, but pt reports self-discontinuation after ~2 doses. BP remains poorly controlled. Likely related to potential nephritic syndrome or renal infiltration by eosinophils, likely with contribution of high dose steroids. While inpatient, treated with hydralazine, labetalol, carvedilol, and amlodipine. BP regimen on discharge amlodipine 10 mg qd, carvedilol 25 mg qd. Avoiding ARBs and ACEI per Renal, although will likely need to add once AKI resolved.    #Microcytic Anemia Patient with drop in Hct from 14.1 on admission to 11.4 4/14. Continues with hematuria, but denies current hematochezia. Suspect combination of blood loss and hypopoliferation given RPI 0.29, likely anemia of inflammation/acute illness given ferritin 1.010. Vitamin B12 &gt;2000, Folate 11. Iron 151, unable to calculate TIBC. Noted to have persistently low MCV in low 70. Hemoglobin electrophoresis ordered.    #Vitamin D deficiency #HyperPTH 25-OH Vitamin D 6. No e/o hypocalcemia. Phos slightly elevated on admission, but subsequently downtrending, likely iso renal dysfunction. Treated with ergocalciferol 50,000 U weekly x12 weeks   #Right mandible lesion Sclerotic changes of the right mandible near the condyle noted on CT scan. Surgeon recommends outpatient follow-up, although patient declined.    #Hematochezia #Hemorrhoids Patient with new bloody diarrhea 4/11. Some e/o hemorrhoids on exam. CBC stable. Treated with tucks pads, dibucaine ointment and hydrocortisone cream.   #Little Medical Follow-up Pt reports that he has not seen a doctor in ~3 years.Cholesterol 124l LDL 73, HDL 10. HgbA1c 5.2. Will join Dr&#39;s panel on discharge   #CHIP mutation  RHP with DNMT3A mutation at low VAF. Will follow in cancer precursor clinic

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Herpes virus infection (Improved after Shingles Vaccine.) on 24-Jun-2008. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: SHINGRIX (First dose- Oct-2019 and Second dose-Feb-2020) from October 2019 to February 2021. Concurrent medical conditions included HIV infection since 18-Feb-1998, Renal agenesis (born without left kidney), Drug allergy (Fluroquine allergy), Contrast media allergy, Asthma since 24-Jun-2008, Mitral valve disease since 12-Apr-2010 and Diarrhea (Improved with daily Morphine ER) since 10-Jan-1996. Concomitant products included AMLODIPINE for Blood pressure management, RITONAVIR, ABACAVIR, DOLUTEGRAVIR SODIUM (TIVICAY), DARUNAVIR ETHANOLATE (PREZISTA) and ABACAVIR SULFATE (ZIAGEN) for HIV infection, ACYCLOVIR [ACICLOVIR], MORPHINE, PRAVASTATIN and FINASTERIDE for an unknown indication.    On 12-Mar-2021 at 10:30 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced BACK PAIN (very bad lower back pain both sides within a few hours of the injection). On 12-Mar-2021 at 1:30 PM, the patient experienced URINARY RETENTION (kidney unable to urinate/Within 3 hours of the vaccine could not urinate/very little if any urine would pass) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On 22-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DRUG INEFFECTIVE (did not have any antibodies after the first vaccine of Moderna). On an unknown date, the patient experienced DYSURIA (urination trouble after the shot, he couldn&#39;t urinate anything,could&#39;nt get out anything out of his body), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (sore arm), SOMNOLENCE (slept a lot after the shot) and FATIGUE (very tired/very fatigue). The patient was hospitalized on 15-Mar-2021 due to URINARY RETENTION. On 13-Mar-2021, URINARY RETENTION (kidney unable to urinate/Within 3 hours of the vaccine could not urinate/very little if any urine would pass) had resolved with sequelae. On 22-Mar-2021, DRUG INEFFECTIVE (did not have any antibodies after the first vaccine of Moderna) outcome was unknown. At the time of the report, DYSURIA (urination trouble after the shot, he couldn&#39;t urinate anything,could&#39;nt get out anything out of his body), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (sore arm), SOMNOLENCE (slept a lot after the shot) and FATIGUE (very tired/very fatigue) outcome was unknown and BACK PAIN (very bad lower back pain both sides within a few hours of the injection) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Blood creatine: (High) Elevated creatine numbers.. On 22-Mar-2021, Antibody test: (Inconclusive) No antibodies were developed 10 days after 1st dose of vaccination.. On 22-Mar-2021, Blood creatine:.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosing remained unchanged.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient reported that he was born with only one kidney(Right).  The patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 study for the last several months.   Sequelae for the event of urinary retention included elevated creatine. No treatment was reported for the events.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 11-May-2021: Event urinary retention was upgraded to serious. Seriousness criteria hospitalization was included for urinary retention. Lab data for antibody test and creatine test were added. Allergy (Fluroquine,contrast dye), historical vaccine(Shingles Vaccine), historical condition(Herpes Virus Infection) were updated in other relevant history. Current condition asthma, mitral valve disease and diarrhea were also added. On 12-May-2021: Additional information provided on 12-May-2021 included an additional event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Initial presenting symptoms upon awakening four days after his shot were muscle spasms, &#34;felt things in his chest,&#34; and dark urine. Within 48 he was confused and was unable to state his last name, which progressed to unresponsiveness by ~7 days after the vaccine. He has since become comatose and his brain MRI is notable for hyperintensity involving the deep gray nuclei as well as the periventricular and subcortical white matter diffusely, bilaterally. The etiology of his comatose state is still under investigation, but a detailed infectious, autoimmune, and malignancy work up at 2 different medical centers and have since been unrevealing as to alternate causes.

After a &#34;few&#34; days of feeling unwell despite treatment, presented to ER and was found to have AKI, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia. Over the course of several days rapidly deteriorated and developed MSOF, including liver failure, DIC, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and shock requiring pressors. Workup for VTE, including V/Q scan, LE dopplers, and head CT negative for thrombosis. Ferritin was found to be highly elevated (12,000) suggestive of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Per ER report, marrow positive for hemophagocytosis on smear. At time of report, transferred to Cancer Center for HLH treatment, currently in ICU, intubated, sedated, and on pressors. PF4 antibody pending.

Three weeks later on May 3, 2021 if felt fatigued by evening time and had chills and sweats all night.  No energy on May 4, 2021 and slept all day with bouts of chills and sweats but never had a temperature over 98F.  Woke up the morning of May 5, 2021 and discovered a large red patch centered over my left hip THR incision scar.  The incision scar was very sore and a dark purple.  I had a dull dehydration type of headache and had to urinate about every 20 minutes on May 4th.  Went to the emergency room and was diagnosed to have cellulitis and given a 7 day dose of antibiotics and 10 day dose of antiviral medication.  The rash never was very itch and started to subside immediately after taking the first dosage of these two medications.   Went to see my primary physician on May 10, 2021 and he believes I had vasculitis and not cellulitis.  No signs of any insect bites or cuts to have started the infection/inflammation. He noticed that blood vessels in and around the red patch which was about the size of a dinner plate were elevated to the surface.  Followed up with Dr on May 25th via telemedicine visit and he ordered another series of blood lab and urine tests on June 10, 2021, to make sure my ESR, CRP, and urinalysis results were continuing to decline.

When I got under covers and warmed up so chills subsided and breathing returned to normal it felt like I was being squashed in a Panini press. Every cell in my body felt like it was vibrating in pain. I had to get up ever hour or so to urinate. I would be back in sever chill mode before i made it to the bathroom and it took about 5 minutes back in bed for chills to stop and breathing back to normal. I was also nauseous the whole time but did not vomit Then. The room temperature was 72F. This continued for 12-14 hrs.  I then tried to drink cranberry juice and eat 3 bites of a banana which  I immediately regurgitated. The rest of the day I was drained of energy. No sleep 48hrs. 3 days

                                                Pre-existing condition of kidney failure; Pre-existing conditions of heart failure; Skin rash; A spontaneous report  was received from a 63-year-old male, consumer who received Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced pre-existing conditions of heart failure / cardiac failure and kidney failure / renal failure.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included preexisting conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. No relevant concomitants were reported.   On unk Feb 2021 (during the first week of February), prior to onset of symptoms, the patient received their first dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 026L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.   On unknown date, the patient experienced a rash, but no other reaction. He reported taking no other medication when he had  received his first dose.   On 17 Feb 2021, the patient was hospitalized for his pre-existing conditions of heart failure and kidney failure. He was discharged on 21 Feb 2021. No treatment information was provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, rash, pre-existing heart failure and kidney failure red, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality the serious events kidney failure and heart failure are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 but possibly related to the consumer&#39;s pre-existing conditions of renal failure and cardiac failure, while the non-serious event of rash may be possibly related to mRNA-1273.

                                                Serious lower left back which I believe was my left kidney. The serious pain problems started the day after receiving the shot and lasted for at least two weeks.    As the kidney pain started, my fingers started to feel numb and they have felt numb ever since.  Left hand is a little worse then my right hand.  Want to get second shot but?? I have walking pneumonia since 1973, since I was 15 years old, and will die if I get Covid 19.  I need help to know what happened to me, and maybe monitor me during second shot.  I am open research person. I am a 64 year old man that has had walking pneumonia since I was 15 years old in 1973.  I know that if I do get Covid-19 I will quickly die.  I need vaccination from Covid-19.    I received my first Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on Thursday March 18th, 2021 after 3 PM and immediately had problems.  I had problems in my left lower back which I believe was my left kidney. The serious pain problems started the day after receiving my first Covid 19 Moderna shot and the pain lasted for at least two weeks.  Immediately as the kidney pain started, my fingers started to feel numb and they have felt this way ever since.    This lead me to the situation of &#34;I am damned if I do and damned if I do not&#34;.  I want to get the second Covid-19 vaccine shot because I am truly scared to die if I do get Covid 19.  But if I do get the second shot, what will happen to me?  I am scared that it may have the kidney pain again, may worsen my numb fingers problem, and/or do other damage to my body.  It may already have caused other problems?      In summation, whether I get the second Covid-19 vaccination shot or not:  Get the second shot: 1. Everything could be OK?   2. I could have Kidney pain again, possibly doing damage or more damage to my body, even my numb fingers could get worse!  Not get the second shot: 1. Be lucky and not get Covid-19. 2. Get Covid-19 and die.  I want very much to get the second Covid-19 shot, but I am scared and I find nobody cares about what had and has happened to me regarding my kidney pain and my fingers becoming numb, and any future consequences to me if I get the second shot.  I do not know what to do.  My current and main concern to me, for now, that if I do get the second Covid-19 shot I will get that kidney pain and may do worse damage to my fingers feeling numb or possibly other damage to my body.  I am not sure what happened, as a non medical person I can only guess things like maybe I have blood clots that reduce the circulation in my hands.  I just recently got on government assistance only because of this Covid-19 problem and I had a very hard time trying to find a job, I had no choice.  I have not been on government assistance long enough to get financially stable to afford medical insurance, but I plan to do so as soon as I can.    I tried to tell my doctor, but she kept telling me to go to the emergency room.  So, I finally went to the Hospital on Friday April 16th.  They checked my bloodwork and told me I was OK and OK to get the second shot, but I had really no explanation as to what had happened to me, my kidney, or my still numb fingers, or most of all, what might happen if I get my second shot.  I am hoping to get help, for someone to care about me, my health, and my future health.  The numbness in my left hand has been a little stronger than my right hand.  I had the shot in the left arm and my left kidney had the pain, if any of these matter. The left kidney problem was very painful within 2 days.  I could not do anything due to the pain.  I could forget about dealing with my feet in any way, such as to tie or untie shoes, put on or remove socks, getting out of bed, and just about anything I did, any movement at all was very painful.    What has me very worried is the continuous numbness of my fingers.  I want to get back to work and my profession involves computers and keyboards, and my numbness in my fingers bothers me, even having problem feeling the raised bump on the f&#39; and j&#39; keys.  The most immediate problem is trying to untie shoestrings, which I cannot feel to do due to my fingers feeling numb.  This problem with my fingers affect my life in many ways continuously everyday.  I cannot feel zip lock bag openings.  I have had a left kidney problem once before over 2 years ago, which I believe was a result of doing Benicar for my blood pressure. I have only had that problem that once and I got off Benicar and have never had the problem since, not until a day after I had my first Moderna Covid 19 vaccine shot March 18th.    For both of these times, the left kidney pain I immediately stopped all of my medicines and after a few weeks the pain went away.  This time was muc worse than the first time. I have high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol and take medicines for these.  I resumed these medicines after the pains went away.    As to the fingers feeling numb, I have never had this problem in my life.  My left hand fingers are a little worse than my right hand fingers.  They feel as if they are very cold for frozen, or I have burnt my fingers.  I have never felt this feeling ever in my life.  At the beginning of, January 1st to be exact, when I was 15 years old and in the 10th grade, I came down with pneumonia and was very sick.  It was not until the middle of March when my mother took me to the emergency late at night when she got a doctor to see me on the side.  The doctor gave me prescriptions of antibiotics, cough syrup, and Guaifenesin (which was a prescription in 1973 and is the main ingredient in Mucinex).   For the next 2 weeks I came home from school and laid down on the sofa and filled up about a third to a quarter of a medium size mixing bowl with phlegm from my lungs.  After that doctors have told me I ruined my lungs and I will have walking pneumonia for the rest of my life.  I have lived with this problem and have had to pay special attention to my lungs my whole life.    When I saw on TV a report on the second e-cigarette and what if did to the lungs, I said that looks like what happened to my lungs when I was 15 years old.  I recently saw news that someone had a similar problem.  However, because of my walking pneumonia I need to get the second shot or vaccinated in whatever way, I want to live.  Please help!

Began to have a fever which over the 24 hour period went from my normal of 97.6 to 101.2 at 10:30pm the second night. Throughout the period I had a mild headache and significant fatigue. I woke up this morning at 12:30am with the sheets, pillow and pajamas very wet (from sweat). I checked my temperature and for the first time in 24 hours, it had dropped (to 99.2). When I got up at 6 this morning, my temperature was 98.6 (still a little elevated for me). My wife experienced practically the same thing 4 days earlier without the urinary symptoms and temp not quite a elevated. We had the vaccine at the same time(s). I&#39;m still fairly fatigued at this time (and my wife a little).

Per clinic notes: &#34;Brief summary covid vaccine 1/21 with side effect within 12 hr lasting 3 d By around 1/26-1/29 had cp w/ exertion and sob TST 2/2 w/  Minor ekg changes and min workload per pt (mod workload per note) nuc study pending.  Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

I was admitted to the hospital with a fever and low blood pressure. Urine culture showed presence of E. coli. This was treated with IV fluids  and antibiotics, followed by oral antibiotics. I am still taking Cefuroxime daily to prevent recurrence of the UTI. I had another UTI on March 18, 2021 - this was between my first and second Covid-19 vaccines. The first UTI happened one day after a cystoscopy. There is no evidence that either UTI was related to the Covid-19 vaccination.

                                                31 hours after the shot all of a sudden I started to get very jittery and started having chills. I ate a banana and a glass of milk. The jittery feeling subsided in about an hour. The chills remained and I got flushed and felt like i had a temperature. My joints in my hands felt very sore and during the night my body muscles felt wore out. My left shoulder at the site of the shot was throbbing  bad. For some reason I had to urinate every hour for the next five hours of the night without ingesting any more fluids. By 7:00 AM I got to feeling progressively better and by 9:30 AM I felt like I had just had a very poor nights sleep. No more chills, fever, being flushed and the pain in my arm subsided substantially.

                                                Patient became very weak and sleepy about a week after the vaccine.  By the following saturday, he couldn&#39;t even stay awake enough to eat.  His blood pessure was very low and he had a fever , so I called paremedics, and they took him to the hosp.  After many tests, they found blood in the urine, and his blood platelets had dropped to 121.( Now he had blood work done in June of 2020 and his platelets were 225.)  After a few days, his platelets began to creep back up, and are now around 165, back to normal range. He is currently at a rehad facility for physical therapy to regain strength.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (10 day hospitalization and administration of oxygen therapy) on 01-Nov-2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension and Diabetes mellitus.    On 02-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ASTHENIA (weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). In March 2021, the patient experienced BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to AGEUSIA, CONSTIPATION, DYSSTASIA, GAIT DISTURBANCE and POLLAKIURIA, and then from 03-Mar-2021 to 06-Mar-2021 due to ASTHENIA. On 06-Mar-2021, GAIT DISTURBANCE (inability to walk/inability to reach bathroom) and CONSTIPATION (inability to produce a bowel movement) had resolved. On 24-Mar-2021, ASTHENIA (weakness), DYSSTASIA (inability to rise) and AGEUSIA (lack of taste for food/loss of sense of taste) had resolved. At the time of the report, POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), BLOOD GLUCOSE INCREASED (blood sugar higher than normal) and HYPERTENSION (blood pressure higher than normal) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications were not provided by the reporter.

On 03-Mar-2021 at 10:30 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced RENAL IMPAIRMENT (Kidney&#39;s almost shut down both times) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and intervention required), MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (had 2-3 attacks) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and intervention required), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (didn&#39;t take the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine) and ILLNESS (Sick as a dog). On 06-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ILLNESS (sick as a dog) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and intervention required), DYSPNOEA (Could not breath/Very difficult to breathe) and FEEDING DISORDER (Could not eat anything). 06-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CHEST PAIN (Terrible chest pain). On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (Foul smelling diarrhea). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ABDOMINAL PAIN UPPER (Unexplainable pain in lower stomach area), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (Health declined quickly), CARDIAC DISORDER (Heart issue after first shot of vaccine), LUNG DISORDER (Lungs have gotten worse since the first shot), CHEST DISCOMFORT (grabbing and pulling at his chest) and INSOMNIA (Unable to sleep). The patient was treated with TIOTROPIUM BROMIDE (oral) on 05-Mar-2021 at an unspecified dose and frequency; SIMETHICONE ongoing since an unknown date at an unspecified dose and frequency; PREDNISONE at a dose of 10 mg and OXYGEN at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, RENAL IMPAIRMENT (Kidney&#39;s almost shut down both times) had not resolved and MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (had 2-3 attacks), ILLNESS (sick as a dog), DYSPNOEA (Could not breath/Very difficult to breathe), FEEDING DISORDER (Could not eat anything), DIARRHOEA (Foul smelling diarrhea), ABDOMINAL PAIN UPPER (Unexplainable pain in lower stomach area), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (Health declined quickly), CARDIAC DISORDER (Heart issue after first shot of vaccine), LUNG DISORDER (Lungs have gotten worse since the first shot), CHEST PAIN (Terrible chest pain), CHEST DISCOMFORT (grabbing and pulling at his chest), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (didn&#39;t take the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine), ILLNESS (Sick as a dog) and INSOMNIA (Unable to sleep) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Electrocardiogram: normal other. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 test negative: negative negative. On an unknown date, Troponin: high (High) high.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Patient is on nebulizer treatment of tiotropium bromide and a lot of simethicone. Patient do not know if using either medication helped or not but that was my immidiate reaction. Now patient is on prednisone and feels like he&#39;s taking it just to breathe. Patient has had to go on 24 hr. oxygen since the first shot.   Patient was negative for Covid-19 over the past 3 months at three different times. He continued to have terrible chest pain where he was grabbing and pulling at his chest, pain creeping up to his chest, could not breath or eat anything for 1 week after his first shot.  Patient was in the ER on 10Mar2021. Caller stated he has chronic pancreatitis and breathing issues for which he was prescribed steroids, his doctor told him to decrease the prednisone to 10mg for 2 days prior and day of vaccination. Caller thinks he had a week long stroke since he had high Troponin level which resulted in visit to the hospital where the doctors thought he had septicemia. Caller stated he has not been able to sleep because he keeps having attacks of chest pains that last approximately 15 minutes in the middle of the sleep which occurs 4&#43; times per night.   Kidney&#39;s have gotten worse since 1st shot vaccine. Doctors said &#34;the kidney&#39;s took a shot&#34; after the first shot of vaccine. Patient was admitted to the Hosp twice after the first shot because his kidneys almost shut down both times. Unexplainable, excruciating pain in chest and very difficult to breathe for approx. 10-15 minutes each attack.  New, unexplainable pain in lower stomach area since 1st shot of vaccine. Doctors cannot explain.  Patient is seeking legal action against Moderna.

                                                Outcome: Patient Death CHIEF COMPLAINT in ER: chest pain, SOB  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 66 yo with PMH of chronic afib on chronic anticoagulation who presented to the ER with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and increased fatigue over the past several weeks that has progressively become worse. Patient denies orthopnea or PND but does have some palpitations and occasional chest pain associated with increased fatigue with exertion. On evaluation emergency room patient was noted to be tachycardic consistent with chronic atrial fib, also acute renal insufficiency likely secondary to dehydration. Patient is admitted to the medical service for further treatment and evaluation. DEATH SUMMARY Date of Admission: 04/07/2021 Time of Death: 04/10/2021 at 0737 Final Diagnoses: 1. Sudden Cardiac Death 2. Acute Renal Impairment Secondary to Hypovolemia, A TN 3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation w/ RVR, Resolved 4. Atypical Chest Pain, Resolved 5. Hypokalemia, Resolved 6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea 7. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Hospital Course: Patient is a pleasant 66yo admitted for acute renal impairment secondary to significant o hypovolemia resulting in ATN as well as atrial fibrillation w/ RVR after presenting to ER with complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, malaise, and anorexia that began after receiving his second COVID vaccine on 4/01/2021. Please see H&amp;P for full details. Patient reported that on the day after his COVID #2 vaccine, he lost his appetite and was not able to eat or drink. He continued to take his home medications as prescribed including losartan, chlorthalidone, and meloxicam. After experiencing progressive worsening of symptoms for 5 days, patient presented to ER for further evaluation. Upon arrival to ER, patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. EKG showed atrial fibrillation w/ RVR. Routine labs were obtained and were remarkable for elevated creatinine and mild hypokalemia w/ normal BNP and negative cardiac enzymes. CXR showed enlarged cardiac silhouette, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or other acute abnormalities. Patient was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and medical management. He was staited on aggressive IV hydration for his hypotension and hypovolemia w/ PRN IV metoprolol as needed for HR&gt; l lObpm. He was continued on anticoagulation. Serial cardiac enzymes were obtained and were negative. TIE report from Dr&#39;s office that was performed recently was obtained and showed EF of 55-60% with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient&#39;s wife brought his CPAP from home and patient wore his CPAP while sleeping during his hospital stay. During the course of hospitalization, patient&#39;s blood pressure &amp; HR improved, though he remained in atrial fibrillation. His creatinine continued to trend up consistent with ATN, but patient continued to produce adequate urine and he had no signficant electrolyte derangements. IVF were adjusted based on urine output and volume status. Patient had no recurrence in his presenting complaint of chest pain and he overall reported feeling better throughout his course of hospitalization despite reporting that he continued to have little appetite. Patient was monitored closely on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. On the morning of 4/10/2021, lab tech and nurse walked into the patient&#39;s room to obtain specimen for AM labs. Patient reportedly tried to get out of the bed independently, grabbed at his chest &amp; pulled off his telemetry, and fell to his knees. Staff called Code 99 and patient was placed back in the bed. He was noted to be in asystole. ACLS was performed and despite maximal efforts, patient subsequently expired at 0737. I personally called the patient&#39;s cardiologist &amp; personal friend, to discuss the events leading up to the patient&#39;s death. Upon review of the patient&#39;s course of hospitalization, it was felt that patient most likely experienced sudden cardiac death. Of note, Dr reports that the patient frequently contacts him via text message with concerns or complaints. He states that the patient did not message him during the hospitalization to report any chest pain or other concerns. Disposition: Patient Expired

I got up to help, cleaning up blood and checking injury.  After a while I got dizzy and fainted, got up too soon and fainted again.  I fainted a third time, had convulsions and lost bladder control.    Visited my PCP a week later.  Now have a neurologist appt scheduled, a month out.  Currently, I have no apparent issues.

Chronological narrative: The morning after the 2nd vaccine I woke up with the typical general muscle aches and a very sore arm, what I considered to be the normal side effects; A slight feaver and chills. Later in the day there was only the muscle ache and low energy. At about 7PM I took two Tylenol tablets, 500 mg each. I soon felt better. At about 9PM I very suddenly felt extremely cold, as if I had been thrown outside naked in below zero weather.   I began shaking very violently, more like muscle spasms than shivering.  I felt an extremely urgent need to pee, but could not.  Then I very strongly felt impending doom.  It was not a feeling like

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 in December 2020. Concomitant products included FLUOXETINE HYDROCHLORIDE (PROZAC) for an unknown indication.   On 19-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced URINARY RETENTION (he couldn&#39;t pee) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DECREASED APPETITE (low appetite), PRESYNCOPE (he thought he may pass out), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (severe headache every time he got up), NAUSEA (feel sick to his stomach but never vomited), PYREXIA (low grade fever) and FATIGUE (tired). On 23-Apr-2021, DECREASED APPETITE (low appetite) had resolved. On 25-Apr-2021, URINARY RETENTION (he couldn&#39;t pee), PRESYNCOPE (he thought he may pass out), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (severe headache every time he got up), NAUSEA (feel sick to his stomach but never vomited), PYREXIA (low grade fever) and FATIGUE (tired) had resolved.            The reporter stated, the patient had similar side effect from what he had from the 1st dose.  Additional concomitant medications included Blood pressure pills, Cholesterol pills and maybe back pain pill. Treatment medication included Tylenol.  Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, headache, pyrexia, fatigue and nausea are consistent with the product safety profile.      Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 26-Apr-2021: An additional document received on 26 Apr 2021 has information Upgraded case to serious, updated suspect product details, concomitant medication, treatment medication and event details.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, headache, pyrexia, fatigue and nausea are consistent with the product safety profile.

A family member told me I was &#34;out&#34; for 1 or 2 minutes, got very stiff,  breathed very heavy then seemed as though I stopped breathing, involuntarily urinated.  When I came to, my speech was slurred for a few minutes and my blood pressure was very low.  The EMT&#39;s arrived, took my blood pressure, reported it was 85 / 58.  After a few minutes, drinking some fluids, I began to feel more normal.  I declined to go with the EMT&#39;s.  That afternoon, I was extremely tired and slept most of the afternoon.

                                                The morning after his first COVID19 vaccine, per wife, patient started with confusion, feeling of impeding doom, and disorientation. Wife had left him in the morning to go shopping and when she returned he had urinated on himself and was wandering around. He was taken to the ER that afternoon. Upon arrival to the ER, patient was noted to have mild confusion, tachycardia, and a mild fever of 100.8 F. Symptoms improved with Tylenol and IV fluids. His chest x-ray showed bilateral mid and lower lung interstitial airspace opacities, concerning for interstitial pneumonia and/or edema. However, it should be noted that patient was hospitalized due to pneumonia from COVID in November 2020. The ER doctor felt the chest x-ray findings were likely chronic changes from COVID, however, he was started on treatment for possible pneumonia. Patient was stable in the ER, so we was discharged.

                                                Pt has a history of CVA and aspiration pneumonia in Feb 2021. Pt had been on olanzapine since 2/24 at Institute.  He was given his second Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on 03/10/21. Per note on 3/12, pt had seizure like symptoms at 0545 for approx. 45 seconds (eye rolling, lack of response, increased confusion)  Per staff, there was no flexing of limbs or loss of bowel or bladder control.  No noted stroke like symptoms but he appeared more confused at neuro check.  Pt was back to baseline at 15 min neuro check.  Pt reported to have had additional seizure, of approx. 4 minutes duration, during morning report that day-but when MD got to his room, he appeared ?post ictal with a mildly agitated restless delirium? rolling back and forth on the floor, moaning, and not making eye contact.  Pt did lose control of his bladder. Olanzapine was discontinued on 3/12, due to potential to lower the seizure threshold.  Divalproex was initiated for seizures.  Per note 3/22-no additional seizure type symptoms have occurred.

                                                Patient and wife called in to report patient experiencing 7/10 constant stomach pain, uncontrollable shaking, and numbness and tingling bilateral feet. Patient reports receiving his first covid vaccine dose 2-17-21 and experiencing symptoms, today Patient states, &#34;I can&#39;t feel the bottoms of my feet&#34; and &#34;it feels like I&#39;m going to throw up&#34;. Patient denies difficulty breathing. Patient was able to check pulse will on phone with triage nurse with pulse 93 and blood pressure 147/107. Patient requesting to have triage nurse call 911-EMS; HPI  The patient is a 69 year old male who states that he had the 1st dose of COVID vaccine yesterday morning.  The patient states that approximately 24 hours later, he developed stomach cramping.  He has nausea.  He denies any diarrhea.  He has not vomited.  Patient denies any cough or shortness of breath.  He complains of generalized weakness.  The patient also has chronic back pain.  Patient is noted to have a low-grade fever here, however, he does not report any fever. CHIEF COMPLAINT: WEAKNESS (per ems, pt got covid vaccine 24 hours ago, feeling weak and dizzy since 1500, tachycardia); Assessment/Plan DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition: 1. Hepatitis; The patient presents with a low-grade temperature, which isn&#39;t unexpected given that he received his COVID-19 vaccine yesterday.  However, the patient complains of abdominal pain.  Lab work does show elevated bilirubin, alk-phos, AST and ALT.  The patient has no previous history of this.  I did obtain both CT and ultrasound imaging of the gallbladder, which shows no pathology.  Subsequently, the patient was reassessed.  He is ambulated.  He is steady on his feet.  He does not desaturate.  He has no subjective complaints while walking.  I discussed the patient&#39;s lab abnormalities with him.  The patient prefers to go home and follow up for lab retesting on Monday.  Patient was given strict return instructions.  He will return should he develop any new or worsening symptoms.  He is going to have his labs redrawn on Monday and follow shortly with his primary care provider.  Given the normal imaging studies, I do think that these findings are likely related to a reaction to his vaccination.  This was discussed at length with the patient.  Patient is discharged home in stable condition.

Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

Shivering began at 1am and lasted until 6am.  Upon getting up I got real dizzy after urinating, decided to go back to bed, but could not figure out how to get back in, so I stood beside my bed until the dizziness went away.  At some point I must of figured I was ok as the next thing I know I&#39;m on the landing of the steps upstairs, which is 6 steps, and my son is saying to my wife &#34;I&#39;m calling an ambulance&#34;.  Upon arrival at Hospital. I heard them say he&#39;s severely dehydrated and his blood pressure is extremely low.  I also had a fractured right clavicle.  I was kept in the Hospital for 3 days.

Following the injection, and within 24 hours, I began experiencing severe vasovagal, with severe bloating, severe headaches, severe weakness and mental cloudiness.  It is difficult, and at times virtually impossible to urinate and defacate.  Any tissues with columnar linings are severely swollen, from the eustachian tubes to trachea and esophagus, including all intestinal organs.  In fact all organ systems are involved.  It is very painful, and has forced my retirement from practice, as I cannot provide the care that is needed for my patients.  Severe fatigue continues, with severe headaches, cloudiness, inability to concentrate.

                                                Patient became unconscious the evening of 4/14/21.  This event occurred five days after his second Covid vaccination. Patient had just gotten up from a living room chair and was walking over to the stairs to go to the second floor when he became rigid, lost consciousness and fell backward.  911 was called by his girlfriend.  He was unconscious for a couple of minutes.  When EMT&#39;s arrived he was conscious but very groggy.  His blood pressure was 250/157.  He knew his name and year and SSN but did not correctly answer several other questions.  He was taken to ER.  After numerous tests over the course of several days, he was diagnosed as having a stroke.    In the ER, they performed CAT scans, EKG, blood work, urine test and chest xray.  Blood pressure remained high.  Complained of headaches.  Patient was also having trouble voiding urine in the ER so a foley catheter was inserted.  He was admitted to the hospital.  After admission, an MRI, echocardiogram and EEG were performed.  The MRI showed three small blood vessels had burst in his brain.  Echocardiogram showed functions were normal.  The EEG showed some slowing but no signs of seizure.  The conclusion was a stroke.  Physical and occupational therapy examined patient.  No need for further therapy.  Blood pressure remains slightly elevated but he does not appear at this time to have lost any physical or mental functions.  Patient does NOT have a history of high blood pressure or heart issues.  Tests showed his heart was functioning properly.  Per his family doctor, his BP ran approximately 124/64 when tested during the previous 12 months.

                                                Patient presented to the emergency room for evaluation of shortness of breath and chest pain that started two days prior (one day after receiving first Moderna vaccine). Symptoms worse with exertion. Chest pain is described as a heaviness, does not radiate.  EKG in the emergency room that showed ST elevations in III and aVF and his troponin was found to be 40.5 and so code STEMI was activated.  Patient had cardiac cath on an urgent basis and that showed triple-vessel disease, with a very short left main as LAD and left circumflex were almost coming from 2 separate ostia, subtotal occlusion of the LAD and left circumflex and 100% occlusion of the mid RCA.   Evaluated for CABG,  which was declined.  Patient&#39;s echocardiogram showed global hypokinesia with EF of 20 to 25%.  Patient underwent high risk PCI procedure using Impella support with 2 stents to the subtotally occluded LAD and 1 stent to the subtotally occluded left circumflex.  Patient&#39;s symptoms subsided following procedure, however patient suffered mild CHF on initial CXR secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, successfully treated with Lasix as displayed by downtrending BNP. Patient&#39;s labs also displayed shock liver with AST and ALT liver enzymes both above 1000 on arrival; hepatitis and HIV titers came back negative. Patient suffered from AKI on arrival secondary to ischemia, with an elevated BUN and creatinine; CKD suspected due to lab values showing chronic anemia.

                                                71-year-old male with history of lymphoma on chemotherapy and heart transplant in 2011 on immune suppressants presenting with fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath x4 days.  Patient is afebrile upon arrival with otherwise normal vital signs.  He did desaturate to 88% while at rest and was placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  He has clear breath sounds bilaterally without any focal findings.  Work of breathing is not increased and very stable in my opinion.  He appears clinically euvolemic and denies history of heart failure.  No wheezing warranting treatment beta agonist.  Patient will require admission given his acute respiratory insufficiency, will need to discuss appropriate Campus placement with the Heart Transplant Service and anticipate he will require transfer to Grand Rapids.  Given his reported dyspnea, EKG ordered.  Will obtain routine screening labs, COVID-19 swab.  With his reported fever, although not objectively present during this visit, and current immunocompromised state, will treat via the emergency department sepsis protocol and collect blood cultures.  Fri May 21, 2021 1059 EKG with a normal sinus rhythm, rate of 88 beats per minute, no acute ischemic changes are noted.  Patient has a right bundle-branch block.  EKG is unchanged from that of January 21, 2021. BNP is 404, no chest pain to warrant cardiac biomarkers.   [SR] 1113 COVID-19 is detected.   [SR] 1125 CMP was sodium of 128, chloride 95, glucose 303, creatinine 0.87.  Magnesium is 1.9.  Phosphorus 2.1.  Urinalysis with trace blood, no urinary tract infection.  Urinalysis without urinary tract infection.   [SR] 1147 INR subtherapeutic at 1.2.   [SR] 1149 Received a critical result from lab, white blood cell count is 0.04, patient is by definition therefore neutropenic.  Platelets are 21 K without reported active bleeding.  Hemoglobin is 9.3.  Have a call out to Oncology to discuss need for IV cefepime given the reported fevers at home although etiologies presumably viral with COVID-19 test.  Further, I do not know if IV Decadron is appropriate given his profound neutropenia, especially having recently finished a high-dose course of 100 mg prednisone orally x5 days.   [SR] 1150 CXR: Airspace opacities are seen involving both the lungs, more prominent in the right lung, as described above. These are likely due to consolidation/pneumonia. Viral pneumonia can also have similar appearance. Correlate clinically.    [SR] 1218 Discussed case with Dr. from transplant team who agreed with admission to his service .  He did recommend that I broaden his antibiotic regimen to include both IV vancomycin and IV cefepime.  He recommended that I do provided dose of IV Decadron despite the neutropenia to treat his acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.  Still awaiting call back from Oncology.   [SR] 1454 After multiple pages, I have not been connected to Oncology.  Patient was transported by EMS.  He will need a formal oncology consult upon arrival to admitting facility.   [SR]

                                                At first I only had a sore arm. By early Friday evening, the night after the vaccination, I began having severe steady pain in my left kidney, along with sharp shooting pain at the same location.  I also had the expected headache and fatigue. I took Tylenol during this time, and still am. I was pretty much totally bed-ridden for 4 days.  I called my doctor on Wednesday, February 17th to report the severe reaction in my left kidney. The nurse told me that as long as I felt better each day then to weather it out and get  the second shot (scheduled for March 11).  Although I am feeling a little better, I am still taking Tylenol for the pain in my kidney. My exhaustion is lessening.

He couldnt put words together to make a sentence.  He got up to go into the kitchen and then urinated all over himself.  He was worried about falling sleep, scared he would die in his sleep.  The 3rd woke up and was feeling some better but still foggy headed.  Pt went to the ER about 5 days later.  They did a CT and blood work.  He thinks the tests results came back negative. They wanted him to stay longer and maybe see a Neurologist but since there wasnt one available to see at that time the pt decided to go home.  He has blood work and urine labs to be done at the facility on 2/23/2021.  Pt states he is feeling better at this time.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The relevant concomitant medications were also not provided.  On 02 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA (Lot number:013M20A ) through intramuscular route of administration in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 02 Feb 2021, patient experienced little bit of pain in arm of injection.   On 23 Feb 2021, patient experienced pink in urine. The patient subsequently visited the urgent care on 26-Feb-2021 and was diagnosed with  a urinary tract infection. Treatment for urinary tract infection included ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 7days.  No laboratory data was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event little bit of pain in arm of injection was resolved 03 Feb 2021. The event pink in urine was resolved on 01 Mar 2021. The outcome of the event urinary tract infection was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event (vaccination site pain) a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, for the events - chromaturia and UTI, a very limited information has been provided at this time. Further information has been requested.

                                                Intense pain in the left Kidney.  It was equivalent to the pain I suffered when I had a compound fracture of my tibia and fibula.  It was so intense that I thought I had a kidney stone or infection.  We called the ambulance and the EMT, after checking my vital signs, thought it was from the vaccine. I also throw up quite a bit.  It was the first time I threw up since 1985.  The pain was hovering between a eight to 10 for about four hours.  After applying heat to the left Kidney it subsided to a five.  It was not until 4:00 am that I was pain free though still sore in the left kidney. The soreness continues.

                                                My UTI, which was going away, developed into a raging UTI and then later into a bladder infection. I tried taking supplements from my chiropractor but they were not adequate. Even the Pads I wore were insufficient to stem the flow.  There was bleeding as well.  Then went to an Urgent Care facility and they prescribed an antibiotic which worked. It was both painful and embarrassing ( I have to stand and greet people in my position). I suffered for about 6 weeks through this.

                                                I am filing this on behalf of my sister, who feels it needs to be reported but she is too grief-stricken to do this herself.   The morning after the second shot, my sister texted that her husband was up at least 10 times during the night, and five times the next night. He was agitated and hallucinating (swatting at bugs that weren&#39;t there.) For the next four weeks he had progressively more difficult breathing, and on 4/28 a liter of fluid was drained from his chest. He continued to have difficulty breathing and was taken by ambulance to Hospital on May 2 where they again drained his chest and diagnosed him with pneumonia. A nurse told him they were seeing a number of cases of fluid around the lungs (his fluid was around the lungs, not in them) after COVID vaccines. He was sent home May 4 and commented that it was strange his cardiologist hadn&#39;t visited.   Almost immediately he was experiencing liver and gall bladder pain, even though tests for those showed the two organs were healthy. On May 8 my sister said patient woke up hyperventilating, which also became more frequent. On the 9th his daughter told me the labs were not trending well, and on May 10 he saw his cardiologist. He diagnosed him with congestive heart failure and got him an appointment at the Heart Hospital on May 17 - he explained congestive heart failure is scary but can be managed through programs at the heart hospital. He began sleeping outside because it made it easier to breathe.   On May 15 he was advised to go to the ER/Hospital for tests the heart hospital would need and, once there, they discovered his kidneys weren&#39;t functioning and he was admitted immediately. He spent 17 days at Hospital- if the kidneys improved, the heart got worse. If the heart improved, the kidneys failed. He was released on June 2.   On June 7  my brother took him to get blood work done - Patient was too weak to get in and out of the car by himself. The blood work came back bad, and on June 8 he was admitted to the Heart Hospital. On June 10 he was transferred to the Regional Community Hospital to be closer to his cardiologist. From there he continued to decline, and the doctors wanted to do surgery for a LVAD but couldn&#39;t. To help him get stronger, he had an impeller put in by catheter on June 19 and died that night.   His own cardiologist said congestive heart failure is manageable. The symptoms started the night of the second vaccine and his illness wasn&#39;t gradual - he went off a cliff. With all the heart problems appearing in males, we don&#39;t think this was coincidence.

Over next 6 hours became exceedingly painful as to prevent sleep or finding a comfortable position to rest my head. Went to Hospital ER at 2am on 12/31/2020. Had normal CT brain scan and labs. Given IV reglan, then ativan(1 mg) then 25mg benadryl and a liter of fluids. BP was slightly elevated 150/90 (?). Had oral temp of 99.1. When ativan didnt help they gave me a dose of dilaudid and zophran and additional dose of ativan. Then sent me home with instructions to take valium 5mg tid, orphenadrine 100mg Bid, Tylenol 650mg to 1300 mg q8hr prn and lidocaine patch on neck 5%(also started in ER) q 24hrs. Discharge diagnosis was headache, intractable neck pain and torticollis.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

Slept for about and hour. Awoke and felt I had to go to the bathroom - I could not feel or move my legs. Finally used my arms to swing legs over edge of sofa but could not feel or use them. I used the my arms to lift myself to standing position and lost control of bladder - not and accident - felt it totally empty at once. Feeling started to return to legs and I was able to walk to clean myself up. Slowly began to regain use of legs and to stop shuffling and dragging my feet. I was doing better by 6:00p.m. and the leg problem was almost gone the next day. No repeat of the bladder issue.

                                                Patient received first COVID vaccine on 2/6/2021 and second vaccine on 3/6/2021. Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

Past adverse reactions to the above products included No adverse event with influenza and pneumococcal. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension, Gout, Hyperlipidemia and Cardiomyopathy.    On 19-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Jan-2021, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (ACUTE EPISTAXIS) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and PURPURA (DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS PURPURA) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 20-Jan-2021, the patient experienced IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Severe refractory immune thrombocytopenia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 31-Jan-2021, the patient experienced MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (extremity weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ENCEPHALOPATHY (encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), FACIAL PARESIS (facial muscle weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), BACK PAIN (back pain causing inability to ambulate) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSARTHRIA (dysarthria) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONSTIPATION (Constipation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), URINARY RETENTION (urinary retention) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and STAPHYLOCOCCAL SEPSIS (MSSA) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized for 5 days due to EPISTAXIS, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS and PURPURA. At the time of the report, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Severe refractory immune thrombocytopenia), EPISTAXIS (ACUTE EPISTAXIS), PURPURA (DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS PURPURA), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (extremity weakness) and FACIAL PARESIS (facial muscle weakness) was resolving and ENCEPHALOPATHY (encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness), BACK PAIN (back pain causing inability to ambulate), DYSARTHRIA (dysarthria), CONSTIPATION (Constipation), URINARY RETENTION (urinary retention) and STAPHYLOCOCCAL SEPSIS (MSSA) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 20-Jan-2021, Platelet count: 10 10^9/L (Inconclusive) 10. On 01-Feb-2021, Blood culture: abnormal (abnormal) blood culture grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). On 01-Feb-2021, Culture urine: abnormal (abnormal) urine culture grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). On 01-Feb-2021, Platelet count: 21 10^9/L (Inconclusive) 21. On 02-Feb-2021, Cytomegalovirus test: negative (Negative) Negative. On 02-Feb-2021, Epstein-Barr virus test: negative (Negative) Negative. On 02-Feb-2021, HIV test: negative (Negative) Negative.

On 04-Feb-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) MRI revealed sever L1-5 stenosis with multi-level disc herniation and fluid collections within the lumbar, posterior and paraspinal musculature.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Two months prior to vaccination, the patient had a platelet count of 224 x 10^9/L.  No concomitant medications were reported.  Treatment for the events included high-dose dexamethasone (400mg/kg/day), five daily doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (400mg/kg/day), three daily platelet transfusions, and two weekly doses of rituximab (375mg/m^2/dose). Immune suppression with dexamethasone (20mg/day) was continued after hospital discharge. Post vaccination day ten, TPO-RA eltrombopag (50 mg/day) was initiated. On post-vaccination day 14, he received one pheresis unit of platelets and an additional dose of IVIg of 80 grams. On post-vaccination day 12, he received high dose methyl-prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) and (5 mcg/kg). The patient was given cefazolin for MSSA infection. On post-vaccination day 19, after the third episode of plasma exchange, his facial weakness improved. On post-vaccination day 22, his platelet count was 72*10^9/L, a second dose of romiplostim 5 mcg/kg was administered, and a corticosteroid taper was begun. He was transferred to a skilled nursing facility on post-vaccination day 25 with a platelet count of 173*10^9/L.

                                                About 12 hours (at midnight) after my second Moderna vaccination, I lost all bladder control and the use of both legs.  I didn&#39;t have much pain but was very tired.  Trying to get out of bed I fell, and my wife had to get me up.  I decided not to call 911 but to wait until the following morning to go to the ER, which I now know was a mistake.  By the morning the use of my legs was starting to return.  I have been told by medical professionals (my wife being one, an RN) that it was the symptoms of either Transverse Myelitis or Gillian-Barre Syndrome.  If it reoccurs, I am told to get to the ER immediately for a spinal tap.  I had no adverse effects from the first vaccination, nor have I ever had any reactions from any other vaccinations or medications.  I am not sure if this is the right place to report this.  If not, please forward that info to me.  Thank you.

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

                                                Almost exactly seven days after my second Moderna shot, I had a urination which was dark blood red. It included a small blood clot, which by my estimate was at most 1/2&#34; long by 1/8&#34; in diameter.  There was no pain or burning on discharge, either with that urination, or before, or after. My next urination after that had a very small amount of dark red discoloration; and there has been no dark red in my urine after that [now six days]. Following that bloody urination, I did have a slight discomfort in the area below my belly button for several hours, but then it stopped. Since that incident, I have increased my intake of water and decreased my intake of acidic and carbonated drinks. I have not smoked in more than 45 years; and the occasional urinary dribbling I had experienced for some years before that incident has decreased noticeably. All else is OK. As a non-healthcare professional, I concluded the outcome to date is good. I have an appointment to see my doctor, on April 22.

                                                We report an event of transverse myelitis occurring one week after second dose of COVID vaccine in a seventy-five-year-old previously able-bodied gentleman with HTN and DM2. He developed a painless, distal greater than proximal, subacute onset weakness of the right greater than left upper and lower extremities with bowel and bladder retention. He was treated with methylprednisolone IV q24h for 3 days and IVIG (divided over 3 days). At one month from symptom onset, he was able to walk, but continued to have urinary and fecal retention. By 60 days since symptom onset, he had near resolution of symptoms.
