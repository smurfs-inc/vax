                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

I couldnt get out of bed: 1) Extreme heart palpitations, my heart rate monitor was reading an extremely high stress activity for 2 days post shot. 2) Very Hot and Very Cold body chill and temp swings 3) Sweating profusely, I soaked through my pajamas on 3 different occasions when I woke up from napping. 4) My pee was orange and hurt to pee. 5) My entire body hurt the worst I&#39;ve ever felt 6) All my joints were super painful, it hurt to walk and I couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain. 7) I had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

As the next few days started to progress I started noticing mild muscle spasms all over my body, mostly in my legs; waking up in the middle of the night, dry mouth, night sweat (1 occurrence), sudden onset of rapid and irregular heart beat (1 occurrence); kidney pain (right and left), upper abdominal pain (right and left). Prior to vaccine I did not experience any of these events.

                                                Blood in urine. Happened after both shots. Didn?t think much of it after the first dose, but definitely happened after the second. Also had a fever (peak at 102.2). Blood in the urine does happen for me occasionally when sick in the past.

                                                I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine on January 12, 2021.  I had a headache on the night of Jan 15 so took two Tylenol pills.  I woke up with a worse headache so took two Excedrin Migraine pills in the morning.  At about 10 am I started a 10 mile run, which is not unusually long for me.  I finished before noon and when I urinated , it was almost all blood, which has never happened to me before.  I went to the emergency room.  They gave me IV fluids and took some blood tests.  My creatinine levels were abnormally high but the doctor felt I overexerted myself and was too dehydrated even though the workout was not unusually for me.  On January 18th, I developed a quite painful lump in my left armpit, that lasted about a week.  I saw my primary care physician on Jan 23rd for a follow up.  He thought the lump was a swollen lymph node from the vaccine and was not concerned.  He scheduled blood tests and an ultrasound of my kidneys, all of which came back normal. I received my second vaccine shot on Feb 9th.  I developed a headache that night and have had a headache most of the time since.  I have taken several pills of Excedrin Migraine over these few days.  I also traveled to San Diego on the 10th and did a fairly long and arduous hike up a mountain on the 11th.  Although it was intense, it?s the type of hike I do several times a year and not completely out of the ordinary.  I was also a bit dehydrated again.  I woke early morning on the 12th with another headache so I took two more Excedrin MIgraines and went back to bed.  When I awoke about 6am, I urinated blood again.  I urinated blood for several hours and have finally drank enough water to end the blood urination. I normally work out intensely several times a week and do have bouts of dehydration.  But I have never urinated blood before.  I can?t help but believe it?s no coincidence that the two times in my life I?ve urinated blood have coincided with COVID vaccine shots.  Not sure how my exercises, dehydration, and use of NSAIDs  have contributed but something is going on and it needs to be investigated.

                                                Woke early one morning to a large painful lump on my right forearm. The lump was painful and felt like it was causing my arm to twist. Some hours later, my entire right arm was covered with large, painful, black and purple bruising. I had never experienced anything like this in my life. I often see blood in my urine, and during this time there was an unusually large amount. I don&#39;t know how to describe the feeling of lumps moving through my body, but I could definitely feel the movement through my arms and legs.

He was having yellow sputum production and he had chills. Upon arrival to the hospital on 4/18 the patient was tachycardic and chest x-ray that showed cardiomegaly with fluid overload. Progressively became severely hypoxemic and had to be emergently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Patient developed cardiogenic shock which may be acute myocarditis and was placed on an Impella device and norepinephrine drip. The patient continued to worsen and developed acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia and was placed on CRRT. LFTs were also elevated. Patient also went into atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone drip. All of the above mentioned occurred within a 12 hour period.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

Then all of my muscles began to ache badly &amp; by 4 pm I was suffering from on and off chills/ sweating ; this lasted all evening.  I checked my temperature &amp; only once was the temperature above 100F.   I did have some chest pain at times as well.   I drank mint tea, took tylenol at regular intervals &amp; used icy hot on the sore back and neck.    Following morning I&#39;m feeling a little better but still quite a bit of soreness but as of 7 am , the chills/hots have subsided.  I did pee a lot over night; at one point I went to the bathroom about 5-6 times within an hour to 90 minutes.

                                                Initially, I felt fatigued and my left deltoid was sore. On day three after vaccination, I had one episode of hematuria. On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the shot, I began to feel flu-like symptoms beginning with intestinal discomfort and incontinence. Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

Over the next 40 minutes I needed to urinate 6 additional times, and my heart rate peaked out at 195 BPM, and BP of 139/84. My blood oxygen never went below 95. My hands and feet were extremely cold, but normal in color. After approximately an hour after I recorded the peak heart rate, my rate was 138 BPM. By about 8:45 AM, I was very close to mo normal heart rate and BP. I had no other notable symptoms other than the expected soreness at the injection site and a very slight headache.

Bladder was very full twice during the night, not normal, I usually sleep through the night without needing to urinate. 20 hours post vaccination, body is sore and weak, headache, neck is sore. At present, still feeling dehydrated, head feels really heavy, very hungry.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

                                                Eighty four hours after vaccine I developed fever of 101-102 degrees, chills and night sweats. I was not able to work for two days. I also developed lower back pain and had Urinary Frequency with bad urine odor. This started 48hours after having the other symptoms. I started to take antibiotics Levaquin and tested negative for Covid-19. The urinary symptoms and other symptoms were reduced after three days. I felt like the illness was coming and going in three hour increments. I had mostly recovered by the sixth day. I got the second dose of the vaccine and had no symptoms that were similar.

                                                TWO lower GI tract infections, each one about two weeks after a vaccine shot. Other worries are confusion and bp oscillation.  DETAILS: 1st dose only minor flu like symptoms then 14 days in, big GI tract infection tennis ball size in lower GI followed by UTI and Colo-rectal infections. Gas and no stool passing.   2nd dose down  24-72 hrs later with serious chills and internal fever in main body cavity. Slept it off and hydrated. Then consistent flu like symptoms but stronger and longer than 1st shot. Increasing confusion and maybe dementia? Some 3-D visual dreams too?  lots of inflamation feel in body wherever old injuries were. Also blood pressure going high and low even though I cross checked with both electronic wrist version, and mechanical armband version of bp monitors. Consistent frontal lobe head pressure, bp oscillation, and flu like feelings (upset stomach, change in urine and stool color, wooziness, chills, etc.). Thank goodness for coffee! It helps clear up my mind a bit.  Then again, 14 days beyond second shot roughly, and the only reason I filed the report, another lower GI tract infection. This time I hit it right away with potassium penicillin 800 mg. This worked the first time too. Just an FYI in case others are showing  GI tract version/issues. I believe this was a secondary form of Covid symptoms in early Chinese data if that can be trusted.   Still not in good shape but it sounds like second shot causes more issues. I will probably schedule general checkup with my doctor if I dont get better in a week or so.

                                                I tested positive for covid on 1/08/21. I had the Moderna vaccine 1st dose 4/12/21 at 8:30am. No significant immediate reaction to the vaccine. Pain worsened at the injection point, but never significant, slight headache, tired, mild flu symptoms grew through the day. At 9:30PM I experienced Fever(101.6 at around midnight after fever had broke was probably higher between 9:30PM and 11:30pm). I experienced chills and violent shaking from approximately 9:30pm to 11:30pm, as bad or worse then the original covid from January. I was unable to sleep and finally took 2 Advil 200mg each at 3:00am. Advil helped and eventually fell asleep around 3:30am. Online information suggests that the 2nd dose generally has more severe reactions. I am concerned how much worse it will be and considering not getting the 2nd dose scheduled for May 10. Tuesday April 13 I experienced slight headache, body aches and exhaustion in the afternoon. Took Nyquil  severe cold and flu Tuesday evening and sleep well. Wednesday experienced lesser symptoms. Thursday had lower back and kidney area soreness. Friday april 15 back to normal.

                                                Patient manifested with flu-like symptoms (myalgias, fatigue, cough, abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath) with high-grade fevers (TMax 103F) approximately 4-6 hours following administration of 2nd Moderna vaccine on 5/4/2021 per patient&#39;s wife. The symptoms progressively worsened to the point that he presented to an outside hospital on 5/12/2021 at which time he was found to be tachycardic and febrile (T 103.1F). Labs at that time were notable for significant thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, elevated procalcitonin. Chest imaging showed bilateral airspace disease. CT of the abdomen noted hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Labs on 5/13/2021 were notable for a markedly elevated ferritin level, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, elevated CRP, elevated transaminase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, markedly elevated CXCL-9 level, markedly elevated IL-18 level, normal natural killer cell function. Of note, while his blood and urine cultures were negative, he was found to have elevated EBV viral load on peripheral blood draw. He had a bone marrow biopsy which reportedly showed rare evidence of cells with what appeared to be erythrocytes within their cytoplasm, concerning for HLH.  Given strong clinical and serological suspicion for HLH, he was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility on 5/18/2021, his inflammatory markers were persistently elevated. He unfortunately developed worsened renal and respiratory failure, and required both hemodialysis and intubation respectively. He was continued on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, however we additionally initiated high-dose steroids as well as anakinra for treatment of HLH. Given EBV viremia, we also began rituximab therapy. He was successfully extubated, however as of 5/26/2021 remains dialysis-dependent with continued improvement in urinary output. His post-intubation course has been complicated by encephalopathy of unknown etiology. We have consulted infectious disease to proceed with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to ascertain potential CNS pathogens explaining the cause of his altered mental status. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of pathology. CNS involvement by HLH remains on our differential.

                                                I got my second shot of mederna on april 2  at about 130 pm, I got the shot and felt fine for about 4 hours at which time I got so tired and dizzy I felt like I was going to pass out, so I stopped what I was doing and went to bed. I slept for 4 hours and woke up in a pool of sweat and was so wet it was like I had just gotten out of the shower. I had the chills and felt cold in 84 Deg F, I went down stairs drank power aid and got out and set up a space heater and sat in front of it with it blowing the hot air on me but had hot and cold flashes, a mild head ach and joint stiffness and pain. I was only able to stay up for 4 hours before I was so exhausted I had to back to sleep and woke up the same way, this continued for the entire weekend. By monday morning my urine was so yellow it was almost black in color, I called my PCP office, they called me back and advised I go to the emergency room asap. I called my parents and got a ride to the hospital emergency room. I told intake what happened and sat down to be called in, they called me in 1 time then had me wait for diagnostic testing, I got vary dizzy just sitting their watching the tv. By the time they called me in for testing I told them I felt vary noxious and ended up passing out on the nurse after they took my blood. They transferred me from that chair to a bed in the blue pod, gave me nausea medication and hooked me up too 2 vary large IV bags and ran them at the same time. Then being up for 4 hours then sleeping for 4 hours and waking up wet in a pool of sweat continued for 6 days in total. the hot and cold flashes and sitting in front of a space heater went on for 12 days in total. waking up in a pool of sweat went on for about 28 - 30 days in total decreasing in severity along the course of time. The only side effect I still have is my sleep is all screwed up now. If I stay up untill 4 am I will sleep to 10;30 then wake up tired and stay in bed untill 11;30  am. if I go to bed at 2 am I wake up at 6;30 am have to use the bath room then can not go back to sleep for at least a hour then do not wake up untill 11 30 am. Normally, I used to goto bed at 2 -3 am and wake up at 9 -10 am every day.  on wednesday april 7 th, the doctors office which is part of the same group as the hospital called me to go over the results from the emergency room, but the person calling did not seem to know I had called them on monday morning or they had called me back to tell me to go to the emergency room, so I do not know how much of a help the PCP will be,  but I have proof of that in the phone call records.  MY PCP is no longer with the practice, so I had to choose a new one

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

Found to have profound anion gap metabolic acidosis with lactate peaking at &gt;27. Initial workup also significant for WBC 40s, AKI with Cr peak at 2.5. Transaminitis likely 2/2 shock liver. Toxicologic workup was negative for alcohol, Tylenol, salicylates, urine drug screen. Blood cultures grew S. hominis. Other infectious workup including covid, hepatitis, hiv, rocky mountain spotted fever, respiratory panel, GI PCR, all negative. Also found to have a PE which was removed via thrombectomy. Developed DIC requiring multiple transfusions of cryo, FFP, and RBCs. Condition improved slowly with lactate downtrending currently and pressor requirement weaning.

It looks like bee stings bigger then a quarter 3 on my stomach and 3 on back. Lots of little bumps. It hurts very sensitive. I felt like my ribs and kidney were hurting but it is because of the nerves when I touch them.  This is been about a week. I am going to call my doctor. The pain is not just one spot but the whole area around them.

Two days later, on 01/28/2021, the patient went to local urgent care for worsening shortness of breath and was referred to Hospital for worsening dyspnea and hypoxia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital   We was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and treated for pneumonia with Rocephin and azithromycin.  He was tested for COVID-19 multiple times, but each of the results were negative.  Despite the negative results, there was high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and the patient was started on Remdesivir and Decadron.  The  patient&#39;s oxygen requirements continued to worsen and the patient was transferred to another facility for higher level of care.  There  his hypoxia worsened and he required mechanical ventilation.  Patient then developed hypotension and required vasopressors for blood pressure support.  Furthermore, patient developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  Despite mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100%, and for vasopressors, patient clinically deteriorated and family decided to palliatively extubate on 02/05/2021.

BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.
