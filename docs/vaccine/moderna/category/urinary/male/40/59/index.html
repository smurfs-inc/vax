                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

I couldnt get out of bed: 1) Extreme heart palpitations, my heart rate monitor was reading an extremely high stress activity for 2 days post shot. 2) Very Hot and Very Cold body chill and temp swings 3) Sweating profusely, I soaked through my pajamas on 3 different occasions when I woke up from napping. 4) My pee was orange and hurt to pee. 5) My entire body hurt the worst I&#39;ve ever felt 6) All my joints were super painful, it hurt to walk and I couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain. 7) I had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

                                                I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine on January 12, 2021.  I had a headache on the night of Jan 15 so took two Tylenol pills.  I woke up with a worse headache so took two Excedrin Migraine pills in the morning.  At about 10 am I started a 10 mile run, which is not unusually long for me.  I finished before noon and when I urinated , it was almost all blood, which has never happened to me before.  I went to the emergency room.  They gave me IV fluids and took some blood tests.  My creatinine levels were abnormally high but the doctor felt I overexerted myself and was too dehydrated even though the workout was not unusually for me.  On January 18th, I developed a quite painful lump in my left armpit, that lasted about a week.  I saw my primary care physician on Jan 23rd for a follow up.  He thought the lump was a swollen lymph node from the vaccine and was not concerned.  He scheduled blood tests and an ultrasound of my kidneys, all of which came back normal. I received my second vaccine shot on Feb 9th.  I developed a headache that night and have had a headache most of the time since.  I have taken several pills of Excedrin Migraine over these few days.  I also traveled to San Diego on the 10th and did a fairly long and arduous hike up a mountain on the 11th.  Although it was intense, it?s the type of hike I do several times a year and not completely out of the ordinary.  I was also a bit dehydrated again.  I woke early morning on the 12th with another headache so I took two more Excedrin MIgraines and went back to bed.  When I awoke about 6am, I urinated blood again.  I urinated blood for several hours and have finally drank enough water to end the blood urination. I normally work out intensely several times a week and do have bouts of dehydration.  But I have never urinated blood before.  I can?t help but believe it?s no coincidence that the two times in my life I?ve urinated blood have coincided with COVID vaccine shots.  Not sure how my exercises, dehydration, and use of NSAIDs  have contributed but something is going on and it needs to be investigated.

                                                Woke early one morning to a large painful lump on my right forearm. The lump was painful and felt like it was causing my arm to twist. Some hours later, my entire right arm was covered with large, painful, black and purple bruising. I had never experienced anything like this in my life. I often see blood in my urine, and during this time there was an unusually large amount. I don&#39;t know how to describe the feeling of lumps moving through my body, but I could definitely feel the movement through my arms and legs.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the shot, I began to feel flu-like symptoms beginning with intestinal discomfort and incontinence. Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.  All temps via temporal sensor thermometer.

General sickness so far making work rough enough to try to call out for the 2nd dose coming.  Still ongoing.   Nausea, Difficulty concentrating, General achiness starting from arm to ribs, then body wide.  Brain Fog.  Heavy fatigue, but it doesn&#39;t take as much to disable me more.  Warm forehead, but temp taken today is normal at 96.6.   Difficulty moving with aches.  A few moments of wanting to vomit.  No allergic reaction or rashes.  Just a greater tax on the system.   I just thought it&#39;s bad enough to report (and is still going on).  Left arm pain all but done as of 3/15/21 at 7pm.  Nothing life threatening, but concerned over second shot.  Strange yellow &#34;Floating oil&#34; runs and dark urine.

Bladder was very full twice during the night, not normal, I usually sleep through the night without needing to urinate. 20 hours post vaccination, body is sore and weak, headache, neck is sore. At present, still feeling dehydrated, head feels really heavy, very hungry.

                                                I don&#39;t think that my reaction to the vaccine is super serious but it is perhaps worth noting if others are also experiencing similar symptoms. On the second day, I did have the expected arm soreness around the injection area on my right arm. That soreness faded by Saturday morning. However, on Saturday afternoon, I began experiencing some intermittent pain in my left kidney. I have had a few (3?) kidney stones since I was approximately 35 years old so it is a pain that I recognize almost immediately.  I kept my spider senses awake to see where it was going to go. About an hour later, I had intermittent &#34;flu like&#34; pain in my arms and legs. I had been up on a ladder painting a wall and I became a bit dizzy and decided to halt the painting project. The rest of the evening was kind of crappy. Intermittent headaches, leg pain, arm pain and left kidney pain. I took 1 Alleve tablet around 8pm. It didn&#39;t seem to do much. I took a second one about an hour later (according to the instructions you can take two for you first dose) and that seemed to do the trick! I slept like a rock and so far today, all of the pain is gone including the pain in my left kidney.  I have not taken any more Alleve besides the two that I took last night. Also, as of right now (2:44pm on Sunday 3/21), no kidney stone has passed. I have been urinating into a cup to see if one comes out. I cannot 100% say that any of these symptoms are related to the vaccine. However, being a Type 1 diabetic (since 1978) and the unusual kidney pain made me go, &#34;huh.&#34; That is why I am providing this info in the event that there are others who are experiencing similar symptoms that can be tied to the vaccine and what to expect. I feel completely fine now. Yay. :)

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

                                                Eighty four hours after vaccine I developed fever of 101-102 degrees, chills and night sweats. I was not able to work for two days. I also developed lower back pain and had Urinary Frequency with bad urine odor. This started 48hours after having the other symptoms. I started to take antibiotics Levaquin and tested negative for Covid-19. The urinary symptoms and other symptoms were reduced after three days. I felt like the illness was coming and going in three hour increments. I had mostly recovered by the sixth day. I got the second dose of the vaccine and had no symptoms that were similar.

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

Went back to bed-headache lasted for about four days.

It looks like bee stings bigger then a quarter 3 on my stomach and 3 on back. Lots of little bumps. It hurts very sensitive. I felt like my ribs and kidney were hurting but it is because of the nerves when I touch them.  This is been about a week. I am going to call my doctor. The pain is not just one spot but the whole area around them.

Two days later, on 01/28/2021, the patient went to local urgent care for worsening shortness of breath and was referred to Hospital for worsening dyspnea and hypoxia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital   We was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and treated for pneumonia with Rocephin and azithromycin.  He was tested for COVID-19 multiple times, but each of the results were negative.  Despite the negative results, there was high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and the patient was started on Remdesivir and Decadron.  The  patient&#39;s oxygen requirements continued to worsen and the patient was transferred to another facility for higher level of care.  There  his hypoxia worsened and he required mechanical ventilation.  Patient then developed hypotension and required vasopressors for blood pressure support.  Furthermore, patient developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  Despite mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100%, and for vasopressors, patient clinically deteriorated and family decided to palliatively extubate on 02/05/2021.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.
