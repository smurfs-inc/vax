                                                6 hours after vaccine developed fatigue and mild soreness. Over night had severe muscle and joint pain. The next day muscle/joint pain continued with headache, fatigue, fever, chills, and my urine turned dark brown. The next day fever went away and all symptoms improved except the urine continued to be brown. The following day I was seen at the ER and was diagnosed with hematuria of unknown cause. I have to have a CT scan on Monday to evaluate further.

                                                1st Moderna shot was 1/4/21.  Had a syncope episode/potential seizure on 1/13/21 - unwitnessed loss of consciousness for a short period of time with loss of urinary continence.   2nd Moderna COVID shot on 1/29/21 with no reactions.  My doctors evaluating me did not consider this as a COVID vaccine reaction, even though it did occur after the first vaccination.  I am a nurse with a doctorate degree and do not believe the seizure was the reaction of the COVID vaccine.  I was under extreme amounts of stress at work at the time.  I also have a prior medical history of syncope episodes when I was a teenager (25&#43; years ago).

Heavy bleeding. Tongue and throat mild numbness at the height of pain. Extremely painful to pass stool and urinate. Worst pain lasted two days. 8 days later mild cramps persist, passing stool still uncomfortable. Day 7 cramps got worse for half a day. bleeding/spotting lasted 7 days (usually 3). Night 7 arm started to hurt again and itch, hives formed injection spot. Next morning (now) arm feels hot, itchy, sore and irritated.  Still cramping in lower abdomen today.

                                                Received vaccine on 3/3/21 at 2:30pm. Waited for 20 minutes at pharmacy for allergic reaction. Given the all clear, so headed home. Around 5pm, I started noticing how extremely sore my left arm was, almost as if somebody had hit it with a baseball bat (no bruising, redness, etc., just VERY sore). I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it&#39;s as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn&#39;t then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger. I am EXTREMELY concerned about the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger as it does not seem to be getting better.

                                                Extreme pain in joints/body aches developed approximately 12 hours after dose with front/side headache similar to migraine pain level with nausea; treated with Nyquil Cough at 3:40 am, Tylenol-650 mg at 7:30 am, and both at 3:30 pm on 3/11. On 3/12, body pain/aches gone, but left with migraine type headache and fatigue. Treated with Tylenol-650 mg on 3/12 at 7:30 am.  Fatigue continued until at least 10 pm 3/12 but gone on 3/13.   Main reason for report: I had an ablation performed and tubal ligation in December 2018 with no break through bleeding at any time since. On Day 28 after first Moderna dose, there was noticeable cramping in low abdomen not experienced since ablation. On Day 32 from first dose-- the same day as the second Moderna dose, there was cramping again in low abdomen and menstrual fluid appearing in urine- more red in color. On Day 33 post-first dose and Day 1 post-second Moderna dose, there was more break-through menstrual fluid- very dark in color typical of prior &#34;end of period&#34; fluid with similar odor, with continued cramping.  This continued, but lessoned on Day 2 post-second vaccine. I understand there can be failed ablations, but the timing seemed worth noting for you in case there is any pattern with impacts on menstruation.

Between hours 14-44 my experience was intense with fever &gt;102 (that was not responsive to Tylenol or Motrin), uncontrollable shaking with an episode of urinary incontinence, fainting, rash on chest/neck, right facial twitching, right arm twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, profuse sweating, flashing lights in both eyes (open and closed), intense body aches, the sensation that my skin was burning, muscle spasms (back), joint pain (knees/hips), dizziness, agitation, and insomnia.  After 44 hours the intense symptoms resolved and I had fatigue, right facial twitching, right arm pain/itching/redness. I went to see my doctor on 1/28/2021 to document my experience.

After day 3, I went to hospital thinking I had Meningitis because my head hurt so bad and my neck was stiff. They ran an urinalysis and found a pretty bad UTI.  The doctor said that the UTI exacerbated the side effects of shot. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true. I got I. V. Keflex and prescription. Migraine continued for another 3 or so days. I missed 4 days of work. Honestly the symptoms felt like I was doing chemo again. It was awful.

I was very worried about the dark urine because I had history of hemolytic anemia. I went to ER and got diagnosed with Hemolytic Anemia after blood and urine test. Admitted to hospital overnight and dismissed with my request to do so with steroid prescription of steroid prednisone 20MG 3 tablets a day for 7days to suppress  my immune response for for the vaccine that believed to be one which triggered the Hemolytic Anemia. following up with Hematologist on Monday with extra blood draw to monitor my situation. Still not feeling well with fatigue, back lower pain and dizzeness .i still look yellow and urine dark .

Monitored for approximately 30 minutes and then released. Abdominal pain started 3 hours after vaccination. Pain worsened and became severe over several hours, peaking with other flu-like symptoms and decreased over the next several days as other symptoms decreased. Pain was worse on left side about half way up rib cage and lasted for 5 days. Abdominal pain was worse and sharpened when twisting, rolling or bending torso.  I can still feel a pulling sensation under ribs on left side off and on.  Also starting about 15 hours after vaccination I had brownish colored urine that lasted about 36 hours.  Saw FNP 10 days after vaccination. CBC, liver &amp; kidney function blood work &amp; urine dip stick tests all normal.  They could not feel any enlargement on physical examination, but suspect spleen issue

Finished last dose of Macrobid 1/17/21. Tuesday evening on 1/19/21 started with itching on my scalp. Woke up at 3:00am 1/20/21 with welts/hives around my waist and ribcage area. These hives progressed over the next 24-36 hours and I ended up covered from head to toe. I also developed a low grade fever of 100.4 on 1/21/21 and has some very slight joint swelling/tenderness. I treated the hives with  of OTC Benadryl, which helped with the itching but didn&#39;t seem to have any affect on the hives. By Saturday 1//23/21 all hives were gone but itching persisted for 4-5 days after and gradually subsided. Was scheduled to get my second Moderna dose on 1/31/21 but the Pharmacist recommended I postpone for now and file a report here.

This followed hours of terrible chills and muscle aches that I couldn?t sleep through. No medications were taken until after the episode and it didn?t happen again. I did not have a working thermometer so unsure how high my temp got. I peed myself when fainted. My husband was present to pick me up off the floor and luckily I didn?t hurt myself in the fall. I didn?t come to until he took me back to bed. I started feeling better a few hours later and much better by 24 hours. Now just lingering body aches and fatigue at 48 hours and still taking ibuprofen/Tylenol.

                                                Immediately after shot: I felt some pain &amp; burning at injection sight. In general felt a little off, but nothing significant. After observation period, on the drive home, I began to &#34;taste&#34; the shot, as did my husband who received vaccine right after me. Then, my face felt a little funny, and my jaw felt tight, but no visible swelling. Then I felt a rush of burning sensation throughout my chest and abdominal region. After arriving home, 20 minutes later, I felt a little nauseated, but not bad. An hour later, I was unable to eat dinner, as I felt ill. I felt like I had a mild fever and I was shivering with chills. While trying to sleep, the chills continued. I then experienced unusual frequent urination, every 2 to 3 hours. I had no consumed abnormal amounts of liquid, but my urine was nearly clear, which was odd. After returning to bed after the first time urinating, my heart rate became very fast and I felt like I had a hard time finding my pulse in my neck, which is unusual for me.   The day after the vaccination I experience headache, a lot of tenderness around injection sight and arm muscle pain making it very painful to make certain movement, like putting on my top and reaching for objects. That evening I experience some muscle aches.   These symptoms have improved now that it is day three after the vaccination. I still have a mild headache and pain at injection sight.

Then random joint pain, muscle aches and stiffness. During the night muscle ache turned to pain radiating around upper abdomen up into right shoulder as did the injection site with nausea, stomach upset and gas. 2/4/2021 around 9am the chills started and fatigue, increased muscle aches and chills with difficulty controlling my bladder, in addition my urine turned dark. 2/5/2021 all the same symptoms with increased discomfort around upper abdomen circling to my back and new muscle twitching at the injection site. All continued through 2/7/2021 and began lessening. Starting 2/8/2021 mild aches and random chills with upper abdominal pain continuing. At night for some reason it all starts again, I wake up wet from perspiration every night and I switch from painful chills with aches and pain to being hot.

                                                That night, headaches and chills really bad. By that evening, around 6, I couldn&#39;t get off the couch by myself. I got up and it felt like my ribs were rubbing against my kidneys. It was hurting that bad. I felt like I did when I had COVID the first time.  I just laid on the couch. I took 2 Ibuprofen that helped more than Tylenol. My lymph nodes were swollen and I couldn&#39;t even put my bra on. The swelling was also in my neck. I continued to have chills and a fever. I was sweaty. From Friday to Sunday, it started to dissipate and then I was able to get around better. My lymph nodes were swollen for about 5 days.  I started to feel better, with the exception of my arm which is still bothering me. I experienced sharp pains in my arm last night and it&#39;s been itchy.

Also pain between my shoulder blades. This subsided after two days.  Beginning 26 hours after the shot I had stomach cramping, nausea, extreme fatigue, body aches, headache, chills. This lasted for 3 1/2 days. Then I developed a severe cystitis flare up, which I had not had in years. I?m still dealing with the cystitis flare which causes fatigue, bodyaches, frequent urination, insomnia, pressure in the bladder and pelvic area, extreme discomfort, nausea and headache.  I?m taking 200 mg Advil every four hours, using a heating pad, drinking mint tea, and taking desert harvest freeze dried Aloe Vera capsules (6) daily.

                                                Began with tingling down my right arm, and I became a little shaky.  Drank some water and the shakiness continued to get worse.  Went to the restroom and felt like I was going to pass out.  Tingling came back  across my upper body (chest level to shoulder level), I began to shake excessively, my mouth got very dry and my skin became splotchy.  I was breathing hard like I had just ran flights of stairs.  Nurses were called and I was given Benadryl and taken to the Emergency Room at a neighboring hospital where they hooked me up to I believe heart and BP monitors.  My blood pressure was very high and my heart was pounding so hard.  Was given steroid pills.  All day I urinated excessively and my heart pounded hard.

I did not have the urgency to go, and when I started walking, my bladder emptied.  I reported this symptom through Vsafe on that day.  This symptom did not happen again.  On 1/10/21, I was changing my clothes and my left arm felt itchy.  When I itched my arm, I felt little, raised welts.  I looked at my arm, and a significant red, irregular shaped spot was on my arm.  I could not report this to Vsafe as my check ins had stopped as of 1/6/21.  I called my PCP, who directed me to this site to report it.

                                                Patient had first dose of Moderna vaccine at another facility on 1/10/2021. Around 1/18/2021 she felt poorly, more fatigue and noted her urine was dark. By 1/22/2021 she opted to present to the ER where she was noted to have severe hepatitis (ALT 1600) but oddly a normal bilirubin. Her INR, CBC and vitals were normal. She was sent home from the ER and I saw her today 1/25/2021 in consultation for the liver enzyme issues. It is not clear that this is related to the vaccine. She may have hepatitis A or this could have been a medication/supplement induced hepatitis but due to the timing I felt it should be reported.

She felt awful within an hour of vaccination and persisted with symptoms for 2.5 days.  She described it as being out of it, headache, fever, chills, profound body aches, weakness and dizziness with palpitations.  She could not get out of bed for a day.  She literally thought she was going to die given the severity of her weakness.  As quickly as the symptoms occurred, they left her on March 7th, 2021.  She went to work on March 8th and noted similar symptoms to prior ITP flares - petechiae on legs, gum bleeding, fatigue, mild headache.  She also noted dark urine but no frank blood.  Since being admitted and receiving steroids, she is feeling improved and petechiae are lessening.  She also noted mild mouth ulceration to lower lip along with oozing.

                                                Arm turned red at injection site and hot. There was really no pain and went away within a couple of day but turned red again exactly a week later from injection date. This time it was hard, hot, red, itchy, and bigger. Dr treated it with clindamycin and dose pack of steroids. It got better after a few days. Next, I got a UTI and called my primary care physician. She ordered CIPRO and phenazopyridine. That got better but before CIPRO was finished, I got a crick in my neck that turned into excruciating pain in my neck and was unable to turn head from side to side. At the same time, my left foot became painful, red and swelled. I have been treated for arthritis in that foot 6 years ago with an injection. I have not had any problems with it since the injection.  Dr. treated my neck problem with Robaxin and a steroid dose pack. This seemed to help my foot too temporarily. Neck pain improved but not gone. It was excruciating pain up the back of my scalp at times. I can turn my head some now but it&#39;s not back normal. Can&#39;t turn it all the way.  Dr. did another injection in my foot but did not work this time. I got worse and I can no longer put any weight on that foot. I have not been able to work since January 20. Have had to apply for leave of absence and short-term disability

                                                Ten hours after vaccine I experienced a hyperglycemic  event; my glucose was so high than neither my arm sensor (Free Style Libre) or my finger stick meter could read it.  It took 40 units of Humolog over a 2 - 1/2 hour time period to bring it down enough to read it.  It was 452.  By morning, six hours later and 20 more units, I am down to 236.  My systems started with my heart pounding out of my ears and neck, frequent urination, and sweating or feeling warm (usually associated with low blood sugar events).  I ate lunch after the vaccine, but by evening when I would normally make some dinner, I didn&#39;t eat until I forced myself to eat some cooked cauliflower at 12:30 a.m.  As I was finally going to bed, around 2 p.m., the cough started.  The cough is an itch at the base of my throat with a slight feeling of swelling.  I have sugar free cough drops and cinnamon candy (which helps reduce the swelling).  This morning, four hours later, the cough has a small amount of phlegm with it (but mostly just itches).

                                                I had a uti and was prescribed an antibiotic Nitrofurantoin on 1/23/2021 -didn&#39;t start it until the next day - finished the antibiotic - 1/28/2021.  On 2/1/2021  I started to feel sick, I had chills, temp 99.5-99.7 rash - at first just around hips, buttocks lower abdomen - areas of erythema that was raised and indurated largest area was about 8 cm diameter, very itchy, later that day  swollen hands, feel, large tender lumps that were normal skin color.   A few hours later I developed macular rash to top of my shoulders, itchy and tender - looked and left like a sunburn. ( but no sun exposure !)  My wrists , hands, elbows were sore.  As the rash on my lower torso improved I had a second outbreak abdomen ,   I took benadryl 25-50 mg every 8 hours.  I contacted my employee  occupational health - discussed with them - at the time  I was concerned about whether they wanted me to be tested for covid - I am a healthcare worker . At the time we both thought may be it was the nitrofurantoin. I also asked about whether I should hold on my 2nd vaccine- but by this time rash was much better, chills were gone, joint pain and swelling improved. Occupational health recommended I get 2nd vaccine. On 2/4/2021 I got 2nd vaccine, no new symptoms that day. Next day 102.5 fever but rash was almost completely gone and no longer itchy.  On 2/6 .2021 rash came back but much worse, same symptoms , rash more wide spread, hive like rash with white border pink in center, various sizes but including breasts , thighs, buttocks abdomen, and starting on my arms but no joint pain. I was taking benadryl 50 mg every 4  hours without much relief and pepcid 20 mg.  This morning 2/7/2021 I developed facial swelling , lip  swelling, - started on prednisone, now things improving

On  Sunday, she took her Humira which she normally takes every two weeks.  On  Monday morning, started to notice that she had oral ulcers as well as cuts on  side of mouth.  Tongue felt like it was really dry.  Mouth was really painful.  Went to ER at who thought that this was oral candidiasis versus oral  psoriasis. Suggested she get B12 checked and also start nystatin swishes.   On Tuesday started to notice that her hands were peeling and having much pain.  Used triamcinolone cream on both of her hands but this is not helping.  Use of  lidocaine for pain only causes her hands to burn more.  Husband bought her a  pair of cotton gloves to wear.

I took Advil,  it was like the worst &#34;flu shot&#34; I ever got. Then the muscle pain started. I went home and took some Advil, tried to walk my dogs and couldn&#39;t. I usually walk 3 miles with them and did not walk even 1/2 mile. Went home and took a hot shower with Epson salt and laid down. My arm started aching. I can&#39;t even wash my hair, the injection site itches and is painful and my scalp was itching too. Overall headache, joint/ muscle pain like flu like symptoms. Wednesday morning before I left work my back started hurting really bad, severe back pain. When I arrived home and used the bathroom I was having abd pain, and diarrhea. It was all fluid. I ate some chili the day before and when I wiped my bottom it was red like bloody. My PCP was closed. It happened about 4 times. It is like I have a kidney pain (the back pain)

But, when I woke up on Friday, February 5, 2021 at 8:30 am, I had this horrible pain in my lower leftside of my back in my kidney.    The pain was so bad that it hurt every time that I would move, pass gas, cough, sneeze, or getting in and out of the car.  I couldn&#39;t lay flat on my back to sleep . This horrible kidney pain lasted until I got up on Sunday, February 7, 2021 at 8:30 am.

                                                I had underlying body inflammation prior to getting vaccine, but otherwise no illnesses or issues.  Two days after vaccine I came down with a UTI.  Another 3 days after that my body went into an acute inflammatory response.  I had extremely pronounced pinkeye (first time ever) followed by acute gout flare-up (first time ever) followed by extreme edema in lower extremities (first time ever).  I&#39;m being treated with steroids, but these issues have yet to resolve.  I have not been able to work since Jan 4.  I can only stand for a few minutes and walk a short distance with the aid of crutches.  In all of my life, I have never had pinkeye or gout or edema, or a UTI for that matter.  I am a healthcare worker and I&#39;m needed back at my job asap.

                                                Two hours post vaccination:  tongue heaviness followed by metallic taste sensation, vomited once after this.  Four hours post vaccination:  nausea, bilateral forearm pain evolving to all over body aches and muscle cramping along with a pulsating headache.  Spiked a fever of 102 F that I treated with 500 mg of Tylenol.  Later took ibuprofen for body aches.  Had frequent urination along with unexplained crying.  The lowest the fever would measure for the next 24 hours was 100 F.  I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen as directed on a regular basis.  On Thursday 1/21/2021 at 5:55 pm, I woke up drenched in sweat.  I felt weak yet improved.  Headache and back pain were less.  Showered and moved to the couch in living room attempting to watch TV.  Could not stay awake.  Woke up three hours later again drenched in sweat.  Showered and went to bed.  Slept through the night and woke up at 8 am with body aches, muscle cramping and nausea gone.  Night gown and sheets were damp with sweat. Lingering symptoms:  Skin from lips and inside my mouth appears to be sloughing off.  There are very tiny cuts on my bottom lip.  Left with mild headache I attribute to dehydration.  No longer nauseous although I have no appetite.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.
