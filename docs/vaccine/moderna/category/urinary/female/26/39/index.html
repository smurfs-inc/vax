My arm was immediately hot and tender after administration. The area around the injection site had less feeling than the rest of my arm - it felt almost numb. My arm was very sore and warm the rest of the evening. I began having fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain last night as well. I woke up around 6 this morning and the room was spinning. I was also nauseous. I tried to roll over in bed but was unable to feel my arms and legs. I was also temporarily unable to see. Right after, I passed out and lost urinary continence. I regained consciousness a minute later and had normal functioning again. I have not had any more dizziness today but am still sore and fatigued.

                                                The patient did report swelling, induration and pain at the injection site. The patient  reports onset of headache, fever of 100.6, chills, body aches, night sweats, and malaise within a couple of hours of receiving dose 2 of her Covid 19 vaccine.  Due to how she felt, she went to bed soon after, and slept until the next morning. Upon waking up she noticed resolution of all her symptoms except for night sweats, and malaise.  She continued feeling hot and having night sweats but did not appreciate having a fever.  She also reports  the onset of significant facial swelling, periorbital swelling and swelling of her hands and feet, basically her entire body.  She also reports an onset of &#34;foul smelling&#34; diarrhea.  Her chronic eczematous areas which are her eyebrows, posterior neck, and scalp became more itchy and flaking and peeling.  She developed new areas of eczema and itching over her torso located at her mid axillary areas from her braline down to her waist area.  She also reports the onset of browniish red/ amber colored urine since receiving the vaccine. She continued to flake and peel over her eyebrows and cheeks in  continuously and in large amounts for the next 10 days.  She reports taking no antihistamines, or antipyretics.  She went to urgent care and was treated with 0.5% clobetasol cream which after 2 applications to her face caused a chemical, sun burn like reaction and more severe swelling over her cheeks and periorbital areas.  A photo shows that her left eye was so swollen it was half closed and the skin color was purplish. She returned to urgent care on March 11, 2021 and was prescribed a medrol dose pak.  She started it right away and her facial swelling improved.   On March 13 she came to see me.  with improvement in her swelling, peeling and flaking.   She was noted to have a fever of 101.6, then it was 100.6 after recheck and finally 99.6 before the end of her appointment.   It isn&#39;t clear whether her temp decreased because her medrol taken earlier that morning had kicked in or by removing her sweatshirt and being out of the sun allowed her to sweat and decrease her core body temperture to that level.She was asked to continue checking her temp which she reported as 99.8 on March 13, 100.6 on March 14, and 100.5 on March 15.  She has been instructed to check her temp everyday for the next 14 days.  Her urinedipstick showed 1&#43; bilirubin and ketones with trace blood and all other indicators were negative.  Patient was sent for stat bloodwork to evaluate for possible hemolysis.

                                                10 minutes after vaccination had a large localized site reaction. Was kept at the hospital to be watched for approximately 45 minutes.  12 hours later night sweats, headache, site reaction cleared up.  8 days later (1/14/21) site became red, hot, and very inflamed. I had a similar reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine in September so I immediately contacted my allergist. I immediately took prednisone as instructed by my doctor and went in for an appointment. About 4 hours after the new site reaction, joint pain and malaise began. I&#39;m continuing on a steroid regimen for treatment.   Today 1/16/21 I am still having joint pain and swelling. Site on my arm is mostly cleared up.

                                                Around 10:00-11:00 pm on 03/02/2021, I woke up with extreme soreness on left arm bicep (where injection was received and all over bicep). I kept waking up about every hour will chills and sweats as well as muscle and joint aches. From this time until approximately 7am, I used the restroom and urinated approximately 5 times. On an average night, I may use the restroom/urinate once at the most around 5-6AM.  This is usually only because the dog wakes me up to let her out at that time. At approximately 4am I took 40 mg (two 20mg pills) of DextroAmp-Amphet.  At 7am I attempted to shower for work. During my shower I couldn?t barely lift my arm to wash with out severe soreness. I also became very dizzy and nauseous. I had to get out and sit in front of the toilet because I thought I would vomit. Fortunately I did not. I then proceeded to crawl back into bed and call in to work (notifying them I was too sick to come in). I had extreme chills, muscle aches, and joint pain. I began to cry from hurting so bad. At approximately 7:45 I took 400mg of ibuprofen to help relieve symptoms. My body felt feverish (hot/clammy).  Around 8am I mustered up the strength to get dressed due to extreme chills. I then proceeded to eat a banana, peach yogurt, and a blueberry Benvita breakfast bar package with 4 wafers.  I then took a nap and have been laying in bed ever since until approximately 4:30 PM (with the exception of getup twice to urinate). My body hurt so bad, I barely moved. At approximately 4:30PM I got up to get orange juice and take 600 mg of ibuprofen.

                                                Of course I had side effects like aches, bone pain (mainly spine and sternum), kidney pain, abdominal pain, sweating with no fever, etc. But none of that is an adverse effect.  The adverse effect happened when I was taking a shower 45 hours after my second vaccine. I was starting to feel better at this point. I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I quickly turned off my shower and sat down. I would have passed out had I not focused to not. I felt nauseous, lost my hearing and started to lose my sight. After I was ok, my lips were blue/Gray. I don&#39;t pass out. I&#39;ve passed out twice in my life when I was much younger. That&#39;s how I knew what was happening. I&#39;m scared this will happen again and I don&#39;t know what this means.

                                                3 hours post vaccine, extreme arm pain. Couldn?t lift my arm to get my sweater off. By 10pm I had extreme chills (shaking so hard my jaw locked from being so tense). Sharp shooting pain in my right leg started (still sore today). I then had extreme muscle aches, I could hardly walk to the bathroom. Finally at 12:15 am I took Tylenol.  Was able to sleep until 4 am and woke up with all the same symptoms... still extreme. Kidney pain started around 6am.  I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep until 10am. Woke up feeling just as bad- couldn?t eat. Went back to sleep. Woke up at noon with a headache on top of the rest and had to take ibuprofen (I didn?t want to exceed the allowed amount of acetaminophen in 24 hrs). Kidney pain continued, muscle aches as well. Chills went away around 4pm.  Woke up today feeling pretty good except the headache and kidney pain. Headache subsided around noon. Noticed a giant, raised, hot spot about an inch below vaccine sore tonight... assuming it?s ?Covid arm? . Super strange! Thankful for the vaccine, but dang- I?ve never had any kind of reaction from any vaccine, ever. I get my flu shot yearly.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

She was pretty much herself on morning of 2/13/2021 - got up, had shower.  caregivers noted her extremities were cool and face was red.  temp was 97.4.  She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.  CPR was continued until family could be reached and decision was made to stop resuscitation.

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

I then felt very sick to my stomach and threw up. After that the chills went away but I felt extremely hot. In the morning my body was VERY sore especially around my kidneys. I also have a headache and feel weak.

                                                Received vaccine Thursday afternoon. Waited for a half hour after receiving the vaccine, as there is a history of anaphylaxis. On the drive home lips began to swell and the lips felt numb. Patient went home and took some Benadryl which seemed to help.  Friday 3/5  Patient woke and her arm was swollen at the injection site and was very painful. Patient also complained of a headache at that time. Later that same day, Patient developed a rash at the injection site and intense itching all over her body including her face. Patient went to the Medical Center ER. At ER the staff evaluated her and administered IV steroids and Benadryl and sent her home with instructions to return in worsens. Saturday Patient complained that her throat began swelling and so she went back to the ER. The  ER gave more IV steroids and Benadryl, a breathing treatment (nebulizer), and gave 2 doses of epinephrine. Due to Patient&#39;s continued symptoms and gradual worsening condition the medical provider at ER felt  it necessary for Patient to be admitted, however, due to the smaller size and limited resources at ER it was decided for Patient to be transported to Hospital. Patient has remained admitted at Hospital since then, and yesterday (Sunday) she required another dose of epinephrine due to tongue swelling.  Patient reports that she is being given IV Benadryl and steroids, and she will not be discharged today. Today Patient is also reporting a burning sensation with urination.

The back/kidney pain was excruciating and my thirst for water was extreme. The kidney pain and fever responded to treatment with Tylenol with codeine, then resolved on its own after 24 hours. The fatigue lingered until the 72-hour mark.

                                                My kidneys began bleeding a little less than 24 hours after my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. I realized this because I had a large amount of blood in my urine. My particular kidney disease will cause my antibodies to fight my kidneys when I am sick and I will urinate blood. The second shot caused this to happen and I have been urinating blood for over 24 hours. 3 days is typical when I have an occurrence. I haven&#39;t had one of these occurrences in over a year or 2.
