I work as a PA and had to go home early the day after receiving the second does with flu like symptoms; chills, aches and pains.  Later in the day I immediately started experiencing blood in my urination and ulcers within my vagina.  I do not have any form of an STD.  I went to Urology and discovered six kidney stones.  I am in tremendous health and exercise daily.  I have never had issues with my kidneys.  Lastly, I had a rash on my arm with first and second dose.

I developed what I thought was just a UTI on Thursday and was prescribed the medication to treat that. For the next few days I was sore, had body aches, and chills. On Sunday I noticed the outbreak on my labia and went into Urgent Care to diagnose it. I haven&#39;t been aware of any HSV-1 in my system, but somehow I ended up getting HSV-1 all around my genitals. On Sunday i was prescribed Valacyclovir. I was in intense pain when using the restroom for both urinating and bowel movements. I went to my primary care doctor on Monday to have a second opinion and found the same answers. I missed work for two days due to the pain I was in and my inability to walk. I then had to work from home the rest of the week. My partner has been tested and does not have HSV-1 or 2.

I called 911 and asked for an ambulance because of difficulty breathing. Arrived at Hospital Center ER around 5:00am, given oxygen and several tests (blood, urine, EKG) and also IV fluids in my left arm. Vomited a second time around 8:00am. Continued difficulty breathing until around 11:00am and chest pain improved somewhat. Got chest x rays done and monitored until I could breathe more regularly without oxygen. Discharged around 12:26pm. Heartbeat was abnormally fast for this whole duration and did not return to resting heart rate until about 5:00pm later that evening, 24 hours after vaccine. All symptoms subsided within 48 hours. Diagnosis was nonspecific chest pain and UTI.

                                                On the fourth of May, evening after the second shot, I started to get body aches and a sharp pain in the injection site. So I took some Aleve and went to bed early at 9:00pm. At 3:00am I woke up with vomiting, diarrhea, a fever of 102.2, chills and worse body aches. I threw up everything I tried to drink, even water and Vitamin Water. Trying to eat anything produced the same result. I live alone, so I thought I was prepared for getting sick, but it just kept going on for days. I called an ambulance Friday morning when vomiting and nausea still had not passed. I wasn&#39;t having diarrhea anymore, but I wasn&#39;t keeping anything down, so that&#39;s probably why. My urine was brown and sticky, I had dropped weight and was missing multiple days of work. I was given Zofran IV and fluid IV in the ambulance, first bag of three. The ER gave me two bags of fluid before I could produce a urine sample, which was very dark orange. Then &#34;one more for the road&#34; as they said. They did a CT scan of my abdomen with and without contrast. They prescribed Zofran. The next day I went back to the ER with more nausea and vomiting, severe stomach and abdominal pain, and still dark orange urine. I was taking the Zofran as prescribed, and the also prescribed Prilosec.

My arm was immediately hot and tender after administration. The area around the injection site had less feeling than the rest of my arm - it felt almost numb. My arm was very sore and warm the rest of the evening. I began having fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain last night as well. I woke up around 6 this morning and the room was spinning. I was also nauseous. I tried to roll over in bed but was unable to feel my arms and legs. I was also temporarily unable to see. Right after, I passed out and lost urinary continence. I regained consciousness a minute later and had normal functioning again. I have not had any more dizziness today but am still sore and fatigued.

                                                The patient did report swelling, induration and pain at the injection site. The patient  reports onset of headache, fever of 100.6, chills, body aches, night sweats, and malaise within a couple of hours of receiving dose 2 of her Covid 19 vaccine.  Due to how she felt, she went to bed soon after, and slept until the next morning. Upon waking up she noticed resolution of all her symptoms except for night sweats, and malaise.  She continued feeling hot and having night sweats but did not appreciate having a fever.  She also reports  the onset of significant facial swelling, periorbital swelling and swelling of her hands and feet, basically her entire body.  She also reports an onset of &#34;foul smelling&#34; diarrhea.  Her chronic eczematous areas which are her eyebrows, posterior neck, and scalp became more itchy and flaking and peeling.  She developed new areas of eczema and itching over her torso located at her mid axillary areas from her braline down to her waist area.  She also reports the onset of browniish red/ amber colored urine since receiving the vaccine. She continued to flake and peel over her eyebrows and cheeks in  continuously and in large amounts for the next 10 days.  She reports taking no antihistamines, or antipyretics.  She went to urgent care and was treated with 0.5% clobetasol cream which after 2 applications to her face caused a chemical, sun burn like reaction and more severe swelling over her cheeks and periorbital areas.  A photo shows that her left eye was so swollen it was half closed and the skin color was purplish. She returned to urgent care on March 11, 2021 and was prescribed a medrol dose pak.  She started it right away and her facial swelling improved.   On March 13 she came to see me.  with improvement in her swelling, peeling and flaking.   She was noted to have a fever of 101.6, then it was 100.6 after recheck and finally 99.6 before the end of her appointment.   It isn&#39;t clear whether her temp decreased because her medrol taken earlier that morning had kicked in or by removing her sweatshirt and being out of the sun allowed her to sweat and decrease her core body temperture to that level.She was asked to continue checking her temp which she reported as 99.8 on March 13, 100.6 on March 14, and 100.5 on March 15.  She has been instructed to check her temp everyday for the next 14 days.  Her urinedipstick showed 1&#43; bilirubin and ketones with trace blood and all other indicators were negative.  Patient was sent for stat bloodwork to evaluate for possible hemolysis.

I vomited my dinner in the evening. Then next day, my lower back pain increased and I was bedridden. I figured my kidneys were hurting me. I couldn&#39;t stomach anything until about mid-day. Finally, just a piece of toast. I have no issues with urination, but I noticed a decrease in urination especially for the next following days. It took me about a week to get back to my normal routine.

                                                Within 24 hours of receiving the second dose of Moderna, I was peeing blood. It started out as a light pink and turned darker throughout the day. I went to the doctors and was given a CBC, Complete Metabolic Panel, and Urinalysis that was sent to the lab. Everything came back normal-no infection, kidney function looked great, etc. The visible signs in my blood lasted three days. I went to the doctor 6 days later and there was still microscopic evidence of blood, but no visible amounts. Since all tests were normal, they told me not to worry about it.

                                                6 pm the night of vaccine - fatigue; body pain; headaches and low grade fever. These were the exact same symptoms I had for COVID but at about 75%  as bad  and that lasted until the exact same time the next day, 24 hours. And then I started having kidney pain the end of January and the beginning of February and I was also having stomach  pain. I saw my doctor and the doctor ran a Metabolic panel - my kidney function was lower. No treatment. Just not taking NSAIDS and I&#39;m drinking more water. My kidney function is back to before the first shot levels - I&#39;m back up to 70- which is my normal. Currently I&#39;m experiencing with Gastroparesis - it may be post viral from having COVID. It started getting really bad in February. It showed I had delayed stomach emptying.  I first tried Reglan - it didn&#39;t help and made me feel kind of weird. Other than that, I have changed my diet and drink liquids only for food. Take a lot of anti-nausea and vomiting medication. It seems to be flaring up less now so I think I&#39;m coming out of it. It&#39;s difficult to know if it&#39;s helping. For kidneys, I am recovered to back to normal. I am dealing with something that may be autoimmune - I&#39;m being tested for lupus. My grandma had lupus and so it may be a possibility for me. I think the kidney issue was more vaccination orientated.  I had a bag of fluid at work - as I was badly dehydrated - so that was like an Urgent care visit except Urgent care was closed - that was June 8th.  Note: my second COVID vaccine was February 20th, 2021.

Increased heart rate of 120-150 continued for a couple of hours with minimal dizziness. About 5am, I had a bought of sudden explosive, watery stool. This continued 3 more times in the am, at times having incontinence. (This has never occurred before.) By 10 am, those symptoms had stopped. Only residual side effects were a headache and sore arm. On 12/31, it was noticed that I had hives on my abdomen and back. They were not itchy and I am unsure how long they had been there for; referred to allergy

Went to Hospital and was diagnosed with kidney stones (one 3mm and one 4mm on the right side), however the imagine done did not show they had left the kidney. Was discharged same day with ibuprofen (600mg) and Flomax (0.4mg; 7 days). 4/23-5/4/21 - pain continued on and off, spiking severely on 5/4. Blood in urine stopped being visible to human eye on 4/25/21. 5/7/21 Met with Dr. PA, to discuss continuing symptoms. Urinalysis in showed microscopic levels of blood were still present in urine. Sent to get scans and received a script for naproxen sodium (220mg) to take instead of ibuprofen, 5/17/21 - Imaging results from 5/13 (u/s of kidney) and 5/14 (KUB x-ray) confirmed a 6mm triangular calcium stone in the ureter, causing urine to back up into the kidney. 5/26/21 - Underwent a uteroscopy with the intent of a laser lithotripsy to remove the stone, however noticeable bacteria was present, so instead a stent was implanted and the kidney stone was left alone as to prevent sepsis. Sent home with flomax (0.4mg; 30 days and Cipro (500mg, 2x/day, 5 days) and told to take advil/aleve and tylenol for pain. Tentatively scheduled to go back in to remove the stent and the stone in early June.

                                                I was 30 &#43; 2 weeks at the time of my second Moderna vaccine. My due date is 4/22/2021. Pregnancy has been uneventful until the second Moderna vaccine. At 3:00 am (14 hours post vaccine), I woke up with the urge to go to the bathroom. I went, urinated, and had a small amount of diarrhea. I laid back down and within 30 second had urge to go again. I repeated this six times back to back. I began to have severe lower abdominal cramping and could not sleep again. I didn&#39;t know if I had to urinate or defecate but the urge was extremely severe and constant. My temperature began to rise, and I was shaking/aching severely. I took 500 mg tylenol at 5:45 am and that kept my temperature around 99.5 (normal 97.5).  Around 7:30 am I called my OB and they told me to go to emergency/labor and delivery ward of the hospital. At this time, my diarrhea and urge to defecate to stop and it turned to a constant urge to urinate with near constant, severe, lower abdominal cramping. At the labor and delivery ward, they monitored the baby (stable and moving the whole time), did a fetal fibronectin (normal), did a CBC (normal except preexisting mild anemia), and a urinalysis (normal). Hospital determined I was not in labor and did not have UTI so they sent me home. I continued to have temperature raises (up to 100.4 but always took tylenol at this point), severe lethargy, no appetite, severe abdominal cramping, constant urge to urinate, severe shaking, etc. until approximately 8 or 9 pm that evening (32 hours post vaccine). Everything except the constant urge to urinate resolved. Three days post vaccine (evening of 2/15/2021), I began to urinate large blood clots. I scheduled an appointment with my OB for a repeat urinalysis and urine culture. I had the appointment on 2/16/2021 and the only abnormality was hematuria. Urine culture was negative. Doctor prescribed 7 days of antibiotics just in case (while waiting for urine culture). My symptoms finally resolved on 2/19/2021 (7 days after vaccination), with slow improvement after urinating the large blood clots. I have not had any symptoms since then and my baby appears healthy still in utero. I have no history of UTIs.

                                                10 minutes after vaccination had a large localized site reaction. Was kept at the hospital to be watched for approximately 45 minutes.  12 hours later night sweats, headache, site reaction cleared up.  8 days later (1/14/21) site became red, hot, and very inflamed. I had a similar reaction to the pneumococcal vaccine in September so I immediately contacted my allergist. I immediately took prednisone as instructed by my doctor and went in for an appointment. About 4 hours after the new site reaction, joint pain and malaise began. I&#39;m continuing on a steroid regimen for treatment.   Today 1/16/21 I am still having joint pain and swelling. Site on my arm is mostly cleared up.

                                                Around 10:00-11:00 pm on 03/02/2021, I woke up with extreme soreness on left arm bicep (where injection was received and all over bicep). I kept waking up about every hour will chills and sweats as well as muscle and joint aches. From this time until approximately 7am, I used the restroom and urinated approximately 5 times. On an average night, I may use the restroom/urinate once at the most around 5-6AM.  This is usually only because the dog wakes me up to let her out at that time. At approximately 4am I took 40 mg (two 20mg pills) of DextroAmp-Amphet.  At 7am I attempted to shower for work. During my shower I couldn?t barely lift my arm to wash with out severe soreness. I also became very dizzy and nauseous. I had to get out and sit in front of the toilet because I thought I would vomit. Fortunately I did not. I then proceeded to crawl back into bed and call in to work (notifying them I was too sick to come in). I had extreme chills, muscle aches, and joint pain. I began to cry from hurting so bad. At approximately 7:45 I took 400mg of ibuprofen to help relieve symptoms. My body felt feverish (hot/clammy).  Around 8am I mustered up the strength to get dressed due to extreme chills. I then proceeded to eat a banana, peach yogurt, and a blueberry Benvita breakfast bar package with 4 wafers.  I then took a nap and have been laying in bed ever since until approximately 4:30 PM (with the exception of getup twice to urinate). My body hurt so bad, I barely moved. At approximately 4:30PM I got up to get orange juice and take 600 mg of ibuprofen.

Then I I had urine colored like strong tea from the next morning, and the urine color had been like strong tea for 3 days. I am now feeling better, but still not fully recovered. I feel headache and dizzy sometimes.  I think the tea color urine is caused as a side effect of the vaccine. But I hardly read anything about this side effect happened to anyone by taking COVID-19 vaccine. And I think the tea color is consisted of broken red blood cells.

About midnight I woke up in cold sweats, I had a fever (101-102) over the course of two days I got up to 104. I took Tylenol and drank fluids. I didn&#39;t take Ibuprofen because it effects your kidneys. After the two days I felt terrible, after the second day my urine was dark color and a few days you could tell there was blood in my urine. I contacted my Dr. we did lab work. My GFR originally was 97 (prior to vaccine) and post vaccine was 74.  About day 10 I started to feel better. About two weeks after I re-did lab work and my GFR went back to normal and urine went back to normal as well.

                                                Severe aphthous ulcers formed on the labia.  First noticed at 4am on April 24 (2 days after the vaccine on April 22 and on April 23 I had felt achy and fatigued which had passed by the time the ulcers started to appear).  The ulcers rapidly grew and were in full &#34;bloom&#34; about 36 hours from first noticing them.  There were 4 areas of ulcers: 2 of them on the interior of the vaginal wall near the opening that were about an inch in diameter/length and 2 other smaller patches on the exterior labia minora.  For the first several days there was also extreme swelling of the entire area.  During this time and in particular the first couple of days pain from the ulcers was extreme - the evening of April 25 I was completely unable to sleep.  On April 26 I went to see a gynecologist who diagnosed them as aphthous ulcers based on my history of having these before and tests I have had in the past to rule out other possible diagnoses (A biopsy to check for cancer, STD tests including swabbing the ulcer to test for herpes). She prescribed medication for pain management  (lidocaine jelly, a small amount of narcotic to help me get through the worst of it) and a Medrol pack in hopes it may help accelerate the healing time.  For the first 2.5 weeks urinating was extremely painful.  After 3 weeks I could urinate relatively comfortably and I started being able to ride my Peloton bike 1-2 times a week for 30 minutes (formerly 6 days a week for at least 30 minutes).  The large ulcers are still healing almost 4 weeks later.  I&#39;m not sure when my husband and I will be able to have sex again.

                                                I had a little bit of pain - like a tetanus shot when I first got the shot. That lasted overnight. I took Tylenol after the shot. Then about two weeks after, I had pain that felt like kidney stones (which run in my family). My mom got me to ER. They told me it was my appendix - in my lower right quadrant from back to front. I was tested for COVID and it was positive result but I was asymptomatic. I ate lunch and then it got really bad and I had surgery about 05:00 pm. on March 27th. It felt like I did a million sit-ups after the surgery. Everything checked out okay in follow up visit. I&#39;m still not doing running at full strength - breathing isn&#39;t quite back to normal with my distance running. I can do 1 and 1/2 miles but if I try to do more, I get more easily winded. It&#39;s slowly getting better. I was 10 days in isolation after the surgery because of the COVID diagnosis. Had a COVID test after the quarantine and it was negative results (had it done at the fairgrounds on 4/7/2021)

Had difficulty sleeping over night and bizarre dreams when I did fall asleep. Wednesday had moderate symptoms all day - fatigue, dizziness, body aches, joint pain, chills and hot flashes (no fever), nausea, and headache. Thursday morning (1/28), symptoms were more mild, but noticed urine was dark. By early afternoon, urine had gotten much more dark and looked to be blood in urine. Went to OB provider who confirmed blood in urine and urine sent out for culture, no infection found. Unknown cause of blood in urine. Headache has continued since 1/27, worse in the morning.

                                                Of course I had side effects like aches, bone pain (mainly spine and sternum), kidney pain, abdominal pain, sweating with no fever, etc. But none of that is an adverse effect.  The adverse effect happened when I was taking a shower 45 hours after my second vaccine. I was starting to feel better at this point. I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I quickly turned off my shower and sat down. I would have passed out had I not focused to not. I felt nauseous, lost my hearing and started to lose my sight. After I was ok, my lips were blue/Gray. I don&#39;t pass out. I&#39;ve passed out twice in my life when I was much younger. That&#39;s how I knew what was happening. I&#39;m scared this will happen again and I don&#39;t know what this means.

                                                First it started with the arm pain, then a headache, internal fever, chills and a lot of pain throughout the body, mainly the pain in my back and my lower back. Through the area of ??the kidneys and the pelvis. The intense pain lasted about midnight, I took a pill of TYLENOL for pain and to be able to sleep, which helped me a bit but the next day the body and back pain persisted ... what hurt the most was my lower back and I could not bear to lie down in any way so I remained semi-lying or sitting in bed because when I lay down my back bothered me. I took natural teas to help me and I took water and electrolytes to feel better. gradually by the end of the second day my pain symptoms were decreasing. The dizziness in the head remained very persistent on the 2nd day. On the third day I felt a relief from my muscle pain but the discomfort or dizziness of the head was still there, it was not as strong as the last days, but when moving my head from side to side or sitting or standing up it was like a vertigo or a unstable that I felt was there. By the 4th day I felt better almost no symptoms just like body sweat ... like hot flashes.

The ER took urine tests and confirmed that blood was present in my urine - my urine was red in color. They did a CT scan of my lower abdomen. No kidney stones or other obstructions or damage were seen.  My temperature went up to 99 degrees. I was treated with antibiotics and discharged. No pain, just slightly elevated temperature and the blood in my urine. The blood in my urine subsided 24 hours after the hospital visit. I was left feeling very fatigued and it was hard to stay awake. Over a week later, I still have low energy levels. My GP said to report this.

When she goes to ER they say go to PCP. Her depression is rapidly increasing, her ability to function is rapidly declining.  I am significantly concerned and do not know what else to do.  Symptoms started after first vaccine, but were relatively mild.  Increase in symptoms and intensity following second vaccine. One MD put her on steroids.  Then a few days later another took her off steroids.  She&#39;s been treated for a UTI, a sinus infection, you name it.  There does not seem to be any consensus on what the cause of her symptomology is but it is definitely tied to vaccination time frame.

                                                Patient was fine immediately after vaccination. She left our vaccination room to sit down and wait 15 minutes and for some reason did not sit down, but kept walking, then proceeded to lay herself down in an aisle of the store. She says she passed out. I only witnessed her being awake. She urinated herself. She asked for a pillow and cold wash cloth. We got her those. We tried to get her a snack and a juice, but she didn&#39;t take those. I had a technician call an ambulance and pressed a button we have that calls the police as well. The police arrived first. The ambulance crew took her out into their truck to be evaluated and said she was fine, but had her mom come pick her up because they just didn&#39;t want her to drive. She did tell me before I gave her the shot that she passes out from vaccines.

My heart began racing, my equilibrium was thrown off, I couldn&#39;t speak (when I did, it came out wrong, but I didn&#39;t realize it), I couldn&#39;t walk or move my fingers, and my vision was blurred. I ended up urinating on myself. My supervisor wheeled me down to the ER. They had me to sit in a chair for a long time and monitored my heart. I had taken a Xanax, so my heart rate had slowed down by that time. The doctor was a little upset about me taking it because he wanted to know my heart rate prior to taking the med. I was there for about 3 hours while they monitored me, and I was well enough to be released. I didn&#39;t feel great for about 4 or 5 days, but then I was back to myself. I decided not the get the 2nd dose.

                                                3 hours post vaccine, extreme arm pain. Couldn?t lift my arm to get my sweater off. By 10pm I had extreme chills (shaking so hard my jaw locked from being so tense). Sharp shooting pain in my right leg started (still sore today). I then had extreme muscle aches, I could hardly walk to the bathroom. Finally at 12:15 am I took Tylenol.  Was able to sleep until 4 am and woke up with all the same symptoms... still extreme. Kidney pain started around 6am.  I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep until 10am. Woke up feeling just as bad- couldn?t eat. Went back to sleep. Woke up at noon with a headache on top of the rest and had to take ibuprofen (I didn?t want to exceed the allowed amount of acetaminophen in 24 hrs). Kidney pain continued, muscle aches as well. Chills went away around 4pm.  Woke up today feeling pretty good except the headache and kidney pain. Headache subsided around noon. Noticed a giant, raised, hot spot about an inch below vaccine sore tonight... assuming it?s ?Covid arm? . Super strange! Thankful for the vaccine, but dang- I?ve never had any kind of reaction from any vaccine, ever. I get my flu shot yearly.

A few hours later the painful and extreme/ non stop gas/explosive diarrhea started. Nothing helps. I?ve been eating Imodium like candy. It does nothing to help. I have prescribed anti nausea msds for my migraines and they don?t help. I?ve only had water in two days and haven?t been able to pee in two days. It?s all coming out as the runs. About every 20 minutes. I know my body. This isn?t something I ate. This is the vaccine. I?m so dehydrated because nothing will not stay in me. I tried eating a slice of plain bread and a banana and it was out in 15 minutes.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

                                                Since the first adverse anaphylactic reaction I have been having squeezing chest pain weakness shortness of breath racing heart, hypertension, and a series of mysteries vascular issues and ?blood marks? (I?m not sure the right term, but I have a ton of pictures). On June 18th 2021 the most severe appeared mysteriously on the back of my leg behind my right knee (I was previously bitten by a tick years ago and treated for Lyme w/ this same knee - and it was suggested there could be a connection and maybe my immune system did not fully recover - but this is the weakest area of my body). There was no plausible cause for what an orthopedist described as a hamstring hematoma protruding the size of a golf ball. I had ultrasounds of both legs that day to check and make sure it was not blood clots. I was told to seek additional care when my husband returned home (I was alone with my daughter and uncomfortable leaving her to go to the hospital that day - the paramedics found me a home technician to do the mobile ultrasounds)? the next day, my husband was home and took me to urgent care, where they tried to transport me to the hospital via ambulance. We elected not to go then and discussed the symptoms with my cardiologist, neurologist, and orthopedist who all advised me to go to the hospital. I decided to go for an outpatient visit with the orthopedist to take a look at my leg. Things were a bit blurry at that time because I was experiencing a lot more than just leg pain. A home physical therapist came to see me the next day I believe (I kept a diary of medication taken symptoms etc because I was afraid I might die after all these strange symptoms but still averse from going to the hospital thinking it was just panic attacks)? The home PT came and took my BP and called 911. I was taken to allegedly to be stabilized and transported to .  found a UTI and discharged me with Keflex. The next day I ended up back in the hospital this time  and discharged with Nitroglycerin. Shortly thereafter collapsed again and hospitalized again admitted to  Cardiac.

She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.

While I was there I broke out in a cold sweat. I finished up and sat down on the stool we have. I sit there for a while, my ears ringing and I realize that I can&#39;t see, and the next thing I know I&#39;m on the floor and my head hurts where it hit it on the floor. The pain in my kidney area gets worse but about an hour later, subsides quickly. I went back to bed for a while and slept it off.

Rashes, red, itchy and raised, on my wrists started after 2nd shot, alternating on and off. One time on my neck and onto face. Then a rash on my right upper arm,  had stopped about 5 days ago. but today a new one on my wrist started. Pain in my arms on and off, and new pain started today in my left arm , before the rash started.

                                                My joint pain the first night was debilitatingly severe and I spiked a fever which finally broke overnight that Saturday.  I was drinking lots of fluids, so when I started peeing more than usual on Saturday I didn&#39;t think much of it.  It got worse on Sunday, but there was no pain.  The pain finally started today, along with a little blood.  I went to the doctor and the test confirmed I have a UTI.  There are red and white blood cells in my urine, and the hyaline casts were high enough that it flagged them too.  Normally, I would not have reported this but the timing was very strange and based on the severity of my joint pain the night of, it is not just a weird coincidence.  I was not experiencing any urinary symptoms before the vaccine. I found that there have been others during the study who experienced UTI&#39;s following vaccination with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and although the study determined no correlation, I thought it important to report it. With me, for reasons no one seems to understand, my kidneys react to my allergens before anything else does. I&#39;m assuming that is why I am having the UTI issue right now, although no bacteria got flagged in my sample.

Because I am allergic to Dexamethasone, there were two nurses watching me and I had to wait for 30minutes prior to leaving. Within a few hours, I had extreme fatigue, worsening migraines, rapid heart rate and difficulty breathing, fever, chills, and nausea. I was in bed for about 48hours with a fever over 102F before taking tylenol to reduce symptoms. I had lingering migraines for a week post 2nd dose, and rapid heart rate for about 2-3 weeks before it subsided. I also had a bladder infection that wasn&#39;t diagnosed until about a month later

                                                On 12/28/2020 at 1930 I had a throbbing HA, nausea, chills, no appetite, body aches, extreme fatigue and low grade fever. Temp was 99.4-100.3. 1 gram of Tylenol was taken that evening, to relieve HA pain. Zofran 4 mg ODT was also taken for nausea. The following morning,  I felt extremely fatigued and had a persistent headache that was not consistently responsive to OTC meds. I developed a fever on 12/29/2020 in the evening. Low grade and ranging 99.3-100.6. Along with fever, my s/s were extreme fatigue, no appetite, headache, body aches, chills. On 12/30/2020, I spiked a Tmax of 101.0 around 11 am. Again, the same s/s were there. I went home from work early.  Same s/s and low grade fever persisted past 7 days, so I called my PCP as well as the Pharmacy where I received the vaccine. On the 10th day after vaccination, I notified my Infectious Disease Dr. He advised me to wait 6 months to 1 year to receive the second injection. He stated that my s/s were likely vaccine related and would go away with time. Fever persists through every day for the month of January 2021, with exact same symptoms. Started to notice Shortness of breath with activity, occasional sharp pain in chest. Presented to ER on 01/09/2021 with chest pain and shortness of breath. Labs revealed Acute Kidney Injury and Transaminitis. Cardiac work-up was performed, all tests negative. I was hypotensive. MD recommended I either get transferred to hospital, or stay in ER for min 23 hours observation for monitoring of kidney function and blood pressure. I received 2 L of Normal Saline. BP eventually began to rise with SBP above 90 and DBP above 40. (Normal BP range for me is 120/60-70&#39;s. Baseline Creatinine is 0.9. Discharged from ER per patient request, after second Creatinine level came down to 1.5. MD advised patient to not return to work for the next 2 business days. Spoke with PCP on 1/11/2021 in AM, and informed him of the events over the weekend. Also informed him that I am still febrile with same symptoms as reported previously. Was told I could not return to work until I was fever free. Was fever free for about 12 hours, until evening of 1/12/2021. MD not allow patient to RTW.

                                                Starting at 9pm I got uncontrollable chills to the point where my whole body was shaking. I pulled multiple blankets on me but could not get warm. I then felt very sick to my stomach and threw up. After that the chills went away but I felt extremely hot. In the morning my body was VERY sore especially around my kidneys. I also have a headache and feel weak.

                                                Received vaccine Thursday afternoon. Waited for a half hour after receiving the vaccine, as there is a history of anaphylaxis. On the drive home lips began to swell and the lips felt numb. Patient went home and took some Benadryl which seemed to help.  Friday 3/5  Patient woke and her arm was swollen at the injection site and was very painful. Patient also complained of a headache at that time. Later that same day, Patient developed a rash at the injection site and intense itching all over her body including her face. Patient went to the Medical Center ER. At ER the staff evaluated her and administered IV steroids and Benadryl and sent her home with instructions to return in worsens. Saturday Patient complained that her throat began swelling and so she went back to the ER. The  ER gave more IV steroids and Benadryl, a breathing treatment (nebulizer), and gave 2 doses of epinephrine. Due to Patient&#39;s continued symptoms and gradual worsening condition the medical provider at ER felt  it necessary for Patient to be admitted, however, due to the smaller size and limited resources at ER it was decided for Patient to be transported to Hospital. Patient has remained admitted at Hospital since then, and yesterday (Sunday) she required another dose of epinephrine due to tongue swelling.  Patient reports that she is being given IV Benadryl and steroids, and she will not be discharged today. Today Patient is also reporting a burning sensation with urination.

Has a history of Sjogren&#39;s syndrome and has never had prior extraocular or extraoral manifestations of Sjogren&#39;s.

                                                I am a nurse practitioner, so as a healthcare worker, I received a very early vaccine. I have had little time to report what happened to me but not that it remains an issue I think I need to do so.  I had a very serious initial reaction and am now having chronic problems likely related to my vaccine. I received my first dose of Moderna 12/27/20 at POD lot# 025J20A and my second dose 1/24/21 at POD lot#029L20A.  After the first vaccine within a few hours I had significant injection site and arm pain. By the time I went to bed that night I could barely lift my arm over my head it was so stiff and warm. The arm was very painful, and I required Ibuprofen 800 mg TID for 3 days to control the pain. I did not have systemic symptoms from the first vaccine. After the second vaccine, within hours I had systemic symptoms of fatigue, generalized aches in my muscles and severe arm pain in the injection arm. I received the vaccine in the afternoon. I went to bed that night and woke up suddenly at 3 am, about 14 hours later. I had severe myalgias and rigors. I was barely able to move. I was not able to walk or perform fine or gross motor tasks without difficulty. I was unable to dress myself or get up to go to the bathroom. I required almost fulltime care from my husband for three days. On day 4 I developed severe headaches nausea and vomiting. The muscles still ached but I was able to walk and move again. My fine motor was still impaired for a total of 7 days. I was out of work for 8 days and did not feel 100% well for 12-14 days after the vaccine. As the symptoms started to resolve on day 5, I believe I had a mild case of Rhabdomyolysis as my urine was very dark almost brown and there was sediment in the toilet. There was no blood in my urine and no dysuria. I did a urine dip at work and it had protein and ketones but no bacteria. The specific gravity was very concentrated. I did not check my renal function at that time. My renal function a few weeks later was normal Cr 0.88. GFR 85. The dark urine and sediment lasted for about 2-3 days. I was drinking lots of water through this time-period and during then I was very ill. I was not seen at a hospital and rather I treated myself at home. During the above week was the first time I ever had neck or back pain. It did subside but I still had a dull aching in my neck after all of this. I had two episodes, one in late January and one in mid-February of left neck being very sensitive to touch, felt warm, and my ear was very hypersensitive to touch as well. It felt almost like shingles but there was never a rash and I took Acyclovir 800 mg TID for 3-5 days without relief. It subsided each time after about 7 days. This was on the same side of my body on the left as the vaccine was. In the end of March 2021 I began with left trapezoid pain in the same side of the body. I had some numbness in that arm as well so I saw orthopedics and received an MRI of my left brachial plexus which showed C3-4, C4-5, and C6-7 disc herniations that had not been present before. If the herniations were present in the past they were acutely inflamed by the inflammatory process the vaccine caused in my body. The MRI also showed significant and specifically left cervical and left axillary adenopathy this being the side of my vaccine. The pain spread beyond my trapezoid and become progressively worse into my neck and upper back only on the left side. The entire left side of my spine both cervical and thoracic was painful but the right side unaffected. It was very sharp nerve like pain shooting and running up into my head and anterior neck. Another MRI was done of the full cervical spine this time confirming these same herniations, but the discs appear to be pulling to the left with isolated left inflammatory process. The nerve pain became so severe that last week I began having numbness in that left arm and numbness into the left side of my face. A stat MRI of my brain only shows T2 flare pattern consistent with sequela of an inflammatory process of unknown origin. The foraminal stenosis at these spinal levels are very mild and do not explain my symptoms very well. Spine specialist reports that there can be symptoms of this nature but usually not with this mild of a pathology. The facial numbness has been identified as a trigeminal neuropathy of cervical origin but is rarely documented in medical journals and not seen by these spine specialists. There is a very significant amount of left sided nerve over stimulation, inflammation and adenopathy that is not explained. I have never had any spine or neck pain in my life before this and I have no history of traumatic events to explain this sudden change in my condition. I truly feel that ever since I received the Moderna vaccine and had that very severe reaction, my body has been in a constant inflammatory phase and there has been nerve pain in and around only the left upper side of my body where the vaccine was placed. I am scheduled on Monday for epidural spinal injections as I have been unable to find pain relief with any other therapies including dry needling, physical therapy, traction, tramadol, muscle relaxers, oral steroid bursts, etc. I know this may be a very strange and unique case, but I can say confidently that I believe the vaccine stimulated this entire cascade of events. If someone could please contact me related to this, I would appreciate it.

On 6/15/21, patient&#39;s significant other discovered patient in bed, not breathing, with ashen appearance, uncertain how long it had been since patient was last breathing.  EMS was contacted, CPR was given and patient was transferred to Emergency Department at the hospital.  Diagnosis of Cardiologist is cardiac arrest, NSTEMI (suspects type 2).  Per cardiologist, patient appears to exhibit cardiomyopathy, etiology difficult to ascertain (patient&#39;s family/acquaintances have endorsed periodic use by patient of anabolic steroids in the past, making it more difficult to rule out source of cardiomyopathy. ). Physicians involved are reporting this case in the event that this may be a case of vaccine-induced myocarditis, although no diagnosis as such has been made.

I have had terrible muscle/body aches and pain at the site where the injection was administered. I started having pain when urinating and diarrhea. I went to the doctor (  ) where I was diagnosed with a bladder infection. I had to take antibiotics ( Bactrim ) which I just finished, starting to feel a little better but still suffering with fatigue. I also had a headache for one week after vaccine and have been taking over the counter pain medicine.

By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.

                                                My kidneys began bleeding a little less than 24 hours after my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. I realized this because I had a large amount of blood in my urine. My particular kidney disease will cause my antibodies to fight my kidneys when I am sick and I will urinate blood. The second shot caused this to happen and I have been urinating blood for over 24 hours. 3 days is typical when I have an occurrence. I haven&#39;t had one of these occurrences in over a year or 2.

                                                Received 2nd Moderna shot on 4/21 at 1pm (it is currently almost 60 hours later). I was pretty out of it just a few hours after injection, so while I dont have specific times, here are some of the side effects I&#39;ve been experiencing. Note: I had a pretty significant reaction to the first shot so expected to have the same with the second.  Arm pain - pain radiated from injection site to fingers and fluctuated from uncomfortable to almost unbearable off and on throughout the next 48 hours. Felt better if I slept with pressure on the arm itself, but once I took it off, it throbbed relentlessly. Still have swelling, redness, and tenderness almost 60 hours later.   Fever - consistent low grade fever; spiked to 103.8 and plateaued between 99 and 101 for some time. Broke after 36 hours, but returned after 48.  Brain fog and confusion - consistent for first 24 hours.   Nausea/vomiting - was not able to keep most foods down, but alleviated after 24 hours. Returned after 48 hours and continued on to 60 hours.  Swollen foot - unsure if this is direct result of vaccine, but important enough to note. Left foot was very swollen after 48 hours (same side of injection). This was after returning to work and being on my feet.  Kidney pain - experienced pain similar to passing a stone in lower left kidney area a few hours after the shot. Continued until about 24 hours after.  Joint pain - all joints tender for the first 24 hours (all knuckles, elbows, knees, ankles, wrists). I experienced this with the 1st shot as well.   Itching - whole body, moderate level itching for almost 24 hours. No rash, just sensation. Returned at 60 hour mark.  General flu like symptoms- have carried over past 48 hour mark 60 hour mark.  39/F
