Patient&#39;s son tried to call her around 3:30 or 4 and there was no answer. Son called the facility where patient resided and staff went to check on her, where they found patient on the floor, conscious. Patient was communicating fine when they found her. It is unclear if she bumped her head when she fell, but patient deteriorated and was taken to ER where a CT was done and it was determined patient had a brain bleed as well as a UTI. Patient was admitted to hospital. Patient subsequently had a stroke while in hospital. Patient was discharged to rehab facility on 02.23.2021 and while she has regained the ability to walk with a walker and some use of her right hand, she remains unable to speak.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medication history was provided). Concomitant products included ASCORBIC ACID, BETACAROTENE, COPPER, TOCOFERSOLAN, ZINC (OCUVITE [ASCORBIC ACID;BETACAROTENE;COPPER;TOCOFERSOLAN;ZINC]), ASCORBIC ACID, CALCIUM, MINERALS NOS, RETINOL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, VITAMIN B NOS, VITAMINS NOS, ZINC (CENTRUM SILVER [ASCORBIC ACID;CALCIUM;MINERALS NOS;RETINOL;TOCOPHERYL ACETATE;VITAMIN B NOS;VITAMINS NOS;ZINC]), METOPROLOL TARTRATE (METOPROLOL TARTRATE ACCORD), CLOPIDOGREL and DULOXETINE for an unknown indication, ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN 81).    On 15-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced PNEUMONIA (pneumonia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), URINARY TRACT INFECTION (urinary tract infection (UTI)) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COMMUNICATION DISORDER (talking nonsense and not being clear) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and INAPPROPRIATE SCHEDULE OF PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION (The reason the patient did not have the second dose one month from the first dose is because she got ill). At the time of the report, PNEUMONIA (pneumonia), URINARY TRACT INFECTION (urinary tract infection (UTI)), COMMUNICATION DISORDER (talking nonsense and not being clear) and INAPPROPRIATE SCHEDULE OF PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION (The reason the patient did not have the second dose one month from the first dose is because she got ill) outcome was unknown. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       While hospitalized she was diagnosed and treated for a UTI, with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Patient was discharged from the hospital with Foley&#39;s catheter and rehabilitation was advised. While hospitalized she was due for her second dose but she got pneumonia, so she was not given the second dose. The reporter assumes the pneumonia was bacterial, because the patient was treated with antibiotics.  Very limited information regarding the events has been provided. Further information was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided. Further information was requested.
