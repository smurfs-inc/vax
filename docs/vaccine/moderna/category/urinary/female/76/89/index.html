I went grocery shopping the afternoon after I had my shot at about 11am.  Everything seemed normal, but after 20 minutes I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone .  I bought the wrong products, I also bought several of the same thing.  I bought products I never would have bought and had never purchased before.  Then I got home and was feeling still like I was in the Twilight Zone. (nothing seemed real).  Soon after I fell on the floor and could not get up.  My leg and back would not work.  Then I started to urinate and could not stop.  Buckets came out and every time I tried to get up, I fell completely flat again.  The urination lasted from early afternoon till about 6:30 pm.  Then I went to bed and stayed there till morning when I could get up and walk.  Meantime I had to wash my bedding, 3 pairs of pajamas and seven pairs of under pants.  One of the times I fell, my foot (which was recovering from a burn across my toes) and I jammed it between the wall and the bed, causing a break.  Also the first night I took the shot, I could not get to sleep until 4am (my cat and I were stuck watching Robo Cop till it ended at 4am.  I?m now in a boot-cast, and will get an x ray tomorrow.  I should let you know I take Sartaline HC, 100 mg once a day and Clonazepan, 1 mg 3 times a day.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history reported by the reporter.  Concomitant products included DORZOLAMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE (DORZOLOMIDE HYDROCHLORIDE), TIMOLOL and ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID] for an unknown indication.   On 06-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainting) (seriousness criterion medically significant), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (MODERNA toes/dots on her foot which still persist), PRURITUS (itchiness), DEHYDRATION (Dehydration) and PYREXIA (Fever). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainting), POLLAKIURIA (frequent urination), DEHYDRATION (Dehydration) and PYREXIA (Fever) outcome was unknown, VACCINATION COMPLICATION (MODERNA toes/dots on her foot which still persist) had not resolved and PRURITUS (itchiness) had resolved.            For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments  Treatment medications were not reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.

                                                I felt like I was hit by a ton of bricks. I got feverish, the chills, and muscle aches and pains to the point that all I wanted to do was sleep. So I went to bed, but just as I would be close to falling asleep I&#39;d have to get up to empty my bladder. This was happening almost every 15 minutes for a few hours. I knew I probably should hydrate, but I chose not to because I wanted to get some uninterrupted sleep which I finally did at about 4:00am which only lasted a couple of hours. Then up at about 6:30am when I took some acetaminophin and went back to sleep. I was in bed all day, sleeping most of the time. When I&#39;d wake up I&#39;d take my temperature and most of the time I&#39;d hydrate. I haven&#39;t had anything to eat because I wasn&#39;t feeling  strong enough to even heat water for soup. My normal temperature is about 97.6 give or take. The highest temperature I had was 100 when I took another dose of acetaminophin. But one time it was 94.3!!! I started feeling better at about 8:30pm (3/1/21)  and was able to make myself some chicken noodle soup and had some cereal and cottage cheese with it. I finally felt &#34;normal&#34; on Tuesday morning (3/2/21) after getting a good night&#39;s sleep.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, stated she was sneezing and coughing few days before receiving her first dose vaccine. Concomitant medications reported included iron, metolazone, nicardipine, simvastatin, torsemide, levothyroxine, glimepiride, apixaban, potassium chloride, acetyl salicylic acid, and donepezil 5mg.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 032L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The route of administration was not provided.  On an unspecified date in Jan 2021 after receiving the first dose vaccine, the patient experienced not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, and didn&#39;t want to get up.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient was losing her balance and confused. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with renal failure, as well as, severe urinary tract infection that was septic.  On an unknown date post hospitalization, the patient tested positive for Covid-19.  Treatment drug administered included Tylenol, Azithromycin, Promethazine, 325mg aspirin, and Vitamin D.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, like not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, confusion, loss of balance, renal failure, severe urinary tract infection that was septic, and Covid-19 positive test were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19.  The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-033912:

EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

Back in the middle of February the patient had a high-grade small-bowel obstruction ended up with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.  She was extremely deconditioned.  She came to swing bed here and states here for about 2 weeks.  She thought she was ready to go home and be successful at that time.  Unfortunately, she has gotten home and found that she can barely take care of herself.  She is extremely deconditioned.  She thinks she just needs to be built up for another week or 2 and then could be very successful at home.  She does have a friend that is helping her, but is worried about getting so weak that she end up hurting herself.  I saw her yesterday in the office and thought that another swing bed stay a might be in order.

                                                She got the vaccine and did not get an immediate reaction, and on Thursday morning she was tired and couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  So her husband kept her in bed all day and by Friday morning things didn&#39;t get any better, and he helped her to get to the end of the bed and went into the kitchen to get breakfast and he heard her fall, and she fell off the bed and was semi-consciousness, and was able to get her back into the bed and called the ambulance.   She was taken to the hospital Friday morning and she&#39;s still in there.  She has been diagnosed with hydronephrosis, and they keep going back and forth on her diagnoses.  At first they said that she had a UTI, and then they said she didn&#39;t, and then said that she did.  The son feels that all three of the doctors feel that it was some sort of reaction to the vaccine.  They did give her steroids at one time, and she developed severe tremors when she moved which have subsided.  She also has had fever, in a weakened state due to this condition.  She is still being treated for this still and said that she will be having to go to rehabilitation before going home.

I talked with the husband briefly about why his wife was hospitalized. He reported she got sick 2 days after getting her first COVID-19 vaccine. He states she had pneumonia, had a urinary tract infection and had to have a heart catherization with stent placement. We moved her second vaccine appointment to February 17th. The spouse came in on February 8th for his 2nd dose. He told me the doctors did not believe his wife&#39;s hospitalization was related to the first COVID vaccine and he said the doctor&#39;s told him that she needed her 2nd dose.

                                                Sudden presentation of Ecoli bladder infection with numerous clotting and emergency catheterization.  Have not had prior UTIs that I am aware of.  Urologist doesn&#39;t see any possible correlation but I am now on a third round of antibiotics.  Three days after my second shot on 3/12/2021 bleeding again started so now am now back on antibiotics.

She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) in an 87-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 029L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy, Syncope (granddaughter states patient has episodes of syncope) and Wheelchair user.    On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant). 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) had resolved and URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   After administration, the patient remained in waiting area for the recommended 15 minutes observation time. Approximately 20 minutes after vaccination, patient was unconscious and appeared not to be breathing, but pulse was palpable. Pharmacist administered 1 dose of 0.3mg epinephrine via epi-pen into patient&#39;s left thigh. The patient quickly regained consciousness, spoke to family, said she did not feel well. Emergency medical services (ems) arrived. The patient began to vomit, was placed on stretcher and left with ems. A few hours later the granddaughter reported that the patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and physical exam by emergency room (ER) attributed her experience to untreated infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Vomiting is consistent with event safety profile.

The patient&#39;s medical history included Parkinson&#39;s Disease.  On 19-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch:unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Treatment included antibiotics, remdesivir IV (intravenous) and rehabilitation.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   At the time of this report, the outcome of the events did not open eyes (unresponsive), UTI, positive COVID test, fever, and not speaking was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 89-year-old female who experienced serious unexpected events of COVID-19, pyrexia, urinary tract infection, aphasia, unresponsive to stimuli.  The events occurred 25 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treated with antibiotics and IV remdesivir. Event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time.
