                                                Second Covid Response to Moderna  I had a very severe reaction to she second Moderna shot (3/4/2.  I went grocery shopping the afternoon after I had my shot at about 11am.  Everything seemed normal, but after 20 minutes I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone .  I bought the wrong products, I also bought several of the same thing.  I bought products I never would have bought and had never purchased before.  Then I got home and was feeling still like I was in the Twilight Zone. (nothing seemed real).  Soon after I fell on the floor and could not get up.  My leg and back would not work.  Then I started to urinate and could not stop.  Buckets came out and every time I tried to get up, I fell completely flat again.  The urination lasted from early afternoon till about 6:30 pm.  Then I went to bed and stayed there till morning when I could get up and walk.  Meantime I had to wash my bedding, 3 pairs of pajamas and seven pairs of under pants.  One of the times I fell, my foot (which was recovering from a burn across my toes) and I jammed it between the wall and the bed, causing a break.  Also the first night I took the shot, I could not get to sleep until 4am (my cat and I were stuck watching Robo Cop till it ended at 4am.  I?m now in a boot-cast, and will get an x ray tomorrow.  I should let you know I take Sartaline HC, 100 mg once a day and Clonazepan, 1 mg 3 times a day.

On 2/9/2021 she complains more than usual with fatigue, a lot of fatigue so they make the decision to transfer her to the hospital.  In the hospital she was informed that the pain was from a  gallbladder stone,  also that she has a lung condition and a compromised kidney.  A Dr.  from Hospital  tells POC that the patient was not responding to treatments and was compromised thus prolonging the hospital stay.

She was waiting the 15 minutes after the vaccine, at about 8 minutes I checked up on her again and asked if she was doing okay. her eyes were open but she was not responding. I ran over there and tried to get her to respond to my touch and voice. She was breathing but was non responsive. She also had incontinence and when she came to she stated that she was asleep. We called 911 at this time and the paramedics came and took all her vitals, all of which were within range. The paramedics came within 10 minutes and at this time she was already responsive. She kept stating she was just asleep and told us she does sometimes have incontinence and has to wear pads. She refused further medical care and I contacted her when she was at home, where she stated that she would rest up but overall feels fine.

                                                Pt received her Moderna covid vaccines in jan and Feb 2021. She was hospitalized from 5/26/21-5/31/21 with a complicated urinary tract infection with bacteremia and pyelonephritis due to a pansensitive e coli which progressed to bacteremia and pyelonephritis despite being treated with 10 days of keflex and 3 days of macrobid as an out pt. She also had severe sepsis and a NSTEMI as a result of the illness. It is unclear why she progressed despite appropriate treatment and it was suggested an immune deficiency work up be done if she has recurrence in the future.

                                                I felt like I was hit by a ton of bricks. I got feverish, the chills, and muscle aches and pains to the point that all I wanted to do was sleep. So I went to bed, but just as I would be close to falling asleep I&#39;d have to get up to empty my bladder. This was happening almost every 15 minutes for a few hours. I knew I probably should hydrate, but I chose not to because I wanted to get some uninterrupted sleep which I finally did at about 4:00am which only lasted a couple of hours. Then up at about 6:30am when I took some acetaminophin and went back to sleep. I was in bed all day, sleeping most of the time. When I&#39;d wake up I&#39;d take my temperature and most of the time I&#39;d hydrate. I haven&#39;t had anything to eat because I wasn&#39;t feeling  strong enough to even heat water for soup. My normal temperature is about 97.6 give or take. The highest temperature I had was 100 when I took another dose of acetaminophin. But one time it was 94.3!!! I started feeling better at about 8:30pm (3/1/21)  and was able to make myself some chicken noodle soup and had some cereal and cottage cheese with it. I finally felt &#34;normal&#34; on Tuesday morning (3/2/21) after getting a good night&#39;s sleep.

The outcome of events, like not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, confusion, loss of balance, renal failure, severe urinary tract infection that was septic, and Covid-19 positive test were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19.  The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-033912:

Friend reports that patient complained of &#34;just not feeling right&#34; following vaccine administration. Complained of poor sleep, poor appetite, dyspepsia and began complaining of lower extremity swelling in the weeks following vaccine administration. Was no longer able to line-dance, etc. Was fatigued. Her friends became concerned and encouraged her to seek medical attention, patient reported that she had was prescribed &#34;water pill&#34; and told to &#34;lay off salt,&#34;. Friends later found out that she had lied about doctor&#39;s visit and was self-medicating with over the counter  &#34;water pills&#34; for all of the water weight she was gaining. Eventually developed worsening shortness of breath. Admitted to hospital on 5/4 with shortness of breath and worsening abdominal pain. Found to have systolic heart failure (EF 20-30%) and was in SVT. Also diagnosed with UTI and SMV thrombus. Grossly anasarcic on exam. Treated for heart failure with diuretic and for her UTI with antibiotics, was started on Heparin drip for SMV thrombus. Underwent left heart catheterization at OSH that was negative for significant CAD. Developed worsening septic shock and was transferred to our hospital for higher level of care. Unfortunately had ongoing decline, found to be fungemic. Eventually succumbed to her septic shock, passed away on 5/14/21.  Patient had second dose of vaccine on 3/18/21 according to vaccine card in her purse. Friend states that because of symptoms she developed after first dose of vaccine, she was fearful of getting second dose.  Friends insist that she was well before the vaccine---knee pain was limiting factor for her activity level, never shortness of breath. Of note, several friends tested positive for COVID on 2/11/21, the week prior to patient receiving her vaccine. Patient tested negative and reportedly got tested at frequent intervals and was always negative.

Treatment team Severe sepsis (CMS/HCC) Principal problem Discharge Summary Internal Medicine    Inpatient DeathSummary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admission Date: 4/6/2021     Discharge Date: 4/17/2021  DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Patient is an 79 y.o. female morbidly obese with past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia follow-up that was initially scheduled oncology follow-up for April 7 now postponed to the next 2 weeks, COPD on 2 L oxygen support at home, GERD, depression and anxiety.  She was recently seen in the ED on April 4, 2021 with complaint of shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, fever, chills, nonbloody diarrhea, vomiting and weakness and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19.  She had however received a second dose of COVID-19 a week before and was  discharged home due to lack of significant findings on imaging chest x-ray and lack of requirement for higher  oxygen support. She presented to the emergency via EMS for evaluation of progressive shortness of breath with associated with fever, chills, headache, persistent shortness of breath, cough productive of thick clear sputum, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  She denies abdominal pain, chest pain, or dizziness.  Denies recent antibiotic usage or recent travel.  Apparently, she thought she was getting better upon discharge after being kept for about 12 hours in the last ED visit, however she was not feeling well after going to bed last night and asked the husband to call 911.  Upon EMS arrival patient was saturating in the 80s and in respiratory distress.  She received 1 DuoNeb and was eventually placed on 10 L oxygen support.  She was noted to be in significant respiratory distress during speech.   Hospital Course Patient was admitted to hospital due to shortness of breath, and was found to have severe sepsis on presentation due to COVID-19 pneumonia.  She had evidence of acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure as well.  She was started on IV antibiotics, as well as remdesivir and Decadron at high dose.   Unfortunately she continued to have clinical deterioration, and ultimately required high flow oxygen therapy.  She was then transferred to the ICU, and ultimately required intubation due to severe profound ongoing hypoxia despite optimal medical treatment.  She did not respond to remdesivir or steroids or antibiotics.  Post intubation, she also developed acute renal failure during the course of her admission.   Multiple discussions were had throughout the hospitalization regarding goals of care, and initially patient and family wish to be continually aggressive.  She received full medical treatment, including life support, with minimal improvement.  Despite being on ventilator for roughly 5 days, she continued to have severe hypoxia.  She was proned, and was unable to sustain oxygen saturations when supine even for short period.   Her renal function continued to decline as well, and at that point discussion was had with family regarding goals of care again.  They were explained that symptoms continue to be persistent, and her illness continues to progress despite aggressive medical therapy.  Ultimately decision was made to not pursue dialysis, and to allow the patient to be kept comfortable and pass away naturally from this infection.   She was terminally extubated on 4/17 and passed away at 11:16 AM due to COVID-19 and acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure.

                                                On 4/7/21, she received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Then, around 5/1/21, she developed fevers to 102 with associated fatigue and poor appetite, but no other clear localizing symptoms, including no sore throat, cough, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V/D, joint swelling/pain, rashes, or dysuria. She presented to an outside hospital ED where she had an infectious workup that included a CXR concerning for LLL pneumonia. She was prescribed doxycycline for 7 days with resolution of her fevers and subjective improvement.    In early June 2021,  the patient redeveloped fevers and chills, worst at nighttime, without localizing symptoms. Her appetite and energy level remained very poor despite several changes to antidepressants as an outpatient. She was treated with nitrofurantoin x 5 days for presumed UTI, but fevers persisted, still without associated cough, CP, or SOB. With going fevers, fatigue, and poor appetite resulting in ~18lb unintentional weight loss, she was admitted to Hospital on 6/22/21 for further evaluation.  While at Hospital, she continued to have fevers to 102&#43; without localizing symptoms despite empiric doxycycline. A broad infectious workup returned negative. CT chest and CTAP were also unrevealing for a cause of fevers. She was found to have an elevated ferritin, LDH, and triglycerides, as well as a low fibrinogen, concerning for HLH (high H-score). She received high-dose dexamethasone. Bone marrow biopsy was performed that was negative for malignancy. However, peripheral flow cytometry returned with a clonal B-cell population, her soluble IL-2 was elevated, and she was found to have splenic enhancement on PET-CT, all concerning for occult lymphoma as the potential driver of her HLH. She remains admitted and is critically ill with complications of DIC and bleeding that preclude a splenic biopsy to confirm the suspected diagnosis of lymphoma. Since her fevers, malaise, and fatigue started less than 1 month after her second dose of the Moderna vaccine, and the patient was insistent that she &#34;hadn&#39;t felt right&#34; since she received that second dose of the vaccine, we decided to report this event in the VAERS system.

EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

Back in the middle of February the patient had a high-grade small-bowel obstruction ended up with laparotomy and lysis of adhesions.  She was extremely deconditioned.  She came to swing bed here and states here for about 2 weeks.  She thought she was ready to go home and be successful at that time.  Unfortunately, she has gotten home and found that she can barely take care of herself.  She is extremely deconditioned.  She thinks she just needs to be built up for another week or 2 and then could be very successful at home.  She does have a friend that is helping her, but is worried about getting so weak that she end up hurting herself.  I saw her yesterday in the office and thought that another swing bed stay a might be in order.

                                                She got the vaccine and did not get an immediate reaction, and on Thursday morning she was tired and couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  So her husband kept her in bed all day and by Friday morning things didn&#39;t get any better, and he helped her to get to the end of the bed and went into the kitchen to get breakfast and he heard her fall, and she fell off the bed and was semi-consciousness, and was able to get her back into the bed and called the ambulance.   She was taken to the hospital Friday morning and she&#39;s still in there.  She has been diagnosed with hydronephrosis, and they keep going back and forth on her diagnoses.  At first they said that she had a UTI, and then they said she didn&#39;t, and then said that she did.  The son feels that all three of the doctors feel that it was some sort of reaction to the vaccine.  They did give her steroids at one time, and she developed severe tremors when she moved which have subsided.  She also has had fever, in a weakened state due to this condition.  She is still being treated for this still and said that she will be having to go to rehabilitation before going home.

                                                Patient noticed what appeared to be severe rash mostly on lower extremities (legs).  It did not itch and she is not sure the onset except that it appeared sometime after her Moderna vaccine (only had one shot).  She ended up at Emergency Department per her doctor&#39;s orders and was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia (platelets 130).  They also found stage three kidney failure. She was not aware of these conditions prior to vaccine although it sounds like there were prior labs suggesting some issues.  She was advised to not get the second vaccine as it could potentially further lower platelets.  Apparently, other pts have been in their hospital with severe platelet issue post second Moderna vaccine.

Now she is unable to walk and is totally incontinent.  She does not know her routine anymore and is waiting for directions from her caretakers on when to get up, when to go to the bathroom and sits in bed all day or is moved to a chair by caretakers.  She needs pillows propped around her in order to sit upright.

I talked with the husband briefly about why his wife was hospitalized. He reported she got sick 2 days after getting her first COVID-19 vaccine. He states she had pneumonia, had a urinary tract infection and had to have a heart catherization with stent placement. We moved her second vaccine appointment to February 17th. The spouse came in on February 8th for his 2nd dose. He told me the doctors did not believe his wife&#39;s hospitalization was related to the first COVID vaccine and he said the doctor&#39;s told him that she needed her 2nd dose.

                                                I woke up on 3/02/21 totally incontinent.  I could not control my urine.  The flow was bright red, filled with blood.  I called my healthcare provider and the doctor at that clinic gave me a urine test.  He found nothing.  There was no pain, only blood for about six bouts of irination.  He sent out to a clinic and they said I had an infection caused by E-coli.  (The vaccine had obvioiusly lowered my resistance to infection because I had none before at all.)  Also, he found that I was in heart failure - about 30% function.  They recommended I be hospitalized.  My daughter and I drove back to my home state and primary care physician, who concurred.  I was hospitalized for heart failure at the hospital in my home state.    This was the first time ever my heart had been compromised.  I have now to see a cardiologist, take meds, and do cardio rehab.  They found my heart was enlarged and I had fluid build-up around my heart also.

                                                She got sick, pain in the arm and neck the day after the vaccine.  I called her doctors office on the 19th of Feb and I did not get a call back.   She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

                                                On Saturday while getting your night medicines from the shelf, and started feeling dizzy, tried to reach the shelf and said to herself that &#34;i can&#39;t do it, I just can&#39;t do it&#34;.  She staggered back and sat down on a towel hamper and apparently fell off of that onto the floor, lost kidney function.  Tried to get up and managed to get her phone out and called her husband (he&#39;s hard of hearing - was downstairs).  She said when he got there her head was towards the bathroom door and felt that he could not get in and could not get her up so she tried to get up.  She did not have any strength.  Finally she got up to get on her elbow and crawled into the vanity area and raised up and pulled herself up.  She did not enough strength to walk to the bed.   She got to the bed and then started with chills, turned on her electric blanket.  She felt better Sunday, 1/7/21, and is real shaky today.  She feels a little stronger but is not back to where she wants to be.  Yesterday evening she felt her arm itching a little bit, and looked at it and it was swollen and red, and had an area about the size of her hand.  Her husband felt of it and said that he felt she had fever in it.  The arm was sore to touch.  It is itching a little bit this morning.  She had a headache for a couple of days as well, took a Tylenol one night and her head felt real weird.  It was not real severe, and it hurt more times than it did others.  It would come and go.  Has not taken anything else for these symptoms.   Her husband checked her BP, Friday was 108/62, and last night 106/67.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) in an 87-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 029L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy, Syncope (granddaughter states patient has episodes of syncope) and Wheelchair user.    On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) (seriousness criterion medically significant). 22-Jan-2021, the patient experienced URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (patient was unconscious) and SYNCOPE (patient was unconscious) had resolved and URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI), BEDRIDDEN (Bedridden) and VOMITING (Patient began to vomit) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   After administration, the patient remained in waiting area for the recommended 15 minutes observation time. Approximately 20 minutes after vaccination, patient was unconscious and appeared not to be breathing, but pulse was palpable. Pharmacist administered 1 dose of 0.3mg epinephrine via epi-pen into patient&#39;s left thigh. The patient quickly regained consciousness, spoke to family, said she did not feel well. Emergency medical services (ems) arrived. The patient began to vomit, was placed on stretcher and left with ems. A few hours later the granddaughter reported that the patient had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and physical exam by emergency room (ER) attributed her experience to untreated infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Vomiting is consistent with event safety profile.

Patient developed coffee ground emesis and had NG tube placed, yielding 1800 cc of coffee-ground emesis. She was also noted to be hypertensive. A CT done at the outside hospital revealed a large hiatal hernia with a significantly distended herniated portion of the stomach and a portion in the left upper quadrant compatible with a gastric outlet obstruction. Transferred to another hospital and GI consulted. Underwent EGD on 3/14 with results as noted below. Recommended to continue PPI, avoid NSAIDs if possible and repeat EGD in 8 weeks as outpatient. NG-tube removed and tolerated diet. No further bleeding noted. Hgb remained stable. Medically stable for discharge. Counseled on medication use and diet. Patient or daughter had no further questions or concerns on discharge.

Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time.
