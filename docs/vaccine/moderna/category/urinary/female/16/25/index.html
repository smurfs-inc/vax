While EMS was evaluating the patient in the pharmacy, she stated that she was beginning to have trouble breathing; but those symptoms quickly resolved without the administration of epinephrine. We received a phone call from the patient within 2 hours stating that she was being discharged from the hospital and was feeling much better.

                                                Around 10 min after injection patient flagged down a technician and said she thought she was going to faint. Fainting has happened to her in the past and she could feel it coming on. The pharmacist moved her closer to the area and gave her water. While pharmacist was standing with her she lost consciousness and control of her bladder. Pharmacist held patient upright as she was still in the chair as to not obstruct breathing. Patient was out for around a min and regained consciousness. Pharmacist in that time had called EMS who arrived later and checked all vitals. Patient drove alone nearly an hour so Pharmacist want to make sure she was ok before driving the long distance home.

I have found 100s of women my age online who say they got their first ever uti after the covid vaccine, but I cant find any data on it as a possible effect.

Provided water, patient mentioned she hadn&#39;t eaten. Grabbed her a bar to snack on. EMS then arrived on the scene and took over care.

                                                Got shot on a Tuesday 3pm, arm sore right away, full body aches appeared 12 hours after. I woke up Thursday morning with a left swollen labia minora and a stinging sharp pain wiping after urination, blood spots on TP. I took flash photos to see what it looked like at the entrance of my vagina. I saw a cluster of small, bleeding, open wound sores, looked like speckles of blood. I saw a doctor at Health Services the next morning and was told it looks like I have herpes. I did a viral culture swab for hsv. I had just tested negative for a full panel std test (minus hsv) in February, so we did not redo it. Monday, I got the call, my doctor said the results were negative and most likely a false negative, she said she is sure I have herpes. Tuesday, the next day I go into health services again to get a second opinion from another doctor and get re-swabbed. The second doctor agreed it looks just like herpes and she doesn&#39;t know what else it could be. We do another viral culture swab and she confirmed that she picked up fluid from the sores this time. I was also swabbed for gonorrhea and chlamydia and redid the full panel std blood test from February. The results all come back negative, and the doctor says she doesn&#39;t know what else it could be besides herpes. I am fed up with no answers and go to an urgent care. The doctor does not know what my lesions could be from. We did another viral culture swab that tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia and hsv. She offered pills to treat chancroid just in case and I took them thinking it was risk free. By the time I got home I was throwing up for a couple hours. My results come back negative. My second doctor calls me and says she is confident I could have syphilis (even though the sores were the most pain I&#39;ve ever experienced). I came in to give blood for syphilis and hsv testing. Both came back negative, but the doctor was telling me I should still go somewhere for syphilis treatment (a shot I think?). I was even more frustrated.  I sought out an OBGYN center that specializes in ulcers. The amazing doctor agreed with me that I do not have any std&#39;s and that my ulcers were a result of the vaccine. By this time the sores were healed.

                                                -3 hours after my first shot I felt very disoriented and nauseated. I immediately fainted and I lost consciousness for 5 minutes, while unconscious I also was incontinent and peed myself. When I came to, I was disoriented for about 2 minutes and very cold.  -For a week after I fainted I was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up without feeling that I was going to faint.  -The second week after my shot I also felt pressure on my chest for 5 days that has since then gone away.  -Since I fainted 3 hours after my shot  I have experienced constant ringing in both ears that have not stopped for the past 30 days since I got the vaccine. I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

                                                Patient only had muffin and coffee that day early in am. Had some arm pain after shot no other reaction.  Did go home felt some nausea . Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.
