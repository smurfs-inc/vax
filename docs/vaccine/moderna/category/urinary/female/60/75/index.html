                                                Mild fever,   increased pain in my neck and shoulder that were previously a bit sore from an old injury, my hand felt &#34;tight and sore&#34; and so did the &#34;bones in my head&#34;.  I do suffer from that when we have a storm and one was on the way, but it was more intense than normal. I had 4 bouts of very urgent needs to urinate that is not normal for me and the urine was very dark, not the typical light yellow.  I was not otherwise ill or dehydrated that perhaps would&#39;ve caused that to happen.

                                                Tuesday in the early am, I woke up and I took my temperature - it was 101.2 (I had taken Ibuprofen 5 hrs prior). I got something to eat and then I took 800 mg of Ibuprofen. I bundled up - h ad chills and fever. Left arm was killing me. I went back to bed. I could hardly move my left arm. I oculdn&#39;t lay on it - the ibuprofen didn&#39;t work. I had to call out of work. I cancelled Tuesday. I was in bed. I drank a lot of water before the vaccine and after the vaccine. I had soup broth, tea, juice, cider. I slept 3-4 hour nap in afternoon. Diarrhea and cramps late tuesday night - bathroom and bed all of Tuesday. Had a fever again on Wednesday night - 101 (oral). Tired. Left arm was killing me. I continued 800 mg ibuprofen every 6 hours on Tuesday. I started VIT DE again. I was mostly exhausted and my arm still hurt badly. on Wednesday and Thursday. Thursday didn&#39;t take any ibuprofen - pushed through the day. On the 5th of February, for the first time in my life - left flank pain; sharp left lateral pain. I couldn&#39;t pee for three hours. I was drinking three quarts of water. For the most part, it didn&#39;t hurt a lot to move my left arm but it hurt. Bladder was not full even though I couldn&#39;t pee. I went to URGENT CARE  - Doctor on Duty - (Friday, the 12th)  UA - no nitrates; large amount of blood but everything was normal. No growth after 48 hours. Flomax - dialator and started to urinate. I didn&#39;t have any sense that I had to pee. Friday, the 5th, I took the Flomax once a day - 0.4 micrograms - I took it Friday and Saturday. I did abdomen warm compresses in my abdomen and back. I did it on Sunday twice, two. I started back up on Ibuprofen on Friday, Saturday. Monday - I got my PCM -  Monday the 15th - He did a UA and I had no blood. I stopped  Ibuprofen on Monday. He is going to do a renal ultrasound. I had never had a kidney stone but he has put in a referral to get that done.  Tuesday (after President&#39;s day) - UA results - negative and no blood and he wasn&#39;t going to send it for culture. I still have minor left flank pain here and there.

By the next day, there were numerous marks on my left arm including my hand.  The marks were very itchy. It resembled chicken pox or poison ivy.  The marks continued up the left of my face and and into my hair line and up my ear. I was also feeling an itchy painful burning in my private area.  It was very painful  to pass urine or have a bowel movement.  The rash continued to break out all over my body for 5 or 6 days.  I was put on Prednisone for 17 days.  I did not feel the prednisone helped.  At 2 1/2 weeks I still have the rash although it is fading.

                                                Severe headache that woke me from sleep at 15 hours post vaccination; then at 24 hours post vaccination, typical side effects began with chills, aches and tiredness.  However, at 28 hours post vaccination, my fever climbed to 102.  I had such severe body aches, I needed assistance to get up and was nearly impossible to walk or move. I had no appetitie. I decided to take 2 extra strength tylenol to aid in the fever/chills and severe headache.  Unfortunately, two days prior to vaccine, I was diagnosed by CT scan that I had a kidney stone.  It was being treated with Toradol, which I only took at bedtime with the also, prescribed Flomax.  The Toradol did little to assuage my body aches, incidentally  My fever only came down to 101.4 .  It remained between 101.4 and 102 until 48 hours post vaccination, when it finally went down to 99.2.  I could only get out of bed to use the bathroom.  I drank at least 2.25L of water daily because I was flushing a kidney stone, so my fluid intake was very strong.   I knew that many of my friends/relatives have had the 2nd shot, so I messaged with them, but nobody had had a fever over 102.  I knew if I did not take anything, it would&#39;ve easily been 103F.  I was confused and couldn&#39;t gather my thoughts.  Things had to be repeated to me, but fortunately, I slept a lot and the worst of the symptoms was during my sleep at night and I had horrid nightmares.  By 56 hours post-vaccination, I could function, but I was severely exhausted.  By 72 hours post-vaccination, I had tried to resume low level activity, but was too exhausted and took a 3 hour nap in addition to sleeping 12 hours/night since I had the vaccination 5 days ago. My arm is still very sore, but not as immobile as first shot.  I still have very little appetite and my headache lasted 3 days. I&#39;d consider myself general recovered from the worst of the fever, body aches and fatigue.

Tried to take long breathes and slow things done but it was far too intense.  I have major GI issues and have had an ERCP.  Monday the day before I had a four hour gastric emptying test with nuclear aspects that was in some of the egg whites I ate.  They said there would not be any side effects...i do thing that related to the vaccine side effects and created the perfect storm for an over 3 hour stomach attach.  Couldn&#39;t have bowel movement although I felt like it was needed.  Couldn&#39;t throw up yet I was extremely naseaus.  Very sore and swollen arm today where vaccine was given...very very thirsty today.

They continued like this but with fluctuating severity.  My calves and shin muscles began to be sore.  I sought out acupuncture and myofascia release work to help.  It did help temporarily.  I started to have left ankle pain, not like a sprain, like tendonitis or inflammation.  It continued to hurt to walk and the muscles more painful.  I started having darker urine about 4 days after the vaccine.  I drank cranberry juice and took a kidney/bladder supplement, increased fluids, but it continued dark.  I went to the Urgent Care on January 7th c/o muscle pain and dark urine.  My blood pressure was elevated, 179/100..unusual for me, and my urine was neg so it was sent for culture and blood was drawn for CBC and metabollic panel and Creatine Kinase

                                                About 9PM after the receiving the vaccine I started had riggers which lasted for about an hour. I couldn&#39;t reach for my phone or call for help. I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

After 1 episode of nausea,  I started experiencing more than mild muscle cramps.  Could not lay on either side.  Darkened room because light/ sound was adding to already severe headache. Used cold washcloths on forehead.  Was having trouble trying to walk, use restroom, frequent urination but could only sip water. Over the next 24 hours...just slept and used bathroom.  Severe muscle cramps, chills, fever, headaches.   Called my Dr.&#39;s nurse-she advised to hydrate and to go to ER if needed.  24 hours later, I realized I would be okay...but took me another 24-36 hours to feel 80% normal.  Lost 8LBs. during 48 hours.  Experienced extreme dreams/delusions.

Around 11:30, severe shivering began and lasted around 3 hours, which stopped after covering myself with a blanket (they started again every time I was uncovered). Also, every 30 to 45 minutes, I had to urinate (seemed to be about half a cup of liquid each time). Next morning (21 hours after the second dose) shivering and constant urination have decreased but arm is still sore.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                She was transferred from one ER to another for intraparenchymal bleed and subarachnoid hemorrhage with midline shift. On the week of April 11th she was seen by her periodontist of a bone graft in preparation for a tooth implant. She took minimal ibuprofen and norco after this procedure. However, she also began to feel very nauseated which led to anorexia and worsening malaise. This prompted the pt to present to ER on 4/16 evening, where was given Phenergan, and discharged to home. Symptoms worsened and she re-presented to ED where she was admitted and diagnosed with UTI and colitis. She was started on ciprofloxacin. She denied having had any dysuria or diarrhea. Patient&#39;s son says that at 0130 on 4/19 his mother was using both sides of her extremities equally. She had been complaining of headache and leg pain, but by 0130 on 4/19 family did not notice any other obvious changes in patient&#39;s movements or behavior. However, at 0730 on 4/19 nurses noticed that patient was unable to move her L arm or leg. She had a CT scan done, which revealed multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages bilaterally as well as subarachnoid hemorrhage with midline shift. The transferring physician told me that patient had not been on any anticoagulation. Patient and her family deny any history of falls or trauma, denied family history of coagulopathies, and use of blood thinners (including aspirin). No records, labs, or inpatient med list was sent with patient upon transfer. Family says that patient had her first Moderna COVID19 vaccine 3 weeks ago and was due for her second vaccine on 4/23. Labs on admit here are significant for leukocytosis with WBC of 21.9, Hgb of 12.1, platelets of 306, sodium of 140, potassium of 3.1, Bicarb of 22, creatinine of 0.7, glucose of 126, magnesium of 1.8, INR of 1.2. Patient is normotensive, afebrile, and satting well on room air.  Angiogram showed multiple cortical vein thromboses.  Will send hypercoagulable work up, HIT antibody given COVID vaccine 3 weeks ago (Moderna).

                                                I received the first Moderna vaccine on March 15, left arm hurt to touch, couldn&#39;t lift it overhead, had sound halucinations and fatigue.  On the eleventh day things got ugly. Sharp chest pain and  jaw pain, blood pressure 130/104 (my normal is 125/60), for four days couldn&#39;t eliminate but a small amount of urine, dizzy spell-almost passed out, vitreous detachment in eye, lost taste and smell 24 hrs (test for covid-19 was negative), blood pressure jumped to 180/112, temp 94.4, TMJ/node pain and swelling three weeks, teeth didn&#39;t occlude four days and couldn&#39;t get floss between any teeth for a day (so weird), severe shooting wrist pain, couldn&#39;t hold a pen or type for 24 hrs, hand tremors, sound halucinations of metal scrapping, hammering, thumping when laid down, super itchy rash under armpit one week, occipital node swollen, top of head painful to touch, ankle swollen, pounding heart beat, dry cough, oxygen readings of 88, sub- normal temperature 94.8 to 95.8 for several days and a month of very high blood pressure readings with tinnitus, fatigue, cloudy thinking and speech. Most reactions lasted a day up four days, all were on the right side of my body, most resolved before the next started. The longest ongoing issue is high blood pressure. Finally went down to 124/66  but not consistently. Spent three weeks around 138/104 and when walking uphill, heart would start pounding, felt faint, nauseated, head ached and had difficulty breathing. Alcohol and salt triggered a reaction or made blood pressure jump to 180/104. Leaning forward to do yard work or and strenuous activity like walking made heart pound violently, head ache, and blood pressure go up. Laying down makes heart flutter. Most of the symptoms listed are for myocarditis. Once the CDC reported that kids were having these issues I reduced activity and and more bed rest and am feeling slightly better.

I had liver enzymes as high as 600-700, CAT scan showed edema of the portal valve and a slightly enlarged liver.  I also was diagnosed with Hemolytic Anemia. I never had any symptoms in my life like these, no family history either.  My blood work now shows that everything is going back to normal with no treatment at all.

                                                I started having leg cramps in the middle of the night and had to ice both shoulders. I previously had problems with my rotator cuff earlier in the year - I had to ice both even though I didn&#39;t do anything with the arm that didn&#39;t have the shot. I also had to ice my neck, which is when I decided to go to the doctor. It&#39;s like having menopause again but worse. I was already wearing a pee pad but instead of every 12 hours at night I would have terrible cramps and before being able to go to the bathroom I would already pee. And I work at Amazon in the warehouse and do manual labor so I know the difference in the feeling of being worn out but I didn&#39;t do anything and had all these cramps. I had a low grade fever a lot, which is still continuing. I checked with the doctor to make sure I wasn&#39;t having an infection. I had exhaustion beyond the regular and headaches. problems with my feet, foot fungus that&#39;s getting worse and things that used to fix it aren&#39;t. Not getting enough sleep, irrigatable.

However, the state tracking system lists her date of vaccination 10 days prior to the symptom onset. Below is a more detailed description:  This is a 64-year-old female nurse practitioner with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled (untreated) type 2 diabetes, obesity, and remote history of kidney donation who presented yesterday with a 5-day history of nausea and frontal headache with new recent dizziness /lightheadedness when standing.  She describes her headache as starting out as temporal and periorbital and then persisting as a frontal discomfort radiating to the back and down the neck.  Associated with this were complaints of blurry vision, photophobia and scotomata.  She denies any focal weakness or numbness/tingling. There was no vomiting or reports of seizures. She denies no recent problems finding words or bouts of confusion.  She denies a history of arrhythmia or palpitations.  Patient received the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on 4/14/2021 into her right arm, 5 days prior to admission (But state records list 4/7/2021 as the date). She did not take any medication to pre-empt side effects such as NSAID, aspirin, H2 blocker, or Tylenol. Initially she developed a sore arm the night of the vaccination. Three days later the headache developed that did not respond to Tylenol PM although it helped her sleep.  She noted taking more than the recommended dose and had mouth dryness.   Patient denies any past history of COVID exposure and any illness c/w COVID where she was not tested.  She has never had her antibody titer checked.   She recently had a dental procedure for an exposed nerve and had a temporary filling placed.  No antibiotics were given and denies having a dental abscess   She described that one of her sisters developed &#34;blood clots from her heart due to atrial fib&#34; after her Pfizer vaccination.  She denies rashes or stigmata of endocarditis, no fevers, chills, or night sweats.   She describes vaginal itching a few days ago and self treated with an anti-yeast cream (Monistat) that relieved symptoms and does not currently have dysuria, frequency or urgency.  On admission, her UA was abnormal and culture is pending but she received one dose of Rocephin and is still without urinary symptoms.   After admission CT scan and MRI of the brain revealed focal areas of likely small subacute embolic infarcts.  (See report)   Since admission she had a reassuring ECHO and no further worsening.

                                                She got the vaccine and later that evening she got the shakes so bad that the bed was shaking, achy.  the next day same reaction, and had the itchy rash that was 3&#34; down from the shot site and went down near her elbow.  Then, a week after that on 4/4/21 she started getting a rheumatoid flare up which has never had one like this before, which has lasted now about a month.   On 4/9/21 she started with back pain and went to her PCP and diagnosed with a UTI.   You then continued with the same problems, and called her rheumatologist on 4/12/21 and was put on Prednisone.  On 4/14/21 the lower right forearm had a blotch that looked like cellulitis but was not, and felt that it was an allergic reaction/possibly related to the RA flare up.  The flare was in multiple joints and kept moving around.   On 4/22/21 she was started on a 2nd dose of steroids and it didn&#39;t work.  Everything has swollen to the point that she had to have  her wedding band cut off due to the extreme swelling on 4/28/21 she had her last pill of steroids.  She ended up getting an IV while in the ER of Methyl prednisolone, which did help her and today she is a different person.  They also gave her a Toradol shot and now on a steroid pack, but this has been almost a month reaction and was having no symptoms before the vaccination.   She does take Humira for her RA.

In February 2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced TRANSPLANT REJECTION (transabdominal liver biopsy was obtained and showed mixed portal inflammation, bile duct injury and endotheliitis consistent with ACR (Rejection Activity Index [RAI] score 4) with central venular dilation and sinusoidal congestion) (seriousness criterion medically significant), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (local soreness at injection site), VACCINATION SITE MOVEMENT IMPAIRMENT (reduced range in motion at injection site), HYPOSMIA (reduced sense of smell), MYALGIA (mild myalgias), CHROMATURIA (darkened urine), FATIGUE (fatigue), MALAISE (malaise), HYPOSMIA (Reduced sense of smell), LIVER FUNCTION TEST INCREASED (elevated liver tests), VENOOCCLUSIVE LIVER DISEASE (possible hepatic venous outflow obstruction) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and VENOOCCLUSIVE LIVER DISEASE (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with METHYLPREDNISOLONE (METHYLPREDNISOLONE WITH AZATHIOPRINE) (intravenous) for Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, at a dose of 3 day course; MYCOPHENOLATE MOFETIL for Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, at a dose of 1 dosage form and IMMUNOGLOBULIN ANTI-THYMOCYTE at a dose of 1 milligram/kilogram once a day. At the time of the report, TRANSPLANT REJECTION (transabdominal liver biopsy was obtained and showed mixed portal inflammation, bile duct injury and endotheliitis consistent with ACR (Rejection Activity Index [RAI] score 4) with central venular dilation and sinusoidal congestion) was resolving, VACCINATION SITE PAIN (local soreness at injection site), VACCINATION SITE MOVEMENT IMPAIRMENT (reduced range in motion at injection site), HYPOSMIA (reduced sense of smell), MYALGIA (mild myalgias), VENOOCCLUSIVE LIVER DISEASE (possible hepatic venous outflow obstruction) and VENOOCCLUSIVE LIVER DISEASE (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) had resolved and CHROMATURIA (darkened urine), FATIGUE (fatigue), MALAISE (malaise), HYPOSMIA (Reduced sense of smell) and LIVER FUNCTION TEST INCREASED (elevated liver tests) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered TRANSPLANT REJECTION (transabdominal liver biopsy was obtained and showed mixed portal inflammation, bile duct injury and endotheliitis consistent with ACR (Rejection Activity Index [RAI] score 4) with central venular dilation and sinusoidal congestion), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (local soreness at injection site), VACCINATION SITE MOVEMENT IMPAIRMENT (reduced range in motion at injection site), HYPOSMIA (reduced sense of smell), MYALGIA (mild myalgias), CHROMATURIA (darkened urine), FATIGUE (fatigue), MALAISE (malaise), HYPOSMIA (Reduced sense of smell), LIVER FUNCTION TEST INCREASED (elevated liver tests), VENOOCCLUSIVE LIVER DISEASE (possible hepatic venous outflow obstruction) and VENOOCCLUSIVE LIVER DISEASE (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) to be possibly related.    Patient was advised to begin tapering off concomitant medication prednisone; she decreased it to 2.5 mg daily for two weeks starting one day after vaccination and then discontinued it entirely. The liver test elevation did not improve after intravenous steroid therapy, and a repeat liver biopsy showed similar histology to the initial biopsy, with persistent ACR (Reject activity index (RAI) score 5) and slightly reduced central venular dilation and sinusoidal congestion. Patient was treated with anti-thymocyte globulin 1 mg/kg daily for a 6-day duration, and the liver tests gradually decreased. A third liver biopsy after completion of anti-thymocyte globulin showed improved ACR (RAI score 2) and no central venular dilation or sinusoidal congestion. Fifteen days after vaccination, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 229 U/L, Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 199 U/L, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP): 576 U/L, Bilirubin: 6.0 mg/dl, Albumin: 3.3 g/dl, Tacrolimus, 12-hour trough: 8.3 ng/ml; negative for Cytomegalovirus DNA, Hepatitis C RNA, Herpes Simplex Virus-1/2 DNA, Adenovirus DNA, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, Donor Specific Antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibodies Receptor Binding Domain; positive for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibodies S1 Subunit. Twenty-one days after vaccination, AST: 191 U/L, ALT: 195 U/L, ALP: 522 U/L, Bilirubin: 4.9 mg/dl, Albumin: 2.0 g/dl, Tacrolimus, 12-hour trough: 7.0 ng/ml. Twenty-five days after vaccination, AST: 188 U/L, ALT: 245 U/L, ALP: 449 U/L, Bilirubin: 5.5 mg/dl, Albumin: 2.6 g/dl, Tacrolimus, 12-hour trough: 8.3 ng/ml; negative for Donor Specific Antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibodies Receptor Binding Domain; positive for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Antibodies S1 Subunit. Twenty-nine days after vaccination, AST: 125 U/L, ALT: 229 U/L, ALP: 467 U/L, Bilirubin: 5.2 mg/dl, Albumin: 2.6 g/dl, Tacrolimus, 12-hour trough: 11.3 ng/ml. Thirty-six days after vaccination, patient&#39;s AST: 94 U/L, ALT: 145 U/L, ALP: 437 U/L, Bilirubin: 2.7 mg/dl.  Company Comment: Transplant rejection is the body&#39;s inherent response to foreign body, veno-occlusive liver disease , elevated liver enzyme test, involves a pre-existing underlying condition , Con-med Tacrolimus is a high risk for chromaturia and as such these events are unlikely related to mRNA-1273.  The remaining events show temporal association with product use and as such cannot be excluded although malaise and fatigue are confounded by patient&#39;s condition and treatment for condition.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Transplant rejection is the body&#39;s inherent response to foreign body, veno-occlusive liver disease , elevated liver enzyme test, involves a pre-existing underlying condition , Con-med Tacrolimus is a high risk for chromaturia and as such these events are unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                About six weeks after the second Moderna COVID vaccine, I started experiencing thirst, more frequent urination and noted some weight loss. This continued and then by end of April 2021, I started experiencing other symptoms including white flakes in urine, cramps in calves, and dry mouth. I sought medical care for these odd symptoms and despite having normal blood glucose at annual physicals, including in July 2020, my blood glucose run on 6/10/21 was 379. I do not have any history of diabetes nor is it in my family history, parents, siblings, grandparents and aunts/uncles on both sides.

Ten weeks after the vaccine I got a bladder Infection. I have gotten bladder infections in the past but this was more severe. I had urgency, discomfort and blood in my urine. I took one course of antibiotics but the symptoms returned. I returned to the doctor when the discomfort returned and I had a lot more blood in my urine.

                                                She got her vaccine, and started out with the sore arm, but she was sitting in the bathroom sometime after 11:00 preparing to do a peritoneal dialysis exchange and blacked out.  She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

The first day she was unable to move from the bed and had a fever of 102, headaches, incontinence.  She is able to move some today but states her legs are rubbery which is a feeling she has never felt before.  She said she has been very confused the last few days and dreaming a lot more than usual.  She is improving but still not back to herself at this time and plans to discuss with her neurologist later today.

                                                Wednesday, March 31, 2021 Moderna vaccine, 2nd shot at 4:00pm. Arm began to feel sore about 10pm. Blood pressure and oximeter reading remained normal throughout.  Thursday, April 1, 2021 Insufficient sleep, sudden increase in sinus congestion, muscle soreness and increasingly sore arm upon arising. Fatigue, Imbalance and Brain Fog rapidly increased. Urinary incontinence 3 times - once upon awakening and twice in the afternoon. Temperature began rising and reached 100.2°F by 3:00pm (normal temp 97.5°F). Resting pulse rate 74 at 10pm (normal 54). Headache and weakness in the evening.  Friday, April 2, 2021 Insufficient sleep, sore arm, sinus congestion, sneezing, moderate headache, moderate imbalance, muscle soreness, weak, moderate brain fog. Resting pulse rate 64 (normal 54). Temp at 7:30am 99.4°F (normal 97.5°F). NEW today: joint pain in both hips and Tinnitus suddenly spiking high. 10:00pm noticed mood began to change, feelings of irritation then anger for no apparent reason.  *Saturday, April 3, 2021 Insufficient sleep. Temperature at 12:30pm 98.1°F then continued to fall until it reached normal range (97.7°F) at 10:00pm. Resting pulse rate 68 (normal 54). Increasingly painful hip joints, sinus congestion still high, sneezing, mild headache, canker sores, tinnitus spiking, brain fog, increased imbalance. *NEW today: 7:30am-10:00am mental confusion, hallucinations, auditory, increased imbalance. Afterwards, feelings of fear, anger and paranoia that persisted through Sunday. Evening: increasing blurred vision and diplopia (both chronic conditions but usually very mild). Injection site suddenly red and more swollen, itching. Still feeling uncharacteristically emotional at bedtime.  Sunday, April 4, 2021 Insomnia. Volatile emotions - anger, agitation, crying - kept me awake Saturday night; slept 2:30am-8:30am Sunday morning. Brain fog, imbalance, sinus congestion, sneezing, right arm itching, hip joint pain, canker sores on tongue, spiking tinnitus continue. Temperature normal all day; resting pulse rate still high 64 (normal 54).  Monday April 5 through Thursday April 15: Most symptoms continued to gradually subside over the next ten days. Spiking tinnitus, canker sores and injection site itching were the most persistent and lasted until April 15. Imbalance subsided on April 12. NEW Symptoms: Anxiety dreaming began on April 6th. Most nights had insufficient sleep. Concern about the cause of the episode of delirium on April 3rd continues. Good news, no COVID-Arm like I had with the 1st vaccination.  General observations: It seems as though my body&#39;s response to the 2nd vaccination was to temporarily trigger some of the symptoms of my chronic health conditions like MCAS, Dysautonomia and Diplopia, without causing an actual flareup of those conditions. This was quite unexpected and disconcerting. The episode of delirium was something I&#39;ve never experienced and hope to never experience again.

She was told that she could not have her ostomy reversed and has been doing with the end ileostomy since then.  She states that she just emptied her bag again this morning.  She has been having trouble eating secondary to the abdominal pain.  This prompted her visit to the emergency room today.  Upon evaluation by the ED physician she underwent a CAT scan which showed a small bowel obstruction.  For this were consulted.  Of note patient was also found to have a UTI and was made a septic alert by the ED.  I met the patient upon my arrival into the emergency room.

                                                Noticed bleeding in the mouth/gums. Looked inside and found bloody holes in my cheeks about 1/2&#34; big. I noticed the top of my hands we also very bruised although I did not get hurt. I went to the ER and they took me in and ran blood tests. They diagnosed me with Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura. My platelet level was at 8,000, and 6 months prior I was at 180-200,000. They began giving me platelets and were working up to giving my Immunoglobulen. After 2 doses of platelets they gave me 2 doses of benadryl intravenously and I had a scary reaction (I&#39;ve never had a reaction to benadryl prior to vaccine). My body went numb, it felt like my muscles fell asleep, I felt like I could not breath. It&#39;s as if my body attacked anything that came in. Then I was given a sedative to calm down.  As the sedative faded I began feeling immense pain in my abdomen, they thought it was internal bleeding, but after a CT scan they found 3 kidney stones. I was then put on fluids. Due to pain, my blood pressure went up and stayed up for about 8-10 hrs at around 255. I was given about 3 does of blood pressure medication throughout that time to lower it as well as morphine to help with the pain.  The next morning (Day 3) I was finally given the Immunoglobulin (3 bottles = 1 dose). platelets went up to about 60,000. Then I was given a second dose and released on day 4 (but the second dose was not completed in full, only 1 or 2 bottles of the 3 were given. I was released and came back after 2 days for a blood test. I was given steroids to take for a few months.   My platelets were at 120,000. I thought that I was getting better, but then a few days letter came in for another blood test and it showed I was back at 60,000 platelets. Thats where I am now.

For five weeks the symptoms were every day; now they wax and wane randomly every 2-3 days. The symptoms present randomly (i.e. not in the constellation of symptoms I would normally get with an MCAS flareup), which initially was confusing and disorienting. It feels as though something got turned on in my brain and hasn&#39;t turned off. This has seriously and detrimentally affected my quality of life. I now carry a medical Alert device  because I have fallen due to the disequilibrium.  Symptoms listed in alphabetical order: Items marked with @ are new, never before experienced symptoms.     ? Anxiety     ? @ Breathing, sometimes dysregulated     ? Brain fog     ? @ Cognitive: Word finding, rambling, losing track of conversations. 1st shot during acute phase; 2nd shot acute phase then continuing intermittently     ? @ Delirium:          ? Symptoms:             ? Confusion: 1 Day             ? @ Emotions, Heightened, sudden onset with no provocation             ? @ Hallucinations, Auditory: 1/2 day             ? Lightheaded: 1 day. Only during acute phase of delirium (feeling disconnected)         ? Onset: Began with heightened emotions (anger, fear, crying/tearful, depression, joy) late afternoon. The next morning auditory hallucinations, disequilibrium, and confusion; insomnia (slept 2:30-8:30am and intense anger the night before followed by fear then paranoia. The acute phase ended as suddenly as it began about 10:00am - total acute episode lasted about 12 hours. However the heightened emotional state - anger, fear, paranoia, - continued. My handwriting was large, loopy for 2 days.         ? Complication: followed by fear of repetition, concern because cause unknown, and anxiety dreaming for 2 weeks         ? History: I had disequilibrium, confusion and cognitive symptoms in combination only once before, when I had the flu in 2019; duration 1 day     ? Disequilibrium     ? Emotionally labile, random: tearful, sad, depressed, scared. Began with delirium but has continued intermittently with flare-ups     ? Fingers, Icy cold: began during acute phase on same day as delirium, and lasted 4 weeks; continues wit cold fingers during intermittent flare-ups     ? @ Heart rate, resting, rapid - 10-14 beats above normal for 2 weeks     ? Incontinence and urgency: urinary and gastro     ? Senses Heightened or changed:          ? Light (photophobia) and Sound (hyperacusis) sensitive         ? @ Smell heightened (hyperosmia)         ? Taste, Metallic     ? Sexual arousal, low level, random and unexpected: briefly for a few minutes several times during acute phase; a few times during intermittent flare-ups     ? Sleep, disrupted: Insomnia and Insufficient     ? @ Swallowing, difficulty: suddenly unable to swallow water (it got &#39;stuck&#39;) usually on days I have dysregulated breathing     ? Tinnitus, increased exponentially: Volume, Duration and Spiking;  began fter 1st shot and became even worse after the 2nd shot. I have not yet returned to baseline     ? @ Tremors, hands and arms: after mild exertion and/or fine work such as sewing or using mouse to edit photos.     ? Vision: Blurred, Diplopia (I have Adie&#39;s Tonic Pupil): Increases during acute phase; intermittent with flareups.  Other:      ? Sudden onset Sinus Congestion, edema, itching and sneezing 12 hours after 1st and 2nd shots and lasted about 4-5 days.     ? Fatigue, edema, joint pain, muscle pain, Rosacea flare, canker sores flare all continuing during flareups.     ? To reiterate: Symptoms became exponentially heightened in Frequency, Intensity and Duration, and occur randomly - not in the constellation that I&#39;m used for MCAS or Dysautonomia or Tinnitus.

                                                On the morning after receiving the vaccine I had severe pain in my left hip, across my shoulders and lower back. I had a golf trip planned so I drove friends from and played 9 holes of golf that afternoon. I took Tylenol every four hours and the pain eased. I felt tired that day but the next day the pain was minor and I was not as tired.I played 18 holes of golf and played 9 on the following day and drove home. The first day of my trip when I had a bowel movement I noticed a strange acidic smell. All that day every time I ate I had a bowel movement, which is RARE for me. I usually go once in the morning. Also when I had to urinate I had to go IMMEDIATELY. The urination issue improved after the 3rd day but I continue to have the bowel problem and a mild headache and just don&#39;t feel well. I am mostly concerned about the bowel problem. I have to go every time I eat. Sometimes it is somewhat normal and sometimes it is like diarrhea.

I tried to get up but couldn&#39;t and managed to get out of the spot I was in but unable to get up. I continued to try but was unable to. after two hours of moving, trying to get up and resting where I was I managed to get to my bedroom (a distance of under 12feet).  I felt like my muscles weren&#39;t working properly. I called 911 to help me get off the floor and was taken to the closest ER. By 7am on March 12th I was able to get up and walk on my own. Although my arms and legs are bruised I feel much better today.

Her outpatient workup included positive ANA and anti-SSA.  She was then referred to Rheumatology for new diagnosis of Lupus.  6/11/2021 she was referred to the hospital for management of acute lupus flair.  On admission she was found to have acute kidney injury and thrombocytopenia. AIR team was consulted given concern for active lupus, she was started prednisone as well as Plaquenil.   On 6/17/2021, she brought emergently to MICU for lethargy, WOB, hypoxia, and new onset A-Fib. She was intubated and continued to clinically deteriorate with persistent lactic acidosis.  An ECHO showed severely depressed EF and right heart dysfunction.  On 6/17/2021 she experienced PEA arrest with 6 minutes of CPR.  She was placed on VA ECMO with Impella.   Patient was extubated on 6/19/2021 and was reintubated on 6/20/201 for hemoptysis.  A CT on that day showed RP bleed on the left with extension into the left thigh and ground glass opacities throughout suggestive of ARDS.  She tolerated a slow ECMO wean and was explanted successfully on 06/23. She was extubated on 06/25.    Over the next several days she was able to be successfully weaned from HFNC and was transitioned to NC. On 6/28 she passed her swallow evaluation and was okayed for a PO diet. Plan is to transition patient to the floor in the next few days

                                                The evening of the vaccine, at about 10pm I suddenly was unable to get up from the couch and I had an episode of incontinence.  I had to shout for my husband who was asleep in the bedroom to come help me.  He had me hold onto his neck and he lifted me, transferred me to a chair, pushed me into the bedroom and transferred me to the bed.  Overnight I experienced incontinence again, was still not able to stand or walk and my husband had to help me to the bathroom.  The next morning I was not able to walk and was very tired and weak.  My husband pulled me into a chair and pushed me to the dining room.  I had a small amount of yogurt and after 2- 3 hours needed to go bad to bed and slept to evening.  After waking I was still weak and had not appetite.  During the second night I was able to go to the bathroom unassisted. After three days I was feeling back to normal.

                                                I got my second vaccine on 2-24. For 2 days after the vaccine, I experienced chills, a high fever (102), sweats, and overall body aches. By 2-28, I was feeling tired but no symptoms. By March 3, I started to experience severe exhaustion again, plus unusual brain fog, and paresthesia. I went to ER and was checked for stroke. Given MRI and blood tests. Some energy returned by 3-6. On 3-9, severe fatigue returned along with increased cognitive confusion. I was unable to function as I was sleeping up to 15 hours a day 3 or 4 x&#39;s a week. I had to stop working. I was referred to a rheumatologist in March and started getting blood tests. Blood tests show high titers of AMA, ANA,RNAl.Doc suspected AI disease and begin elimination testing. In May 2021, I had a liver fibroscan, ultra sound,  and biopsy. Biopsy showed bile duct inflammation. In early June 2021, a gastroenterologist, gave Dx of Primary Biliary Cholangitis. Rx Eursodiol. (Rheumotologist had Rx Hydroxychlorquine before PCB Dx but I never started that.) I have been taking Ursodiol for 2 weeks. Still battling fatigue but it is lessening. I still get fatigued if I do simple adult activities like grocery shop, do light house cleaning, go out for simple dinner.

I took my pulse and it was going up to 123. My oxygen saturation was good 96-98%. I took my temp and I had a low grade fever. I bought a BP monitor and my BP was as high as 145/88 and fluctuated throughout the day and would go back down. I went to an Urgent Care. I got an urinalysis and it was positive for UTI. I was prescribed a medication called Macrobid for the UTI and referred to a cardiologist. By the time I went to see the specialist, most of my symptoms had subside. I went to the cardiologist and did an ECHO and had to wear a monitor. Everything came back normal and all my symptoms has subsided except a little short of breath.

                                                Sent: 3/4/2021   7:55 AM Subject: Non-Urgent Medical Question                    For a full week now, I have been battling diarrhea and a very hyperactive stomach and intestines. Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).  Patient presented to outlying emergency room with flank pain &amp; transferred here with severe bilateral hydronephrosis on imaging.  Patient had severe left flank pain about 2 weeks ago. Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.  Nothing has made it better.  Patient has tried ice, heat, tramadol Tylenol, Motrin, steroids and pain persists.  Additionally patient having nausea and vomiting.  She has started to have burning with urination.  Pain is excruciating stabbing.  Radiates to the groin.  Patient has also started running fevers today.  She feels pretty miserable.   Also patient notes difficulty with her bowels since her last surgery.  Prior to surgery she took Linzess every day.  Since surgery it has been suggested she does not need this medication.  Patient does note little to no notice when her bowels decide to move.  Severe significant gas.  Other times patient feels quite constipated.   UA suggests possible infection with positive nitrites, 1&#43; leukocyte esterase and 3&#43; blood.  WBC 2.1, Cr 1.0, K 3.0 CT scan with multiple abnormalities, but most notably severe bilateral hydronephrosis without obvious obstructing lesion.  Multiple scattered nodular densities concerning for metastatic disease.    Patient transferred for higher level of care and urology consultation.

                                                After the first inoculation I had some transient pains in my head, and a few hive like welts, some tiredness.  Then I had the second inoculation.  The morning of 3/11/21 I woke up sweating with a fever and this very strange feeling was rolling through my body, from my head, down to my toes, then back up to my head and on and on.  I took my temperature and it was 100.5 F. Also, I had begun breaking out in a few hive-like red welts on my legs, arms, stomach, back,  maybe 8 to 10, hard to tell,  but strange looking, unusual,  and uncomfortable.  Then around that Wednesday, the 16th, my urine was brownish and smelled smoky.  I had not taken any supplements in days. The next day it was beige, smoky, then the next day bright yellow.  The next day it went back to normal. More welts.   EXTREME exhaustion.  Then  on  the 18th I developed chills and more itching and welts. One on my face.  One or two on my scalp.  More around my waist, arms, neck, and legs.  I am still having intermittent chills and hives/welts, and EXTREME  tiredness.  I have a cold sore in my mouth or throat, I can&#39;t tell exactly where.

                                                Got the vaccine and they had her pull over as she had already had a reaction to the first one.  All of a sudden she felt like her lip was swelling, and her tongue swelling, her face was a little red.  She then had trouble breathing, and thought it may have been anxiety.   She also has had headaches which have lasted for about 11 days, and depression.  Her breathing was getting worse and the nurse came over and told her that she was having problems breathing and started coughing.  She had Benadryl with her and she was advised to take that, and took 2 puffs of her inhaler.  She stopped coughing as much, and was able to drive home within 10 minutes.  She went home and realized that she was hyper, advised to take more Benadryl.  It did not make her sleepy and did help with the allergic reaction.  A friend saw her and told her that she was wired.  She keeps having the coughing fits and breathing problems, and was thinking she was going into anaphylaxis.   She also has had some confusion.  She then went to the doctor on 3/25/21 due to urinary symptoms and had a UTI.  Within the first couple of days she was having coughing bouts and was wondering if she should go the UC or not, wheezy type feeling.  Her doctor gave her antibiotics and told her to use inhalers.  She went back to the doctor on Monday 3/29/21, did a chest x-ray which was clear.   She still thought that she was wheezy and ordered a new inhaler which she has been using, and still having coughing fits even today.  She has been taking Benadryl every night since the vaccine which has not made her sleepy.   The antibiotics seem to have helped the chest symptoms, but she is still coughing.

                                                Upon awakening: severe aching all over body similar to flu; a feeling of deep lethargy, mental fog, and difficulty in moving and rising from bed due to a feeling of heaviness.  Left upper arm VERY stiff, painful and difficult to raise, although I had applied an ice gel pack to it on and off on the day of receiving the injection. No redness or swelling.  Soles of both feet burning, very painful to walk.  Occasional twinges of very sharp stabbing pain where big toe adjoins right foot, about once or twice per hour, pains lasting about 20 seconds each.  Unusual urinary urgency and frequency, with difficulty holding it back before getting to the bathroom.  Uncomfortable feeling of fullness and burning in left breast.... Due mental fog and some dizziness, and pain with walking and moving about, I was unable to do most normal daily activities or work at my job.  I spent the whole day in bed and tried to sleep as much as possible.  Also applied a heating pad intermittently to left upper arm to help with pain.  All symptoms worsened throughout the day and evening.  After dozing in bed throughout the day, I fell soundly asleep between 7:00 and 7:30 PM on April 9 with all symptoms still fully present.  After sleeping soundly for approximately 6 hours, I awakened at 1:00 AM on April 10 and immediately realized that every symptom described here had disappeared.  There was absolutely no trace of any of the symptoms, not even any residual soreness left in my arm.  I felt perfectly well and strong and normal and that has continued.  The only strange thing was that when I awakened at 1:00 AM on April 10 feeling well, even though I was perfectly cool upon awakening and had also not registered ANY fever when taking my temperature throughout the whole day of April 9, my entire body was drenched with perspiration upon awakening, including my hair, which was dripping wet, comparable to what might be experienced after a high fever.

Fatigue and weakness during the whole week after the vaccine.  I couldn&#39;t eat or drink for 2 days and couldn&#39;t go for my usual walk for 4 days, and even then I wore out.  No desire yet to do anything but sleep. I was diagnosed with a UTI on 03-24-2021, so am having pain from that now, too.  Haven&#39;t had one of those since 2019, so there could be some correlation  there...I just don&#39;t feel well, like I used to.

My neck, shoulders, arms, thighs, and back were swollen;  I had difficulty moving from one side to the other because of pain and swelling;  3. Ibuprofen did nothing.  I took two every four hours.  4. By 8:30 AM, today, Saturday, I began to feel better. I took three Ibuprofens instead of two. Edema went down; only my back is a little swollen and achy. I was able to eat breakfast and walk around a little.

                                                Patient is a 69-year-old female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, RA, GERD who presented from a rehab facility with fevers, hypotension, tachycardia and diarrhea.  This is the patient&#39;s third hospitalization in the last month.  She was initially admitted on 5/4/2021 for she suffered to syncopal episodes resulting in a motor vehicle accident x 2.  From 5/4-5/6.  During that admission her gabapentin dose was decreased and she was given 5 days of Macrobid on discharge for a possible urinary tract infection.  We also arrange follow-up with cardiology for loop recorder and to see orthopedics as an outpatient the etiology for her syncopal episode was unclear.  It was not felt to be seizure related.  She went home with home health care.  She unfortunately was readmitted on 5/29-6/3 new onset acute pancreatitis with an unknown etiology and was ultimately discharged to rehab.  During that hospitalization patient reported that she was seen by cardiology for her 2 syncopal episodes that occurred earlier in the month and a cardiac cause of her syncope was ruled out and they recommended she be referred to neurology.  She returns back again for admission on 6/8 for encephalopathy, hypotensive, septic shock, NSTEMI and was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit on pressor support.  She was given Cipro, Flagyl, Vanco and Levophed and IV fluids.  Her septic shock was felt secondary to urinary tract infection.  The urine culture that was resulted on 5/30 grew Klebsiella pneumonia that was resistant to Macrobid.  She was not sent out on any antibiotic therapy as she was not felt to be symptomatic during her last hospital course.  She also had a CAT scan during this hospital course which showed colitis.  Urine culture from this admission was of mixed flora Greater than 100,000 colony-forming units no organisms were grown out however.  She was treated with 7 days of Cipro.  Again patient&#39;s CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis done on admission showed colitis she was seen by gastroenterology during her hospital stay and underwent an endoscopy.  It was ultimately felt that the patient&#39;s colitis was likely ischemic in nature.  Patient was also noted to be thrombocytopenic on admission which was felt to be possibly from sepsis or dilution was ultimately resolved at the point of discharge.  She also again was found to have acute blood loss anemia with no source found.  she had hematochezia noted on admission but resolved by the point of discharge.  EGD did not reveal any source of bleeding other than a tiny esophageal ulcer.  Aspirin therapy was discontinued.  She did not need transfusion during her hospital stay.  The lowest her hemoglobin went was to 7.3.  Patient&#39;s acute tubular necrosis resolved her metabolic acidosis and metabolic encephalopathy resolved and at this point she is stable for discharge to rehab.  Patient&#39;s lisinopril aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide have been discontinued at this point.  Her blood pressure is 121/61 she is afebrile respirations are normal O2 sat is 95% on room air.  Patient&#39;s hemoglobin  is 8.1.  She is no longer having an abdominal pain and is tolerating p.o.  She is not having any diarrhea.   the cause for the patient&#39;s colitis is likely ischemic in nature.  she was discharged to rehab on 6/15

Another friend happened to have a vaccine the next week and said she had the same symptoms afterwards!  No UTI found for her either!   I think that a lot of people may have this and just not put the two together.  I would not have linked it to the vaccine unless my friend had not happened to have the same symptom!

                                                I just woke up and I was completely sweaty. This was the morning after my vaccination. I had my son here and he thought I was going to have a seizure. It was almost like the chills, it would not stop. I was nauseas, I was achy and so sore. I took Tylenol and kept putting cool clothes on my body as best I could. This lasted for about 4 days, I was in bed for those four days. Extreme fatigue. And when I saw very sweaty, my son had to change my sheets for me because they were so wet. A few weeks after that I got extreme pain in my abdomen and I had to have my appendix removed. At that time I was informed that I had the beginning of kidney stones. We have not addressed them because I have had one problem after the next. I did not contact my doctor during that time but did see them afterwards. I was aware of the side effects and figured that was it. I had no energy, no appetite or anything. I did get sick vomiting for four days as well. I still have sore joints, but not as bad. I am trying to cut back on carbohydrates to cut back on inflammation. I handle pain very well usually. My daughter wanted me to go to the hospital. I went to the DR for appendicitis and I ended up very sick from all the antibiotics as well.

                                                Arm was  hurting at injection site; got a fever that evening. I started feeling really really tired. I went to bed. I woke up the next morning, I had an uncontrollable urge to go to the bathroom - bladder was screaming like mad - I was holding the bottom of my stomach as it felt like it was going to fall out. Bladder started leaking before I got there. When finished, I had to shuffle to the foot of my bed (couldn&#39;t pick up my feet). And that was last time I remember when I came to on the opposite side of bed on the floor. Then I tried to get up off the floor and my knees kept collapsing. The weight of my body would shift every time I would try to do something. Scars on my forehead, top of head, knees and elbows from trying to get up. And I couldn&#39;t. I pulled the charging cord to my phone off the night stand and called my daughter. She came and asked me the time and I thought it was 7 something. It was 9 something by then. There was not a muscle in my body that would hold me up. I was a rag doll. She put my arms over her back and stood up and pushed me on to the bed and had to take the rest of the body and turn it right on the bed because I couldn&#39;t move it. Spent the first week in bed. The biggest thing was to go to the bathroom and it took forever. I was shuffling so slow, I was using my toes to make my feet move. I couldn&#39;t sit up in bed - I would just slide down. Couldn&#39;t get in to see my doctor - spoke to him on the phone. Dr called the Paramedics/fire dept. I was trying to go from my bedroom to my front door to undo the security lock thing for the building but I didn&#39;t get there before they did and they found a way to unlock my door. They did check up with vitals - blood pressure; heart rate; temperature. They didn&#39;t find anything wrong. I had to promise them that my daughter would take me  March 23  -  Urgent Care that night. I shuffled back to their COVID Urgent room; doctor checked me over and said he needed to take bloodwork and x-ray to see my head. Went to facility right across the street for that. Visually they could see something was wrong but the tests don&#39;t show anything wrong. He  (my doctor) thinks that what happened was caused by a clash between the vaccine and the Neurontin (Gabapentin). They don&#39;t know what to do to undo what has happened. Still have a loss of muscle strength -it has improved about 25% from what it originally was.

                                                I woke up at 6 AM and had pressure on my chest. I walked 2 miles and came home. I took my BP, which is normally 120/70, but this time it was about 167/92. I kept checking it throughout the day. The highest it got was 212/94. The next day, on 6/23, I went to the doctor. They took my BP, which was still high. The nurse practitioner asked me questions. I had an EKG and blood work done. Nothing abnormal showed up on the EKG. I was then sent to the ER. Another EKG was done and more blood work was done. My blood pressure was 215/102 at the ER. I was given nitroglycerin, which brought the BP down. I was kept under observation for a couple of hours and then sent home. The next day, I got a call informing me I had a UTI. I was given fluconazole, nitrofurantoin mono. I took them for 5 days. I&#39;m still having a little pressure on my chest, but maybe it&#39;s the heat. I&#39;m still walking and using my exercise bike. I decided to fill out the VAERS report, because I know of 2 other people who developed a UTI after getting the vaccines. During the follow-up doctor visit on 6/29, my BP was taken and he talked to me, but no tests were done.

I felt well enough and went to get my 2nd dose 5/1/2021 ( lot 032B21A IMRA).    I had the same symptom of arm pain that lasted about a week and I felt recovered.  On 6/15/2021 at 5AM I had awoken with severe pelvic pain and lower back pain, chills and sweats. I called the ambulance and was taken the ER (Wilmington Hospital).   At the hospital,  they did an ultrasound and found a kidney stone.  I was discharged to go home and rest and drink a lot of water. I made an appointment to see my doctor and saw him on 7/1/2021 and was prescribed Tamsulosin to help flush out my kidney stone.  I still have my kidney stone which has not been flushed out yet.   I am going to follow up with my urologist.

                                                Leading up to my adverse event, I had been feeling more and more tired. I did not have any problems breathing, I just felt tired. I ability to walk had decreased. I noticed it had been going on for some time. I noticed it, but I didn&#39;t get concerned because it could have been related to the muscles from my eye condition. I started to feel a decrease in energy all around. The day, 05/30/2021, my husband was not home. I was home alone. I had a zoom call, with some of my friends, and as we were hanging up on the call, I started to feel as if I were going to faint. I did not have any other symptoms besides fainting. My mind felt clear. I had my cell phone next to me, and I texted my friends and told them how I was feeling. I ran to my bathroom because I had to use the restroom. I sat there and felt like I was fighting fainting. My friends called me and I was having problems speaking. I told them I was fainting and I needed their help. They called an ambulance for me, but they are out of state, so there were problems. I contacted someone closer to me to make a call for an ambulance. I was only able to text by dictation, I couldn&#39;t type anything. My friend who I called, came over to my house right away. I had to get myself out of the restroom and make it to my front door to let her in. It was difficult. She called 9-1-1 when she got to my house. The paramedics gave me a baby aspirin right away. I felt that I could talk better after taking it. They gave me nitroglycerin as well. They put me in the ambulance and I stayed awake and alert the whole ride. They took me to The Hospital and took me right in for surgery. I was experiencing a heart attack. I had a couple of stints put in and they did it through the groin area. I was alert through this surgery. I felt sensations, but I did not feel any pain. I am now taking a baby aspirin, carvedilol (coreg) 3.125 mg (2 in the AM, 1 at PM), Plavix 5mg (1 per day) and Rosuvastatin 20mg (1 per day). Since I have had the surgery, I noticed that I have had some blood in my urine. I am following up with a Urologist to see what is going on. She wants to put a scope up my urethra to see if she can find anything.  As of today, I feel so much better than I did. I can walk better and move more quickly now. I&#39;m very thankful for the doctors at the hospital and how they handled me.

On 29 Jan 2021, the patient experienced cellulitis at the injection site.    On 02 Feb 2021, the patient experienced red spots around the injection site, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, kidneys started to fail, and blood pressure 60/24 (no units or reference range provided).  The patient was hospitalized from 04 Feb 2021 to 07 Feb 2021.    Treatment for the events included hydration, unspecified antibiotics, and levid for blood pressure.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events of cellulitis at the injection site, red spots around the injection site, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, kidneys started to fail, and blood pressure 60/24 was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2&#43; to 3 and slightly brisk, 1&#43; at both ankles and 1&#43; and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.  We will continue to follow.  While admitted to this facility, she was treated with IV dexamethasone 2/14-2/21  She was admitted to an inpatient hospital 2/14-2/23 and discharged to an inpatient rehab unit at a different health system.

She is now having incontinence issues after the vaccine as well, is on medication that was working just fine prior. Pt now has swelling, redness, and blood vessel flare ups in her left ankle that hasn&#39;t occurred in a long time. Feels like the vaccine has exasperated some of her medical conditions.

                                                Began to feel feverish around or slightly before 9:30, when chills &amp; shivering began.  Could not sleep due to shivering.  Got up around 1 AM to go to bathroom- was VERY weak &amp; needed help.  Also while getting to bathroom began to lose control over kidneys and was urinating involuntarily.   Had urge to to go the bathroom again around 3;  30.  This time could NOT walk at all &amp; was once again urinating involuntarily.  Tried to just go back to bed, but did not seem to have any control over my body.  Around 4:30 I got as comfortable as possible on the floor &amp; slept  off &amp; on until around 8:30.  When I woke up I was able with  help to get back into bed. I had continued to urinate involuntarily during the time I was sleeping prior to 8:30.   The symptoms seemed to gradually subside after this point.  Called Neurologist,  thinking that my radiation induced nerve damage was involved in my reaction and she agreed.

She states that several hours later she began feeling globally weak and with coordination difficulties intermittently (gives example that she would be feeding self, then have difficulty getting utensil to mouth and noted sudden collapse of LE when standing, &#34;they just gave out&#34; and feels that difficulty coordinating her legs led to inability to stand- adamant that it is coordination rather than fatigue or weakness at issue). She feels symptoms in extremities are bilateral and symmetric. Denies prodrome prior to falls, denies LOC but states she fell onto her face and did not &#34;catch&#34; herself &#34;it happened too fast&#34;. She has been able to ambulate with assistance to bathroom and in her house in recent days. Denies paresthesias, numbness to groin or perineum. She has been constipated, which is new for her with last BM 4/17 no GIB. Pt denies dysuria or difficulties with urination, though she tells me she has not voided since yesterday.

She was reportedly in her recliner for approximately 12-18 hrs prior to being brought in via EMS. In the ED her b/l LE extremity was cold to touch and mottled. Her toes were white and nail beds blue. No pulses were found on Doppler on either extremity. She was also noted to be in a.fib with RVR. Doppler of LE showed extensive occlusive thrombus. Bedside echo showed the RV severely dilated with mobile thrombus and EF 20-25%. Given these findings there is a very high probability of massive PE, however given current situation of AKI and instability CT was unable to be performed. She was given TPA and admitted to ICU. Pt was started heparin gtt, as well as levophed and dobutamine for obstructive and cardiogenic shock as her troponin, kidney function, lactate and liver function all were elevated.  Of note pt lives in a hoarding situation and lives a sedentary lifestyle and reportedly only gets up from recliner to use the bathroom. Pt also has a 96 pack year history but was noted in her medical chart  to have quit smoking in 2017.

The patient was treated with PARACETAMOL (TYLENOL) on 13-Mar-2021 for Fever, at an unspecified dose and frequency; ONDANSETRON (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) for Candida of mouth, at an unspecified dose and frequency; PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (PHENERGAN [PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) on 19-Apr-2021 for Candida infection, at an unspecified dose and frequency; DOXYCYCLINE for Urinary tract infection, at an unspecified dose and frequency; FLUCONAZOLE (DIFLUCAN) at an unspecified dose and frequency and PHOSPHORUS at an unspecified dose and frequency. On 09-Apr-2021, PYREXIA (fever) had resolved. On 14-Apr-2021, ORAL CANDIDIASIS (candida in her throat) had resolved. At the time of the report, UNRESPONSIVE TO STIMULI (unresponsive to stimuli), NEUROPATHY PERIPHERAL (neuropathy in both legs and has fallen 3 times), WEIGHT DECREASED (She had lost 25 lbs but she had gained back 3 lbs), WALKING AID USER (started using a cane and progressed to a walker), FALL (fallen 3 times) and URINARY TRACT INFECTION (urinary tract infections) outcome was unknown and DIARRHOEA (diarrhea), DEHYDRATION (dehydrated), NAUSEA (nausea), VOMITING (vomiting) and CHILLS (chills) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 14-May-2021, Blood magnesium: low (Low) low. On 14-May-2021, Blood phosphorus: low (Low) low. On 14-May-2021, Endoscopy: candida in throat (abnormal) candida in  throat. On 14-May-2021, Renal impairment: normal (normal) normal. On 14-May-2021, Sigmoidoscopy normal: normal (normal) normal.         By 19 Apr 2021, the transplant team office was called as she was not responding. They ran bloodwork and found the Diflucan had caused issues with the tacrolimus which she takes for the kidney transplant. They went to the hospital on 10 May 2021 and 11 May 2021 but could not wait. She was finally admitted on 12 May 2021. On 14 May 2021 another endoscopy showed that the candida was better. Bloodwork indicated her phosphorus was critically low and magnesium was low. She was given fluids and phosphorus. Her kidney function test was normal. She was released on 16 May 2021.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However subject&#39;s use of steroids can be a confounding factor to oral candidiasis. Furthermore the interaction between Diflucan and Tacrolimus can also be a confounding factor.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-169089 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

At baseline she is alert and oriented to self, she has a guardian. It appears she was noted to be more somnolent than usual at her facility and found to be hypoxemic so was sent to ER for further evaluation. She required 4L oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain saturation. On arrival to ER, her labs were notable for mild AKI, troponin elevation, leukocytosis and positive COVID19 PCR. Chest xray was consistent with patchy bilateral lower lobe airspace disease. CT Head showed a chronic large right MCA infarct without acute hemorrhagic changes

I went and had breakfast and then i got the chills, then i started sitting up but i felt awful so i went back to bed and dizziness weakness headache, redness around injection site.  My whole left side felt like it was achy and almost like it was numb. I lost bladder control, I had a couple of accidents.  I stayed in bed until next day, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t eat. Got up Saturday, not feeling good, queasy, diarrhea but not as bad as Friday. Every time i would try to do something i would fall asleep. went and had covid test for surgery. Sunday I felt better but not to par. Today i feel the best so far.  Put antibiotic cream on injection site because it was itching, and it is still hard and warm to touch.  Today i have a small cough that I didn&#39;t have before.

                                                That afternoon I walked, but cut it off at just over 2 miles as I was getting tired. Around 6 I had bad chills, a low fever 99.9, Around 8 nauseous and headache, 9:30 I started throwing up with urination at the same time.. This happened maybe 4 times until around 3 am.. I was really weak. Over temp around 101. On 29th: Took 2 Advil and kept the water down. Slept all day and weak, Hurt all over especially the entire left arm and hips.  Temp 102.6 overnight..  On 30th, Temp stayed just over 100, took Advil, ate soup and slept most of day. Around 4 pm temp down to 99. On 31th, Sunday, I will could do much, but did sit up much of day and ate light meal. Fever broke in the afternoon. I did not call a doctor as I always thought I would be better soon. On Monday, Feb 1, I went for my previously scheduled Mammograms. The next day I received a call that I needed to come back. When I went in on the 8th for more mammogram views and ultrasounds, they found 3 places of concern. I am scheduled for a needle biopsy on this Thursday.. I told them that I had received my Covid19 vaccinations and they mentioned that they have seen differences in tissue after the shots. I did not see a doctor on the first and not sure if the breast tissue or mass is a consequence or not.

Went to the bathroom, urinated, took Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke again at 2:00 a.m, still chilled, and tried to stand up and my legs wouldn&#39;t hold me. I managed to lift myself to my feet and clutching furniture get to the bathroom, with complete loss of bladder control on the way. Took more Tyleonol, drank more water, put on clean pajamas but couldn&#39;t lift my knees to step into them, had to put them on the floor and pull them up. Went to sleep eventually. When I woke at about 5 a.m., all was completely normal. No fever, legs fine, usual bladder control.

The room was spinning, I fell down, vomited and peed.  I laid there for a while until I realized if I closed my eyes the room would stop spinning.  I got up off the floor, back into bed and stayed there for about 5 hours.  When I woke up, I was still dizzy, but not nearly as bad.   The dizzyness and nausia still hits me several times a day.

About 2 minutes after shot, felt light headed and like the shot contained adrenalin or epinephrine. That subsided by the time I left the site, although I remained slightly light headed all evening. Went to bed at 10:00 with an extremely sore arm, beginning of body aches and fever of 99.3. Awoke at 1:00am with 101.9 temp, extreme muscle and joint pain, and every time I moved anything, even a finger I would feel the sensation of a chill or slight electric shock. Urinated every hour from 1:00am and 5:00 am. When I awoke at 5:00 I was so weak, nauseated and dripping sweat I barely got my dog fed and let out for the morning. The nausea passed quickly but I thought I was going to have to lie down on the floor during that wave.Went back to bed, slept until 7:00 and was pretty much a zombie until 6:00pm last night(March 10) when all exhaustion and muscle pain disappeared and I have been fine since then.

                                                Late Saturday afternoon starting not feeling well. Sunday didn&#39;t feel good , cold and then I started coughing, asthma, and none of my usual meds helped.  Late evening Sunday the fever broke, but not the coughing and this continued until Thursday morning. I have a massage therapist friend that thought she could help the lymphatic system with a massage and it did. I saw her again Saturday morning and the cough stopped. Sunday afternoon started a UTI infection and had to get antibiotics on Thursday and still have to get more since it didn&#39;t clear up. In the meantime my whole body ached and when I went to the dentist my BP was elevated.  4/2 I felt the worst of all the days since the shot. On the 3rd started feeling better and yesterday my BP was good and just took it and it up again, but hadn&#39;t been elevated prior to the shot. In fact I felt fairly well prior to the shot. Based on how I&#39;ve felt since the shot I&#39;m electing not to take the 2nd shot.

Hospital course: 74 y.o. female admitted on 4/8/2021 for abdominal pain. Notable PMHx: aortic valve replacement, HTN   On morning of admission, patient woke up with severe epigastric pain.  Describes pain as a pressure.  Has had vomiting.  Had bowel movement after pain started.  Patient came to the emergency room.  Patient received an antiemetic and Demerol.  Patient has continued to have pain in got a dose of morphine as well.  Pain eased some but was still 7/10.  In the ER, blood pressure was very elevated with systolic in 200s.  Cardiac enzymes negative.  EKG look good with normal sinus rhythm.  Patient has aortic valve replacement and is on Coumadin with INR goal of 2.5-3.5.  INR was elevated at 4.3.  D-dimer was negative.  Amylase and lipase negative.  Creatinine normal at 0.9.  Chest x-ray done which showed no acute disease.  On the floor, we ordered a CT abdomen.  It did show gallstones, but nonobstructing.  It showed kidney stones in the renal pelvis, but none obstructing.  No other inflammation or signs of bleeding.  Blood pressure came down after medicines in the ER.  Did have some lower blood pressures through the afternoon evening which was felt to be a combination of blood pressure low in medicines in the ER and pain medication.  From 11:00 p.m. onward blood pressures were controlled.   Patient continued to have severe abdominal pain.  Hemoglobin down to 9.0 from prior 12.4 yesterday.  Creatinine up from 0.9 yesterday to 1.8.  White count up from 8.3 yesterday to 14.4.  INR from 4.3 yesterday to 4.2.  Coumadin was held yesterday.   CT abdomen was repeated. CT abdomen was read as worrisome for necrotic gallbladder and small bile leak Contacted transfer line at hospital.  Surgery accepted and wanted transfer to go through the ER. Patient has PCN allergy.  Surgery said that if reaction was not severe, they wanted Invanz given before she left.  Patient says that she had a itching rash in the 70s.  No trouble breathing or swallowing.  No other reaction.  Dose of Invanz ordered.  IVF were increased.  HPI from hospital: 74 y.o. female who presents with Chief Complaint Patient presents with? Abnormal Scan   Patient presents via EMS as a medical transfer from hospital after having gallbladder necrosis seen on CT imaging.  She was given IV Invanz there.  General surgeon was contacted by that facility and he accepted the patient for transfer to this facility.   Apparently, the patient began having abdominal pain yesterday. Timing of onset was gradual.  Severity is rated as severe at maximum intensity. Quality is described as aching abdominal pain.  Symptoms have been improved after IV pain medicine.  Symptoms worsen with nothing, and improve with IV pain medicine.     History was provided by patient, EMS, transfer paperwork and EMR, and I spoke with treating doctor in general surgery who accepted the patient for transfer.

                                                Patient started having some low-grade chills and aches around 3/2/21.  Her first COVID-19 vaccine was received on 3/1/21, so she was originally attributing these symptoms to the vaccine.  She has had some diarrhea.  Mild headache, muscle aches.  However, she started to develop some dyspnea on exertion and mild cough that is nonproductive.  When she realized her sister was having symptoms of COVID and tested positive and she had had some mild exposures to her, she realizes she might have active COVID infection and was tested positivity on 3/6.  She has had poor appetite and poor oral intake compared to average.  On 3/12, she became weak, fatigued, having diarrhea, and a difficult time urinating, advised to ED by PCP. So, patient was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonitis on 3/12. Received dexamethasone 3/12 to 3/21.  Discharged home on 3/19/21 with supplemental oxygen.

I couldn&#39;t run or walk up stairs or a slight grade without getting out of breath. I sought medical attention on 4/27/2021. The Dr. heard wheezing and chest sounds for which he prescribed Flovet. I have never taken an inhaler before this time.  Concurrent with the shortness of breath, I had a urinary infection.  I have not had one in at least 30 years.  I was prescribed Sulfamethoxazole, and took two rounds. I had a second positiveurinalysis, and prescribed Ciprofloxacin HCLon 04/29/2021.

                                                May 18 I received my first Covid Moderna Vaccination.  4 hours later when I went to urinate there was blood on the toilet paper. It only lasted about 3-4 minutes.  2 hours after that I went to the bathroom again to urinate and it burned really bad.  I called my doctor and was able to see her the next morning ( May 19)  She sent my urine in for a culture and it came back as a Urinary Tract Infection. She treated me with Cipro for 3 days. She felt that I should see my GYN regarding the bleeding and felt that it is Post Menopausal Bleeding. I saw my GYN on June 7. She did a Pap Smear and it came back normal but it showed that I have a Bacterial Vaginitis infection and treated me with Metronidazole Vaginal Gel for 5 days. Today June 14 is my last day for that. But when I went to the bathroom to urinate there was some blood again on the toilet paper. I don&#39;t know if all this is a coincidence or if this is a reaction to the vaccination. My doctor doesn&#39;t think it is a reaction but I want to make sure since I was fine till I was vaccinated. I am concerned because I had no sign of the bleeding or the burning before I got the vaccination. I am also concerned because my next vaccination is tomorrow June 15. If I don&#39;t get the second one then is the 1st one not going to be valid. If I do get the second one could I have a worse problem with bleeding and UTI? Due to the bleeding I have to have a vaginal ultrasound and depending on the results I might have to have an endometrial biopsy.

On 2/7  had redness and local swelling at site of injection.  Next day 2/8 rash on chest then broke out face, neck , abdomen, back.  Was seen in local ER where she was diagnosed with an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  Treated Solumedrol, Toradol, lorazepam, Benadryl  and Pepcid and dishcarged with Rx for Prednisone and advised to continue Benadryl and Pepcid.  Rash worsened, became purple and morbilliform on face, arms, legs, back and abdomen over next 3 d.  Was seen by PCP on 2/11.  Prednisone increased to 40 mg x 3 d.  Rash improved with this and was resolving by the time I examined her on 2/15/2021.  Face was beginning to peel but had no  mucosal surface involvement.

                                                My mother, the patient, received the shot at 3:00 pm on a Wednesday. By 3:00 am Thursday morning, my mother became very weak and was unable to walk to the bathroom. She needed to be carried. The next morning she was very weak and needed to be dressed. She was also very subdued and &#34;loopy&#34;. She ate breakfast and hearty bean soup for lunch, but by 4:00 pm Thursday she became nauseous and was running a low fever around 99. We gave her a NyQuil dose which she quickly vomited. From there she continued to vomit and her temperature went up. When she needed to use the restroom, I escorted her, but by the time we reached that area she could not follow instructions to sit down and was holding onto the door jamb. She had soiled herself while standing there.  Eventually I was able to get her to sit down and was able to clean her up and change her clothes. But she could not follow instructions to stand up. With a second caregiver, we were able to get her to stand up, but within three steps of the toilet her knees buckled and she was unable to stand. We sat her in a walker with a seat and rechecked her temperature. It had gone up to 103. At this time, we considered calling 911, but instead we put a cool cloth on the back of her neck and monitored her (with three people all standing round). After a while we were able to move her back to the family room where she insisted upon sitting on the couch. She was able to stand up from the walker and move a few steps to the couch. By 10 pm she was starting to drift off to sleep sitting up and her temperature was back down around 99. When we were putting her to bed, she had no memory of where the clothes had come from or why she was not in her original outfit. Following that she slept and did not have another worrisome episode. She did complain of her arm hurting for several days and that it was itchy at the injection site. I did not observe any swelling or rashes on her.

                                                Night following shot, I slept badly and felt cold all night.  When I wanted to get up to go to the bathroom around 5:30 AM, I could not get myself off and out of the bed.  It was like my legs wouldn&#39;t work. When I was finally up, I had no control of my bladder and urinated all the way into my bathroom. When I was done on the toilet, I started to stand up and lost my balance. I tried to reach for the door jam but missed and fell backwards onto the toilet and sat hard and hit my back very hard against the top of the toilet.  I helped back to bed by boyfriend but had to get up several more times that morning and had the same weakness in my legs and no control over my bladder. My boyfriend had to leave to go home, so I called my sister to come and stay with me in case I couldn&#39;t get up again. One she was here, I ate a small amount of roast chicken and slept most of the afternoon. I slept thru the night and felt stronger the next day. I felt very tired and sleepy for the next couple of days, but (3 days later) am now feeling and moving in a more normal manner.

                                                Pt presented to acute care on 5/21/21 following 2 weeks of SOB, intermittent low grade fever and fatigue.  Labs and chest XR ordered.  Diagnosed with UTI and placed on Omnicef 300 mg BID x 7 days.    Follow up in clinic on 5/24/21 for continuation of symptoms:  SOB, intermittent low grade fever/chills, dry cough.   Pt prescribed albuterol and labs ordered.  Follow up in clinic on 5/26/21 for ongoing SOB, intermittent low grade fever, dry cough, anemia, abnormal liver function.  Ordered ECG 12 lead and sent to emergency department.  Admitted to hospital 5/26/21 :  During hospitalization patient was diuresed with Bumex, she put out a net of approximately 2.4 L and then developed an AKI suggestive of intravascular depletion.  Diuretics were stopped, confirmed that BNP down trended and was within normal range. Patient had negative troponins throughout hospitalization.  Her free T4 and TSH was within normal limits.  She had mild electrolyte disturbances secondary to diuretics which were replaced.  She had a respiratory viral panel completed, did not identify any source.  Patient is Covid negative.  ANA and ANCA screen were sent out unfortunately they will be delayed.  #SVT: Patient went into an SVT rate of 150 required adenosine which showed underlying sinus rhythm.  Started on amiodarone drip briefly which did help maintain sinus rhythm although she had hypotension with that.  Cardiology was consulted during hospitalization.  Despite SVT troponins remain negative.  TSH and free T4 within normal limits.  #Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure #Suspected viral cardiomyopathy #Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Patient remains with good saturation off oxygen.  She is net -2.0 L from diuresis.  Weight is down approximately 4.4 kg.  Started on metoprolol, unfortunately due to hypotension had to decrease the dose to 25 mg daily.  Aspirin 81 mg daily was provided.  Currently holding diuretics but may need to be reassessed for restarting this in the future.  ANA and ANCA pending.  #Leukocytosis #Increase inflammatory markers #Sepsis with organ dysfunction No clear-cut source of infection but she did have pyuria with leukocyte esterase.  She could also have had atypical pneumonia.  The concern is that patient could have an underlying inflammatory process versus autoimmune process contributing to it end organ damage.  At this point I cannot tell so started empiric treatment with ceftriaxone during hospitalization, complete 5 of 7 days course as well as 3 of 3 days of azithromycin.  Despite this leukocyte continues to be elevated and inflammatory markers continue to be elevated.  #Hypertension: Patient was briefly hypotensive in setting of amiodarone, metoprolol continue to 25 mg after discontinuation of amiodarone.  Will need to be retitrate to goal-directed therapy.  #Hypothyroid: TSH and free T4 within normal limits given the tachycardia holding levothyroxine for 5 days  #Suspected UTI Day 5 of 7 of ceftriaxone currently, initially had 50?100 WBCs positive for pyuria, leukocyte esterase positive no bacteria seen.  #Atypical pneumonia suspected: Completed 3 days of azithromycin  #Elevated LFTs #Elevated alk phos: Unclear as to potential source other than congestive hepatopathy LFTs normalized alk phos downtrending  #Anemia of chronic disease: Possible viral syndrome unclear etiology at this point.  There may be some underlying iron deficiency.  No indication for transfusion during this hospitalization. Patient remained on sodium restricted 2 g daily, and 2 L of fluid restriction diet.  She is a full code and enoxaparin was used for DVT prophylaxis. Hospital transfer today, 6/2/2021 to St. Michaels with no clear unifying diagnosis.  Maybe a pericarditis:  Patient continues to have ST changes on EKG, elevated inflammatory markers, significant JVD, evidence of heart failure on echocardiogram, after speaking with cardiology will likely need a right heart cath

Called on call nurse twice in this 3 day period &amp; they said to go to ER within an hour. She had an underlying UTI hospital said &amp; her body was working ?overtime? with vaccine &amp; UTI. Still was sick for another 2-3 weeks. Took to dr several times to check. Second vaccine - tired, body aches. Has slept much, much more since vaccine. Seems confused &amp; just not THE SAME!  Went to hospital 6/3/21 by ambulance because she wasn?t feeling well - throwing up yellow bile, extremely clammy (sweating), confused, bp when ambulance got to her, 89/60. ER can every test - urine, blood, cat scan, stroke, heart attack. NOTHING. Came back all normal. A mystery. This is 5 months since first vaccine.
