                                                Mild fever,   increased pain in my neck and shoulder that were previously a bit sore from an old injury, my hand felt &#34;tight and sore&#34; and so did the &#34;bones in my head&#34;.  I do suffer from that when we have a storm and one was on the way, but it was more intense than normal. I had 4 bouts of very urgent needs to urinate that is not normal for me and the urine was very dark, not the typical light yellow.  I was not otherwise ill or dehydrated that perhaps would&#39;ve caused that to happen.

                                                About 9PM after the receiving the vaccine I started had riggers which lasted for about an hour. I couldn&#39;t reach for my phone or call for help. I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

I do not have a history of UTI&#39;s at all.

After 1 episode of nausea,  I started experiencing more than mild muscle cramps.  Could not lay on either side.  Darkened room because light/ sound was adding to already severe headache. Used cold washcloths on forehead.  Was having trouble trying to walk, use restroom, frequent urination but could only sip water. Over the next 24 hours...just slept and used bathroom.  Severe muscle cramps, chills, fever, headaches.   Called my Dr.&#39;s nurse-she advised to hydrate and to go to ER if needed.  24 hours later, I realized I would be okay...but took me another 24-36 hours to feel 80% normal.  Lost 8LBs. during 48 hours.  Experienced extreme dreams/delusions.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Primary biliary cirrhosis.    On 07-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ABDOMINAL PAIN UPPER (Stomach pain) and NAUSEA (Nausea). On 08-Apr-2021, the patient experienced UNRESPONSIVE TO STIMULI (Unresponsive) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DEATH (Died) (seriousness criterion death), RENAL FAILURE (Renal failure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and HEPATIC FAILURE (Liver failure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 23-Apr-2021, RENAL FAILURE (Renal failure) and HEPATIC FAILURE (Liver failure) had resolved and NAUSEA (Nausea) outcome was unknown. The patient died on 23-Apr-2021. The cause of death was not reported. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, UNRESPONSIVE TO STIMULI (Unresponsive) and ABDOMINAL PAIN UPPER (Stomach pain) outcome was unknown.            The concomitant medication included liver medications, as reported by the reporter. On 07Apr2021 around 1230pm, the patient experienced stomach pain and nausea which the family attributed to her liver medications. The patient went to sleep later that evening. The next day, 08Apr2021, the patient was found to be sleeping around 8am but was unresponsive around 1:30pm. She was taken by ambulance to the local hospital. The patient was eventually placed on life support and passed on 23Apr2021.  No other treatment medication were reported.

                                                She got her vaccine, and started out with the sore arm, but she was sitting in the bathroom sometime after 11:00 preparing to do a peritoneal dialysis exchange and blacked out.  She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

As night progressed the symptoms worsened - about 2am intense back pain between shoulder blades radiating to chest, heart was pounding, temperature increased to 101 About 3am was in extreme pain throughout entire body, severe chills/shaking,  fever was 102.2, experienced minor urinary incontinence About 3:30am I finally had to take  2 Advil - within an hour the symptoms had lessened and temp had dropped to 100 By noon (22 hours after injection) I was experiencing only mild body aches, temperature was normal, left arm remained sore but I could move it - other side effects had resolved  I am very stoic and have a fairly high pain tolerance. I had no side effects after shot 1. After shot 2 I was sicker than I have ever been in my life ?- for several hours I was concerned I was going to die.

                                                Sent: 3/4/2021   7:55 AM Subject: Non-Urgent Medical Question                    For a full week now, I have been battling diarrhea and a very hyperactive stomach and intestines. Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).  Patient presented to outlying emergency room with flank pain &amp; transferred here with severe bilateral hydronephrosis on imaging.  Patient had severe left flank pain about 2 weeks ago. Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.  Nothing has made it better.  Patient has tried ice, heat, tramadol Tylenol, Motrin, steroids and pain persists.  Additionally patient having nausea and vomiting.  She has started to have burning with urination.  Pain is excruciating stabbing.  Radiates to the groin.  Patient has also started running fevers today.  She feels pretty miserable.   Also patient notes difficulty with her bowels since her last surgery.  Prior to surgery she took Linzess every day.  Since surgery it has been suggested she does not need this medication.  Patient does note little to no notice when her bowels decide to move.  Severe significant gas.  Other times patient feels quite constipated.   UA suggests possible infection with positive nitrites, 1&#43; leukocyte esterase and 3&#43; blood.  WBC 2.1, Cr 1.0, K 3.0 CT scan with multiple abnormalities, but most notably severe bilateral hydronephrosis without obvious obstructing lesion.

                                                After the first inoculation I had some transient pains in my head, and a few hive like welts, some tiredness.  Then I had the second inoculation.  The morning of 3/11/21 I woke up sweating with a fever and this very strange feeling was rolling through my body, from my head, down to my toes, then back up to my head and on and on.  I took my temperature and it was 100.5 F. Also, I had begun breaking out in a few hive-like red welts on my legs, arms, stomach, back,  maybe 8 to 10, hard to tell,  but strange looking, unusual,  and uncomfortable.  Then around that Wednesday, the 16th, my urine was brownish and smelled smoky.  I had not taken any supplements in days. The next day it was beige, smoky, then the next day bright yellow.  The next day it went back to normal. More welts.   EXTREME exhaustion.  Then  on  the 18th I developed chills and more itching and welts. One on my face.  One or two on my scalp.  More around my waist, arms, neck, and legs.  I am still having intermittent chills and hives/welts, and EXTREME  tiredness.  I have a cold sore in my mouth or throat, I can&#39;t tell exactly where.

Got up around 1 AM to go to bathroom- was VERY weak &amp; needed help.  Also while getting to bathroom began to lose control over kidneys and was urinating involuntarily.   Had urge to to go the bathroom again around 3;  30.  This time could NOT walk at all &amp; was once again urinating involuntarily.  Tried to just go back to bed, but did not seem to have any control over my body.  Around 4:30 I got as comfortable as possible on the floor &amp; slept  off &amp; on until around 8:30.  When I woke up I was able with  help to get back into bed. I had continued to urinate involuntarily during the time I was sleeping prior to 8:30.   The symptoms seemed to gradually subside after this point.  Called Neurologist,  thinking that my radiation induced nerve damage was involved in my reaction and she agreed.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).    On 06-Apr-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced HEADACHE (sharp severe headache), CHILLS (chills) and FATIGUE (fatigue). On 08-Apr-2021, the patient experienced HAEMORRHAGE URINARY TRACT (blood in her urine with clots) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and CHROMATURIA (urine was dark like the color of syrup and it was a brown thick stream). On 09-Apr-2021, HAEMORRHAGE URINARY TRACT (blood in her urine with clots) and CHROMATURIA (urine was dark like the color of syrup and it was a brown thick stream) had resolved. At the time of the report, HEADACHE (sharp severe headache), CHILLS (chills) and FATIGUE (fatigue) outcome was unknown. Not Provided   No relevant concomitant medications were provided.   The patient received acetaminophen for symptoms. She is currently seeking help from her health care provider regarding this situation and is undergoing some tests in the meantime such as a renal ultrasound.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event (headache, chills, and fatigue), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding the events (Haemorrhage urinary tract, chromaturia) has been provided at this time.

I went and had breakfast and then i got the chills, then i started sitting up but i felt awful so i went back to bed and dizziness weakness headache, redness around injection site.  My whole left side felt like it was achy and almost like it was numb. I lost bladder control, I had a couple of accidents.  I stayed in bed until next day, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t eat. Got up Saturday, not feeling good, queasy, diarrhea but not as bad as Friday. Every time i would try to do something i would fall asleep. went and had covid test for surgery. Sunday I felt better but not to par. Today i feel the best so far.  Put antibiotic cream on injection site because it was itching, and it is still hard and warm to touch.  Today i have a small cough that I didn&#39;t have before.

Went to the bathroom, urinated, took Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke again at 2:00 a.m, still chilled, and tried to stand up and my legs wouldn&#39;t hold me. I managed to lift myself to my feet and clutching furniture get to the bathroom, with complete loss of bladder control on the way. Took more Tyleonol, drank more water, put on clean pajamas but couldn&#39;t lift my knees to step into them, had to put them on the floor and pull them up. Went to sleep eventually. When I woke at about 5 a.m., all was completely normal. No fever, legs fine, usual bladder control.

The room was spinning, I fell down, vomited and peed.  I laid there for a while until I realized if I closed my eyes the room would stop spinning.  I got up off the floor, back into bed and stayed there for about 5 hours.  When I woke up, I was still dizzy, but not nearly as bad.   The dizzyness and nausia still hits me several times a day.

At this time urine was orange in color and had a foul Oder for 3 days followed by stomach pain still but more intense and dysentery.  Called Dr office when I had blood clots the size of quarters or better, Nurse suggested I go to emergency.  I did not, this continued for 3 days and then subsided.

                                                The shot hurt when administered, didn&#39;t feel the first one. About 2 minutes after shot, felt light headed and like the shot contained adrenalin or epinephrine. That subsided by the time I left the site, although I remained slightly light headed all evening. Went to bed at 10:00 with an extremely sore arm, beginning of body aches and fever of 99.3. Awoke at 1:00am with 101.9 temp, extreme muscle and joint pain, and every time I moved anything, even a finger I would feel the sensation of a chill or slight electric shock. Urinated every hour from 1:00am and 5:00 am. When I awoke at 5:00 I was so weak, nauseated and dripping sweat I barely got my dog fed and let out for the morning. The nausea passed quickly but I thought I was going to have to lie down on the floor during that wave.Went back to bed, slept until 7:00 and was pretty much a zombie until 6:00pm last night(March 10) when all exhaustion and muscle pain disappeared and I have been fine since then.

The patient&#39;s medical history included back problems with osteoarthritis in the spinal column neck and lower back. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included celecoxib and nortriptyline.   On 20 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient reported she got very dizzy and passed out. Her husband relays that she was totally out for a couple of seconds. She went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a vasovagal reaction and urinary tract infection. Premature ventricular contractions were also discovered and was not known prior to this event. Patient reports a normal blood pressure of 114-120/75. Patient also stated her arm was sore the day after vaccine but not hurting much during her usual four mile walk.   Treatment for the event included intravenous medications in the emergency room, cephalexin, and a heart monitor.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events passed out, dizziness, vasovagal reaction and arm pain were resolved. The outcome of the events, urinary tract infection and premature ventricular contractions were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.  The events occurred the next day after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  Further information have been requested.

Her first COVID-19 vaccine was received on 3/1/21, so she was originally attributing these symptoms to the vaccine.  She has had some diarrhea.  Mild headache, muscle aches.  However, she started to develop some dyspnea on exertion and mild cough that is nonproductive.  When she realized her sister was having symptoms of COVID and tested positive and she had had some mild exposures to her, she realizes she might have active COVID infection and was tested positivity on 3/6.  She has had poor appetite and poor oral intake compared to average.  On 3/12, she became weak, fatigued, having diarrhea, and a difficult time urinating, advised to ED by PCP. So, patient was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonitis on 3/12. Received dexamethasone 3/12 to 3/21.  Discharged home on 3/19/21 with supplemental oxygen.

                                                Night following shot, I slept badly and felt cold all night.  When I wanted to get up to go to the bathroom around 5:30 AM, I could not get myself off and out of the bed.  It was like my legs wouldn&#39;t work. When I was finally up, I had no control of my bladder and urinated all the way into my bathroom. When I was done on the toilet, I started to stand up and lost my balance. I tried to reach for the door jam but missed and fell backwards onto the toilet and sat hard and hit my back very hard against the top of the toilet.  I helped back to bed by boyfriend but had to get up several more times that morning and had the same weakness in my legs and no control over my bladder. My boyfriend had to leave to go home, so I called my sister to come and stay with me in case I couldn&#39;t get up again. One she was here, I ate a small amount of roast chicken and slept most of the afternoon. I slept thru the night and felt stronger the next day. I felt very tired and sleepy for the next couple of days, but (3 days later) am now feeling and moving in a more normal manner.
