She then had sensation down her leg nerve pains.  Sometimes she also gets some hot flashes but they go away.  She woke up early in the morning yesterday and had a pressure like sensation in her head, she still has that today.  She still has burning sensation in her chest, and her legs and ankles are hurting still.   She has taken some Tylenol for the aches and pains.   Also has itchiness of her arm from the vaccine, as well as soreness.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and given Ativan (she refused any opioids) She was ultimately diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the pain in her left arm. Two days later, the pain has subsided.

Uncertain how long it will continue. Severe whole body edema beginning day five. Particularly pronounced in L arm that received Moderna Vaccine. Also aches in Left shoulder, and whole body muscle aches. She has had some edema in her lower legs and feet, but NEVER in her hands, face and torso. In retrospect, we should have avoided using her left arm to vaccinate due to lymph node removal.
