She was admitted to the hospital - Initial NIHSS was 26 and CT imaging showed no acute hemorrhage but mild hypodensity of greater than 1/3 of the MCA territory (TPA not recommended).  CTA did show distal L M1/M2 occulsion and she was transferred to larger facility for thrombectomy.  Unfortunately the patient had persistent severe neurological deficits after thrombectomy.  Was discharged home on hospice care and expired on 1/23/21.

                                                Patient became incoherent for a few seconds while sitting in a chair in the observation area. Pharmacy manager went to observe patient and ask how she was feeling. Patient&#39;s head started to droop to the side for a few second and her shoulders made shrugging movements for a few seconds. During this time I called 911, while individual waited with the patient seated in the chair. Patient became more coherent in a few seconds and could speak and smile normally. Ambulance came and patient went with paramedics.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included transient ischemic attack; the patient experienced 3 events in 2020.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 030L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient experienced dizzy lightheadedness and a fall, resulting in a head bump in her temple and ear caused by hitting the sink as she fell. The patient was hospitalized following the fall and diagnosed with transient ischemic attack.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received magnetic resonance imaging and a laboratory test.  On 27 Jan 2021, the lightheadedness and head bump had resolved.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not reported.   The outcome of the events, transient ischemic attack and fall, was considered resolved on 25 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, lightheadedness and head bump, was considered resolved on 27 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 90-years-old female patient with a relevant medical history of three TIA within last year, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Dizziness and Transient ischaemic attack and non-serious unexpected events of Fall and Head injury.  The events of occurred approximately 2 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 030L20A. Treatment details were not provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of TIA are considered significant confounders.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and given Ativan (she refused any opioids) She was ultimately diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the pain in her left arm. Two days later, the pain has subsided.

On 09 Feb 2021, the patient&#39;s fever was control, very weak and passed away on the same day at 04 45 pm. The death occurred and death certificate stated that pneumonia was the cause of death.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, pneumonia was considered as fatal, and that of other events unresponsive at times, weak, diarrhea, feeling punky, body aches/muscle aches, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, sore arm at site of injection, and vomiting were considered as unknown. The patient died on 09 Feb 2021. Plans for an autopsy was unknown. The cause of death was reported as pneumonia.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 96 year old, female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Pneumonia (fatal) among others, 5 days after receiving 1st dose of mRNA- 1273 (Lot# 013M20A). Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The subject&#39;s con meds included insulin, unknown medications for pulmonary HTN and heart failure. The cause of death was determined to be pneumonia. Advanced age and co-morbidities may remain as risk factors.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Pneumonia

                                                My mother fainted on the night she was vaccinated, early in the morning. She had gone to the kitchen to get a heating pad and felt faint while standing  She didn&#39;t make it to a chair, but fell and broke her hip.   While this could have been due to another health problem, my mother had never had a fall or a near-fall. it is concerning that very old adults are not warned to have someone with them after receiving the vaccine (for instance, overnight),  I realize that the vaccine has not been studied specifically in geriatric populations, but it is realistic to assume that there are substantial numbers of very old people living on their own, particularly in cities where there is no need to drive, and where food and other necessities can be delivered. There should be a warning to people that they should not be alone after receiving the vaccine.

                                                developed pain, redness and heat in her left wrist on 1/11/21. I saw her on 1/12 and evaluated it. It could be gout or pseudogout and just a coincidence but we need to fill out a VAERS report on it, just in case.

She did not have any neurological impairment after fall and remained at facility to be monitored.  1/26/21, resident had sudden loss of consciousness with hypotension and tachycardia.  This resolved slowly after resident was put in trendelenberg position.  She has not had similar events in the past.  She was sent to ED without a distinct underlying cause of the event identified, differential included cardiac arrhythmia, ? orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, stroke She had a similar event occur on 1/27 after she had returned to the facility from the ED.  The family elected not to pursue further evaluation for second event and she was placed on hospice as she had been experiencing some gradual decline before these events occurred.
