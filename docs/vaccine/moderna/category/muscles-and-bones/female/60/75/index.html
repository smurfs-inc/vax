Got up a 2am to go to bathroom and had teeth-chattering chills.  30 minutes later vomited several times.  Fever was 99.6  last night, 99.8 this morning, and 100.2 this afternoon.  Significant pain in joints, moderate in muscles.  Feel by far worse than when I had covid.  Though these side affects typically resolved in 24 hours? Mine are no better, other than I&#39;m only nauseated, not throwing up.

                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                1-8-2021:  9:25 body shaking, nostrils constricting, throat tightening and legs weak.  Happen while I was heading home.  Returned to HD.  EMT administered 50ml benedryl and pushed 125ml saline.  No response.  Throat felt tight, not closed but tight.  Offered EpiPen .3 agreed.  Body reaction - shaking.  Went to Hospital ER via ambulance (~11am).  ER administered 50mg steroid and had 2 puffs of albuterol inhaler twice.  Became very tired but felt heart raced - assumed reaction to steroid/albuterol.  2:30pm started to finally feel relief.  Discharged 4pm with rx for prednisone 50mg 1/day-10 days and benedryl 25mg for that night and am/pm next day.  O2 dropped to 94 that evening.  Administered 3 rounds of 2 liters/minute before saturation held at 97. 1-9-2021:  9am took benedryl and prednisone doses.  10am both nostrils still feel &#34;swollen,&#34; legs are weak and very tired (benedryl?).  Oxygen saturation is good - 97.  Starting to feel slight sensitivity at injection site.  4pm able to shower and move around.  Breathing is better.  Elected not to take benedryl as I&#39;m not getting an positive response from it, only fatigue.  Nostrils still feel swollen - tried lubricated nasal spray, not much help. 1-10-2021:  8:30 prednisone dose  Oxygen saturation good - 98% pulse 72.  Nostrils still feel swollen.  Injected site sore,  Started around 4pm (similar to shingles vaccine - expected).

                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

Once I did get up I noted a severe red rash covering chest and extending up anterior neck (looked like a radiation burn). Symptoms lasted all day and made work or ADLs impossible. Felt about 75% better next day then symptoms returned the following day. Rash began peeling and appeared to look like a 2nd degree burn. Symptoms resolved by Day 4.

                                                After the shot my left arm became sore and tender. Later my arm had pain from my elbow radiating up into my neck and head causing a massive headache on the left side of my head. I had chills with NO fever. I felt nauseated. I went to work the following day with all of the previous symptoms. I experienced sweats along with the chilling and light headed ness. I started to experience tachycardia. My supervisor on my floor took my blood pressure and it was 164/122 and my pulse rate was 190. A PA was available and examined me and asked if I had caffeine which I didn?t. After sitting and being re-examined my blood pressure was 142/100, and my pulse was 90. I was sent home. At home I still experienced the headache and was fatigued, and my arm was still sore and tender. This happened within 24-25 hours after receiving the vaccine. Today my arm is slightly sore and I still have a headache but it is not as severe as previous.

Almost lost consciousness several times, but did not.  Mental thought process was affected. Had sensation of not receiving enough oxygen. Severe diarrhea and sick to my stomach, sinus congestion. Episode lasted several hours, next 24 hours was dizzy, weak, and soreness of arm. Had another slight episode of dizziness, sinus congestion, tiredness, and chills on day 11 after the vaccine.

Also I have arm soreness in my left arm where I got the injection, malaise/fatigue, joint pain, and mild nausea. But I&#39;m making this report due to the strange development of buzzing/fizzing in my chest.  It seems unrelated to breathing. I have a Kardia 6-lead EKG and it is reading normal. My blood pressure is about where it usually is (143/93, elevated due to as-yet untreated Cushing&#39;s Syndrome. I do take metoprolol succinate to bring it down somewhat, but diastolic has been chronically 90 and above for several months despite medication.) I don&#39;t feel this is a cardiac event, but of course I would like to be sure. It has been constant on and off fizzing/buzzing since 7:30 this morning (may also have been occurring while I was asleep), and it&#39;s now 11:08 a.m. My question is whether I need to go to urgent care/ER. Plan is to call Moderna and talk to them about this, and then make a decision about what to do next. I&#39;m reading online that this could be an immune response, that some people with COVID get the fizzing and buzzing. But I never stop with Dr. Google. I&#39;m going to speak with the manufacturer and then either my primary care doc or an urgent care/ER doc. So I clicked &#34;none of the above&#34; below, but I will likely be seeing a doctor today.

                                                I have been having left arm pain every since having the vaccine. I thought it would go away but the discomfort is now when I have Range of Motion upward and the discomfort is in my shoulder, arm area and a little below the injection site. I still am having that discomfort and in addition to that, that past 7 days I have been having neck and jaw pain like in the node areas front and back of my next. As well as my lower lip has has two episodes of swelling but it goes down and then it feels ok. I generally overall just don?t feel well.  Eye and head pain as well.  I thought it was best that this be reported cause I just don?t know what is going on. I have made an appointment with my doctor which is on Feb 5.

Three days later I still have tendonitis symptoms and some hip joint pain. I developed a large erythemic swelling at the site of inoculation and a rash which is about 6 inches in length by 4 inches in width.

She was assisted by EMS (who was on site).  Her blood pressure was 249/149 per the patient.  She also experienced some lightheadedness.  It was strongly suggested by EMS &amp; nursing staff that she be transported to the ER but she refused stating she had to work the next day.  She continued to be monitored by EMS until her blood pressure stabilized &amp; she felt better.  She continued to refuse ER.  She was driven home by her companion.   On 1/28/2021 she sent an email to the health department showing a picture of her left arm showing redness from the injection site down to above the bend in her left arm.  She reported that on 1/26/2021 her physician  recommended that she not receive the second dose of Moderna.  She continues to complain of high blood pressure.  It is unkown if she takes medication for high blood pressure.

                                                2:00am. Chills started first. Then chills got so bad I started shaking uncontrollably almost like seizures. I used slow breathing methods to try to reduce my shaking. I used an extra large heating pad with 4 blankets but could not get my body warm. I felt like i was suffering from hypothermia. I moved my heating pad around to large body parts to try to warm individual body parts to  slow my severe shaking.  My  severe shaking and extreme chills  went on for at least 4 hours. I felt nauseous and felt like I might vomit. I got in shower at 6;30 am to get into a hot shower. I could not lift my left leg without extreme pain in my lower left back. The pain in my back then moved to my hips, then my upper right side. I had diarrhea for 2 days and indigestion after eating small bits of food.   I took Tylenol gel caps on Sunday morning with a full glass of water and went to sleep at 10:00 am. I woke up with my hip joints and left ear pain.

                                                I had a sore arm on Sunday night - and Monday it was really sore and couldn&#39;t use my arm at all so I called in sick. Got sick on Tuesday, the January 5th - woke up with a sore throat; hoarse throat; fever; chills; cough - and chest was congested.  Fever came and went. A bit of muscle aches in my chest from coughing so much. I called the DR and they sent me down to the COVID area of my doctor&#39;s office. They did COVID test and told me to go home. On Thursday, they reported that I was negative on my test. I called my Dr  and she told me she had to still be quarantined for 10-14 days. She told me to take my asthma medicine and she told me to take cough medicine (OTC) and take Tylenol if I still need something else. She told me to drink fluids and rest. I went back to work on January 19th, Tuesday. I still have a little bit of congestion and cough.  I had the second dose of the Moderna on January 28th. I had  a sore arm but not as bad as last time.

I do suffer from that when we have a storm and one was on the way, but it was more intense than normal. I had 4 bouts of very urgent needs to urinate that is not normal for me and the urine was very dark, not the typical light yellow.  I was not otherwise ill or dehydrated that perhaps would&#39;ve caused that to happen.

Stayed in bed a couple of days and started to feel pain again in arm and I physically check and saw a whelp red rash, by then my face had a rash and i took some Benadryl for the next four days and helped.   And much better.   Now on 2/24/2021 and 2/25/2021, feeling pain again in my arm, and the itching on the injection site.   On 2/20/2021 started with left hip pain.  Had a phone visit with the Dr and she prescribed Flexaril 10mg tabs and Motrin 800 mg tabs.   And Hip pain gone.    Now all I have even after taking the Flexaril and Mortin I still have the arm pain and itching. Moderate pain on arm (injection site).

Fever for 4 day and  fatigue and achy/joint pain lasted for at least a couple weeks.  On February 11/12, 2021 started with double vision, progressively getting worse and constant starting on 2/17.  Sought medical treatment on 2/18 with emergent MRI ordered and completed on 2/18.  MRI results showed swelling/inflammation in the brain, specifically on the left side.  Treatment thus far has been antiviral medication, seeing specialists - Ophthalmologist and Neurologist on 2/24 and 2/25 respectively. Further treatment is ongoing but will include ongoing lab work, IVIG infusions starting 3/1 for 3 consecutive days, repeat MRI, potential LP and Quarantine for a minimum of 30 days following the first IVIG treatment.  Neurologist diagnosis is ADEM at this time.

                                                The injection was very painful and pain persisted for 1 day at similar intensity at the very top of the arm near the shoulder.  The joint was painful but the muscle was worse.  I could not even lift my arm without moderate to severe pain. That pain faded, but my clavicle area on the left side began hurting on day 3 and feeling along the bone I discovered a painful lump.  It is on top of the bone about 1 3/4 inches from the notch at the base of the throat. Overnight the lump got less swollen but harder.  It is oval, and depending on my position ranges from the size of a green grape to the size of a kumquat.

Soreness in arm continued for 3 weeks, on and off.  Sometimes it felt like deep bone pain, she described as excruciating.  Sometimes woke her at night.  Did not occur every day.  Some arm swelling.   The injection was given at where she works.   This PHN did not give the vaccine, but patient called to inform of reaction.  We were going to complete this form together, but patient decided she&#39;d do herself.  I am not certain she will, so am sending the info I was told.  She received 2nd injection 3/1/2021.  Side effects seem less vigorous, by report, so far this time.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

                                                I recently retired after 37 years and now stay and provide significant weekly care for my elderly parents.  Because I am a primary caregiver for my parents, and have been throughout the months of the pandemic, I explored various potential paths to ethically and appropriately get in line for a vaccination.  When I took my mother in for her second vaccination at the Health Department in late in March I was able, while my mother was waiting, to converse with a county public health care worker about options and avenues for me to obtain the vaccine as well. She could see, clearly, that I was a caregiver for my mother, so she took down my name and number, and she called me the next day to say that I could, as a caregiver, proceed to sign up for their next clinic vaccination day that would be happening on Thursday, April 1st.   I arrived for my noon vaccination time at the Health Department before 12 on Thursday, April 1st. I proceeded through the check in line and screening questions, and arrived at vaccination site #1 at 12:05 where I was promptly given the Moderna vaccine (lot #026B21A).  Within seconds of the injection, I knew that I was having a reaction. My heart immediately began pounding, my tongue swelled and the room disintegrated into swirling flashes of color. I looked into the kind eyes of my vaccinator and remember distinctly saying to her in those first few post-injection seconds that, I was, ??sorry, but I think that I am having a reaction.?  The vaccinator then took me over to the nursing site coordinator who proceeded to check and record my vitals. I do not have that sheet with the vitals that she recorded, but I do remember that my heart rate and blood pressure measures were high. I sat as she continued to monitor me.  After 20-30 minutes, as best I can recall, my vitals were not improving, but remained elevated and even seemed to be trending higher. Also, the swelling and tingling in my tongue was worsening and seemed to be spreading to my lips and face, and down to the base of my neck.  I began to feel dizzy, like I was going to faint, so she had me lay on the floor with my legs elevated.  Additionally, it was becoming more difficult to breath because of the pressure in my neck. She had earlier and initially offered me Benadryl for the symptoms I was experiencing but I did not previously have good luck with Benadyrl the one time I took it, and also was unsure if I would have been able to swallow it. At 12:40 she thus gave me an injection of epinephrine (3mL) in my thigh and an ambulance was called. I was transported to the ER at the hospital. (Please note that the nursing site coordinator provided top-notch, high quality care through-out my entire emergency medical reaction experience, and I am very grateful and appreciative of her professional and caring response.)  In ER they monitored my blood pressure and pulse, and other aspects of my heart rhythm, as well as the swelling and tingling that continued in my tongue, lips, face and forehead.  I met with the Dr., and worked with RNs during my time there where they continued to monitor me for a number of hours. By about 4:30, when my vitals had returned to normal and stabilized for over an hour, they released me from the hospital. Since my release from the hospital, late in the afternoon on Thursday, April 1, I have noted only a few, relatively minor persisting symptoms which have included tongue, lip and face numbness and tingling. Also, I have noted, from time to time, some periods of continued heart rate elevation, though wonder if it is more of an almost ?PTSD? type of reaction than a pure physiological response, since, for example, just retelling this story right now is causing my heart rate to rise as I recall what happened.  Needless to say, this vaccination induced medical event, explained above, made for a surreal and frightening day unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Processing of it, and grappling with its implications, from concrete to existential, is seeming equally daunting, and it is here where I have a range of questions for which I am seeking assistance and perspective from the CDC:  The most concrete types of vaccination questions first: They indicated I should not try to obtain the second dose of the Moderna vaccine but that I should consult and maybe it could be given to me in a hospital setting? I welcome thoughts and feedback on how to proceed to become ?fully vaccinated.? What about another vaccine?  What about the additional boosters now being discussed for the new variants? Will I need to consider a ?cave dwelling? of some type for myself in the future since I will not have the vaccination card that is being discussed as ?the ticket to travel? in the future?  Will there be special cards for folks like me who tried but for whatever strange immunological reason was not able to take the vaccine? Increasingly complex, bigger picture questions next: Would any type of ?reach-out? to Moderna be in order? Or, do you, at the CDC, reach out to Moderna for me as a result of this VAER? Are they studying people like me?  My sense, from what little reading I have done, is that what happened to me, though severe, is rare, though definitely want the producers of the vaccine to know about my experience. Bordering on existential questions: What does this mean for me and my life going forward? Should I meet with Moderna, or some type of allergy specialist to better understand what may have happened, and what I will need to watch out for in the future? As everyone begins sharing vaccination cards and experiences, what should I say? I don?t want to scare others away from doing what is needed to save lives by sharing my experience, and don?t want to fuel the ?anti-vaxers.? What about the lingering disquiet and unease that something I sought to help and protect me seems like it might have/nearly killed me? The pandemic has already shaken and taken so much in so many of our lives.  Immunization seemed to promise to give back some of what the pandemic has taken, yet, feeling now that ?normal? is not only more distant but possibly will not be achievable for folks like me, rare though we seem to be?

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

                                                I received the vaccine in my right arm about 10 AM on 1/11/2021 I felt a sharp muscular pain in my back near  the base of my right shoulder. It was difficult to take deep breath?s. It felt like I had pulled a muscle there. Moving positions from sitting to standing or raising my right arm to scratch or reach for something caused the muscle pain to occur. After taking ibuprofen, water and rest the pain subsided a lot, but still continues. There was no increase in my temperature.

On 1/12/2021 (today), I could hardly raise my left arm over my head.  I took 2 Ibuprofen and plan to ensure I do range of motion stretches and basically just use the left arm.  I do not have a fever, and plan to drink plenty of water today.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  At about 9pm on 1/11/21 (i.e. approximately 5 hours after I received the vaccine), my left shoulder started to hurt.  When I woke up the next morning it was even more sore.  It wasn&#39;t bad when my arm was at my side, but it increasingly hurt as I rotated my arm upwards.   I would describe it as about twice as sore as I&#39;ve experienced in the past after a flu vaccine.   This continued that entire day (1/12/21).  By the next morning (1/13/21), the pain was starting to subside and by 9pm that night, it was gone.  As the pain level was relatively minor (approx. 3/10), I didn&#39;t treat it with anything.

FYI: I was experience stress and lethargy prior to getting vaccine. I got a Covid-19 test on 1/14/20 suspecting possible Covid-19. The test was Negative. After receiving the vaccination, the symptoms I was experiencing previously worsened.

Had a fever of 101 degrees.  As the hours passed, the joint pain spread to both hips  and ankles. Alternated Motrin and Tylenol with fever reduced to 100 degrees. All muscle aches, joint pain and chills continued for the next 2 days. Finally by day 3 the fever was down to 99.  Experienced fatigue, followed by severe vertigo by day 3.  Although muscle aches and joint pain slowly decreased over time, the vertigo has persisted and at times is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

Everything was fine within 2 days. Like nothing happened. On Day 9 experianced a flash of light out of left eye and a floating blob that came and went throughout the day. Saw Dr and he said this is typical of the aging process.  Dont know if it was related just weird it happened now. Arm was sore for 2 Days but nothing major. Other than that i felt fine.

                                                Pt is a pleasant 61 year old female who received Moderna COVID19 prime vaccine dose on 1/15/2021 as part of employee immunization event.  Pt reported upper respiratory viral illness the week prior but determined with medical advice that she was well enough to be immunized on the 15th. Immediate post-vaccination period was unremarkable.  Later that evening pt experienced onset of HA and fatigue which progressed to severe HA, low grade fever (~99 F per patient), malaise, and sore shoulder the following day.  Symptoms gradually improved over the next 2-3 days with HA being the most troublesome and lingering symptom.  Pt used OTC analgesics to manage HA pain. On 1/19/2021, four days after prime dose administration, pt noted a visible lump mid-clavicle, determined to be a severely swollen lymph node.  Warm and tender to touch.  Pt sought medical attention for this the following day, 1/20/2021.  Physician&#39;s assessment: &#34;Pt received the COVID moderna vaccine Friday, left arm.  She is a triage RN at Medical Clinic.  She states yesterday a lump appeared on her LT clavicle area.  Pt reports the lump is tender, &#34;warm&#34; but not red, and no surrounding erythema.  Yesterday had HA and a &#34;weird sensation&#34; radiating to LT ear from the lump.  The lump is now the size of a golf ball, did draw a line under it to see it.  She is able to swallow okay and has no other concerning Sx.  No changes in breathing.  Has had headaches, which have been reported possible side effect from COVD19 vaccination.  This vaccination was given quite high in her arm she thinks as well.  Fever Sunday night, 2 days after vaccination.  Has been taking Tylenol and IBU (not what she does usually) taking with food and has some GI upset.  Did try a cool compress on the lump yesterday which did not seem to help.&#34; // &#34;Can clearly see her soft tissue mass above her left clavicle, with a line that she drove underneath it yesterday when it started to form. There is no redness but is certainly tender to touch. Can still see a little bit of bruise in her arm where her vaccine was given in her left arm which does seem quite high, not two finger widths from the acromion process. Discussed prednisone but she is terrified of this as she was given a Symbicort inhaler not that long ago and felt that the steroid really made her wired. Recommend warm compresses, alternate between Tylenol ibuprofen with food and even topical Voltaren gel which she has at home and Arnica gel to area. Can certainly get CBC CMP for further evaluation. Discussed soft tissue ultrasound if this does not improve, will order this today in case it is needed she can just get that scheduled. She is going to report her vaccine reaction to the link she was given on the paper which I think is appropriate. Hopefully symptoms will improve in the next few days and then can proceed with her second vaccination a month from the first.&#34;  I spoke with patient today, 1/27/2021, to submit VAERS report. She reports swollen lymph node is still visible though size and sensitivity continue to slowly diminish.

                                                On  January 16, the day after being vaccinated (1/15/21),  I woke up with my arms, hands, legs and feet tingling and numb all over and it lasted on and off all day January 16 and on and off all day January 17 and has persisted every day until Monday, January 26 when the symptoms became worse. Instead of tingling in all extremities (with some numbness)  the sensations changed to a pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shock sensations. I want to note that, yes, I have radiculopathies  - however, I have never had them change so suddenly and increase in intensity so fast. Also, the pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shocks are brand new symptoms for me (my radiculopathies have not presented this way before).  I reported these symptoms to my primary care provider today (1/29/21) and she instructed me to report my symptoms to VAERS and she is referring me to neurology. Note: I received my vaccination outside of my health care system and received it through the county because I could get the vaccination sooner that way.  I did not report these symptoms sooner because they were not listed as a possible adverse effect of getting the COVID19 Moderna  vaccination. However, as these symptoms have worsened over the past 2 weeks I have become concerned.  I have not added any OTC medications or supplements to the ones listed prior. I have gone to a chiropractor twice during this time for relief of my back pain with  no positive outcomes. Waiting to see the neurologist.

On January 15 developed an itchy, red, hot rash about 1/2 inch below injection site.  The area was approximately 3 in by2.5 in with swelling.  Also had 5 hives break out on my body.  I took 1/2 a Benedryl and used clobetasol propionate ointment on the area until the rash went away (7 days).  The swelling took another 5 days to subside.

                                                I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my PMD office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

Took more Tylenol. 9:15am as I write, I am feeling better, just exhausted.

According to my Watch app., the resting hear rate upon waking was 115.. I had a severe headache and generally felt awful. I took Aleve and did deep breathing to try to bring heart rate down. One hour later it was coming down, although still higher than my normal resting rate of 60.  The arm where the injection was given has been extremely sore with a rash, sore enough that it is hard to use the arm. It is now 3 days since the vaccine, my heart rate has been normal. My arm pain is reduced but still sore with a rash. I feel fatigued and foggy. The severe joint pain is less but still present.

New symptoms developed as I am now feeling like I have tightness in my lungs when I breathe with mild difficulty. (kind of like when I have a chest cold). Also my throat feels funny like my trachea hurts.I have been reporting daily with the CDC app as suggested and have reported these symptoms as well.&#34;

On Jan. 25:  Went to bathroom around 3:15 p.m. with diarrhea and became woozy so decided to get off of the toilet and sit down on the floor.  Husband found me semi conscious on the floor with drool at about 4:10 p.m.  He tried to awaken me and found me not lucid, speech was garbled, fragmented responsiveness and could not keep upright position, could not give details to the situation.  Husband called 911.  Ambulance transported to hospital ER   during hospital exams and tests patient was not lucid and this continued for the next 32  hours.  EKG, EEG, CT scan, MRI, Blood/Lab work;  all tests were negative indicating no seizure , healthy heart, clear brain scan, no stroke, white blood count normal, dehydrated. All tests negative with all doctors unable to find a reason for this situation other than the Moderna vaccine considered highly for the situation.  Advised patient not to take the second dose of Moderna.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

Then on Thursday, every joint in her body hurt and this continued until Saturday.  On Saturday she had a big red whelt on the arm that progressively got larger.  She still has some aches in her joints, but not as severe.  The rash is deep red today, swollen with hard ridges, very itchy and very hot to touch.  She has not taken anything for it.  She has been having a harder time than usual breathing, but not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.  She has less than 20% of her lungs.

                                                After 45 minutes of receiving vaccination , the knuckles in my left hand, the arm I received the shot in, began to hurt very badly.  Before I was able to get home,  7 minutes away, both hands hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t hole the steering wheel and I was having cramps in my legs.  I could hardly walk up the steps to my house because my ankle joints hurt so badly.  I went to bed  right away and slept .  My hands hurt really badly, but I knew the vaccination caused an inflammatory response so I figured just  rest.  By the end of the day Tuesday, I couldn&#39;t type and could not hold the steering wheel to drive home.  I felt out of breath, I hurt all over, my muscles ached and were cramping.  I was nauseated, very emotional.  I had a fever that spiked at over 101 degrees.  I was so chilled that I was shaking violently. I hurt in every joint, my lymph nodes were painfully swollen, my heart was racing, normal pulse for me is 68 to 72, it was 88 to 90.  Halfway up our stairs, I just stopped, couldn&#39;t make my legs work.  Day 3 I called my doctor, had a virtual appointment I knew I couldn&#39;t drive or ride 45 minutes away.  I missed 3 days of work, stayed home all weekend and was better by Monday.  It was 3 weeks before my hands quit aching.  The pain came and went in my ankles, wrist, knuckles, hips and knees.    Food still nauseates me.

He stated that the pain began the previous day. I inquired about other possible injuries and illnesses and he denied she had any. He also stated that the pain was not relieved with otc pain relievers. I instructed him to alternate ibuprofen and acetaminophen and if the pain was not improved to report to the ER. The pharmacy staff was notified on 03/29/21 that the patient did report to the ER on 03/25/21 and was possibly intubated.

                                                The night I received the first Moderna vaccine I had a low-grade fever with muscle aches. The next morning when I woke up, I had abdominal pain, which became localized in the lower right quadrant. My friend, who is a nurse, told me I should go to the ER as it sounded like I had appendicitis. I was admitted at to the hospital  on 1/16. After blood work and an abdominal CT, the diagnosis was acute appendicitis. Dr.  performed a laparoscopic appendectomy at 7 AM on 1/17.  I was discharged that night. On 1/25, I started running a fever. Blood work revealed my WBC to be 33,000. Dr. asked me to return to the ER. My fever spiked to 104.6 and I was admitted to the hospital for 5 days of IV antibiotics to manage an infection in my abdomen. By 1/31, my WBC was down to 11,000 and I was discharged.

Nothing seems to help the pain. Heat seems to help some. But I cannot do activities of daily living without pain. I have been to a chiropractor besides my Primary Care Dr.  Not absolutely sure if it is from the shot but could be a contributing factor.

She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

                                                24 hours after the vaccine I had a 102 fever overnight.  The next day, my feet were hurting, like burning.  They continued like this but with fluctuating severity.  My calves and shin muscles began to be sore.  I sought out acupuncture and myofascia release work to help.  It did help temporarily.  I started to have left ankle pain, not like a sprain, like tendonitis or inflammation.  It continued to hurt to walk and the muscles more painful.  I started having darker urine about 4 days after the vaccine.  I drank cranberry juice and took a kidney/bladder supplement, increased fluids, but it continued dark.  I went to the Urgent Care on January 7th c/o muscle pain and dark urine.  My blood pressure was elevated, 179/100..unusual for me, and my urine was neg so it was sent for culture and blood was drawn for CBC and metabollic panel and Creatine Kinase

Prescription for Bactrim was given incase symptoms increased. This helped some on 1/24/2021 in PM area increased , I had general malaise and a stiff neck with joint pain. I started the prescribed Bactrim-for questionable cellulitis.  provider recommended I not receive the second dose

I asked Siri &amp; Alexa if it was ok to take pain reliever after 2nd COVID19 vaccine and they were useless. i had temp of 102 degree. I finally called someone who had reaction and they said Tylenol or Advil. I took Advil at  6am Friday 1/22.  All adverse effects continued throughout day except extreme heart palp. I took Advil at 11am  &amp; 3pm, I took Tylenol at 7pm  and aspirin at 11:30pm &amp; On Saturday at 3:30 am,.  Advil and Tylenol helped slightly, aspirin worked best or I was just exhausted.  I woke up on Saturday at 8:30am  and all was ok, except just tired a and my lower back is in pain still with numbness down leg. Probably  from laying around.

                                                One week after getting the Moderna vaccine I developed a small red mark under my left arm (this was the arm the vaccine was administered). 3 days later it developed into a very large , very painful lump under my left arm. (size approximately 1.4 X 0.8 x 0.9 cm ). I saw my PCP who set up an apt for an ultrasound. Ultrasound completed and appears that this is a skin infection with an abscess developing. Im now on antibiotics and have an upcoming apt with a surgeon. I am 26 days out from receiving the vaccine and the lump has not gone down in size and is still painful. I am postponing my 2nd moderna vaccine due to this possible adverse reaction.

It moved into the area of where I had that shoulder injury for 5-6 years ago. I could not move my arm due to the pain. It lasted at least 4 days at that pain level. The arm pain at the site was the first thing to improve, but a week 1/2 later I am still having pain in my shoulder. The mobility has improved but it is still really painful to move my arm.   I have been in touch with doctor throughout this, my doctor gave me something for pain and instructed me to continue move my arm as much as possible. I have spoke  with her over the phone and through the portal but have not actually been seen in person.

                                                I had a positive Covid test 10/26/2020 with severe symptoms (every symptoms except SOB)that lasted for 1 month until 11/27/2020.  I received Moderna Covid vaccine on 12/31/202 @ 12:30 pm.in my left deltoid.  Fifteen hours after receiving vaccine, I was awakened from sleep at 3 am with a pounding headache, this headache continued for days eventually shifting to the left side of my face and head with posterior neck spasms and pain. I had generalized mild body aches, and mild fatigue.  2 nights I woke from sleep completely soaked and had to change my clothes- I did not check my temperature ( the same thing occurred with Covid). Post vaccine:  Left Arm very tender initially.  On day 3, 1/2/2021, I developed increased pain,  swelling with a warm ,red rash at the injection site on my left arm.  By day 5 this area had greatly extended in size, warmth and tenderness.  Day 6, the rash on my arm had disappeared and I am able to palpate a small lump with very, very slight tenderness at the injection site. I had a repeat Negative COVID test on 1/5/2021 I am continuing to have a dull sensation of pain on the left side of my face (as of 1/8/21), still with palpable spasms on the left posterior neck. All other symptoms have essentially resolved. I have not contacted allergist- wondering if I should before receiving 2nd Covid vaccine.

                                                initial symptoms started at ~ 8-12 hr post inj on FRI:  fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain (generalized), back pain from sacrum to occiput, through cranium to behind eyes, nausea, loose stools, exhaustion, arm swelling (6&#34; diameter) with bandaid indented becoming hard (feeling a little like cellulitis).  routinely measure pO2 and body temp--both spiked; resp rate went from normal pattern of 10-12 to 25; night time HR went from low 60&#39;s to the 100&#39;s; pO2 went from 96-98 to 89-91 (Innovo PulseOx)Treated with sleep (slept from 8PM night of shot until 48 hours after the shot), fluids, hot water bottles, arnica (I can&#39;t take NSAIDS), vit C, zinc megadoses;  by ~36 hours post injection I started wheezing and coughing deeply but non productive, both nasal passages were/are open, feels as though phlegm is stuck at bronchi.  By 48 hours, I was feeling better except chest, ribs, head, and neck and was experiencing 1-3&#34; episodes of spasmodic coughing, wheezing, SOB; Occurred every 20-30 minutes and leaving me physically exhausted.  Sunday night slept with 4 pillows; went to see acute respiratory care clinic, evaluated, COVID-PCR was negative, temperature was normal by statistics (I tend to be colder; baseline temps between 32-33oC and over past week has ranged between 35-39oC).  Sent home with albuterol inhaler, mucinex (which I take at night), and flonase (my nostrils remain clear).  Current status:  extreme fatigue, high resting HR, minimal activity (walking) increases it to the 100s--not normal for me), and continued episodic bronchospasm (uncontrolled) with SOB and diaphragmatic, skeletal pain.  Deep diaphragmatic breaths also trigger.  Am also treating with hot water bottles to anterior and posterior chest walls, and nebulizer treatments with eucalyptus, thyme, and rosemary.  Still megadosing on C and Zinc.  Expect to return to work tomorrow (missed 2 days) as  neurologic and orthopedic physical therapist /exercise physiologist.

Also, I have  soreness under arm near lymph nodes.  I visited my Primary Care Physician today and was prescribed a steroid pack.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

I&#39;m pretty stubborn, and have continued to work despite sxs.  I missed last Friday 2/19 because the pain was so severe.

                                                Following my second dose of Moderna Covid 19 vaccine on 2/13/21 I experienced a significant reaction to the second dose: My temperature rose to 102 with headache and arthralgia throughout body that prevented sleep. I was in bed for more than 24 hours due to lightheaded/dizzy/nausea when standing. I fell once when getting back into bed due to loss of balance. Severe symptoms started 15 hours after receiving the dose and lasted approximately 36 hours post dose when my temperature then returned to normal. The next 1-2 days, while I no longer had a fever and symptoms were improved. I was still fatigued and did not feel fully recovered. Treatment during the severe symptoms included rest, icepack to head, Tylenol or Ibuprofen slightly decreased temperature for a brief periods. I informed my physician&#39;s office Dr, of the above reaction and was told to file a VAERS report.

                                                Tested positive for COVID 19; Hallucinating; Body aches; Fever; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 62 year-old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed body aches (myalgia), fever (pyrexia), hallucinating (hallucination) and tested positive for covid 19 (SARS-CoV-2 test positive).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant product use was not reported.  On 04 Mar 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: not provided) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Mar 2021, approximately 2 days after receiving vaccine, the patient developed body aches, fever and hallucinating. On 07 Mar 2021, the patient tested positive for covid 19.  Treatment information was not reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, the mRNA-1723 does not contain virus capable of causing infection and with the occurrence of SAR-COV-2 test positive after vaccination, is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                On April 4, two weeks after receiving my first dose of Moderna Covid vaccinge, I began feeling strong muscle aches.  Within a couple hours I had a fever of 102. In the next few hours I began having abdominal pain.  The pain grew worse over the next day.  On Tuesday April 6 I had a telehealth appointment with my primary care physician.  He advised me to go the the ER.  I went to my local ER where they found via ct scan, that my appendix was inflamed and they told me it needed to come out.  I had an appendectomy on April 7.  I am feeling much better now that my appendix has been removed.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

Same symptoms continued for about 48 hrs then felt better but still with some arthralgias and fatigue.  I had covid-19 virus in MArch 2020.  Felt pretty much the same way post vaccine as I felt then. Wondering if this reaction could be due to fact that I had virus previously and also wondering about second dose? Have there been reports of worse S/E in people who have had virus previously?

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

She had a sore right arm at the site of injection for about 2 days.  Soon thereafter she developed some right lateral neck pain for several days that required Advil.  It was hard to turn her head.  That got better.  On January 20 in the evening, she noted pain and achiness in the right deltoid at the site of her shot.  It was pink allover and slightly swollen and mildly warm.  Today, the swelling was slightly more and the redness slightly more.  She asked to see me, her PCP, although I did not give the vaccine.  She denies any fever, chills, sweats.  She has no systemic achiness. She has pain  at the site, even if not touched.  It is slightly warm to touch.  Today the erythema has slightly progressed since yesterday when she marked it with a pen.  She has not taken any antipyretics for several days.  She has no rash elsewhere on the body. The erythema is 5 x 8 cm and oval in shape.  She also has some small right axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are no other lesions on the right upper extremity.

                                                1 week AFTER my immunization I had intense discomfort in the upper arm. Upon inspection I found my arm with swelling and redness, 8 inches by 5 inches. The area seemed to be increasing! I had no unusual reaction the week prior. It was located around the injection site and was the area that had been &#34;a little sore&#34; after the vaccination.   I had no fever, but did have some body ache.. I had been working a ten hour night shift, so I could have just been tired? I took Benadryl and ibuprofin and the inflammation decreased.

Occasionally left hand would go extremely cold. (thermometer gun would read low, right hand would read 98.3) Upper left back and shoulder pain worse when laying and upon waking. 1/20 had neck pain also. During day when active deep pain continued, but was able to manage &amp; tolerate to function. The worst of pain was from 1/17/21 to 1/23/21, and seems to be a little better these past few days. Hand is still randomly going cold.  Forearm pain comes and goes now.

                                                The patient had muscle aches/fatigue as expected that lasted about 36 hours.  However, she developed red raised, itchy hot rash localized rash in  the area of vaccine 6 days after vaccine.  There was some heat to the area and some streaking below the circular rash.  We discussed that a red rash at the injection site can be a side effect (benign) of the Moderna vaccine.  However, based on the streaking and the delay in the rash beginning we did also cover with a short course of antibiotic and patient requested this be reported to VAERS.  She did not receive the vaccine at our facility and so I do not know the lot number or other specifics.

                                                I was woken up from sleep at 11:30 with swelling of my tongue.  It was getting hard to breath, so I got ice and sucked on it for awhile, then I put a cold cloth on my face, tried to relax and the swelling seemed ok.  I stayed up all night because I was afraid that it would get worse, At about 9:30a.m. it seemed to be getting back to normal with just a little swelling in the back of my tongue.  I felt terrible for the next three days and still don&#39;t feel great. Sore joints, got chills, headache.  I am not going in for the second shot.

                                                I had severe chills that started around 10:00 PM that night and continued until 1:00 in the morning. I slept 14 hours that night - I did sleep. Got up at 2:00 in afternoon. That fever when I woke up was 100.5. That fever lasted most of that day 2/9/2021. My temperature went anywhere from 99.7 to 100.5 and I had a fever until 11th of February. I also had muscle aches like the flu. I had fatigue, too.  I had the sore arm, too, and that lasted until about the 13th or so. No dr. appt.  I still have a little fatigue lingering - still need to take a nap sometimes which is unusual for me.

I have had COVID-19 twice and the antibodies are in my  blood stream every time I go give blooded I receive a letter indicating such.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 VACCINE EUA. Started feeling achy and feverish night of vaccine.  No temp.  Fell asleep for a while and when I woke up had pain in my right hip going down my leg like sciatica!  Following day, Thursday,  the pain was worse and had trouble standing on leg.  Rested all day.  Not really pain anywhere else, just right hip and down leg.  Friday morning felt better but started again in the afternoon and evening.  Saturday went to Urgent Care as the pain was very bad, could barely stand on my leg again.  Was given Flexeril and Naproxyn which is not touching it!  Using heat and ice.  Right now nothing is working.  Hard time standing on leg.

I realize that these are all normal responses and a sign of immune response. Most symptoms gone after 48 hours but headache persisted on daily basis,  with lessening severity until 2/27 .  A rash developed on 2/12 on neck and upper chest, very itchy and irritated . It is still present.

The next morning had severe charley horse in my right calf.  I have never experienced the intensity of these types of symptoms in the past.  It has taken over a week to recover (back and calf).  Today, 3/6/21, I notice that the injection site is sensitive and hard to the touch.  There is also redness around the injection site approximately 4&#34; x 4&#34;.   I am not yet fully recovered but feel I am improving.

Patient is not an established patient and did not receive care for her symptoms at our facility:  On March 18th I received my 2nd Moderna vaccination. On Friday the 19th at approximately 4 pm I began to have the symptoms of an immune response in my body. Sat the 20th was spent in bed with chills, body aches, fever, stiff neck, and bad headache. On Sunday I was having pain on inhalation along with everything else.  Monday the pain resolved into left side lung pain on inhalation. Tuesday the 23rd I called my provider who directed me to go to the Emergency Dept. I drove to Superior Hospital. After being accessed I was transported; with pericarditis and the additional mentioned immune response symptoms, and a pronounced heart murmur. On Wednesday the 24 I shook uncontrollably with chills for 4 hours and 2 min and went into atrial fib for about 12 minutes, resolved with medication.  Thursday the 25th I woke to all symptoms being gone. I was released on Friday the 26th with the statement my issues had resolved themselves. I was told to report this to where I got my vaccine so it could be passed along.

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

I was told not to take Tylonel because my &#34;immune system&#34; needs to do its job. I have an Immune Deficiency (CVID) and infuse gamma globulin 2x weekly.. I believe that if I was able to take Tylonel at the onset my reactions wouldn&#39;t have been so severe. Immune Deficiency cannot fight off viruses.

Also got upset stomach and little light headed.  A co-worker (teacher ) took her pulse and it was 66.  Lasted for about an hour and then felt better. She notified public health by phone after 30 min and was recommended she call her healthcare provider. Called her back 30 min after that (about hour and 10 min after vaccine) and she had not called provider and was feeling much better. Denies having problems with any shots in the past

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: I got the vaccine at 11 am on 2/15/21. There were not immediate adverse effects.  By 3:00PM, my arm was becoming very sore. By 8:00 PM, my right arm was extremely sore and overall body aches ensued as I began to feel weak. By 9:00 PM, I felt the need to get into bed and had chills, a severe headache and pain over my whole body, accompanied by shooting burning sensations down both arms into my palms and fingers. I had not taken any medication for the discomfort up to this point.  As time went on, my pain became excruciating, I never felt this kind of pain in my entire body. I had pain in areas I never felt pain before like my arms, hands and toes.  I also had extreme pain in the back of my neck, both shoulders, both arms, my hips and knees. The pain was so intense and throbbing, my headache was severe at my temples and I had chills.  I did not take my temp, but I am sure I had a fever, although I was not sweating. I could not sleep at all and finally broke down at 1:30 am and took an Advil.  There was minimal help with the Advil and I slept on and off over the next 4 hours. Throughout today, the headache, chills and pain continued, but slightly less and I was able to take a 2 hour nap.  I think it important to note that I had more of a reaction to the first COVID shot that most others I talked with and felt an ongoing weakness after the first shot over the course of the month.  I understand that some of my symptoms are part of my body&#39;s reaction to building antibodies, but  with the intensity of my reaction, I have to wonder if there is more going on.

I had nausea and vomiting. my asthma also flared up. I also had joint pain.   On Saturday the 13th I started having some weird things going on. I had mild paralysis and I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy in the right side of my face. (notably the same side as the shot was administered)

                                                Part of the vaccine ran out at time of injection.  The night of the injection my arm started itching.  I was awakened at 4;00 a.m. the next morning with a very stiff, sore, cramping arm.  I had the normal reactions: slight headache, low temp, itchy, swollen, hot red arm, but very stiff and sore. This lasted 3-4 days with the most noticeable reaction being the sore arm from shoulder to elbow.  On Feb 10, one week later, my arm started itching again in the afternoon and by evening was swollen, red, hot, and hurting  just like the first 3-4 days or slightly worse.  It gradually got better after 4-5 days, returning to normal by 2/20.  The only other symptom the second time were blisters on my left hand above my pointer finger and ring finger.  I&#39;m not sure if they were related or not since I walk outside or if I may have been exposed to poison ivy since the blisters looked similar.

Then moved to all my cervical neck bones.  This all took place within 30 min after injection.  Once home started to ache all over.  Started with low grade fever of 99.7 and eventually till it got to 101.4  I did not take any medication.  Just let it run its course.  Upon waking up this morning my left eyeball has a busted blood vessel in it and looks bad.  But as day goes on, it is slightly fading.  I am no feeling fine.

                                                About 10 minutes after the injection, I felt tightness in the back of my neck. I thought it might be the stress of anticipating  what might happen,  and tried to relax. Since I knew it wasn?t a life threatening  reaction, I tried to forget about it and left after the 15 minutes.  I had a significant soreness at injection site, but that was normal. It wasn?t until about 12 hours  later that I noticed  a significant fatigue, and general aching  throughout my body - much like the flu. I developed a persistent headache,  as well. It was just after midnight so I slept hoping to feel better in the morning. The symptoms persisted until late afternoon. I hydrated and took Tylenol and gradually began to feel a little better - enough to make myself something to eat.   I was diagnosed with COVID-19 in April  2020. Test results were positive.

                                                Within 10 minutes of injection, felt tingling in left arm from just above the elbow to the tips of my fingers. Sensation last for several hours and has recurred, multiple times a day, ever since. Nothing makes it feel better or abate, and nothing makes it worse. This is a symptom I experienced while sick with Covid-19, but it had abated ~10 days before vaccination. I also experienced soreness and swelling at the site of the injection, chills, and muscle aches, but these all abated within 72 hours.

When I woke to get a shower around 5:30 am on 1/6/2021, I was extremely lightheaded and laid down on the bathroom floor to keep from passing out and falling. The lightheadedness did not improve and my husband was able to help me back to bed. I was unable to overcome the chills and lightheadedness even with lying down, until about 10 am. I am able to sit up but still some what lightheaded and chills are beginning to fade. I do not feel I would be able to walk more than a few feet or drive at this time due to ongoing symptoms.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

Down the left side of back to center of back.  8 days later pain is still severe.   I have contacted VAERS (with no response), contacted CDC (no response) and revisited the vaccine clinic and they referred me to my primary doctor or ER.  Primary is not trained in covid=19 vaccine side effects.  Spent 6 hours in Emergency yesterday to no avail.  This is day 9 and I still have chronic nerve pain.

I just started taking an antihistamine cirtizone/generic Zyrtec. I feel fine no symptoms besides the rash.I am reporting it because I didn&#39;t know if the cortisone injections would have had some impact that the rash is mainly on the opposing arm.

                                                I felt anxious after the shot, but that night felt ok. Morning was another story. I woke up with pain in my muscles from the waist down and found it difficult to walk. My eyes started to hurt. I had blurred vision. Around 2:00 I went by the mirror and saw that my eyes were blood red. I laid down and rested. About 2 hours later I got up the most of the redness was gone but then I had a headache.  The next  morning a persistent cough and the sneezes started.  The headache would return every time that I coughed or sneezed. It was very painful- as if someone hit me with a hammer.  Even though the pain only lasted a few minutes, it hurt a lot. I sneezed and cough a lot. Finally, Sunday morning I was walking better; however, I felt I had the flu. Normally, I would have gone in and got ready for a sub, but I wasn&#39;t able to. I rested on the couch. Then took a 2 hour nap. Finally, I felt better around 6 pm except for the painful headache that returned every time I coughed or sneezed. It has been a week. I thought the worse would be over by now. I guess I will have to go in and talk to my doctor on Monday because the sneezes and coughs are still quite painful. When will it end?

I was feeling a little tired.   After 24 hours, the muscle in the injected arm was very sore.   It was hard to lift the arm even up to my shoulder.   I had a headache and was fatigued.

I applied Caladryl Lotion at bedtime.  Same condition on Day 9 (1/30/21), but as day has progressed, the rash has diminished and it is less sore now, still slightly itchy.    On the day of injection about 5-6 hours after injection, I was sore and had a stiff muscle at site of injection  -- a tad bit more than I experience typically with the  seasonal flu vaccine, but I had no rash.  The sore/stiffness lasted only about 30 hours.  After that everything was fine until Day 8!

                                                Initially shoulder was sore, difficult lifting arm or abducting shoulder, 4 hours later had mild sore throat, after 6 hrs began having body aches.  During the night (  at least 8hrs after shot) developed a fever 101.2, body aches, especially low back, and mild headache.  Had no appetite the next day, 1/29,21, queasy stomach, temp hovered between 99-100 most of the day, back ache was most problematic, no energy, slept most of the day, mild headache remained.  Symptoms disappeared after 30-36 hours.  Had some digestive distress after this but was probably related to not having eaten for over 24 hours &amp; then resuming.

Chills, lost of taste in my mouth, nausea, loss of appetite, body aches all over (joint pain), headache, fever. I also have pain at the vaccine injection site. Last night my fever was 102 so I called EMS and they took me to the ER. I was transferred by EMS. I was just in ER they gave two Tylenol and a bag of IV fluids.  Doctor said it was the side effects from the vaccine.   Today I am feeling much better, my headache is better and I was able to eat but still no taste.

The rash ran from the the top of my arm to the elbow. Over the next 4 days, I tried tylenol, warm compresses, only to have the rash to become more pronounced and navigate to the elbow with more definition and  involve the elbow with arthralgia With the slighest tough to the elbow, I would flinch. On Monday, Feb 1, 2021, I took photos  and called my PCP who then sent me to to the ER. At the ER I was diagnosed with cellulitis and put on a course of prednisone, cephalexn and diphenhydramine.

                                                I woke up this morning with a rash at the vaccine site.  It was itchy and warm approximately 3 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.  The rash curved down towards my armpit.  I had slight swelling and soreness in my armpit.  I relayed this info to doctor and she advised that I take a Benadryl, which I did.  She also advised that I take a Benadryl before my second vaccination.  I thought it was strange for me to have this rash a week after the vaccination.  I only had slight soreness in my arm the 2 days following the vaccination, with no rash at that time until today.  The Benadryl seems to help with the itching, and the rash is lighter but still there.

I also developed a persistent pain in my right hand and thumb along with &#34;trigger finger&#34; type symptoms in my hand where it clenches up and I cant open my hand up without using force. At times the pain is so bad I am unable to walk normally  and also unable to utilize my right hand to open or hold things.  In the 22 days that have passed since the shot the symptoms have not subsided and are effecting my ability to get around and carry my normal activities of daily life.

                                                ?Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA? About a week after my first dose (only immediate side effect, about 12 hours after shot, was stiff left arm/shoulder for about 3 days), I had the WORST genital herpes attack that I&#39;ve had in literally 40 years, with extremely swollen labia, excessively &#34;weeping&#34; sores, intense itching and pain. The shot was the only variable in my routine health and healthcare to which I can attribute this; the herpes attack finally began to heal, but then repeated itself, not as bad as the first one. During this time I have been taking Valcyclovir and Acyclovir cream, prescribed by OB/GYN. A few days into the initial herpes attack, my hands and face swelled and broke out in a case of (probably) dermatitis (which I&#39;ve had once or twice in the last 2 years), covering my arms, legs, hands, somewhat belly and back, with itchy hives which are still healing. Was prescribed by dermatologist Hydroxyzine HCL 10 MG 3x/day &#43; Triamcinolone Acetonide lotion USP 0.025% topical ointment, which are helping to relieve itching.

                                                After 2 days of getting vaccine, on Feb 22, my arm had a huge rash and was very tender where my shoulder was sore.  I took a picture.  I didnt notice any redness prior to this but wasn&#39;t looking for it.  Do you know when it will go away.  It is larger than when a baseball hits you in an arm and the same amount of tenderness.

I had itching and developed a 3&#34; x 2&#34; oval shaped red area near the site of the vaccine (upper left arm).  It is not too bothersome physically, but it does worry me mentally.  I also had some left armpit tenderness a couple days after the vaccine, which lasted about 3 days, but that has subsided.

Also injection site redness, which extended out for a few inches around the injection site itself.  This lasted about 3 or 4 days and was warm to the touch.  The fever etc. only lasted the one day (day after injection) and by day three I was fine.  Was not servere enough to keep me from working etc., but I did go to bed early that night.

The pain is now radiating down my arm.  I thought it would get better over time, but it has not.  Now I am concerned about getting the second vaccine.  I am also experiencing fatigue and other muscle pain.

                                                First, extreme upper arm discomfort after nursing student had difficulty stopping the bleeding.  Then, within 5 minutes, felt somewhat dizzy as pain radiated across shoulder, up spine and neck, into jaw and right ear.  Then, horrible jabbing pain under shoulder blade, followed by a feeling of extreme compression from site of injection to wrist.  Checked every 10 minutes or so by nurses for 50 minutes.  They said that redness first was up arm then down arm.  Once light headedness improved, I left for work (remote teaching from home).  By 3:20, I found it hard to focus, the throbbing under my shoulder and compression feeling of my arm increased with diminished feeling in right hand.  Usually 97.2 temperature but ran low-grade temp of about 99 degrees for 3 to 4 days.  Sleepless night first night with increased pain and discomfort, i.e., no new symptoms but all symptoms increase with difficulty turning neck and head.  Area around injection warm for several days, with swelling first 24 hours, resolving over a few days; still dark black and blue today, 8 days later.

                                                The muscle pain dissapated after a few days but recurred a week later along with an approximately 2 1/2 by 3 iinch area of redness, warmth and slight hardening surrounding the vaccination site.  This area later began to itch.  It is still a little warmer than the other upper arm and itchy and slightly tender but not as hard or red as it was previously.

                                                Injection on  Wednesday at 3 PM. No immediate reaction. However, a few hours after the shot my left arm (at the injection site) was sore and swollen.  That evening it was painful and disrupted my sleep. The next morning (Thursday) I was somewhat feverish. By the mid-morning my fever was up to 100.4, and by the late afternoon it was up to 101.4. I felt exhausted -- too exhausted to even write an email. I had chills, backache,  and slept nearly the entire day (~8 hours). Based on this, I would call this day a 4 in terms of severity.   The next day (Friday), my fever had declined to 100.2 but was still elevated, but now I had a backache (lower back), and I was still weak. However, I could get out of bed for about 10 minutes without too much difficulty. I slept for about 5 hours during the day. This may also qualify as a 4.  On Saturday, my fever had declined further to 99.4, and my energy level was somewhat better.  Even so, most of the day was spent in bed, but I slept less during the day than on the previous days (about 3 hours). The main thing that was a problem on Saturday besides being weak was a headache. This is a strange thing because I rarely have had headaches in my life.  This is a pounding in the front of my head, only occurring when going from an upright position into a seated or supine position. Most of the headache disappears in about 30 seconds.  Overall I would say Saturday was a 3 in terms of severity. Today (Sunday) my temperature seems to be normal (98.6) -- though this is a full degree above what is normal for me. However, the headache has become worse -- it was hurting me while sleeping, and woke me up from the discomfort.  I still have the backache, and I am still weak. It&#39;s only 6 AM here so I cannot comment on how the rest of the day will go.

I walked through the house to another room. I noticed my arms and legs felt kind of rubbery and that I didn&#39;t seem to have control of them. I fell to the bed and lost consciousness for 5-10 seconds. This was all observed by my spouse. I  recovered quickly. The remainder of the day I had a slight headache and felt slightly nauseous. I took acetaminophen before going to bed and woke up the following morning with no complaints .

There was no fever or chills but I was cold and could not get warm. The symptoms appeared consistent with a flu. These side effects began to dissipate slowly the following day (20/26/2021) and were completely resolved by 02/27/2021.  The side affects from the first dose were insignificant by comparison. Other than the usual sore arm there was minimal muscular aches and slight fatigue and was not debilitating at all like the second dose.

There was no fever or chills but I was cold and could not get warm and just felt lousy. The symptoms appeared consistent with a flu. These side effects began to dissipate slowly the following day (20/26/2021) and were completely resolved by 02/27/2021.

Nest day was okay-just a little dizziness. Third day brought on more symptoms: eyes burning,  little dizziness, neck hurt and I had a feeling like the flu ~ spaciness in my head and Very tired...stayed in bed all day. Next five days were normal. Then on following Wed (a week after the shot) a rash or hives formed around the injection area -was itchy. I felt sleepy &amp; my head had a spaciness again. Stayed in bed all day, napped and this lasted about 10 hrs. This morning I feel better but very dizzy. And the 4&#39; circle around injection is still noticeable.

                                                Experienced slightly swollen and sore arm, headache and muscle aches after the initial injection for approx. 48 hours.  No fever.  8 days after the injection I experienced a swollen, sore red patch on my arm and muscle aches and headache again.  Today is day 3 of the delayed reaction and the redness and swelling has subsided.  I am still feeling achy and tired, along with shakiness and nausea.

                                                I was experiencing a mild RA flare w/ tendinitis going into the vaccine sequence. After 2nd dose my flare worsened to severe within a 9 day period. I had joint, muscle pain, swelling of fingers, hands. I lost much mobility, having gait issues and could not walk unaided ( a first in a flare). I do not take immunosuppressive infusions. Just NSAIDs. My doctor  prescribed a week of Prednisone. I am improving but having to build up strength to stand and walk. My flare continues but is abated. My muscles are weak.

                                                Overwhelming severe pain systemically in joints and muscles on the night of 3/20 that continues to a lesser degree and off and on since the initial several hours.   If it had gone on for much longer I would have had to go the the hospital.  The level of pain was terrifying....and lest you think it&#39;s just that I can&#39;t handle pain, I&#39;ve given birth to 5 children without any pain mediation whatsoever.  I am still in the depths of an autoimmune flair-up where severe pain in my joints and muscles occur.  I continue to feel significant fatigue.  I also continue to experience some level of &#34;brain fog&#34; (the inability to follow though streams for long, read more than a few sentences at a time, inability to stay mentally organized).   Mild nausea and inability to digest well continues since the day of the vaccine 3/15.

                                                After having bad reaction to 1st vaccination, I took Tylenol and went to bed early - about 10PM - before feeling any adverse symptoms. I woke up at about 4AM to use the bathroom and felt my whole body hurting like the last time.  I took more Tylenol and went back to sleep. I slept til about noon and when I got up then, everything hurt terribly. This time more pronounced in back of neck than the last time; could not move head to look up. Also tremendous pain in  left hand area of thumb and right heel of hand. All pain continued until evening, then mostly subsided - except for the hand pains; I definitely still have those though not as bad as they were. (P.S. I&#39;ve had occasional Herpes cold sores since the 80&#39;s  (rarely)  - but since I had Covid in December 2019 and/or the vaccines, I have had 8 outbreaks, one after another (I have one now).

Pain going to elbow, pain still persists as of today (12 days after first injection).  My arm and shoulder aches like a toothache and I have some weakness in the arm.    I find this very concerning since I only had mild fatigue and a sore arm the 2nd day after injection, then all was normal until day 9 after injection.   I am beginning to be very wary of having the 2nd injection.

Husband put electric blanket on and down comforter.  Severe headache, dizziness, n/v, severe joint and muscle pain and ear pain.    I had a slight fever of 100.2.

Not looking forward to the second shot.

                                                During the week of January 11 2021 I began to experience pain in the back of my neck and head on the left side and sensitivity to touch on left side of neck, face and ear.  On January 13 2021 I developed lesions on the back area of my head above the neck.  Since that date lesions have developed on my neck, ear, face, shoulder and chest all on the left side.  The lesions are accompanied by red inflammation and pain.  On January 16 2021 I went to an Urgent Care center and was diagnosed with Shingles.  I was prescribed Valtrex 1 gm 2 times daily and informed to take over the counter medication for pain. In addition to the above, the area on my left upper arm that is the point of the vaccination injection began to hurt again during the week of January 4 2021 and  a red rash approximately 3 inch long by 2 inch wide developed.  This rash lasted 2 days and then disappeared.  The arm remains sensitive to touch from the point of the injection to the wrist on the top and from injection point to the elbow on the side of the arm.  I am also experiencing pain in the elbow and wrist on the left.

                                                I started experiencing muscle pain again and pruritus in my vaccinated arm (left) and an area of epidermis (approximately 4&#34;x6&#34;) around the vaccination site is also showing moderate erythema and slight edema on 1/20/21 (12 days after dose 1). I staring applying 1% hydrocortisone cream on the affected area and taking Benadryl 25mg tablets. The pruiritus started to lessen however the erythema and edema did not decrease so I contacted my primary care provider. She referred me to an allergist who I saw via telehealth on 1/25/21. By that time the pruiritus, erythema, and edema was almost gone however I did show her a picture when the reaction was at its most severe state. As of today, it is still present but continues to resolve. My allergist discussed the reported incidence of this reaction, informed me that it did not contraindicate me from receiving the 2nd dose, and that this reaction may or may not occur again.

                                                About 4 hours after the vaccine I started getting a headache. At approximately 8 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started running a fever of 100F. It went up to 101F and stayed there until last night (Jan. 27). It got as high as 102F. I also had joint pain, nausea, fatigue. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen for the symptoms without much relief.  Today (Jan. 28) I feel much better but am very weak and tired. Arm at injection site is still very painful.

                                                After a normal week with only slight effects, on the 9th day I noticed itching and reddening, with some hives. I applied cold compresses, took aspirin. It worsened over the next 24 hours, covering a larger part of my upper arm, and I applied Cortisone, took Advil, and continued with ice packs. It has calmed down over the next four days and there is now a slight ring of reddish skin, with a small patch more inflamed. Much better, but not gone, so I am still doing the care routine. Talked to a pharmacist and she said this is the right course.

Friday continued to feel the same sickness, nauseated, headache, off and on low grade temp and pain  in arms and upper back. I was taking 800mg Ibuprofen 3 times a day and it would ease off headache a little, but nothing  would stop for long.  I was just miserable. had heard the 2nd vaccine could cause such problems, but not the first...therefore, I am a little frightened of getting the 2nd vax. I tried to call the triage nurse at the VA to  ask her about it, but never could get thru to her.  Sent message saturday night to PCP, and was told to go to this website and put in info.

                                                Heart started racing about 7:00 pm the night of the vaccine until today (I haven&#39;t noticed it today for the first time since the vaccine). The next morning after - so nauseous; and aching all over; so tired I could hardly move as I had joint pain, too. Couldn&#39;t throw up but nausea was there constantly - even when I went back to work on Monday I as still nauseated and still in pain. When I came home from work on Monday the body aches were gone and my leg felt numb. So it lasted a good four days for me.  No treatment except drank lots of liquids and stayed still as I could so nausea wouldn&#39;t worsen. I still ache but that might be because of my ruptured disc.

ER treated me for cellulitis although results of blood work,  etc which came back after diagnosis did not show anything wrong. IV steroids, antibiotics, Tylenol at ER &amp; oral steroids/antibiotics 5 days following. Rash gone the next day and fever broke that night. Symptoms except rash returned immediately once discontinued medication 5 days later and have persisted for the past 5 days with fever as high as 104.8. Re-read my Moderna material wondering if anything in the vaccine could be causing it and was told adverse reaction can appear as much as 3 weeks later and that symptoms I had were common.

                                                Patient complained of immediate pain near shoulder joint after vaccination. There was a note on the Allergic Reaction record to call patient &#34;about injection.&#34; Patient called 2/9/21 at 11:13 am to inquire about injection by Nurse. Patient states her arm started hurting within 3 minutes after injection and was focal. Per patient, her shoulder has been hurting since the day of injection, but it is much improved currently. She reports pain with palpation and upward movement, but again significantly improved. Reports taking Tylenol once to alleviate pain but has not taken any more pain medication so as not to interfere with antibody response to vaccine. Instructed to report symptoms to PHP for follow-up

                                                When I first got the vaccine I was fine but as the day went on I felt soreness in my left arm with some stiffness in my neck. Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

                                                11 days post-vaccine (on the morning of 2/22), I woke to find that the area surrounding the injection site in my left arm was a little bit red and sore.  By the end of the day, the soreness in my arm radiated up into the left side of my neck.  I applied a heating pad, took a warm bath and went to bed early.  This morning, my neck is a little better but the arm is more sore and the red area has gotten larger and is swollen.  The pain med-to-mild and does not restrict range of motion or use of my arm.  No distinct pattern or broken skin.

Over next 36 hours fever was between 100-102. Nausea began 48 hours after injection.  It is now Tuesday, almost 4 days since injection and am still dizzy and weak.  Fever stopped yesterday and only light headache today.   My husband also had all my symptoms except a much lower fever.  We are wondering if we could have got a bad batch???  They said to expect 1-2 days of mild discomfort.  This was like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever had.

                                                On the morning after receiving the vaccine I had severe pain in my left hip, across my shoulders and lower back. I had a golf trip planned so I drove friends from and played 9 holes of golf that afternoon. I took Tylenol every four hours and the pain eased. I felt tired that day but the next day the pain was minor and I was not as tired.I played 18 holes of golf and played 9 on the following day and drove home. The first day of my trip when I had a bowel movement I noticed a strange acidic smell. All that day every time I ate I had a bowel movement, which is RARE for me. I usually go once in the morning. Also when I had to urinate I had to go IMMEDIATELY. The urination issue improved after the 3rd day but I continue to have the bowel problem and a mild headache and just don&#39;t feel well. I am mostly concerned about the bowel problem. I have to go every time I eat. Sometimes it is somewhat normal and sometimes it is like diarrhea.

By the next morning, I could NOT raise my left arm, put on clothes, or do my normal activities. I took ibuprophen for 3 days to dull the pain. But the pain and the pain and immobility have returned. It feels like the needle must have hit a nerve a bone or a ligament. My fingers tingle sometimes.

Unable to sleep on right side as I normally do, because of soreness in upper arm 02/18-area about the size of a baseball at injection site  was red, swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. It stayed that way for about 36 hours. Then it began to shrink in size. 02/20-injection site turned a red/purple color about the size of a half-dollar, only slightly warmer than rest of arm. 02/21-upper arm began itching around injection site. When I looked in the mirror, there was a red rash covering most of my upper arm. It continued until 02/24. Went away for almost 24 hours, but returned. I continue to have itching, but only around the injection site. It is not as severe now as it had been. Applying ice pack to numb the itching helps.

                                                About 30 hours after the vaccine the skin under both arms turned bright red.  This extended down the inside of both arms and down both sides of my body. There was NO itching, bumps or streaks and no burning or heat.  I only noticed it when I took a shower.  This lasted about 36 hours and then faded and has not returned at this point, 9 days after the injection.  At about this time, I had extreme tiredness and exhaustion.  This has continued for the entire 9 days.  Both arms and legs feel heavy.  Headache for most of the 9 days.

                                                evening of 2/25 started to have some chills but no chills when I woke up the next day.  on 2/26 in the evening there was an increase in joint pain.  I took 400mg ibuprofen at bed time.  During the night I woke up due to the pain and noticed that I had been sweating.   I took 400mg around 3am and went back to sleep.  Woke at 6AM on the2/27and still had joint pain but not as painful as the night before.  Couple hours later while taking a shower I noticed that my left arm at the site of the vaccine had a large red blotch.  It  did not itch or was painful but it was somewhat warm.  At that point I called my primary drs office and was advised to go to urgent care.  At Urgent care my arm was examined by a doctor and he ordered a Covid test and prescribed doxycycline as he felt I had cellulitis.

My hand, arm, leg, chest and neck mostly.  I just got my second shot so we will see if it continues.  I put &#34;unknown&#34; on item 20 since I don&#39;t know if it will continue yet.

That resolved but within three hours I had severe pain in my left upper arm and shoulder with some discomfort down the dorsal surface of the left forearm. The injection was given maybe one finger-breadth below the acromion and I am very tender right under the bone as well as into the upper arm. It is hard to lift my arm. This is much worse than my previous vaccine. I expected that, but this is higher up and may actually involve the shoulder joint. The same woman injected my husband and he is having similar symptoms. His injection was also given high on the arm. I am concerned about our shoulder joints.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 10-Jan-2021.  On 11-Feb-2021, approximately 2 days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11-Feb-2021, the patient developed body and joint aches, chest pains, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, and just hurt all over and felt terrible. On 12-Feb-2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms persisted, and she was in the emergency room (ER) to be treated.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, chest pain, body and joint aches, fever, chills, fatigue, and nausea, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Numbness/weakness in all fingertips and both legs to above the knees. The symptoms continued to increase and at 11:30 pm I was taken to ER. Was transported by ambulance to Hospital. Was admitted to the ICU. Lumbar puncture was done on 03/13/21 to rule out Guillain Barre. Neurologist determined it was a neurological reaction to the COVID vaccine shot. Was released from the hospital 03/15/21. Legs continue to be numb/weak, but I am able to walk carefully unassisted.

                                                Approximately 3 days post vaccine I began to have severe tinnitus. On the same day, I began to have difficulty with my vision , especially in the left eye, a headache and all my joints began to ache. I was also very tired. The symptoms progressively got worse  over the following two weeks and included a couple of episodes of heart rhythm irregularities . During the third week, the headache, eye issues and joint pain began to resolve but the tinnitus is debilitating and prevents me from mentally focusing or sleeping.

It was definitely swollen and some redness too. I took my temperature and had no fever. Called my doctor&#39;s office to report my findings. Was instructed to apply a cold ice pack on it and take ibuprofen and to contact you with my event. I did not need to visit the office and continuing to ice pack my arm and ibuprofen.  As of 3:41 pm CST it is still swollen.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: My left arm was very sore starting in the evening of 1/6/2021. This soreness got worse over the next 2 days and then tapered off over the weekend.  On 1/11/2021, I started having pain in my left axillary region.  This pain increased into 1/12/2021.  Also, on 1/12, my left upper arm started hurting.  On 1/13, I still had pain in my left axillary region, and thespian in my left upper arm worsened.  Also, on 1/13 my left upper arm started itching.  Around 5pm on 1/13, I had a chance to look at my left upper arm and there was a large reddened area to my left upper arm which included the vaccine injection site.  This area was warm to touch.  About 5:30pm, I took 25mg of Benadryl.  I took another 25mg Benadryl at 11pm.  This morning (1/14), the redness is fading to the area on my left upper arm though itching remains.  There is slight pain to the area.  The pain to the left axillary region is much better-barely noticeable.  I reported this event to County Health Department and to my primary physician.

                                                about 7 hours after injection, the site was sore and tingling. Throughput the evening, the tingling sensation progressed up the left side of my neck and my ear.  My ear felt similar s to Novacaine wearing off after a dental visit. During the night my throat got a similar sensation and created the need to try coughing it out. By 24 hours after the injection I was tired, with sore joints and muscle aches. By 36 hours I was still sleeping it off and at 48 hours I feel pretty well back to normal.

Started getting sick to her stomach all evening, started throwing up last night beginning at 11:00 PM, throwing up bile.  Today having fever of 101, didn&#39;t take anything for it, but down to 100 now.  Took 2 Tums and had such achy joints and sat down in a chair and could not get up from the chair.  Took some Tylenol and that helped, but freezing cold.  Didn&#39;t sleep all night.  Has not notified her doctor of the symptoms, just calling us.

While driving home my face became warm, after arriving home face/cheeks extremely red/flushed.  Have a picture taken at 3:54 for documentation. Not sure if from anxiety, but felt jaw tightness and a thick tongue.  No itching, swallowing problems etc.   lasted approximately 15 minutes. By 4:57 pm redness had faded.   Picture documentation. 9:15 pm had right ear pain and mild reddened of right cheek.   Picture documentation.

                                                Felt very good for 5 or 6 hours after injection. Left arm had became sore and stiff by 5:00 .  By 6:15 PM slight nausea, fatigue, body aches and chills.  By 7:30 or 8:00 PM experienced extreme chills, fever, and more intense body aches all over - especially sore and stiff left arm.  Also slight nausea and loose stools.  After feeling well enough to find the thermometer, temp registered at 100.5, and continued through night. The chills were intense. Treated fever with liquids and rest.  Fever and chills lasted until about 9:00 AM 1/27/2021.  I was able to eat a little, then very fatigued and slept until 4:00 PM 1/27/2021. After a light dinner, slept all night. Woke 1/28/2021 better, but not energetic.  As of today, 1/29/2021, I am able to return to normal activities.

Tightening of jaw (as when eating something really tart).  Pain felt similar to muscle spasms and would be bad enough to cause nausea &amp; vomiting.  When pain subsided would experience chills and shivering.  This would come and go over the next 5-6 hours.    Checked for fever, but temperature was within normal range.

Skin was hot to the touch and itching ensued.   January 31-- 2:03 p.m.  In pain and rash was itching terribly bad.  Called the pharmacist (since this was weekend).

Took photo progression from January 30 thru today, February 1 -- rash is still visible and itching but thinning; knot is smaller but still there; arm is stiff--but better.

                                                It started with my arm hurting, even my fingers on the left arm. Then my temperature began to climb to 101.7 within 20 minutes, accompanied by chills.  I was very cold--freezing hands and feet. Could not get warm. Then headache started. Migraine intensity no matter what position I assumed. My joints began to hurt, every joint --knees, elbows, back, even fingers-- so it was difficult walking or moving. Even my teeth hurt where I had had dental work the precious day.   All I could do safely was lie in bed with many pillows to hold my head up. I was also nauseous, and a bad case of post nasal drip developed. I could not  rest properly all night--I took one baby tylenol  every four hours (my usual dose) but it did not help.  Finally at 8:00 AM the fever began to subside slowly till to 98.7 and the head ached/ joint pains are  slowly dissolving while I am writing this. I normally don&#39;t run fever and the last time I had the flue was 40 years ago! I have never been this sick in my life.

                                                About nine days after my first vaccination, I experienced limited mobility and some discomfort with movement with my left shoulder. Since then I have let it rest from activities but  I have done range of motion exercises as well as strengthening exercises. I have also taken 400 mg of ibuprofen twice daily for about a week. I stopped the ibuprofen approximately a week later but I?ve continue to do strengthening and stretching exercises of my left shoulder with some improvement. I reported this both to my internal medicine doctor whom I have given you her name of as well as my sports Medicine doctor. They agreed with my regime . I still don?t have full range of motion as well as some pain with certain movements with my left shoulder.

Her arm felt warm, and realized it was the area where she got the vaccine.  She put some lotion on it, and just kept watching it and did not go away.  The hand started feeling funny, different feeling to it.  The redness was trying to travel underneath the arm and around it.   She took an allergy pill for it, which helped the itching at first, but now it&#39;s localized more to the area of the vaccine.  She does have an appointment today with her doctor.  She also took some Advil but going to wait to see what the doctor tells her to do.

Saw a dermatologist, who said it is a typical &#34;viral allergic rash.&#34; Told me he could not give me steroids, but gave me sample of cream to reduce itch and recommended OTC antihistamine seasonal allergy pills. He said I should not take the 2nd dose, but to follow the advice of Moderna and CDC re: that decision.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA. On Feb 14, 2021, I received Moderna  011M20A vaccine at  pharmacy. I had no side effects until 9 days after the injection, when I noticed a  huge, raised, hot welt at the side of the injection, a painful and hard lymph node under my left arm, and a small symmetrical rash on my back just below the waist. I began taking Benadryl on day 10 after the injection, and the lymph node and left arm welt subsided after 48 hours of their appearance but the rash was uncontrollable. It was very itchy, sometimes pins and needles, always symmetrical, and appeared on either side of my head under my hair, more extensively all over my back, and on my inner thighs.  On Feb 24 I went into  Pharmacy , where I received my injection, and reported my reactions to the pharmacist there. The next day, Feb 25, I became so uncomfortable with my rash that I got an appointment to see my  dermatologist,  who took 2 biopsies of the rash, and when I asked if I could describe it as a &#34;bad, full body rash,&#34; her answer was &#34;absolutely!&#34; Today, Feb 26, is the first day I have no new spots or traveling rash areas, and I think I am controlling the rash with Benadryl and there is less itching today. I am worried about the side effects I might have with the second Covid shot

                                                In addition to recognized side effects, approximately 24 hours after injection, I experienced sudden-onset severe pain in my right shoulder that traveled through my biceps and into my elbow. On a scale of 1-10, I?d rate the severity as a 10. This lasted approximately 15 minutes.   Over the ensuing 5 days I had noticeable but tolerable intermittent right arm pain. Then beginning on the 10th day following injection, I experienced sudden and severe right shoulder pain that traveled down my biceps into my elbow again. I&#39;d rate the pain at a 9 on the same scale. This time however, the pain started around 11 pm and did not subside. I tried sleeping but couldn?t. I got up and spent the rest of the night holding my arm to immobilize it, however that did nothing to stop the pain. It was about 5 am when I finally took 50 mg diclofenac and in about 2 hours the pain subsided to a tolerable 4 on the same pain scale.   As the day wore on, the pain increased again to a level 9 without medication so I continued with 50 mg diclofenac every 8 hours over the following 4 days and knocked it back to a level 3. This pain has occurred in my right shoulder, biceps, elbow, forearm and even my fingers and intensifies toward evening. I have been able to tolerate the pain without medication at about a level 3 for the past 2 days. However, I take a 50 mg tab of diclofenac an hour or 2 before bed as the pain intensifies toward evening. This has allowed me to sleep through the night.   In addition to the arm pain I developed muscle weakness in my right biceps about 3 days ago and am unable to lift my right arm above my head. The pain is not what prevents the movement. It?s as though my arm is not receiving the nerve impulse to move. Taking all of this together, I?d say that immunization appears to have triggered Parsonage Turner Syndrome. As I understand this immune-mediated syndrome, several events can trigger it, including immunization. I experienced this phenomenon one other time, approximately 2 years ago but did not correlate it to a vaccination at the time. This time it?s too apparent. I wonder how many other reports you?ve received that are like this and whether the vaccines will trigger the same reactions. I also wonder now whether I should receive a Moderna ?booster? if needed in the near to long term. I have no interest in going through this event a

That night ran fever of 103 pain all through body, chills, couldn&#39;t warm up.  couldn&#39;t eat, just drank water Respiration quick and short. Scary all night long..  Next day fever of 102 aching, bone pain, extreme soreness in arm, couldn&#39;t walk without falling..  Stayed in bed, did not eat, no appetite.  Third day fever broke somewhat in night.  Sweating, fever down to 101, still weak and uncoordinated. Still short of breath just walking.  I had a bad case of Covid-19  in July of 2020 and asked if this would aggravate it.  Was told no.  It actually felt like I had a case of it again.  The pain has been really awful.  I still do no want to eat on the third day.  Still having chills.

There was no weakness.  The next day I had transient flu symptoms (hot, nausea) and a 12 hour headache.  Within a week I had a bad flare of migratory joint pain and swelling in my knees, hips, shoulders, elbows.  The joint symptoms are somewhat better (maybe 50% or less) but have not resolved.

Through the night it increased to the whole thigh, and a little on her abdomen, and itched all night.  The next morning is dissipated, and it kept happening for the next night and then increased.  Friday night it happened to the point that 95% of her body was covered with hives, rash, and felt like her skin was burning and pins and needles throughout the areas of the rash.   She called her doctor on Thursday morning and kept in contact them him.  Was given a prescription on Friday for Prednisone and she took that morning and Saturday morning.  Her symptoms were gone during the day but at night they would return with the itching.  She started Benadryl 50 mg on Friday.  She also used Hydrocortisone ointment through the night on Thursday.  Saturday morning her entire face was swollen.  She put a cold washrag on her face and within 45 minutes it stopped hurting her, continued with the 50 mg of Benadryl every 4 hours.  By noontime she was getting short or breath on 2/20/21 she went to the ER.They gave her Solu-Medrol 120 mg, Benadryl 25 mg IV as she had just taken a 15 mg tablet 3-4 hours before that.  Then they gave her Ibuprofen and Pepcid IV.     The shortness of breath was when she was talking, and within 4 hours she was fine.  She had markings on her legs as well.   She was wiped out by this with no energy.   She has not been able to do gardening or anything due to the fatigue.  The rash and symptoms are gone, but her energy level has not returned.  Her legs felt like jelly when she walked on 17/18th.    On Monday, 2/22/20 she stopped the prednisone and Benadryl totally.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:30AM. Around 4:00PM that day I started having severe dizziness. About 40 minutes later I had severe pain in my neck, back, and shoulders. I have had 3 herniated discs in the past and the pain from this was much worse than that pain.  About the same time I felt a headache coming on that just got worse as the night went on. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep, however, the pain was so great that I could not lay down flat or sit up. I spent the night walking the floor. During the night I vomited several times. I also developed jaw pain, earaches, and a sore throat.  But the worse part was that during the night I started to feel the sensation of pins and needles being thrust into my legs, ankles, arms, and hands. I never did however have a fever. I finally was able to fall asleep at about 5AM and slept for several hours. When I woke up the pain was mostly gone and I was just left with no energy at all so that I could hardly lift my head off the pillow. I stayed in bed the entire day and the next day I was fine.

Pain persisted to lower back and both hips for several days. Took Ibuprofen 600mg 3 times a day but did not last during the night. Pain would wake me up. After several days pain moved to just left hip and radiated down the back of my leg to the knee the radiated to lateral calf. On Monday 3/1/21 went to my PCP because the pain was not improving and at night it woke me and I was awake for several hours. Walking didnot increase the pain but sitting would. My PCP felt it was related to my Covid Vaccination. She changed my NSAID to voltarin 2 times a day,  because the ibuprofen was not long lasting and she started a muscle relaxer for night time, Tizanidine 4mg. I don&#39;t feel the voltarin is as effective as the ibuprofen as the ibuprofen resolved the pain but for only 4-5 hrs. I will stop tthe voltarin and return to the ibuprofen. Muscle relaxer is helpful.

On 3/1, rash continued to spread over entire body.  On 3/2, saw primary physician who ordered blood work.  He adjusted prednisone schedule, prescribed hydroxidine, and epipens, and requested followup status. On 3/4, rash and itchiness dramatically subsided.  Today the rash is gone.

Just then I felt strong pain in my lower back.  This pain has been with me ever since.   I spoke to my doctor.  She recommended Advil and Tylenol around the clock for a few days.  Also Flexaril, muscle relaxer at night. I did this for three days.  Also she recommended some gentle stretches and the application of heat.  I am following these directives.  The pain persists.

                                                My entire upper left  arm and shoulder/neck radiate with pain. I am unable to rotate or flex my arm without severe and radiant pain. My arm is weak and cannot raise, lift or rotate it above the elbow.  Very difficult to maintain sleep with a throbbing arm. I have been taking Alleve and it helps but the pain is still there just milder. Muscles are not sore but something is aching deep in bone/joints. I went to the Kinesiologist who told me the rotor cuff is the issue. He did an pressure point &#34;adjustment&#34; and the pain subsided for a day or two and now I&#39;m back to being in pain during any level of movement again.  I believe that my injection was given too high in my shoulder and caused SIRVA. I even took a picture of where the injection site was given.  If needed I can provide it to you.

                                                Within 24 hours, the inoculation site became red, swollen and itchy which I expected. After a couple of days it calmed down.  I am reporting the symptoms that began a week - 10 days later . On January  19 or 20 my joints and muscles began to feel more painful that usual. By Friday the 22nd I felt a deep dizziness momentarily and shook it off. By that evening, I developed a fever, with shakes and chills which continued into the next morning. My throat was sore. I was completely exhausted. My joints and muscles felt as though there were little bonfires burning. I decided to go to a walk in ER to at least receive a Covid 19 test to see if I could have become infected . The test was negative as well as the flu test, strep culture and multi-bacterial screening test. My blood work indicated a heightened inflammatory response.  I have gradually gotten better over the course of the last 10 days. I am reporting this as the vaccine is experimental and although the symptoms that I exhibited are outside of the normal period that a reaction would be expected to occur, perhaps there are outlier cases on the curve

Pain &amp; arm movement  fully resolved on its own within  about  10- 12 hours, With intermittent  ice  applications, swelling  resolved within  10 hours.  As of today, four days after the reaction started, I still have splotches, but they are a lighter color,  &amp; a bit of soreness in  that area.

                                                I had no symptoms for the first 48 hours. On days 3-6 I was fatigued but not enough to effect daily living activities.  Day 6 ( Feb 18, 2021) I started to have a lot of muscular aches and the injection site started to get red and swollen.  I had fever and chills from the 18th through the 20th  as well as a swollen arm and a lot of redness in the arm and minor itching. The red area on my arm was a patch about 4 inches wide and 6 inches long. The swelling was confined to the injection site and was raised up in a circle about 2 inches in diameter. My fever during this time was at 99 degrees.  Today is Feb 22 and most of my symptoms are gone, just minor redness and itching at injection site. I was just surprised that my symptoms didn?t show up until about 6 days after the vaccination.. Everything I have read suggested they could appear within 48 hours of the injection.

                                                First, the shot hurt when I got the injection.  Most people say they don&#39;t even feel it, but I definitely felt the needle  go in and then felt the fluid go in.  By late afternoon, my left arm was very sore .  By  evening, I  couldn&#39;t lift my arm at all  due to pain in  that muscle at the top of my shoulder.  I think by that night but perhaps by the next morning I still couldn&#39;t lift my arm and the pain had gone into my neck on the left side.  After about 36 hrs, it started getting better but it was extremely sore for at least 4 days.   I still have some residual pain in my left arm and the base of my neck on that side.     About 4 days ago, I noticed  a round bruise about the size of a quarter about 1.5 inches away from where I think the shot was administered.  I am not aware of anything that might have caused it, but Im pretty sure it wasn&#39;t where the shot  was administered.  It seems to be growing a bit from when I first noticed it.

My left arm was tingling from the elbow down to the side of my hand and my ring and little fingers and palm of my hand were numb.  The tingling in my left arm has not stopped since then, my left elbow is sore to the touch and the two fingers tingle and are numb.  The flu symptoms subsided by the following day but the numbness and tingling in my left hand has continued.

As night progressed the symptoms worsened - about 2am intense back pain between shoulder blades radiating to chest, heart was pounding, temperature increased to 101 About 3am was in extreme pain throughout entire body, severe chills/shaking,  fever was 102.2, experienced minor urinary incontinence About 3:30am I finally had to take  2 Advil - within an hour the symptoms had lessened and temp had dropped to 100 By noon (22 hours after injection) I was experiencing only mild body aches, temperature was normal, left arm remained sore but I could move it - other side effects had resolved  I am very stoic and have a fairly high pain tolerance. I had no side effects after shot 1. After shot 2 I was sicker than I have ever been in my life ?- for several hours I was concerned I was going to die.

                                                Feb. 23 eve. I had pains in the nerves in my left hip going down my leg and the left side of my tongue was sore. Feb. 24. I was very tired and achy all day with a bad headache. I had some nausea. I took Aleve but it didn&#39;t help much. I noticed when I went to bed that I had an open, bleeding sore on my right wrist. I knew that I had not done anything to hurt my wrist. Feb. 25. When I took a shower, I saw that I had an open, bleeding sore on my right shin. The right side of my tongue was hurting and sore. When I looked in the mirror at my tongue it had little red blotches all over the right side.  I have a bad headache but not as bad as yesterday.  I am also somewhat tired, but not achy.

                                                Nausea. Overall muscle aches. Migraines that responded to the 2 different drugs lists, but manifested repeatedly such that the nausea and very severe head pain woke me. My response was to take a different drug in each 24 hour period. Using sumatriptan first and then 24 hours later after the pain ceased and then reestablished itself, using Migrainol, and so on. The drugs worked, but the projectile vomiting and head pain consistently came and went. Injection #1 was a bit shorter and slightly less intense, but the last time I experienced projectile vomiting due to migraines was in 1999.

She told me she felt numbness and heaviness in her arms and legs about 10 minutes after the vaccine. I checked her blood pressure two times and both times they were in the 140s/90s. I gave her a bottle of water and monitored her for 30 minutes. She did say the dizziness went away and felt better. She left after 30 minutes feeling well.

Phone call to patient on 02/26/21 and she states pain is getting much better, still painful to lift arm but she can tell it is better.

                                                Fifteen minutes after injection, I experienced pain in my left chest. It migrated to the center of my chest and could be felt on both front and back. Pain was a dull, squeezing ache that could be mitigated by placing hand over the pain and leaning forward. Pain level was 2. The pain migrated to left shoulder and up left side of neck. Vital signs were normal.  A few dry coughs caused medical personnel to offer water, which was declined. The pain was similar to the pain I experienced after drinking contrast medium (now considered an allergic reaction) but without breathing difficulties. The pain went away after an hour and half. Nurses suggested emergency medical care, which I declined.

                                                Eight days after receiving my first vaccine I experienced soreness in my left arm.  The next day at approximately 4:30 pm  my left hand started to visibly swell and continued to swell for the next several hours until I could barely remove my rings. My right hand started to swell at approximately 5:30pm and by 8 pm both hands were extremely swollen where I could not close them due to pain and swelling.  Into the next morning and for 2 more days I also experienced sore joints in my ankles (no swelling) and extreme fatigue. The swelling started to subside  on the third day (yesterday) and today my hands are back to normal with a bit of joint pain in the fingers. No more fatigue or joint pain in ankles today  (4th day) .  When I received the vaccine on Tuesday, February 16 I experienced about 3 days of soreness in my left arm, very little fatigue and I had chills for about an hour the evening of the 16th.  After those 3 days I felt fine.  Since the vaccine I have stayed home and have not injured myself nor have I been bitten by anything to have caused the extreme swelling of my hands 9 days after the first vaccine.

                                                First two days after vaccine- tired. By day three began experiencing back pain. By Wednesday, January 20th severe back pain and chest tightening. I went first to Urgent Care. Dr. said EKG ok but I should follow up with Dr. or ER. That evening I went to ER at Hospital. By then it felt like my back and chest were in vice. It did not feel like regular back pain- more searing and deep spasms. Had a gnawing kind of feeling in my stomach and esophagus. Pain in upper part of my body....sometimes waves of pain in shoulders and down back half of my arms. ER Dr gave me shot of pain meds and sent me home after a few hours. Vice like feeling subsided but deep muscle pain in back continued.It was not as severe as the previous day. Over the next week it continued to go from severe back to mild.I visited my primary care Dr/PA and tried changing GERD meds from Famotidine to another- no help. Tried muscle relaxers- I just slept on those. About a week after first visit I went to ER again after a bad night of the vice like feeling in chest and back. ER Dr. did CAT scan of heart and lungs. No sign of pneumonia . Since then I have had an endoscope, seen a cardiologist, and an orthopedic Dr.  After second dose, reaction came back, but less severe than the first time.

                                                Sent: 3/4/2021   7:55 AM Subject: Non-Urgent Medical Question                    For a full week now, I have been battling diarrhea and a very hyperactive stomach and intestines. Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.

Took Tylenol for fever which helped control that symptom.  It was like hospitalized COVIC all over again. Reluctant to receive 2nd dose if I have this same adverse reaction.  I had donated my COVID convalescent plasma that morning for the 4th occasion but I was told it would not interfere with the vaccine.

                                                I started with itchiness at the injection site.  Prior to this I had a lump and soreness to the touch  but no redness or itchiness. When I got home from work  on 1.19.2021 I noticed a large red  patch which was hot to the touch.  During the day my arm where I received the injection became very itchy.  During the day I also was extremely tired and had developed a headache and felt like I may be getting a cold.  I also had a neckache.  I still have those symptoms.   I received my vaccine on 1.06.2021.

                                                I had to sit for 15 minutes after receiving the injection which I did. I can not remember if the headache started while I was sitting there or after I left and driving home. I got home by 10am and went to lay down.  I got up about 10:30 and took some Tylenol and went and laid back to down. I laid for down for about another 30 minutes and then got up and fixed me something to eat, and the headache seemed to go away. Early afternoon same day the headache came back about 3pm I took another dose of Tylenol. Then I laid back down for the couple of hours. Since then I have to go purchase more Tylenol and I have been taking it at least 3-4 times a day. I only take the Tylenol when the headache &#34;bothers me more&#34;. Normally in the morning, afternoon and early evening is when the headache get worse.  Feels like a dull headache constantly feels it in my temporal area and the back of my neck. My sore is still at the injection site and the injection site got red, hot, hard and swollen. Extreme shoulder discomfort not exactly sure when the redness started but noticed it Wednesday evening after the vaccine, knows that the soreness started the next day after being vaccinated.   Had previously had COVID-19, tested positive on October 7th 2020   Notified doctors office via phone and reported to the event to VAERS.

She took Tylenol and went back to sleep and symptoms were improved when she woke up.  Then 48 hours after vaccination, she developed hives on her left upper outer arm.  She has treated them with topical Calazyme.  The redness is improving, but they are still raised.

                                                I received the injection around 2:30 I felt fine. It did not hurt going in. I stopped by a restaurant to get some take out and must of started feeling disorientated and completely forgot I had this folder with the VSAFE information. I started feeling chills all over my body, I kept taking my temperature it was 95.7, I started having a headache top of my head, the temporal, the back of my neck. They were all over the place. I went to bed and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It was like my brain was going crazy, it wasn&#39;t like an anxious feeling. I finally feel asleep around 4am and kept waking up remembering fragments of valid dreams. The dreams were fragment with such dread and anxiety in them.  It was like a huge wave of depression and anxiety. By about 9am I was fully awake, but my body hurt, my muscles ached I felt fatigued. The chills and headaches were through. I was still having weird racing thoughts. About 10pm it all went away and I slept fine and woke up the next morning and I was fine. My arm is still sore at the injection site but all the other symptoms went away.    Saturday morning I was talking with a friend on the phone, and she reminded me of the folder I received the folder. I completely forgot about this folder. I found this folder later that day and then I tried to access VSAFE. It made me realize how disorientated I was.

                                                I am concerned they injected  high, above the muscle.  They had trouble getting the injection in, it burned a lot, she kept asking me to relax my muscle (which was relaxed) and when I took the Band-Aid off it looked high. I took a photo at the time, because of my concern.   My shoulder joint was quite sore and stiff the next few days. 3 1/2 weeks later I still have an aching burning pain;  it feels as if they hit the shoulder capsule or the periosteum.   My questions are as follows:  Do you think this is too high to inject? Do you think I will have gotten enough absorption anyway?  Is there a way to get measured for the antibody response in this situation?  Should this be reported as an adverse event?  ( I hate to get anyone upset at our hospital, as I am grateful I got the vaccine and intend to get the booster Will this affect the booster?

                                                I had a possible reaction on my Left arm and chest. My Right arm received the injection. I never have any sticks in my left arm since I have  developed Lymphedema post breast cancer mastectomies and treatment in  April 2006. When I arose  my effected arm was red in color, with a rash on top of that. It was hot to the touch and swollen and stiff.  My husband took me to the emergency room of the hospital named in Item 21 and later that day I was admitted to the hospital. They diagnosed it as a severe infection, resulting in cellulitis and started me on round the clock IV antibiotics.

Started running low grade fever on 24th  headache and all kinds of muscle pain which I thought might be the fibromyalgia flaring up.  Just took generic Tylenol.  Today is Feb 9 and I&#39;m still running a low grade fever anywhere from 98.9 (I usually run 97.6 or8)  but no higher than 99.9.  Fever comes in waves, as did the muscle pain. and general malaise.  Bullseye is gone now but there is still a small area where it&#39;s still warm to the touch.  Scared of second shot.  I&#39;m sorry!

In the middle of the night, felt soreness on right side. When I got up in morning, had throbbing pain near hip in front. It has persisted all day and cannot lift right leg unless I pull my pants leg up slowly. Extremely painful when trying to do this to get up. Took Aleve 2X but has not helped.

But felt better the next day, and by third day, arm felt fine.  However, seven days after moderna vaccine injection, developed swelling, hardness, redness, hot to the touch, itchiness, at injection site. Hurt to raise left arm up high, left arm feels really stiff when trying to raise it.

                                                A few hours after my vaccination, my arm became extremely sore and was extremely sore all night, and remained so the next day. I have a high pain tolerance, but my arm felt as if it had received a powerful injury, and was hard to lift without using my other arm.  I also had a slight fever the next day, chills and muscle aches and fatigue. I am normally very active, but spent the day in bed. The next day I felt much better although my arm was very sore for another day or two. Then, the evening of the 21st of Feb., my arm, at the vaccination site became very itchy and was painful to touch in that area. I slept well but woke with the same itchiness, and soreness, and now tonight, Feb. 22nd, that area is still itchy and a bit sore. But I have not had the swelling and redness that I am reading about with Covid arm.

My stomach was queasy.  By the next morning, my joints hurt so much it was difficult to roll over in bed, and all the other symptoms were still there and worse.  I did not have a fever.  I developed a headache.  All I could do was lie in bed; sitting up felt exhausting.  By evening of that day, my joint pain was lessening and my stomach felt somewhat better.  By the following morning, I felt normal, basically.  So in total, about a day and a half of bad reaction.

                                                Severe, debilitating joint pain that presented exactly one week after the initial dose. Joints in my knees, hips, shoulders, and wrists were painful to the point that movement is limited. There is no pattern as to where or when the pain strikes. Usually the pain remains from 24 to 48 hours before it abates. Stiffness, pain, and swelling not helped with NSAIDS or heat. I did not have this severe joint pain before I had my initial Moderna vaccination.

Next day I still had a slight fever, general malaise, soreness from shot in arm, a few occurances of heart palpitations, sore back. On third day, no fever, but still felt under the weather, with a sore arm plus some hardness in the injection area. Had some palpitations that evening. By the 4th day, felt better in general, but began feeling a very slight numbness on lips and surrounding facial area. Arm still sore with hardness. Better on 5th day. Day 8 &amp; 9 had pains in lower shins. Day 9 I noticed tiny small bumps on upper front and back shoulders and upper arms. They were not hive like and some were itchy. Took some Benadryl that night which didn&#39;t reallly help. Days 10-12 - still have tiny bumps some slightly pink, mostly skin tone, spreading to neck area. Saw my internist on 2/25/21 Day 14 to ask if symptoms related to vaccine shot. He didn&#39;t think the rash was related because it didn&#39;t start away after shot. The continuing ever so slight numbness in lips and surrounding area may be just from anxiety, he said. 3/1/21 - still have occasional slight numbness off and on of lips with &#34;grainy&#34; rash still present.

                                                I experienced symptoms commonly indicated as possible side effects: arm soreness, headache, low-grade fever, chills, and nausea. I also experienced an intensification of my chronic back pain. In addition I experienced about 20 hours of intense heart pounding with moderate labored breathing/shortness of breath. This is what I am identifying as the adverse event.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA on Sunday (6 days after receiving first dose) injection site was noticeably warmer than left arm and dull pain in the muscle.  By the following Wednesday (9 days after initial dose), noticeable red area around injection site and  experienced pain in the arm at  injection site and shoulder.  Pain continues and I experienced limited movement in the arm with restricted ability to raise arm over head.  Arm movement is better but continues to be painful in the shoulder and right side of neck.  Other than annoying, not too concerned nor do I feel it is necessary to contact my health care provider at this time.

During the next week I had occasional fever and chills , fatigue and muscle aches.   On January 14, my  upper left arm began itching and swelling.  This has continued including the entire upper arm becoming very hot to the touch.  It has subsided somewhat by January 17.  Should I get the second dose scheduled for Feb 4?

I don&#39;t know if I can handle any more pain than I experienced after the first shot. The following day there was no more pain, but I was very tired. I&#39;m ok now.

                                                On 1/15/21 I had pain in my right armpit upon raising my arm and a red swollen, itchy area about three inches wide at the injection site.  My primary care doctor prescribed Cephalexin 500 mg po tid which I began taking at 3 PM on 1/15/21. On 1/16/21 the redness and swelling continue to grow larger on my whole upper left arm. On 1/17/21 the redness and swelling was across a greater area and included the bottom of my arm.

The pain seemed to be in whole leg and seemed to be muscular and also a lot of pain in hip joint area.  Also was feeling a burning and numbness sensation down my leg.  By 7pm was in bed because it was too painful to walk.  Took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.  This morning the hip pain is better and I am walking ok. I still have burning and numbness mostly in the calf area of left leg. I am also feeling burning and numbness on the left area of my lip. This is an area of my lip where I have had cold sore in past but don&#39;t see a cold sore.

                                                approx 16 hours after I received the vaccine I awoke in excruciating pain. My back hurt so badly I was having trouble walking and both upper arms felt as though they were in a vice. I had been warned that side effects might be significant but this was like nothing I had ever experienced. I spent the next 15 hours in pain and at first I worried that somehow I had gotten the virus. At about 4:30 am the pain disappeared and it was like I had never even experienced it.  I am reporting this because of the extreme pain I had and the odd way it just disappeared with no after effects. I did not seek medical attention because I felt fine by the time doctors offices would have been open.

Typical side effects were noticed on Jan 29, that being chills, fever, dizziness, weakness in both legs, itchy arm at vaccine site.  Jan 30 side effects were dizziness, stumbly, chills and trouble walking with left leg.  Legs were still weak, left was worse. I had paralysis in my left foot. My left foot would not move back, only forward so when I walked my toes drug the ground.  I called Doctor.  He told me to see a neurologist and go to ER if symptoms progressed.  I have made the appointment for Feb 16, 2021. Foot is slowly improving. Left leg is still weak and there is some numbness in left leg and left foot.

                                                About 2 hours after vaccine my shoulder began to hurt.  Not at the site specifically, but the entire shoulder hurt like it had been pulled from the socket - I cannot raise my arm parallel with my body and could not put behind my back to undo my bra.  VERY painful.  It feels like someone hit me with a baseball bat on my shoulder.  I took tylenol last night and iced, but it didn&#39;t seem to help.  I just took 3 advil and the pulsating pain has subsided but I cannot raise my arm and the pain is still present.

                                                Within an hour of injection arm was very uncomfortable shoulder to wrist with throbbing pain which continued for 2 days.  Today is day 10 and arm continues to have approximately a 3&#34; area of redness around the injection site and are is still sore as if bruised.  I can touch that area without pain but any pressure is still uncomfortable.  Redness seems to be getting worse instead of better.  Need to know if I should not get the 2nd dose understanding that reactions are more intense on the 2nd dose.

                                                After first vaccination on Jan. 11th, 2021 I had muscle weakness in legs lasting only about an hour. I just didn?t feel right. After one hour I was fine.  Second vaccine was administered on Feb. 8th at noon. By 3:30 AM Feb 9th I could barely get out of bed because of severe joint pain and aching. I was nauseated, had a mild fever, mild headache and very tired. This lasted until  February the 10th at which time I felt better. By Feb. 11th I had return of deep aching pain in my hips and pelvic bones. ( I have arthritis and know what joint pain is). This was much worse. I felt ill from about one week after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna. I started feeling much better with the occasional return of mild symptoms.  I go to physical therapy for arthritis pain and had taken a week off. I returned to physical therapy on Thursday. February 18th. I was unable to complete my usual workout due to weakness in my legs and joint pain. I returned on Feb. 22nd and the same thing happened I felt weak, diaphoretic, nauseated,  after exercising a short time. This has never happened before.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

She saw picture, close up on screen, concerned one spot darker might be cellulitis, need to watch, take benedryl, call if changes, report to CDC

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

                                                I woke up 2/22/2021 about 5:00 a.m. which is close to my normal  time to get up.  A little muscle soreness, a little tired feeling but not enough to keep me from my morning routine of going to church at 7:00 a.m.   I got home around 8:00 am, muscles ache now, and tired feeling more pronounced.  I took two Advil around 8:30 a.m..  but by 10:00 a.m. I had a low grade fever of 100.2.  which subsided for a few hours, then returned late afternoon  around 4:00 pm at 100.4 degrees.  Tired and achy feeling continued the rest of 2/22/2021.  Morning of 2/23/2021, did not get up at regular time nor go to church...general &#34;washed out&#34; feeling, muscle aches improved.  Long nap in the afternoon and woke feeling better.  Today, 2/24/2021  I am back to normal. Went to church, grocery store and plan on doing my 3 mile walk later today if it warms up enough!

                                                With shot # 1.  Intense pain in the vaccinated arm, extending from hand to left, back shoulder blade starting a couple hours after the shot.  Unable to sleep. Day two, used ice pack to attempt to move the arm, which only wanted to stick next to the body and not move.  Attempts to use the arm were excruciating, so nothing worked on that level.  Continued icing throughout day 2.  End of day 2, took an Aleve and continued to ice the shoulder.  Day three, took an Aleve; no improvement in the morning, then saw some improvement throughout day three, but not to the point of being able to use the arm.  Total focus was on that arm.  Day 4, pain improved to being able to use the arm for small tasks.  Day 5, pain [but for injection sight] gone.  Shot #2.  Effects were entirely different but equally intense.

                                                Woke up at my usual time the day after vaccine. Felt a little warm but not feverish and did not take my temperature. After walking to kitchen to let cat in from garage I stopped at the nearby kitchen sink and began to shake ( I believe just my upper body). I had to grab onto sink to steady myself. Shaking was only seconds long.  Then I must have fainted as I awoke (quickly) on the floor  alongside the cupboards and sliding glass door.  I laid there conscious about 15 minutes till I felt confident I could get up on my own.  As result of fall I bit upper and lower lip on right (no blood just skin injured), must have clenched my teeth because my left posterior teeth were sensitive to cold and I injured my right ankle. After I got up and realized my ankle hurt with pressure I put on a support knee high to control swelling.  Injury seemed to be focused on the ankle bone. I applied ice for recommended 20 on 20 off protocol for most of both 2/25 and 2/26, elevated and took OTC Aleve as directed on package.  Bruising observed from heel, behind ankle bone and front of ankle.   Called PCP, she recommended continue as I have and she will contact me tomorrow, March 1

Pharmacist let me stay until I felt I could drive.  I came home and took Tylenol for headache.  5 hrs later I felt extremely ill with joint pain , fever , dizziness.  Vomiting occured during the night along with fainting.  Next morning drank tea, no food. Slept all day until 5pm.  Slept through night.  Sun. still had extreme joint pain and headache.  Was able to eat a light meal. Today I ate normally, went to physical therapy with a reduced routine.  I still have a headache as of Mon. night. I know these seem like Normal side effects, but these were like having the worst Flu ever.

Woke up several times while trying to sleep due to extreme sore arm. Also very tired. (7:30pm-7am). Arm still very sore, but able to exercise it (8am). Feeling very lethargic and cold while trying to complete a virtual class. ( 9am)  Getting the chills and shakes even while wearing several warm layers of clothing, arm still very sore (9:30 am)  Falling asleep while trying to participate in virtual class ( multiple times from 10:00am-12:30am). When session was over, I covered myself with 3 blankets and went to sleep after eating some lunch (1pm) Slept until 3:30, took temperature which was 101 degrees F, took a Tylenol, drank water, and fell back to sleep. Awoke about 6:30PM, checked temp which was lowered to 99.3F. at some dinner, drank plenty of water glasses.

                                                My body became so very weak that I could not roll over or walk on my own.  I experienced a lot of joint pain.  I was so worried that my MS was becoming active.   This conditioned lasted about 24 hours , but the weakness and fatigue lasted for several days. It has been 4 days since my  vaccine and am feeling myself again. This was my second vaccine.  The first vaccine, I experienced weakness and difficulty walking, but it was no where as bad as the second vaccine.

He assisted me in getting back into our home, gave me baby aspirin, asked me questions as to his middle name, of which I  just starred back at him. I can remember him asking me questions, and  I was wondering why my brain was not responding.   My gait  had already returned to normal as I could take the steps into our home with no problem.  My brain fog lasted approx 30-35 minutes. He did bring me to our local ER , where tests were negative but I did stay overnight.

                                                Had history of delayed reactions to allergy shots in past and staff administering vaccinations were concerned about whether that might possibly occur with the COVID vaccination. Many of the delay had been 48 to 72 hours.  I didn&#39;t feel like going to the Farmer&#39;s Market and by 2 pm started getting a migraine headache which had be concerned.   I had not had any fever but had had arm pain that I had used a heating pad for.  I ate Saturday.  I started noticing neck stiffness and some difficulty moving my head right and left.  I had migraine headaches from age 13 - 50 with an increase during pregnancy so I knew what they were and  what I had started to experience as the night went on into Sunday was more than I had ever  experienced in my life.  Flat on my back, ice, no intake, tylenol/codeine, nothing did anything and and the intensity kept coming.  I vomited some Sunday evening which usually helps release the pressure, but nothing helped.  I continued to have more difficulty turning my neck from side to side, visual difficulties and excruciating pain.  I had a virtual appointment with my endocrinologist and she was concerned about what was going on and gave me some guidelines lines about managing my blood sugars and suggesting that I be on the Farxiga if I went in the hospital.  I made it through another virtual meeting basically holding my head in my hands.  I canceled all my dental and doctor appointments because of the unrelenting pain and my concern for my driving. I began having some spastic jerking of the head and neck, which with the mask on forced my teeth into my front gums and lacerated the wholes front inside of my mouth. On 3/23 my husband died unexpectedly, I canceled Wednesday&#39;s Funeral Home visit because of my concern regarding driving and the extreme degree of pain.  I could barely move my neck past center.  I was also having mobility issues and my right side was working as well as it should.  Typing and writing were difficult.  My pain level was off the chart.  I had spoken with the doctor and once I did the required things at the funeral home, I took myself to the emergency room.  My pain was coming off the right lower part of my neck, affecting my vision, my appetite, my balance--basically neurologically going downhill on a fast slide since Saturday night. I told the nurse that my pain level was 20&#43;. The Spinal Tap in the ER was negative across the board and the fluid was clear.  IV&#39;s were hung to help with hydration.  Solumedrol and methacarbornol were given IV to deal with the inflammation around the vertebrae and the pain muscle spasms. Ice packs were applied to the front and pack of the neck to not only help with swelling, but with to relieve pain and help with neck alignment.  Blood sugars were a real struggle with all the prednisone on board but were helped some with the arrival of my Frixiga from home. It was the new Neurologist in the practice that looked at my posture, listened to my history and said, I am going to get some X-rays which took all day to do.  The X-rays showed that there had been swelling and shifting to make CI and C2 put pressure on the nerve. There was also a problem with L3.  A second neurologist added a morning dose of Topomax (50mg) which began to show some effect on Tuesday after being in the hospital for 5 days.  These 2 neurologist, along with the one in the ER could not rule out that what I experienced was a delayed reaction to the Moderna Vaccination, particularly as I have had delayed reactions to allergy shots in the past. It was suggested by the radiologist that a MRI be  one for a more definitive brain study as well as a spine study but the doctor on originally was doing much and didn&#39;t pick up on that. I have had to wean off of the prednisone at home which has meant wonderful monitoring of blood sugars. I have had to continue to wear the neck collar and slowly ween out of it.  I have been exhausted--the doctors think some of that may be from the muscle spasms and the fact that it took 4 days before there was a significant decrease in the intensity in the headache.  I still have to focus on posture and my right had gets very tired of the board.   Signatures are still not as  neat as they were but better than they were when I was admitted.

General practitioner consulted via telemedicine and diagnosed probable cellulitis.  Now taking Cefdinir antibiotic (day 3).  Redness is less but more diffuse. Pain and itching are somewhat less at site but arm is now aching, with ache moving up into right shoulder. I will continue on the Cefdinir for 10 days and check back with my doctor.

                                                At 10pm on 1/26/21 I experienced severe pain in my right wrist.  The pain kept me awake all night.  In the morning I could not touch my wrist, move it without extreme pain. The pain level was a 10/10.  I made an appointment with a doctor but was not able to be seen until February 24.  I took advil, wrapped it in an ace bandage with no relief.  Around 4:00 pm on 1/27/21, I realized that the pain was gone.  I tried moving my wrist and was able to.  After that I had complete motility and no pain.  Is this related to the vaccine?  I&#39;ve never experienced this before.

He has a degenerative muscle disease (Inclusion Body Myositis) so is already very weak, wheelchair bound. House is set up with all lift chairs or elevated (Bed, Toilet) so he can get out of them with very weak legs. By mid morning he was not able to use legs or arms at all to get up and had difficulty holding head up (usually no problem). By afternoon temperature went to 103.6. and he ached all over. After 2 - 3 hours with dose of 2 extra strength Tylenol temperature came down to 100.6 and then another hour later he became very sweaty all over body and temp returned to normal. Continued very weak for a few days. Gradually regained strength and back to normal strength for him over 6 days.

The flu like feeling was gone after about 10 hours of sleep and the third day I just have the muscle and joint pain.  Am working through it and trying tai chi.  Tylenol.

I am beginning to feel better (about 27 hours after vaccination).

Took Tylenol, headache went away and didn&#39;t return.  1/30/2021 (day after injection): 4 PM, injection arm which had been only slightly tender to touch became so sore I could hardly bear to touch it, shoulder and upper arm became very stiff and painful, moving arm even slightly upward or across body was so painful that I could not continue with this motion. This  got worse as day went on. Tylenol helped some but not much.  1/31/2021 (2 days after injection): Still experiencing above-noted pain and stiffness in arm. Also running low grade fever. Took Tylenol which helped. Fever did not return and arm was much easier to move by end of day. All reaction symptoms gone by 2/1/2021.

I felt like I was coming down with the flu, aching, cold, muscle pain, chills. I don&#39;t know if I had fever. I didn&#39;t check. After soaking in a hot tub I still felt cold. I took 2 Tylenol Arthritis and about 2 hours later my skin was hot - almost like I did have a fever. On the second day (today) I still have some pain in my arm pit. However, all of the other symptoms have not reappeared.

                                                I work at  medical center where patient is being treated for a new diagnosis of Acute monocytic leukemia.  I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

The patient&#39;s medical history included epilepsy.  Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included clonazepam.  On 03 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient was slurring her words and fell into a deep sleep.  It took three individuals to wake her up.  The patient wondered if she passed out.  She felt tingly in her upper right arm and it felt like her equilibrium was off, and legs were heavy.  The patient was very fatigued.    Treatments of these events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, passing out, unsteadiness, slurring words, fell into a deep sleep, tingly feeling in her upper right arm, felt like equilibrium was off, legs felt heavy and fatigue, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71 year old female subject, with history of epilepsy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown).

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

On 2/1, scalp started hurting on the back of the head, felt like hair being pulled tight in a ponytail (still currently, but not as tight), feeling of tightness. Started noticing hair falling out more (a lot more than usual), started steroid shampoo on 2/9. Nothing has changed since patient has been on it. Chiropractor on 2/16, the neck muscles are inflamed, really tender per chiropractor. Symptoms are slightly better on top of skull but otherwise symptoms are the same.

Also had a loss of appetite for a few days.  I was mostly off my feet for 2 to 3 full days.  Then I was extremely sweaty for the morning of the final day, like when a fever finally breaks after flu.   The site of the injection (left deltoid) got a softball sized red  hard itchy and somewhat tender spot.

                                                Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2&#43; to 3 and slightly brisk, 1&#43; at both ankles and 1&#43; and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.  We will continue to follow.  While admitted to this facility, she was treated with IV dexamethasone 2/14-2/21  She was admitted to an inpatient hospital 2/14-2/23 and discharged to an inpatient rehab unit at a different health system.

                                                I have basal arthritis in my thumb on my right hand and slight arthritis in the base of my right index finger.  About 24 hours after my vaccine the flare up began in both locations.  I used my normal treatments of Peppermint and Frankincense essential oils throughout the rest of the afternoon and evening, but it did not work.  The pain only kept increasing and both areas became very inflamed.  By 10:00 p.m. I was unable to use my thumb to support a glass of water and soreness began to develop in the base of the finger next to the index finger.  I finally took an Aleve which began to relieve the severe pain within about an hour.  The severe flare up was better in the morning, but it has been a week and the discomfort is still there.  I bought Voltaren and hope this will get my joints back to normal, which is mild flare ups when the weather changes.

On 2/28, noticed the first skin lesion on my left arm..it looked like shingles..muscular pain increased and now have 8 similar looking lesions...went to doctor and he said that since I had no pain  to the touch of my skin, it likely was not shingles but a delayed reaction to the vaccination.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   When I went to bed the night of the vaccine, I noticed some soreness in my back muscles and left arm.  I took 2 500 mg tylenol at bedtime.  I woke up about 1:30 a.m.  Soreness in my back was so bad, it hurt to touch it or lay on it.  I also had chills to the point of shaking and added 2 extra blankets and took another 500 mg tylenol.  On Thursday, the day following the vaccine, I continued to have chills, had no appetite and had a headache. The soreness in my back lessened throughout the day and by 7:30 pm had almost disappeared.  I woke up at 1 and 2 am on March5 dripping wet(I assume from fever breaking).When I got up at 5am on the 5th, all adverse symptons were gone and I ate normally.

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

                                                I felt fine at first and it lasted until I stared coughing Saturday (1/16), I thought it was just post-nasal drip. By Monday (1/18), I had a really bad sore throat, chills and a fever. I had a fever for 26 solid days. My lung capacity was 98-99% the entire time. On Wednesday (1/20), I contacted my doctor and he had me to come in to get tested for COVID. The next day, I got my results and they were positive. It got worse from there and I was admitted to the hospital due to my sodium being low. I was also losing a lot of weight. I was hospitalized for 3 days in order for them to get my sodium up. I also had burning and tingling on the sole of my feet, which they attributed to my lack of sodium. My symptoms lasted for weeks. I have a lot of congestion, but they can&#39;t seem to locate the source. I&#39;m also having issues with my BP, which just started to decrease on 3/21. I was also diagnosed as anemic, which I&#39;ve never had an issue with. I also have a hard time concentrating. I also have spine issues, so I&#39;m not sure if my knee pain is from that or the COVID.

I continue to have pain in my arm, shoulder and back and some itching .  the rash area is discolored brownish and very dry.

I developed chills and had muscle aches like the flu.  No fever.  The next day, my arm started getting sore below the injection site and itched.  That night, my whole arm was swollen, red,  sore, hot to touch and itched.  The redness extended around my upper arm and down to the elbow.  It had been 8 days since the vaccination and I still have the red itchy arm.

By next morning: sore wrists, hands, and shoulders. By afternoon: same soreness, but from elbow to elbow, across shoulders, felt like a bad sunburn of skin. Ankles and knee swollen. 2nd night: intermittant, surprising shooting pain in shin bones, general myalgia, plus upset stomach. 3rd day: more of same, relieved somewhat by Tylenol, but not at all by 1 Aleve (my ususal anti-inflamatory pain med of choice). Thursday, day 4: lessening of inflamed joints, but still soreness across shoulders, neck and back. Day 5: improved.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 21 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 043L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient experienced injection site reaction.  On 22 Jan 2021, she was feeling achy.   On 23 Jan 2021, she had nerve pain that felt like cutting on the back, legs, and arms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s muscles were weak and were not working or responsive on both sides.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient could not control her left hand and weakness was more predominant on left side. The patient went to the doctor and was hospitalized with minor stroke for 24 hours. The patient stated that she was still experiencing terrible pain in neck and lower back.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, minor stroke, weak muscles, nerve pain, injection site reaction, and achy, was unknown. The outcome of event, terrible pain in neck and lower back, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and evidence of a temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and the onset of injection site reaction and achy, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There is limited information to asses causality for the events of injection site reaction, and achy.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                Received #1 dose as stated.  Next day, 1/27/21, 9:00am , had mild joint pain to both legs, &amp; arms, &amp; slightly tired.  Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

Strong headache  ,  shoulder / neck pain ,  and strong fatigue .    All symptoms noted here continued for approximately 6 to 7 days. The 3 rd day of symptoms   I went to my Family Doctor who advised me to NOT take Dose # 2 of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine due to possibility of having a worse reaction , possible anaphylaxis  reaction .  I notified Health Dept. that same day  and cancelled my scheduled 2 nd dose vaccine  appointment.

I was also so fatigued that I could do nothing all day except lay on the couch or in bed. I felt better that night around 8 PM. The injection site was also swollen, red and painful for about 5-6 days.  Today, it was itchy.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.  Started 12 hours after receiving 2nd vaccine with fever, chills, aching back and severe headache.  Fever started at 100.2, went up to 101.2, and down to 99.9 by noon today.  Other symptoms persist as of 1:45 pm PT.  I am not able to take over the counter pain relievers because I had acute hepatitis in late October.  No cause was determined and I tested negative to all the various versions.  All my liver function tests returned to normal within 2 weeks or so.

My arm has remained very sore. After the first injection it was sore for a few days and went away. This soreness has not gone away.  It feels like a very sore muscle and is painful with certain range of motion. It has of today been over 6 weeks since the 2nd injection.

On 2/24 I noticed a lump in my arm pit along with increased tenderness.  The lump was large enough that I could feel it with my arm down. On 2/24 I made an appointment with my health care provider.  I was given an antibiotic ( Clindamycin 300 mg) to take for 10 days for pain and swelling . On 3/3  I notice the symptoms had not improved and tenderness had progressed down my arm to the elbow area and also into the back of my shoulder from the arm pit area.

                                                Blood clot on right lung; soreness in arm; A spontaneous report was received from  a 72 year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced blood clot on right lung  (pulmonary embolism) and myalgia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25-JAN-2021, 26 hours prior to the onset of events, the patient received her second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot#: unknown) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 26-JAN-2021, the patient reported they have developed chills, fever, and muscle pain in the chest area. The reporter specified that it wasn&#39;t chest pain.  The patient took acetaminophen for the pain. On 27-JAN-2021, the patient reported her fever subsided but she was still having a little cough and chest pain.  On 28-JAN-2021, the patient had chest pain again during a nap and decided to call 911 because she was about to pass out. The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) where an EKG (electrocardiogram) was performed. A few moments after the EKG, the patient had a heart attack. The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin. At the time of this report, the patient was still feeling fatigued but other than that, she was feeling better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, heart attack, cough, muscle pain in chest area, fever, chills, and chest pain, were resolved. The outcome of the event, fatigue, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                About 3:30 in the morning I woke up and I was really cold. I started having chills. when I checked my temperature it was in the 99s (the highest my temperature 101.9. When I checked my heart rate in the morning and it was in the 90s, and that&#39;s higher than normal for first thing in the morning. My heart rate went high and I had achy muscles. I sat around all day, but I didn&#39;t feel that bad in the morning, I took an extra strength Tylenol and I didn&#39;t have much have an appetite. My heart rate stayed in the 90s-130, so I called my cardiologist and he recommended I alternate Tylenol and ibuprofen and drink lots of fluids. By dinner that night I had no appetite, and then I had nausea and dry heaves, so I took 25 mg of promethazine at about 8 and the dry heaves got better within an hour. I got the COVID tongue. I had a white coating on my tongue and I couldn&#39;t get it off and a weird metallic taste in my mouth, I had a mild headache. The next day I felt much better. I called my PCP and they didn&#39;t think it was necessary for me to come in for a cardiogram because I was feeling better.

While there (about 4:15 p.m.) I started a bad headache, neck hurt and feeling &#34;strange&#34;.  While waiting in the check out line I felt hot and weak.  After a few min. when I got home  ( about 5:15 p.m.)  my face felt tight and I became itchy on all parts of my body except not as much on my legs.  The next day  the headache was not as bad but still itchy especially on my face, head and back.  My arm was not any more sore than with a flu shot.  The next day the headache was gone, the arm was not sore, but I was still itchy.  The itching would come and go for about a week.

These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

It was Friday morning at 8:00 AM.  Previously had rotator cuff surgery 16 years ago in that arm, something has happened to the right shoulder.  Not able to raise the arm at all.  Cannot raise it up towards her face.  Left arm is crippled due to a fall 5 years ago and broke it in 3 places, but not able to move that.  Not having any  other problems, not sure if this was associated with the vaccine or not since it was the opposite arm.

Called ER and they told me to take some aspirin (2). I tried to walk around the house and eat but decided to go back to bed and slept it off. ER also told me to drink electrolytes, I could not even open the bottle, I had to call my daughter to come and open it for me. I broke up in a  sweat last night around midnight, this morning I took my temp it was 98F and I still feel weak. I also woke up with a headache and my nose is stuffed up, I have some mucus. Feels like a head cold.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine; Nine days after receiving the vaccine, I noticed slight soreness in the injection site muscle. When I got out of the shower the next morning, my arm had a red circle at the injection site.   I had no other symptoms.  The redness faded during the day.  A  friend of mine is a nurse who said I should report this, even though the symptoms were very mild.  Later, I remembered scratching my arm before the redness occurred.  My skin is dry during winter, so I hadn&#39;t made any connection to the vaccine site.

Shoulder injured in a jogging injury/ fall twenty years ago (subachromial impingement), but have had no problem with since, became &#34;frozen&#34; and extraordinarily painful (on pain scale its a 9). It is post-vaccine day 10 now and it appears to be showing no signs of abating. Only  relief is 400mg ibuprofen on a prn basis. Cannot lift left arm or extend left arm (abduction). Believe the  vaccine may have caused a vigorous immune response (great!), however it may be an &#34;cytokine storm&#34; which has caused an acute arthritis event. Concerned about immunization #2.

She had stiffness of her neck, and then within the next day she ended up having the gland on her right side of her neck swell all the way up to her ear.  Then she developed little bumps which make her itch.  Then it went from her right chin, all the way to the right side of her neck.  Nothing on the left.   She was having so much pain and she had what she described as the mumps that she found on the internet, and all the symptoms associated with that description.    She still has itching, and bumps again from her shoulder to the right side of her neck.   She went to the pharmacist and tried to explain it to him, he told her to take some Benadryl.  Called the nurse who told her to take Ibuprofen and aspirin.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they would get back to her within 48 hours.

                                                It stared out with just stiffness in my legs and back. Then at night I couldn&#39;t put my legs down they hurt and my shins felt like I had shin splines.  This lasted about a week or more. I went to a Dr. because my left knee and shin were hurting so bad.  The Dr. was not sure and did a Doppler to see If I had a Blood clot in my left knee but I didn&#39;t. She put me on an antibiotic, that I really didn&#39;t need I don&#39;t think. I took that for  a few days and stopped because it wasn&#39;t helping any. On the 14th I went to see another Dr. and he put me on Prednisone, at this time I could barley walk my right hip was hurting so much. I was taking little bitty steps.  The prednisone has been helping, it&#39;s allowed me to walk and to function. I was to the point it was getting so bad. I&#39;m still having some stiffness, my left elbow gets inflamed at times, my left hand and knuckle swell and get stiff at times too. It seems to move around at effect different places.  The medication helps me move better, I have been off work for 7 weeks, I plan to go back and try half days.

Over the next three days the redness moved down my arm, covering an area of 6 inches and nearly all the way around my arm.  The arm was stiff and painful and hot to the touch.  On Monday,  1/25/21, I contacted my primary care doctor.

More sore every day up to the shoulder bone, down to the elbow in the muscle.  The bone at the top of her shoulder hurts as well.  Thought it was going to go away and after 3 weeks is still having these symptoms.  Takes an aspirin once a day, and Ibuprofen on occasion for the pain, but nothing more.  The pain is not so bad that she can&#39;t stand it, but it&#39;s uncomfortable and feels like it is in the bone itself.

                                                Adverse reaction began around midnight with chills, continued throughout the night alternating chills and hot flashes, severe backache, muscle aches in thighs and general malaise.  Got up around 8 to try to take a warm shower to ease muscle aches but as soon as I got into the bathroom I felt very hot, very nauseated and lightheaded.  I suspected hypotension but of course I wasn&#39;t able to prove it at the time. I attempted to get back to my bed but had syncopal episode a few feet from the bed where I collapsed onto the floor.  I just stayed on the floor and rested because it actually felt better lying down. I am a retired RN and suspect this adverse event was related to orthostatic hypotension.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

At 1;00PM  I woke up and stood up out of bed and collapses onto the floor.  I was unable to get up.  I found my phone which had fallen onto the floor.  I was shaking so bad I kept dropping it.  I looked and my phone and was  unable to figure out how to make a call.  The screen did not make sense.  Eventually I was able to call my daughter who decided to call 911.  The paramedics came, picked me up  off of the floor and helped me walk to the living room.  My legs kept giving out like I was going to fall again.  They were asking questions but I was unable  to answer coherently. I was so confused.  My brain was not working.  They took me to the hospital where I was admitted and many tests were done.
