                                                Got vaccine at 11am,  was ok all day.  About 11pm I felt nauseated.  Got up a 2am to go to bathroom and had teeth-chattering chills.  30 minutes later vomited several times.  Fever was 99.6  last night, 99.8 this morning, and 100.2 this afternoon.  Significant pain in joints, moderate in muscles.  Feel by far worse than when I had covid.  Though these side affects typically resolved in 24 hours? Mine are no better, other than I&#39;m only nauseated, not throwing up.

Began to feel dizzy, weak, was sweating, and had a flushed appearance in face.  On attempt to stand, felt like I could not take a step.  In ER vitals were normal except for blood pressure was high.  Was discharged after receiving IV fluids, lab tests, EKG.  About 5 hours later, I developed a low grade fever of 99.7, blood pressure 142/92, chills,  general malaise and body aches.  Symptoms started dissipating later in the evening.  Started feeling better as the day progressed the next day.

                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                1-8-2021:  9:25 body shaking, nostrils constricting, throat tightening and legs weak.  Happen while I was heading home.  Returned to HD.  EMT administered 50ml benedryl and pushed 125ml saline.  No response.  Throat felt tight, not closed but tight.  Offered EpiPen .3 agreed.  Body reaction - shaking.  Went to Hospital ER via ambulance (~11am).  ER administered 50mg steroid and had 2 puffs of albuterol inhaler twice.  Became very tired but felt heart raced - assumed reaction to steroid/albuterol.  2:30pm started to finally feel relief.  Discharged 4pm with rx for prednisone 50mg 1/day-10 days and benedryl 25mg for that night and am/pm next day.  O2 dropped to 94 that evening.  Administered 3 rounds of 2 liters/minute before saturation held at 97. 1-9-2021:  9am took benedryl and prednisone doses.  10am both nostrils still feel &#34;swollen,&#34; legs are weak and very tired (benedryl?).  Oxygen saturation is good - 97.  Starting to feel slight sensitivity at injection site.  4pm able to shower and move around.  Breathing is better.  Elected not to take benedryl as I&#39;m not getting an positive response from it, only fatigue.  Nostrils still feel swollen - tried lubricated nasal spray, not much help. 1-10-2021:  8:30 prednisone dose  Oxygen saturation good - 98% pulse 72.  Nostrils still feel swollen.  Injected site sore,  Started around 4pm (similar to shingles vaccine - expected).

I have had steroid injections in other shoulder and this is the sensation I felt during injection. The rn also told me &#34; You have tough skin&#34; after the intense pressure started. I worked the night before injection. I went home to sleep. woke around 2pm with intense pain in my left arm, I could not shift position or move my arm. with out excruciating pain. I used heat, aleve,  tylenol &amp; biofreeze. By saturday,  i could easily move left arm from elbow down, but extremely limited from shoulder. today i have most of my range of motion, but still have dull ache and pain restrictions. This pain is in my shoulder, not my arm or deltoid. . On thursday, pain was constant, roaring throb 7/10  shoulder to shoulder blade, almost to spine in back and down to elbow , then 9/10 with any movement.   Today is ache 2/10 just in my shoulder, with 5/10 with some movement. I had to call into work 1/7. I am scheduled tonight. I am an ICU RN.

                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

Once I did get up I noted a severe red rash covering chest and extending up anterior neck (looked like a radiation burn). Symptoms lasted all day and made work or ADLs impossible. Felt about 75% better next day then symptoms returned the following day. Rash began peeling and appeared to look like a 2nd degree burn. Symptoms resolved by Day 4.

She was assisted by EMS (who was on site).  Her blood pressure was 249/149 per the patient.  She also experienced some lightheadedness.  It was strongly suggested by EMS &amp; nursing staff that she be transported to the ER but she refused stating she had to work the next day.  She continued to be monitored by EMS until her blood pressure stabilized &amp; she felt better.  She continued to refuse ER.  She was driven home by her companion.   On 1/28/2021 she sent an email to the health department showing a picture of her left arm showing redness from the injection site down to above the bend in her left arm.  She reported that on 1/26/2021 her physician  recommended that she not receive the second dose of Moderna.  She continues to complain of high blood pressure.  It is unkown if she takes medication for high blood pressure.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

Fever for 4 day and  fatigue and achy/joint pain lasted for at least a couple weeks.  On February 11/12, 2021 started with double vision, progressively getting worse and constant starting on 2/17.  Sought medical treatment on 2/18 with emergent MRI ordered and completed on 2/18.  MRI results showed swelling/inflammation in the brain, specifically on the left side.  Treatment thus far has been antiviral medication, seeing specialists - Ophthalmologist and Neurologist on 2/24 and 2/25 respectively. Further treatment is ongoing but will include ongoing lab work, IVIG infusions starting 3/1 for 3 consecutive days, repeat MRI, potential LP and Quarantine for a minimum of 30 days following the first IVIG treatment.  Neurologist diagnosis is ADEM at this time.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful.

I had to go the the ER on 12/31/20 because of this. they gave me a shot of Prednisoneand Hydroxyzihe that helped for a coupled of days and then I had to go back to the ER on 1/6/21 because of the same symptoms. They gave me Benadryl,prednisone and pepcid. I am still itching.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

Husband came in and grabbed her, to get her back into bed. she could not stand. Went to ER at  Hospital. Had CT scan, blood work , EKG, chest xray. Was still kind of out of it but was able to communicate with nurses. Face is still black and blue. Last night got up at 4:00 a.m. something was wrong with her throat. Felt like a walnut was in her throat. Went to doctor this morning. They said it was a reaction from the shot. Got an EpiPen, prednisone. Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes. Has not felt well at all.

                                                I received the vaccine in my right arm about 10 AM on 1/11/2021 I felt a sharp muscular pain in my back near  the base of my right shoulder. It was difficult to take deep breath?s. It felt like I had pulled a muscle there. Moving positions from sitting to standing or raising my right arm to scratch or reach for something caused the muscle pain to occur. After taking ibuprofen, water and rest the pain subsided a lot, but still continues. There was no increase in my temperature.

On 1/12/2021 (today), I could hardly raise my left arm over my head.  I took 2 Ibuprofen and plan to ensure I do range of motion stretches and basically just use the left arm.  I do not have a fever, and plan to drink plenty of water today.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  At about 9pm on 1/11/21 (i.e. approximately 5 hours after I received the vaccine), my left shoulder started to hurt.  When I woke up the next morning it was even more sore.  It wasn&#39;t bad when my arm was at my side, but it increasingly hurt as I rotated my arm upwards.   I would describe it as about twice as sore as I&#39;ve experienced in the past after a flu vaccine.   This continued that entire day (1/12/21).  By the next morning (1/13/21), the pain was starting to subside and by 9pm that night, it was gone.  As the pain level was relatively minor (approx. 3/10), I didn&#39;t treat it with anything.

FYI: I was experience stress and lethargy prior to getting vaccine. I got a Covid-19 test on 1/14/20 suspecting possible Covid-19. The test was Negative. After receiving the vaccination, the symptoms I was experiencing previously worsened.

Had a fever of 101 degrees.  As the hours passed, the joint pain spread to both hips  and ankles. Alternated Motrin and Tylenol with fever reduced to 100 degrees. All muscle aches, joint pain and chills continued for the next 2 days. Finally by day 3 the fever was down to 99.  Experienced fatigue, followed by severe vertigo by day 3.  Although muscle aches and joint pain slowly decreased over time, the vertigo has persisted and at times is accompanied by nausea and vomiting.

Everything was fine within 2 days. Like nothing happened. On Day 9 experianced a flash of light out of left eye and a floating blob that came and went throughout the day. Saw Dr and he said this is typical of the aging process.  Dont know if it was related just weird it happened now. Arm was sore for 2 Days but nothing major. Other than that i felt fine.

Very tired and did not feel well.  Low grade fever was sporadic.   Could not go to work. Called Dr. about symptoms and prescribe antiobiotic of Ceftin for the sore throat..  Sore throat went away after 24 to 48 hours of being on medicine. By day 10 all the skin reactions had calmed down and by day 12 was feeling good.  Dr. wanted me to report to you guys.  He was unsure if I should take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  He seemed confident throughout that this was an immune response to the vaccine.

                                                On  January 16, the day after being vaccinated (1/15/21),  I woke up with my arms, hands, legs and feet tingling and numb all over and it lasted on and off all day January 16 and on and off all day January 17 and has persisted every day until Monday, January 26 when the symptoms became worse. Instead of tingling in all extremities (with some numbness)  the sensations changed to a pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shock sensations. I want to note that, yes, I have radiculopathies  - however, I have never had them change so suddenly and increase in intensity so fast. Also, the pins and needles sensation with burning and random electrical shocks are brand new symptoms for me (my radiculopathies have not presented this way before).  I reported these symptoms to my primary care provider today (1/29/21) and she instructed me to report my symptoms to VAERS and she is referring me to neurology. Note: I received my vaccination outside of my health care system and received it through the county because I could get the vaccination sooner that way.  I did not report these symptoms sooner because they were not listed as a possible adverse effect of getting the COVID19 Moderna  vaccination. However, as these symptoms have worsened over the past 2 weeks I have become concerned.  I have not added any OTC medications or supplements to the ones listed prior. I have gone to a chiropractor twice during this time for relief of my back pain with  no positive outcomes. Waiting to see the neurologist.

On January 15 developed an itchy, red, hot rash about 1/2 inch below injection site.  The area was approximately 3 in by2.5 in with swelling.  Also had 5 hives break out on my body.  I took 1/2 a Benedryl and used clobetasol propionate ointment on the area until the rash went away (7 days).  The swelling took another 5 days to subside.

                                                I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my PMD office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

ED doctor told patient the only thing they could contribute this to was her covid vaccine she got the day before. She was admitted to the facility for further observation for the next 24 hours.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

                                                Day 1 after the vaccination: very strong pain in the arm to the extent that I was unable to reach anything above a shoulder level (so much worse than the 1st shot), surprisingly little swelling though (so much better than the 1st shot). Increasing fatigue which maxed around 11am accompanied by  cold shivers and increased body temp . Fever picked at 5pm to 101.3F.  By 10pm fever and fatigue were gone! Day 2 after the vaccination: a red rash size 2 inch x 3 inch on the arm around the place of the injection, pain in the arm was nearly gone, no fever, no fatigue. Day 3 after the vaccination: red rash is gone. Back to normal.

Then on Thursday, every joint in her body hurt and this continued until Saturday.  On Saturday she had a big red whelt on the arm that progressively got larger.  She still has some aches in her joints, but not as severe.  The rash is deep red today, swollen with hard ridges, very itchy and very hot to touch.  She has not taken anything for it.  She has been having a harder time than usual breathing, but not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.  She has less than 20% of her lungs.

On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

                                                Started with body aches and lethargy at about 1800, then progressed to temperature sensitivity-felt cold. I went to bed but awoke hot, then alternated with cold frequently. I began having twitching in my hands which kept me awake.  These symptoms continued until morning. Toward the AM, about 0500, I had fluttering sensations in my body.

They continued like this but with fluctuating severity.  My calves and shin muscles began to be sore.  I sought out acupuncture and myofascia release work to help.  It did help temporarily.  I started to have left ankle pain, not like a sprain, like tendonitis or inflammation.  It continued to hurt to walk and the muscles more painful.  I started having darker urine about 4 days after the vaccine.  I drank cranberry juice and took a kidney/bladder supplement, increased fluids, but it continued dark.

Then progressed to whole body itching. Unable to sleep for two nights. Went to urgent care next morning. Was prescribed hydroxyzine 25mg. Itching went away that night and was able to sleep. Next day bilateral hands had numbness and tingling and general dizziness so stopped taking hydroxyzine. Went to family practitioner and was prescribed methylprednisolone dose pack. After starting steroids, by 2nd day (today - 1-21-21), hands continued n/t. Bilateral feet developed n/t. Dizziness continues when standing but goes away when sitting. Balance and gait are unsteady. Difficulty walking from weakness, balance issues, and dizziness.

I went to work and let my supervisor know that my arm was really sore. I went out to do my patrol and noticed a headache. I thought I needed to eat some I tried to eat some cereal. I became nauseous. I went back to the office to do some paperwork and when I tried to walk it was painful I told my coworker who suggested I need something warm on my stomach. I tired that but was to nauseous. I ended up leaving work and coming home and laid. I have cannot lay flat as it is uncomfortable and have myself propped up in bed. I have been unable to sleep since then. I previously had COVID in November 2020

The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 22 Dec 2020, about 4pm, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #011J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Dec 2020, around 7pm, the patient experienced severe leg cramps.    On 23 Dec 2020, she experienced severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shaking chills and bloody diarrhea. Treatment for nausea was ondansetron.    On 24 Dec 2020, the patient experienced terrible hemorrhoid pain and abdominal pain. On 25 Dec 2020, the patient went to the emergency room where she received a computed tomography scan. The computed tomography scan of  the lower abdomen showed that earlier diagnosis of diverticulitis 27 Nov 2020 &#34;inflammation&#34; had gotten better.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.  The outcome for events, severe leg cramps, severe diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, shaking chills, bloody diarrhea and hemorrhoid pain, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62-year-old female patient with medical history of diverticulitis, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 011J20A), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of bloody diarrhea, the non-serious listed events of nausea and chills, and the non-serious unlisted events of severe leg cramps, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hemorrhoid pain.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s history of diverticulitis is noted.

It began on February 13, 2021, which was 2 days after injection.  Redness subsided some, but on day 8 after injection, area became more red, hard, feverish and sore.  Also, I have  soreness under arm near lymph nodes.  I visited my Primary Care Physician today and was prescribed a steroid pack.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

I&#39;m pretty stubborn, and have continued to work despite sxs.  I missed last Friday 2/19 because the pain was so severe.

Treatment information was not reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, the mRNA-1723 does not contain virus capable of causing infection and with the occurrence of SAR-COV-2 test positive after vaccination, is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

Same symptoms continued for about 48 hrs then felt better but still with some arthralgias and fatigue.  I had covid-19 virus in MArch 2020.  Felt pretty much the same way post vaccine as I felt then. Wondering if this reaction could be due to fact that I had virus previously and also wondering about second dose? Have there been reports of worse S/E in people who have had virus previously?

Observation of swelling then 2 Benadryl were given.  BP monitored. After about 15 minutes or longer swallowing slowed down  some.   BP did start coming down.  A friend came to get me and I took 2 more Benadryl  about 4 hours later due to swallowing issues again.  After about 6 hours after that took more Benadryl and the the next 2 days just as needed about every 8 to 10 hours   Started  chills with highest temperature was  99.4.  K Legs felt heavy the morning after the vaccine and  I felt very tired with some short bursts of Nausea

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

Stated allergic reaction and looked like cellulitis too.  Today arm is less swollen, but still red and itchy. Going back to clinic to see Dr Friday 01/08/21 at 10:30 am

I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Approx. 12:30am I awoke to a leg cramp. I arose from bed and stood up till the cramping muscle relaxed.  Then I walked to the restroom and during the short distance,I felt a sudden &#34;flush&#34;.  Upon entering restroom, I felt I was getting faint.  Feeling that I was about ready to faint, I tried to easily lower myself to the floor without striking my head or body.  Feeling very dizzy and faint, my stomach instantly felt nauseous and then vomited.  After vomiting, I  suddenly started to &#34;shake very violently&#34; (chills?).  The shaking was uncontrollable and went on for approx. 10 -15 min.  I tried to relieve the violent shaking by covering up with bath towels, that I was able to reach from the floor, where I was still sitting; but that did not seem to help.  After I did not feel so faint, I called for help to have my husband help me back into bed to try to warm up.  By that time the shaking (chills) were no longer so severe, and I was gradually able to fall back to sleep with no further problems the remainder of the night.  The following morning, and ever since that night, I have had no other adverse reactions.   For many years, I have received the yearly flu vaccine and have never had any kind of reaction, accept some minor soreness at the injection site (muscle).

Felt exhausted and nauseous.  Slept for a few hours and got up and just sat on the couch for another few hours and then felt that same nausea and exhaustion and went to bed. Took 2 more Tylenol. Started drinking more water.  On 2/21/21 felt pretty good -- stayed in all day -- ate a little -- but saw the site on my arm just under the injection site was very large, red, and hot to the touch.  The red welt area went from just below the injection in the left arm to just above the elbow.   On 2/22/21 (today) feel pretty good.  Drinking a lot of water and tool 1 Tylenol.

Hip to below knew, dull and numbish; from below knee thru toes, same tingling as fingers. Biggest concern was side of face and jaw; dull and numbish. All these reactions occurred on right side of body. Thursday late afternoon, the tingling and the dull and numbish diminishes but the arm aching along with inability to completely raise remains. Friday; arm remains the same Saturday; arm below injection site now feels only bruised NOTE: while I enjoy a strong immune system, by body is very sensitive to new medicines/tweaking medicines. Also applies to food.  APPROX 25 years ago, I believe I contracted Gullian Barre, where the immune system attacks nervous system. There was./is no test to confirm although I continue to endure some side effects. QUESTION- with all said is it advisable to receive the 2nd vaccine shot?   Please advise ASAP

                                                I had soreness in the left arm for @ 2 days after the vaccination.  No redness, no swelling.   After that, no known problem.  Exactly one week after the injection, On the morning of Tuesday, January 5, 2021, I noticed soreness in my left arm similar to what I had right after the injection. It was painful to extend my arm over my head.  Later that day, I noticed a small 1 3/4&#34; x 1&#34; area of redness and warmth appearing at or right next to the area of the injection.  Over the next 24-48 hours, the area grew and became swollen, more red, and warmer.  The soreness in my arm didn&#39;t seem to change at all; it was painful to lift my arm overhead and to touch.  The area grew to approximately 3&#34; x 4&#34; during that time period.  On Thursday morning, 1/7/21, my PCP, inspected the area and felt the swelling and the warmth.  She believed that I had likely developed cellulitis in the arm and placed me on cephalexin 500 mg, one capsule tid.  I began taking that on Thursday afternoon, 1/7/21.   By Friday evening, the area was barely visible, but was still warm and a little swollen.  It was still slightly tender. Today, Saturday, 1/9/21, the area is still a little warm and slightly swollen, but not visible at all, and there is only tenderness if I press on the area.

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

Was in so much pain that I took Oxycodone at 12:00 am, another at 3:00 am. TYLENOL with codeine at 5:00 am and another at 7 :00 am. Was not expecting so much pain. If I did not have the RXs, I would have to go to the emergency room. I still have pain and it goes down by arm. I have been told that the injection was given to high.

                                                Part of the vaccine ran out at time of injection.  The night of the injection my arm started itching.  I was awakened at 4;00 a.m. the next morning with a very stiff, sore, cramping arm.  I had the normal reactions: slight headache, low temp, itchy, swollen, hot red arm, but very stiff and sore. This lasted 3-4 days with the most noticeable reaction being the sore arm from shoulder to elbow.  On Feb 10, one week later, my arm started itching again in the afternoon and by evening was swollen, red, hot, and hurting  just like the first 3-4 days or slightly worse.  It gradually got better after 4-5 days, returning to normal by 2/20.  The only other symptom the second time were blisters on my left hand above my pointer finger and ring finger.  I&#39;m not sure if they were related or not since I walk outside or if I may have been exposed to poison ivy since the blisters looked similar.

It is my sense that I was improperly inoculated outside the deltoid muscle, hitting the axillary nerve. The symptoms came on almost immediately, though (since it&#39;s a while ago) I cannot be reliably sure of the time. The pharmacist injecting me was very scattered, in my opinion, and perhaps tired from a long day of immunization. My sense is that she failed to properly landmark my arm. I am a short-stature woman with good muscle tone, if that helps. I am seeking medical evaluation on 4/9 and, likely, will start physical therapy to regain range of motion, which is disabling.

When I woke to get a shower around 5:30 am on 1/6/2021, I was extremely lightheaded and laid down on the bathroom floor to keep from passing out and falling. The lightheadedness did not improve and my husband was able to help me back to bed. I was unable to overcome the chills and lightheadedness even with lying down, until about 10 am. I am able to sit up but still some what lightheaded and chills are beginning to fade. I do not feel I would be able to walk more than a few feet or drive at this time due to ongoing symptoms.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 02 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011L20A) intramurally in the left deltoid bursa for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 02 Jan 2021, the patient reported she had been given the vaccine in the wrong location. The vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle. The patient was also experiencing loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and she also can&#39;t sleep. Treatment information was not provided. Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. The event vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle was considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events loss of range of motion, can&#39;t sleep, and pain at the injection site were considered not recovered/not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of 65 year old female patient who experienced non-serious unexpected events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle for mRNA-1273, lot #  011L20A. The patient experienced loss of range of motion, pain at the injection site, and can&#39;t sleep. Onset latency was not provided.  De-challenge and re-challenge are not applicable. Based on the information provided the events of vaccine was given in the left deltoid bursa instead of the deltoid muscle, loss of range of motion and can&#39;t sleep are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 as this is due to product administration error. The event of pain at the injection site is included in the known safety profile of the vaccine, hence a causal association cannot be excluded.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

                                                Initially kind of soreness in right arm, (left handed). Sunday, head started hurting, started having body aches, stomach ache.  Then it moved to both arms, and entire body, nauseous.  By Monday, really getting worse and at night extremely uncomfortable and not wanting to get up in the morning.  Tuesday, off work and still having symptoms throughout the day.  Went to the chiropractor and stated she was tight.  Also got PT and said the same thing, she was very tight in her muscles.  Today, Wednesday she&#39;s feeling better.   Called employee health and notified them.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

Down the left side of back to center of back.  8 days later pain is still severe.   I have contacted VAERS (with no response), contacted CDC (no response) and revisited the vaccine clinic and they referred me to my primary doctor or ER.  Primary is not trained in covid=19 vaccine side effects.  Spent 6 hours in Emergency yesterday to no avail.  This is day 9 and I still have chronic nerve pain.

I knew my mouth was hanging open and couldn&#39;t shut it. My husband took my blood pressure,  it was 61/50.  After a few minutes I was coming to, blood pressure began to come back up. My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

                                                ?Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA? About a week after my first dose (only immediate side effect, about 12 hours after shot, was stiff left arm/shoulder for about 3 days), I had the WORST genital herpes attack that I&#39;ve had in literally 40 years, with extremely swollen labia, excessively &#34;weeping&#34; sores, intense itching and pain. The shot was the only variable in my routine health and healthcare to which I can attribute this; the herpes attack finally began to heal, but then repeated itself, not as bad as the first one. During this time I have been taking Valcyclovir and Acyclovir cream, prescribed by OB/GYN. A few days into the initial herpes attack, my hands and face swelled and broke out in a case of (probably) dermatitis (which I&#39;ve had once or twice in the last 2 years), covering my arms, legs, hands, somewhat belly and back, with itchy hives which are still healing. Was prescribed by dermatologist Hydroxyzine HCL 10 MG 3x/day &#43; Triamcinolone Acetonide lotion USP 0.025% topical ointment, which are helping to relieve itching.

                                                After 2 days of getting vaccine, on Feb 22, my arm had a huge rash and was very tender where my shoulder was sore.  I took a picture.  I didnt notice any redness prior to this but wasn&#39;t looking for it.  Do you know when it will go away.  It is larger than when a baseball hits you in an arm and the same amount of tenderness.

                                                Moderna Covid Vaccine, 1st dose.  I experienced &#34;covid arm&#34; 6-7 days after  I received the vaccine.  I had itching and developed a 3&#34; x 2&#34; oval shaped red area near the site of the vaccine (upper left arm).  It is not too bothersome physically, but it does worry me mentally.  I also had some left armpit tenderness a couple days after the vaccine, which lasted about 3 days, but that has subsided.

This time had low grade fever (100.1), body aches, sore neck, joint aches in hands, minor headache, chills from fever.  Also injection site redness, which extended out for a few inches around the injection site itself.  This lasted about 3 or 4 days and was warm to the touch.  The fever etc. only lasted the one day (day after injection) and by day three I was fine.  Was not servere enough to keep me from working etc., but I did go to bed early that night.

                                                I was experiencing a mild RA flare w/ tendinitis going into the vaccine sequence. After 2nd dose my flare worsened to severe within a 9 day period. I had joint, muscle pain, swelling of fingers, hands. I lost much mobility, having gait issues and could not walk unaided ( a first in a flare). I do not take immunosuppressive infusions. Just NSAIDs. My doctor  prescribed a week of Prednisone. I am improving but having to build up strength to stand and walk. My flare continues but is abated. My muscles are weak.

                                                I have nerve pain in the back of my left ear that has grown to encompass a larger area below my ear and up my skull about 2 inches.  Also moving down my neck under my ear, feels like it is getting numb.  It feels more like numbness is occurring hourly and the pain seems to be creeping into my ear drum.  Scale  of maybe 5 from a 1 to 10 scale of pain.

Rapid heart rate, nausea, felt like blood pressure was going up a lot.  Afraid I was on the verge of having a stroke. Symptoms hit abruptly with no warning. Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

                                                Sharp, painful muscle cramps in both left and right feet and ankles, relieved by self-administered massage.   Cramping began when first lying down in bed, relieved by massage, then recurred about 20 minutes after falling asleep, and again relieved by self-administered massage.    Not persistent.   Did not recur after being relieved by self-administered massage the second time.   I was physically exhausted due to only 3 hours sleep the night before, so this may have been the result of exhaustion and not the vaccine, but has never happened before and seemed severe enough to file a report about it.  My arm was not particularly sore where vaccine administered and no other SE.

A few days after vaccine, woke up with cyst very inflamed and painful/difficult to swallow.   Took advil (2 pills) 4 x.  Cyst settled back down but going to ENT to have checked out.   Concerned getting the 2nd dose if adverse affects become greater.

I was feeling a great deal of soreness immediately. my arm at the injection site is tender to the touch and my shoulders and neck are sore too. I started with 99 fever Monday night and Tuesday night  I experienced sweats and clamminess. I couldn&#39;t sleep. When I awoke Wednesday morning, I had 100.5 fever. I took Tylenol and a couple of hours later, fever went  to  99. 2. I will continue to take Tylenol every few hours.

                                                I started experiencing muscle pain again and pruritus in my vaccinated arm (left) and an area of epidermis (approximately 4&#34;x6&#34;) around the vaccination site is also showing moderate erythema and slight edema on 1/20/21 (12 days after dose 1). I staring applying 1% hydrocortisone cream on the affected area and taking Benadryl 25mg tablets. The pruiritus started to lessen however the erythema and edema did not decrease so I contacted my primary care provider. She referred me to an allergist who I saw via telehealth on 1/25/21. By that time the pruiritus, erythema, and edema was almost gone however I did show her a picture when the reaction was at its most severe state. As of today, it is still present but continues to resolve. My allergist discussed the reported incidence of this reaction, informed me that it did not contraindicate me from receiving the 2nd dose, and that this reaction may or may not occur again.

                                                I had been freezing all evening after the shot.  Went to bed as usual for the night.  Woke up about 1 am which is normal for me.  I was still freezing.  Got up to go to the bathroom as I normally do.  While sitting on the toilet, I started shaking violently - not just regular shivers.  This was scary.  Violent jerking from the waist up - head, arms, torso.  I could not control it.  Eventually it stopped.  I put on warmer clothes and climbed back into bed.  Eventually I warmed up and went to sleep.  Other minor side effects were same as the first vaccine - sore and tender around the injection sight and slight headache.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

By the end of the day, the soreness in my arm radiated up into the left side of my neck.  I applied a heating pad, took a warm bath and went to bed early.  This morning, my neck is a little better but the arm is more sore and the red area has gotten larger and is swollen.  The pain med-to-mild and does not restrict range of motion or use of my arm.  No distinct pattern or broken skin.

Over next 36 hours fever was between 100-102. Nausea began 48 hours after injection.  It is now Tuesday, almost 4 days since injection and am still dizzy and weak.  Fever stopped yesterday and only light headache today.   My husband also had all my symptoms except a much lower fever.  We are wondering if we could have got a bad batch???  They said to expect 1-2 days of mild discomfort.  This was like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever had.

                                                The volunteer chose a landing mark for the needle which when stuck into my shoulder joint area, hit something, so he immediately withdrew that needle.  He then took a new second needle and chose a 2nd landing mark that was close to the first needle &#34;stick&#34; and delivered the vaccine.  I felt immediate burning  and that continued for much of the day.   The burning proceeded into intense pain.  I returned to the Senior Center at 7:30 a.m. the next morning and reported the error the volunteer made and showed the head nurse the bruise that was high - at my upper arm - and nearly on my shoulder.  The head nurse said it was &#34;high.&#34;   She asked me what I wanted her to do.  I responded that she should report the error and I would like it documented, as I was now afraid I might have endured a shoulder/joint injury.  I also called the health department and the Covid-19 Help Line  and reported the error.  I had two days of intense pain, where I could not physically, not just the excruciating pain, lift my arm.  I emailed an Orthopaedic doctor who specialized in shoulders and made an emergency apmt with him.  I also made an apmt with my primary.  My ortho doctor is treating me for SIVRA, I am on anti-inflammatories, I am having physical therapy on my left shoulder, as there is constant pain.  I am scheduled for return visits to my orthopaedic doctor and this appears to be a concern as far as damage, time course and outcome.  I hope the head nurse DID report the injury to my shoulder area.  She promised to record the event in &#34;my file,&#34;

It was definitely swollen and some redness too. I took my temperature and had no fever. Called my doctor&#39;s office to report my findings. Was instructed to apply a cold ice pack on it and take ibuprofen and to contact you with my event. I did not need to visit the office and continuing to ice pack my arm and ibuprofen.  As of 3:41 pm CST it is still swollen.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine: My left arm was very sore starting in the evening of 1/6/2021. This soreness got worse over the next 2 days and then tapered off over the weekend.  On 1/11/2021, I started having pain in my left axillary region.  This pain increased into 1/12/2021.  Also, on 1/12, my left upper arm started hurting.  On 1/13, I still had pain in my left axillary region, and thespian in my left upper arm worsened.  Also, on 1/13 my left upper arm started itching.  Around 5pm on 1/13, I had a chance to look at my left upper arm and there was a large reddened area to my left upper arm which included the vaccine injection site.  This area was warm to touch.  About 5:30pm, I took 25mg of Benadryl.  I took another 25mg Benadryl at 11pm.  This morning (1/14), the redness is fading to the area on my left upper arm though itching remains.  There is slight pain to the area.  The pain to the left axillary region is much better-barely noticeable.  I reported this event to County Health Department and to my primary physician.

Throughput the evening, the tingling sensation progressed up the left side of my neck and my ear.  My ear felt similar s to Novacaine wearing off after a dental visit. During the night my throat got a similar sensation and created the need to try coughing it out. By 24 hours after the injection I was tired, with sore joints and muscle aches. By 36 hours I was still sleeping it off and at 48 hours I feel pretty well back to normal.

Started getting sick to her stomach all evening, started throwing up last night beginning at 11:00 PM, throwing up bile.  Today having fever of 101, didn&#39;t take anything for it, but down to 100 now.  Took 2 Tums and had such achy joints and sat down in a chair and could not get up from the chair.  Took some Tylenol and that helped, but freezing cold.  Didn&#39;t sleep all night.  Has not notified her doctor of the symptoms, just calling us.

While driving home my face became warm, after arriving home face/cheeks extremely red/flushed.  Have a picture taken at 3:54 for documentation. Not sure if from anxiety, but felt jaw tightness and a thick tongue.  No itching, swallowing problems etc.   lasted approximately 15 minutes. By 4:57 pm redness had faded.   Picture documentation. 9:15 pm had right ear pain and mild reddened of right cheek.   Picture documentation.

Since then I have let it rest from activities but  I have done range of motion exercises as well as strengthening exercises. I have also taken 400 mg of ibuprofen twice daily for about a week. I stopped the ibuprofen approximately a week later but I?ve continue to do strengthening and stretching exercises of my left shoulder with some improvement. I reported this both to my internal medicine doctor whom I have given you her name of as well as my sports Medicine doctor. They agreed with my regime . I still don?t have full range of motion as well as some pain with certain movements with my left shoulder.

Her arm felt warm, and realized it was the area where she got the vaccine.  She put some lotion on it, and just kept watching it and did not go away.  The hand started feeling funny, different feeling to it.  The redness was trying to travel underneath the arm and around it.   She took an allergy pill for it, which helped the itching at first, but now it&#39;s localized more to the area of the vaccine.  She does have an appointment today with her doctor.  She also took some Advil but going to wait to see what the doctor tells her to do.

He said I should not take the 2nd dose, but to follow the advice of Moderna and CDC re: that decision.

Just then I felt strong pain in my lower back.  This pain has been with me ever since.   I spoke to my doctor.  She recommended Advil and Tylenol around the clock for a few days.  Also Flexaril, muscle relaxer at night. I did this for three days.  Also she recommended some gentle stretches and the application of heat.  I am following these directives.  The pain persists.

My arm is weak and cannot raise, lift or rotate it above the elbow.  Very difficult to maintain sleep with a throbbing arm. I have been taking Alleve and it helps but the pain is still there just milder. Muscles are not sore but something is aching deep in bone/joints. I went to the Kinesiologist who told me the rotor cuff is the issue. He did an pressure point &#34;adjustment&#34; and the pain subsided for a day or two and now I&#39;m back to being in pain during any level of movement again.  I believe that my injection was given too high in my shoulder and caused SIRVA. I even took a picture of where the injection site was given.  If needed I can provide it to you.

                                                Headache after the inacoulation on Tuesday 12/29. Two days later I started hearing a ring in my right ear. The ring went away on Wednesday 1/6. However on Friday morning 1/8 I woke up with a headache and body aches more pronounced in my waist and abdomen. I took my temparture and it was 98.8 F. I started taking Tylenol 500 mg. every 6 to 8 hours. On Saturday 1/9 the chills came back around 8 pm. I continued taking 2 Tylenol every 6 or 8 hours until now Sunday 1/10 at 4:30 pm. I am still experiencing sore abdomen and joins.

                                                Day 2 after vaccination I experienced severe headache, dizziness on standing, and stroke like movement in my right leg being unable to advance it normally when walking and my right foot turning so that I stood on the outside border of my foot. After sitting down I experienced visual disturbance in my right eye of blurred vision and corona of bright lines that zigzagged. These symptoms slowly resolved over the next hour, but left with extreme fatigue.

As the day progressed I started having body aches, headache, and some chills. It only lasted for that day and I was fine on 1/22/2021. I have never had a reaction to a shot before so it was worrisome. I am fine now.

                                                I had no symptoms for the first 48 hours. On days 3-6 I was fatigued but not enough to effect daily living activities.  Day 6 ( Feb 18, 2021) I started to have a lot of muscular aches and the injection site started to get red and swollen.  I had fever and chills from the 18th through the 20th  as well as a swollen arm and a lot of redness in the arm and minor itching. The red area on my arm was a patch about 4 inches wide and 6 inches long. The swelling was confined to the injection site and was raised up in a circle about 2 inches in diameter. My fever during this time was at 99 degrees.  Today is Feb 22 and most of my symptoms are gone, just minor redness and itching at injection site. I was just surprised that my symptoms didn?t show up until about 6 days after the vaccination.. Everything I have read suggested they could appear within 48 hours of the injection.

Most people say they don&#39;t even feel it, but I definitely felt the needle  go in and then felt the fluid go in.  By late afternoon, my left arm was very sore .  By  evening, I  couldn&#39;t lift my arm at all  due to pain in  that muscle at the top of my shoulder.  I think by that night but perhaps by the next morning I still couldn&#39;t lift my arm and the pain had gone into my neck on the left side.  After about 36 hrs, it started getting better but it was extremely sore for at least 4 days.   I still have some residual pain in my left arm and the base of my neck on that side.     About 4 days ago, I noticed  a round bruise about the size of a quarter about 1.5 inches away from where I think the shot was administered.  I am not aware of anything that might have caused it, but Im pretty sure it wasn&#39;t where the shot  was administered.  It seems to be growing a bit from when I first noticed it.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

I had donated my COVID convalescent plasma that morning for the 4th occasion but I was told it would not interfere with the vaccine.

                                                After the initial injection (1/11), there was just soreness at the site and no other problems.  The next morning (1/12), I woke with severe vertigo and ensuing nausea.  I couldn&#39;t focus my eyes on any one point because everything seemed to quiver.  The nausea was like motion sickness.  I couldn&#39;t walk without stumbling.  Since this was the first time I&#39;ve ever experienced vertigo, it was concerning.  I consulted my sister who is an RN who recommended the Epley Maneuver.  It helped only a little, but I resigned to returning to bed to sleep to avoid the symptoms.  The next day (1/13), I woke with vertigo again.  It was not as bad as the first day, but prevented my activities (walking around the house, driving, working).  Today (1/14) I woke feeling slightly queasy, but can function, but not work.  If the resolution continues on this trajectory, I should be okay tomorrow, I hope.

When I got home from work  on 1.19.2021 I noticed a large red  patch which was hot to the touch.  During the day my arm where I received the injection became very itchy.  During the day I also was extremely tired and had developed a headache and felt like I may be getting a cold.  I also had a neckache.  I still have those symptoms.   I received my vaccine on 1.06.2021.

                                                Sore injection site began 24 hours after injection.  Swelling and redness at injection site. Also began then.  Sore shoulders developed on that day as well. 36 to 40 hours after injection I developed swollen lymph nodes under left arm.  They diminished after 24 hours.  Injection site began itching about 4 days after injection.  All have gone away by 7 days with the exception of the injection site.  9 days after injection it is still slightly tender.

                                                I received the injection around 2:30 I felt fine. It did not hurt going in. I stopped by a restaurant to get some take out and must of started feeling disorientated and completely forgot I had this folder with the VSAFE information. I started feeling chills all over my body, I kept taking my temperature it was 95.7, I started having a headache top of my head, the temporal, the back of my neck. They were all over the place. I went to bed and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It was like my brain was going crazy, it wasn&#39;t like an anxious feeling. I finally feel asleep around 4am and kept waking up remembering fragments of valid dreams. The dreams were fragment with such dread and anxiety in them.  It was like a huge wave of depression and anxiety. By about 9am I was fully awake, but my body hurt, my muscles ached I felt fatigued. The chills and headaches were through. I was still having weird racing thoughts. About 10pm it all went away and I slept fine and woke up the next morning and I was fine. My arm is still sore at the injection site but all the other symptoms went away.    Saturday morning I was talking with a friend on the phone, and she reminded me of the folder I received the folder. I completely forgot about this folder. I found this folder later that day and then I tried to access VSAFE. It made me realize how disorientated I was.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch. Was in bed 2 days bcuz it exacerbated my MS.  After that the injection site started itching, with redness.  Lump finally getting smaller.  I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

                                                I am concerned they injected  high, above the muscle.  They had trouble getting the injection in, it burned a lot, she kept asking me to relax my muscle (which was relaxed) and when I took the Band-Aid off it looked high. I took a photo at the time, because of my concern.   My shoulder joint was quite sore and stiff the next few days. 3 1/2 weeks later I still have an aching burning pain;  it feels as if they hit the shoulder capsule or the periosteum.   My questions are as follows:  Do you think this is too high to inject? Do you think I will have gotten enough absorption anyway?  Is there a way to get measured for the antibody response in this situation?  Should this be reported as an adverse event?  ( I hate to get anyone upset at our hospital, as I am grateful I got the vaccine and intend to get the booster Will this affect the booster?

                                                I had a possible reaction on my Left arm and chest. My Right arm received the injection. I never have any sticks in my left arm since I have  developed Lymphedema post breast cancer mastectomies and treatment in  April 2006. When I arose  my effected arm was red in color, with a rash on top of that. It was hot to the touch and swollen and stiff.  My husband took me to the emergency room of the hospital named in Item 21 and later that day I was admitted to the hospital. They diagnosed it as a severe infection, resulting in cellulitis and started me on round the clock IV antibiotics.

                                                A few hours after my vaccination, my arm became extremely sore and was extremely sore all night, and remained so the next day. I have a high pain tolerance, but my arm felt as if it had received a powerful injury, and was hard to lift without using my other arm.  I also had a slight fever the next day, chills and muscle aches and fatigue. I am normally very active, but spent the day in bed. The next day I felt much better although my arm was very sore for another day or two. Then, the evening of the 21st of Feb., my arm, at the vaccination site became very itchy and was painful to touch in that area. I slept well but woke with the same itchiness, and soreness, and now tonight, Feb. 22nd, that area is still itchy and a bit sore. But I have not had the swelling and redness that I am reading about with Covid arm.

My stomach was queasy.  By the next morning, my joints hurt so much it was difficult to roll over in bed, and all the other symptoms were still there and worse.  I did not have a fever.  I developed a headache.  All I could do was lie in bed; sitting up felt exhausting.  By evening of that day, my joint pain was lessening and my stomach felt somewhat better.  By the following morning, I felt normal, basically.  So in total, about a day and a half of bad reaction.

On an unknown date, the patient experienced APHASIA (couldn&#39;t talk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (memory started to go/ memory was getting worse/ couldn&#39;t remember what day it was) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), FALL (tried to get out of bed and fell) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ANXIETY (getting anxiety ridden) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, TREMOR (Tremor/hand was shaking was dropping things/whole body just shakes) had not resolved and DYSSTASIA (had trouble standing), MALAISE (feeling sick), APHASIA (couldn&#39;t talk), MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (memory started to go/ memory was getting worse/ couldn&#39;t remember what day it was), FALL (tried to get out of bed and fell) and ANXIETY (getting anxiety ridden) outcome was unknown.            The patient thought that the tremors might have been due to the Hydroxychloroquine and because she was also feeling sick, she stopped taking the Hydroxychloroquine, but continued taking the Clarithromycin. The tremors continued. Her doctor advised her to resume taking the Hydroxychloroquine, starting with ĵ pill, then ½ pill working her way up in dosing. The patient reported that her hand tremors never stopped.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not Applicable.

During the next week I had occasional fever and chills , fatigue and muscle aches.   On January 14, my  upper left arm began itching and swelling.  This has continued including the entire upper arm becoming very hot to the touch.  It has subsided somewhat by January 17.  Should I get the second dose scheduled for Feb 4?

The pain seemed to be in whole leg and seemed to be muscular and also a lot of pain in hip joint area.  Also was feeling a burning and numbness sensation down my leg.  By 7pm was in bed because it was too painful to walk.  Took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.  This morning the hip pain is better and I am walking ok. I still have burning and numbness mostly in the calf area of left leg. I am also feeling burning and numbness on the left area of my lip. This is an area of my lip where I have had cold sore in past but don&#39;t see a cold sore.

After one hour I was fine.  Second vaccine was administered on Feb. 8th at noon. By 3:30 AM Feb 9th I could barely get out of bed because of severe joint pain and aching. I was nauseated, had a mild fever, mild headache and very tired. This lasted until  February the 10th at which time I felt better. By Feb. 11th I had return of deep aching pain in my hips and pelvic bones. ( I have arthritis and know what joint pain is). This was much worse. I felt ill from about one week after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna. I started feeling much better with the occasional return of mild symptoms.  I go to physical therapy for arthritis pain and had taken a week off. I returned to physical therapy on Thursday. February 18th. I was unable to complete my usual workout due to weakness in my legs and joint pain. I returned on Feb. 22nd and the same thing happened I felt weak, diaphoretic, nauseated,  after exercising a short time. This has never happened before.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up at 2:15 a.m. feeling pains in my chest middle and extending through to my upper back.  The pain encompassed the span of my upper chest and back from one arm to the other.  I experienced very rapid heartbeats that I could feel throbbing from my head to my chest.  I was hesitant to move or rise from my bed because of the pain.  At 3:40 I called 911.  They did an EKG and I was told that my heart was fine.  My blood pressure was 180/90.  I chose not to go to the hospital but to call my doctor when his office opened up at 9:00 a.m. in approximately 5 hours.  My doctor had me come into his office.  I had another EKG which was fine and he sent me to have a Cat Scan. the same day which was also fine.  My doctor spoke to me and said that he felt that this was due to side effects of the vaccine.  I doubled up on my Acid Reflux medicine, taking 80 mg daily for  four days through Monday 2/22/2021.  I could not sleep well for three days after the vaccine experiencing pain in my chest and could not breathe deeply without feeling it.  Then I steadily improved and today I can take deep breaths with little pain.  I also experienced muscle pain in my left shoulder and neck but used Mineral Ice on my neck and was relieved in one day.

                                                Became extremely hot &amp; went to check thermostat in house. Suddenly had no feeling in legs, i.e., felt like legs did not exist. Could not hold myself up. Fell down and landed on right side hip &amp; knee.  After a minute or two, could get up on my own and feeling returned to legs.

As day progressed felt discomfort, site began to get itchy. In evening checked and blotches became one mass, swollen, very warm to touch. Called pharmacy, they never heard of delayed reaction said take benedryl and call primary dr in morning. Went to pharmacy, the pharmacist looked at it and felt it, also never saw delayed reaction, gave same instructions. Sent picture to primary, did video call today, 99.7 temp, elevated BP and pulse. She saw picture, close up on screen, concerned one spot darker might be cellulitis, need to watch, take benedryl, call if changes, report to CDC

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

A little muscle soreness, a little tired feeling but not enough to keep me from my morning routine of going to church at 7:00 a.m.   I got home around 8:00 am, muscles ache now, and tired feeling more pronounced.  I took two Advil around 8:30 a.m..  but by 10:00 a.m. I had a low grade fever of 100.2.  which subsided for a few hours, then returned late afternoon  around 4:00 pm at 100.4 degrees.  Tired and achy feeling continued the rest of 2/22/2021.  Morning of 2/23/2021, did not get up at regular time nor go to church...general &#34;washed out&#34; feeling, muscle aches improved.

He has a degenerative muscle disease (Inclusion Body Myositis) so is already very weak, wheelchair bound. House is set up with all lift chairs or elevated (Bed, Toilet) so he can get out of them with very weak legs. By mid morning he was not able to use legs or arms at all to get up and had difficulty holding head up (usually no problem). By afternoon temperature went to 103.6. and he ached all over. After 2 - 3 hours with dose of 2 extra strength Tylenol temperature came down to 100.6 and then another hour later he became very sweaty all over body and temp returned to normal. Continued very weak for a few days. Gradually regained strength and back to normal strength for him over 6 days.

Stayed that way until yesterday, 1/28/21, was able to raise the left eyebrow and her lip was starting to normalize, but still having some droopiness from it.  Called her provider and looked it up on the internet, and was told she had Bell&#39;s Palsy.  Told her to keep an eye on it, and if anything else happened to go into the hospital to see if it was a stroke.  It did not affect her limbs or have any other stroke symptoms, just the left side of her face.

                                                I work at  medical center where patient is being treated for a new diagnosis of Acute monocytic leukemia.  I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

The patient&#39;s medical history included epilepsy.  Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included clonazepam.  On 03 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient was slurring her words and fell into a deep sleep.  It took three individuals to wake her up.  The patient wondered if she passed out.  She felt tingly in her upper right arm and it felt like her equilibrium was off, and legs were heavy.  The patient was very fatigued.    Treatments of these events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, passing out, unsteadiness, slurring words, fell into a deep sleep, tingly feeling in her upper right arm, felt like equilibrium was off, legs felt heavy and fatigue, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71 year old female subject, with history of epilepsy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of loss of consciousness after first dose of mRNA1273 (Lot# unknown). Concomitant medication included clonazepam. Very limited information has been provided at this time. Further information has been requested.

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

On 10 Feb 2021, at noon, post vaccination, the patient reported she had atrial fibrillation. She was able to get it under control until it started back again at approximately 4 pm the same day. At 6 pm that evening, the patient reported her arm was really sore, there was redness and itching at the injection site. She had lots of bloating, chills and overall, not feeling good. The patient stated it felt like having COVID again.   Treatment for the event included hydrocortisone cream.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the event, afib/atrial fibrillation, was considered not resolved.   The outcome of the events arm got really sore, redness itching at the injection site, lots of bloating, lots of chills, just not feeling good, and feeling like having COVID all over again were considered unknown.  Follow-up received on 16 Feb 2021 included date of when patient had COVID-19, treatment information and added redness and itching at the injection site to the events.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, which includes a strong temporal association with onset of the reported events and the use of the product, a causal association cannot be excluded.

                                                Neurology consult note 2/16: The patient is a 72-year-old woman, who states that last Friday she began to notice a strange fullness and numbness and perhaps a mild degree of weakness in her right leg and came to  Emergency Room.  She was seen by ER doctors.  Diagnosis was unclear.  She was offered admission to get physical therapy, but she did not wish to stay for the weekend and returned home on Friday the evening only to come back to the ER on Sunday, 2 days later with progression of further right leg weakness, right leg numbness and a hint of new left-sided symptoms that had not begun before Sunday.  None of her symptoms involve the arms or face and everything was below the waist.  There was no significant pain.  She has not had a bowel movement since Thursday and has lost the ability to void.  Her MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine was reviewed by me on the computer monitor and was unrevealing except for mild DJD.  Thoracic MRI scan shows possible spinal cord infarction versus myelitis occurring within the thoracic spine at the dorsal surface of the cord at the T5 and T6 vertebral body levels to the right of midline.  This was a faint finding and not clearly infarct or myelitis and could be artifact.  It appears that she has hydronephrosis on her scans too and now is using a Foley catheter.  She does have a history of high cholesterol for which she takes a statin at home and was taking a baby aspirin a day when the above symptoms occurred. In summary, the patient has a 72-year-old woman, who presents with progressive right lower extremity weakness and now evolving left lower extremity weakness.  This may be related to an autoimmune process such as myelitis or less commonly cord ischemia.  Normally, I would start her on Plavix, but I think she may need to undergo spinal tap tomorrow if MRI scan of the brain and cervical spine are unrevealing.  Patients with mild hyperglycemia can develop a diabetic amyotrophy or lumbosacral plexopathy simply related to diabetes, which is a diagnosis of exclusion.  Speaking against this would be that her reflexes are intact at both knees at 2&#43; to 3 and slightly brisk, 1&#43; at both ankles and 1&#43; and symmetric in the upper extremities.  We will hold aspirin for today.  Consider LP for tomorrow, but have not ordered as we will try to avoid and hopefully the imaging studies I have ordered will be sufficient.  We will continue to follow.  While admitted to this facility, she was treated with IV dexamethasone 2/14-2/21  She was admitted to an inpatient hospital 2/14-2/23 and discharged to an inpatient rehab unit at a different health system.

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

She saw her doctor on Monday3-1-21 and had an x-ray. On Tuesday the doctor&#39;s office called and said her x-ray  was clear. Friday morning, 3-5-21 my father heard a loud noise (thud) and  found my mother unresponsive on the bathroom floor at approximately 8:30am. He called 911. She was transported to the hospital via ambulance. The emergency room physicians worked on her for over an hour and were unable to get her back. Her time of death was 10:12am.

It had been 8 days since the vaccination and I still have the red itchy arm.

Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, minor stroke, weak muscles, nerve pain, injection site reaction, and achy, was unknown. The outcome of event, terrible pain in neck and lower back, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and evidence of a temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and the onset of injection site reaction and achy, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There is limited information to asses causality for the events of injection site reaction, and achy.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                First vaccine digestive symptoms and minor aches; very sore left arm lasted 7 days; 2nd vaccine: 102 degree fever on next day; aches and pains all over; could barely get out of bed; inability to eat at all for 24 hours; digestive symptoms: gas, acid refulx, nausea; giant burps. By next day, very painful electric transitory pains (seconds) in core of my vascular formation in my upper left leg. This is a congenital defect that responds to estrogen, but also some medicines like synthroid, which I do not take after getting reaction with just 3 pills. Successfully moderated Hashimoto&#39;s with strict gluten-free and dairy-free diet. I have never experience such severe leg pain and massive swelling, still happening today. Th The only other time that I have experienced these short intermitent &#34;electric&#34; pains was during infertility treatment at age 40, more than 30 years ago. I suspect something in the adjuvant. I hope that this will exit my body because the sudden swelling and severe pain is not something I can endure. It barely beats dying from Covid-19. My quality of life is wrecked for the time being. I suspect that this vaccine has caused an autoimmune attack on my vascular malformation; that my T cells have gone beserk. I&#39;d be willing to have my antibodies against Covid checked and I&#39;ll bet I have more than average! The havoc for people with autoimmunity and Moderna vaccine is serious. I despair and hope that it won&#39;t have a lasting impact on my health. I will volunteer to be studied, but no more Moderna vaccine for me! I trusted the medical establishment and government and this has not worked out well!

                                                Received #1 dose as stated.  Next day, 1/27/21, 9:00am , had mild joint pain to both legs, &amp; arms, &amp; slightly tired.  Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

On Feb 21st started having severe pain in both legs from the knees down to the ankles. No swelling, but ice and ibuprofen lessened the pain some.

I was also so fatigued that I could do nothing all day except lay on the couch or in bed. I felt better that night around 8 PM. The injection site was also swollen, red and painful for about 5-6 days.  Today, it was itchy.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On 28-JAN-2021, the patient had chest pain again during a nap and decided to call 911 because she was about to pass out. The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) where an EKG (electrocardiogram) was performed. A few moments after the EKG, the patient had a heart attack. The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin.

                                                On 01/11/2021, within a few hours of my grandmother getting the shot her injection area became red, swollen and hot to the touch. At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

I called my primary care physician but no one returned my call.   Awoke around 2:21 am, I am moist, my fever had broken.  Feeling much better.  During this period I experienced intense anger which was troubling.  I though I had been given the virus rather than the vaccine.  I am experiencing a much better mood this morning.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

On Monday,  1/25/21, I contacted my primary care doctor.

                                                Had vaccine on 1/11/21, did not have any problems for at least a week or two, then it was a little twinge, and it seems that every day it gets a little bit worse.  More sore every day up to the shoulder bone, down to the elbow in the muscle.  The bone at the top of her shoulder hurts as well.  Thought it was going to go away and after 3 weeks is still having these symptoms.  Takes an aspirin once a day, and Ibuprofen on occasion for the pain, but nothing more.  The pain is not so bad that she can&#39;t stand it, but it&#39;s uncomfortable and feels like it is in the bone itself.

                                                Woke up about 1:00 am in delirium and feverish. No control over thought process or able to get up. Managed to get out of bed at 9:00 am but was so weak could barely make it up a flight of stairs. And when I did ended up in bathroom vomiting. Laid on floor to get some strength back. Went back to bed and slept restlessly until 4:00 pm.  Still feverish and weak but not as bad as earlier. Ate some cold grapes and went back to bed until the following morning. Tried to stay hydrated and took ibuprofen several times. My upper arm was red and blotchy for 3 days. Overall I?d say the severest part of the event lasted 48 hrs and another 24 hrs of tiredness and nausea but not vomiting.

She reports no weight changes, no cough, shortness of breath, PND, dysuria, swelling.  Patient originally presented to the ED at hospital 3/1/2021 with a generalized body aches and pains of 1 day duration. In the ER, patient was hypertensive and labs showed elevated creatinine of 1.6 (baseline 1.27), BNP &gt;8000.  She describes her symptoms as a sub-acute onset hand and leg weakness. It appears that the leg symptoms started before the arms were affected, after which she developed positive sensory symptoms in the form tingling of the hands and feet. She also admits to negative symptoms in the form of decreased sensation of her feet. She has been unable to stand on her feet since about two days ago. She appears to have some disturbance in time perception as her recollection of the progression of her disease is off by several weeks. she denies bowel/bladder incontinence or saddle anesthesia.
