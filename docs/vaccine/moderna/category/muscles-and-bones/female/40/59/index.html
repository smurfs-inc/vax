The next day muscle/joint pain continued with headache, fatigue, fever, chills, and my urine turned dark brown. The next day fever went away and all symptoms improved except the urine continued to be brown. The following day I was seen at the ER and was diagnosed with hematuria of unknown cause. I have to have a CT scan on Monday to evaluate further.

                                                About 1  hour after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19, I started feeling extreme pain in my left shoulder and arm, where the shot was administered. The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was &#39;hanging and drooping&#39; and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.  During the days that followed my immunization, I was unable to do anything with my left arm and was dependent on my husband to help me get dressed, showered, household chores, etc. It is unknown at this time whether this will be temporary or permanent damage and disability.

I felt very short of breath. worst when walking and talking that improved with me sitting. Nausea with lots of drool. Around 4:30 I started feeling body aches . Then at 5 on my way home, i started feeling extreme pain in my joints, to where i couldnt hold the steering wheel tight. Around 7:30 I started having shaking and aching. Around 9:30 I ate potatoes, and took motrin and it helped a little. I felt weak and washed out like I ran a marathon.  I was still feeling fatigue and wiped out, I had no energy.  I took my pulse ox and it was 95-96.  I am now having muscle pain at the injection site, and injection site is very sore.

                                                1/5/2021 - Day 1:  R) deltoid pain at injection site around 1600, mild headache viewing around 2100 when going to bed. I took ibuprofen prophylactically to prevent pain getting worse.  1/6/2021- Day 2 around 00:00, I was woken up out of bed with severe body aches all over. Mostly to bilateral hip joints and lower. Arm pain and headache were barely noticeable d/t other pain. Pain radiated to arms down to both shins. It hurt to touch skin and took ibuprofen around 0130-0200. It was so bad I couldn&#39;t roll my body up without assistance and I&#39;d need to use restroom for almost 2 hours at this point. Had to call out of work because I knew this pain wouldn&#39;t go away in a few hours in addition to lack of sleep, I knew it&#39;d be better to rest with OTC, rest, And heating pad.  Later this day I was still feeling the same, went to store to get something for body aches. It wasn&#39;t until I was in this store, when my left femur bone hurt so bad I had to grab onto a shelf. I felt my bone was about to break - scary. (My1 st time experience the bone pain symptom) Later at home same day, spent an hour going back and forth to bathroom with large loose/water diarrhea. I slept most of the day, as I was too fatigued to do simple tasks. Went to bed around 21:00 after taking ibuprofen, laying on heated and covered in electric blanket.  1/7/2020 woke up at 05:50 to get ready for work and instantly felt the pain again and headache, I&#39;m usually not so tired after sleeping, so contributed that to same fatigue. Although is not pounding, still dull.  1/7/2021 0900 took my HCTZ, Propranolol, and Potassium. Today the pain is not as high, but better than yesterday. I expect to feel a lot better tomorrow to go into work.

My tongue was still numb but not getting any worse so i felt it was ok to leave. I decided to go home after those 2 hours and i took 10 min of zyrtec and about 5 hours later i still had a little numbness and tingling on the right side of the tongue but the rest of the tongue and lip had resolvedf. Had fatigue and myalgia for the rest of the day.

Everything was good until about an hour after I got home, and I developed a headache and was very tired. Went to bed at my normal time which is 9o?clock, and slept all night. When I woke up the next morning which is January 15, 2021 my left arm was very sore and my headache was gone. Went to work at normal time, 7:00 am and began feeling very fatigued with muscle soreness and joint pain. Left work and came home and slept for two hours. Still experiencing aches and pains and fatigue. I do feel it necessary to report I have had a positive covid-19 result in April of 2020.

I was tired, had body aches and a severe headache for 3 days. This all subsided on the 4th day post injection. On the 6th day post injection my shoulder and neck began to hurt with swelling and a hard knot at my clavicle. It was tender to the touch and caused pain when moving my arm. I saw my doctor on the 7th day post injection with complaints and he said it is most likely a  viral infection and gave me meds to relieve pain. That night my shoulder started to throb and when I looked at it it is red, hot and swollen again. I still experience pain and discomfort to my shoulder and neck. The area where I received the vaccine itches as well.

My arm also developed redness the following morning accompanied by body aches.  I started running a fever of 102 by that evening, with increased aces and chills. The redness spread down my right arm to the elbow and was hot and swollen. Lymph nodes to the right axilla and arm were swollen and painful.  I missed the 16-17 from work and spiked intermittent fevers. I am a nurse, and a doctor at work said it looked like a reaction, so I took Zantac, certrizine and ibuprofen. I also started taking amoxicillin 500 mg due to the potential for cellulitis. Today, I am spiking a fever again of 101.5, and they lymph nodes are still swollen.   Today is 12 days post vaccine.

Body aches. Incredible arthritis-like ache at the tops of my shoulders, upper back, and neck. Runny nose. Spitting mucous - was clear, now some thick solid white. Chest pain in the middle that comes and goes. Chest pain on left center side - it feels like in the area of my heart. Ache in my lower left side. Today, aching in my jaws mostly left side, but both. Ache on upper right front (lung area?). INCREDIBLY tired. It&#39;s so hard to stay awake.

                                                I was vaccinated on 12-30 after 4 pm.  By 3:30 on 12-31 my neck quickly swelled up, my throat becoming sore, glands swollen, headache, and fatigue were my first symptoms. An unusual symptom occurred from day 2-6. My facial skin did not hurt unless I applied pressure. When I applied pressure it felt bruised and highly sensitive but didn&#39;t hurt unless pressure was applied.  I also developed a small sore along my gum line on the bottom right front of my mouth.  Both of these symptoms disappeared after day 6. 7-8 days after receiving the vaccine my neck, jaw and shoulders became extremely stiff, including a runny nose. This symptom has persisted and is the worst of all symptoms (jaw and neck stiffness and sore throat). On day 12 in addition to the ongoing sore throat,  and stiffness in my neck and jaw I developed white spots on my right tonsil.  3 days after the white spots disappeared, but the red sore throat is current. On day 20, I developed 2 more sores on the right side of my mouth. One on the bottom gum line and one on the top right gum line (this feels like a canker sore). Today I have a slight earache in my right ear.   NOTE: I tested positive to COVID June 2020. I ended up taking 1 month off work due to persistent symptoms. I still cannot properly smell and taste, and I can smell water.  Occasionally, the brain fog from COVID comes up but that is more rare.

                                                On Thursday, 1/14/21 I found a large ?lump? under my collarbone on my left side. It was tender. Went to my PCP and she found further cervical, axillary, supraclavicular, and infraclavicular adenopathy (all on the left side)I had labwork,  X-ray, mammogram, and ultrasound on 1/15/21. Also, on 1/15/21 I started to have a lot of discomfort in my left shoulder. Everything came back good. On 1/16/21 I woke up and the area around my vaccination site was reddened, swollen, and itchy. This cleared up by 1/17/21. Used ice to assist. Today, 1/21/21, I still have a lot of discomfort and limited ROM in my left arm. The lymph node under my clavicle is still large and tender.

                                                Patient started as having distress and hyperventilating. Patient was breathing and able to take 50 mg of diphenhydramine. Progressed some and patient used inhaler. Patient developed flushing/warmth to face and neck pain. On pulse oximetry O2 was 98% to 99%. BP was in low 140s and 100s. Patient began having chills and BP was read as 98 over 42 (possibly a bad read). Chills persisted and became worse. Inhaler was used again. The patient began to become harder to keep conscious. The patient&#39;s chills became worse, began to complain of bilateral arm pain. A BP reading occurred at some point prior that read back in the 140&#39;s; however, after this reading the pulse oximeter failed to read on multiple fingers, another individual was unable to find a pulse multiple times, and the patient grasped at their chest in the universal for need air. This was the point at which an epi was administered. The patient seemed to improve a bit as EMT arrived at the scene. Patient was still having chills.

                                                typical side effects with in the first 48 hours. then 8 days post injection began to have side effects again. Began with an itchy arm at injection site and thought nothing of it b/c there were not marks. by the end of that Sunday my arm was red and warm with round spots. I took some Cetirizine and used a topical cortisone. Monday morning I woke to two lumps, itchiness, heat, tenderness, sore muscles, headache. I took some APAP and IBU and applied some more cortisone, went about my day with a two hour car ride and a walk. i was stiff through the day so i completed stretches several times through the day. When i got home that night most of my major joints hurt enough that I could not sleep through the night even with Naproxen 440 mg , APAP 1000 mg, Cetirizine 10 mg on board. My arm began to be more swollen, my nervous system began to be off. I had no appetite, was dizzy, felt shaky but when I held my arm and hand out, I did not shake. I have continued on a with Naproxen an d APAP since Tuesday after read not to take PO IBU if had Moderna vaccine.  I have not been able to complete house hold chores, missed three days of work, and been able to be with family.  As of today, January 22nd 2021, thirteen days post injection I still have fatigue, intermittent dizziness, loss of appetite, joint pain, headache with no relief with OTC&#39;s. The redness, swelling, heat have dissipated in left arm at and near injection site.

                                                Got my vaccine early morning.  Left arm where injection site given,  started to become really sore 30 minutes after injection.  I ate breakfast at around 9:30am. Went to my Doctor&#39;s appointment for 1030am, started having mild chills that would come and go. After Doctor&#39;s appointment,  around 1130-12pm, started to feel nauseous and loss of thirst and appetite.  I called the vaccine line at my job at around 2:59pm, but nurse just stated nothing to do right now, to call back following morning.  I knew things would get worse so I made the judgement call to call out this was close to 4pm. My chills started increasing,  despite not having any high temp was 98.9 f. Then around 5pm started having mild joint pain all over my body. Around 7pm joint pain got unbearable,  that I even started to shiver from more chills and pain.  I couldn&#39;t sleep,  except just laying and tossing and turning in bed, I also started having stomach cramping . Finally I fell asleep at around 12:30 midnight,  due to the pain. I finally woke up around 3:30am, took 2 Motrins. Then I woke up around 06:30am with body aches all over. Last night just took sips of ginger ale, didn&#39;t eat anything since 9:30am yesterday.  Finally had a small breakfast at around 7:30am with a glass of water. Still feel warm at times, with body aches, and nausea.  Will call vaccine line again today.

I developed a fever up to 102F over the following few days and severe pain at the injection site. On about 1/18 my ankles started swelling and turning bright red. I took tylenol / motrin not knowing this could even be associated and thinking maybe I overworked my muscles running around at work that weekend. Over the following few days the reaction has become much more severe. I have nodules that are red, painful and flat all over the front of my legs and thighs and continued swelling and pain to my ankles and knees. This makes it difficult to walk. I followed up with a Dr. on health online as I am unable to drive myself to an appointment at an office at this time who diagosed me with Erythema Nodusum and started me on prednisone. I missed 2 days of work with the initial reaction to the vaccine and will miss 3 shifts this weekend as I cannot walk and need to start prednisone&#34;

It started with an itch near the injection site that was red and looked like a hive. It itched and the rash increased in size over the next couple of days. As it healed, the itch decreased and the rash started to resemble the look of ring worm around the injection site. After about 72 hours it was almost completely gone. After about 4 days my arm was completely back to normal. I was never in pain from this, just a little bit of discomfort from the itching. I applied Cortisone cream which helped with that. It freaked me out more than anything. However after discussing it with a couple of healthcare professionals I wHowever after discussing it with a couple of healthcare professionals I was able to calm down. I can provide pictures of arm if needed.

I&#39;m healthy and 40 years old and I was barely able to walk to my bed, like a 90 year old.  Followed by uncontrollable shaking for 1-2 hours (like extreme chills, though I wasn&#39;t cold and was covered in blankets).  Following that,  I was unable to walk or crawl and almost any movement of any part of my body was excruciating, including picking up a glass of water and even wiggling my toes.   It felt similar to the physical trauma of recovering from a car accident, when every muscle is tensed for impact. That severity decreased within 24 hours of the vaccine.  Muscle pain, extreme fatigue, headaches and dizziness have continued for 4&#43; days and are still present and prevented me from working and going about day-to-day activity.

Pelvic/lower back/neck aches began evening of vaccination, around 10pm. Pain was significant enough to cause insomnia during the night and did not improve during the day after vaccination. Pain improved considerably after dose of ibuprofen mentioned above.

                                                Woke from sleep at ~1:00 am with anxiety and the sensation that I could not breathe. It progressed to a panic attack with uncontrollable crying and breathing issues for ~5-10 minutes. I was able to calm down, but continued to feel horrible all night. I threw up twice about an hour later. Muscle aches in both my shoulders (far worse in the one I got the injection in), back, buttocks, hips, and feet all night that kept me from being able to sleep. Ongoing nausea, headache, and fatigue all morning. Mostly has resolved now (2 pm) aside from fatigue.

                                                About 24 hours after the vaccination (NYE), my last knee was achy, first I did not correlate it to the vaccine, but by the end of the day I could not walk. The next morning (01/01) my knee was better but my left hand was very stiff and painful and in the afternoon my left shoulder was very painful and I could not lift my arm. Next day (01/02) my shoulder was better but my left hand was swollen and very painful.  I went to bed with a swollen hand and next morning (01/03) the hand was a little better, maybe 80% better, but my right shoulder was ridiculously sore that I could not lift my arm and I could not go to work because of that. That day I also had stiffness on both hands. I went to bed that night and when I woke up my shoulders and knees were ok but my hands were still stiff and sore.  My feet were painful and bluish. Woke up the next day and my feet were fine but then my right hand was like 5 times its normal size, I could not open or close it, and that is when I ended up at the ER with lots of joint pain, my feet and knees were hurting again and I also had shortness of breath and   chest pains at that moment. They prescribed me prednisone for the swelling. The day after the ER my fingers were numb, I totally lost the feeling on my fingers until 01/28/2021.

I also had nausea and headache (felt like a migraine). With my 1st dose I ended up at the ER so they had recommended me to take a Prednisone after the second dose. I took it and next morning I was much better. I still felt achy and my legs felt weak but that lasted only 48 hours and then I as fine.

                                                Developed a mild headache about five hours after injection. That was not uncomfortable. I then developed intense chills that woke me up from sleep  14 hours after injection.   I had pain in injection site, fatigue, non-stop chills, body aches, joint pain, muscle pain, cough, and difficulty eating (but not nauseated) and slight fever - just less than 100 degrees the entire first night, next day and night from the second injection. The joint and muscle pain was so intense in my elbows and wrists, that it caused me to break down crying as I was trying to drive home from work at 9 AM the following day after injection. The joint/muscle pain persisted and I would get some shooting pains in my toes, feet, hands, and wrists on and off for roughly 12 hours the day after injection. Lymph nodes have also been swollen in my throat since 14 hours after injection.   Naproxen did not ease this pain or discomfort but it did keep a fever at bay (but still with chills nonetheless) so at the recommendation of my sister who&#39;s a doctor, she said I should take the max dose for short periods of time at 2 pills, 3x a day. After taking two at once, that made the chills go away but not the body aches.

It increased in size over time and took benedryl and used hydrocorotsone cream to help with the itching.  It disappeared after about 3 days but still itch to date and I still experience some muscle weakness also.

                                                5 am - sore arm - a little swollen. That evening of the second day at about 7 pm - I had body aches and a low grade fever.  The third day, I felt back to normal and my arm was back to normal. The following week, the day after I tested positive for COVID, so that was January 7th. The arm was itchy and burny. It had a big rash on that area. (January 6 My upper back was hurting really bad and I had a fever. I wasn&#39;t feeling good at all. Had shortness of breath. So I went for a COVID test.) The rash lasted for about 48 hours and then it was gone. I didn&#39;t take anything for it. My other COVID symptoms lasted for about 6 days. I still didn&#39;t have taste though. I got that back on about day 10. I had the shortness of breath (feeling out of breath) which lasted a week and a half longer than when I felt better from the other COVID symptoms.  I treated COVID symptoms with VIT C; Vit D3 and tylenol.

Some days I feel better but tired then symptoms return. After 9 days the arm started to itch and hurt again and muscle spasms returned. But it was manageable until 02/24/2021 when spasms increased and I began shaking uncontrollably. My hands, torso, and feet would shake vigorously. I went to ER on 02/25/2021 as symptoms continued. They ran several tests and couldn?t find any other reason. Was told not to take the 2nd dose and was given a corticosteroids to help with possible inflammation and allergic reaction.

Fatigue,  severe muscle aches, joint pain, headache,  nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, chills to point shaking still come in waves.  This is day 7 and I could barely put one foot in front other after work to get in bed but vomited first.  Today, odd pressure in my face developed and headache came and went and again, the fatigue, muscle and joint pain are intense.  I&#39;m still working, but have had to take time off, go in late, etc.  Brain fog is a thing.  It feels like it did when I &#34;didn&#39;t have COVID-19&#34; before but had every symptoms and I was going to die, but in waves.  I was dizzy, saw stars and black spots in my right eye today on and off and vision in my right eye honestly seems to have significantly decline.  I&#39;m really just concerned that it is day 7.

It also hurt under my arm pit on that day and a few days prior to seeing the rash.  Directly following the vaccine (hours after until 3 days after) my arm was very sore and it was uncomfortable to move it. Those symptoms went away and I thought I was done with the side effects. Then that rash appeared 8 days later as stated above.

Over the next 3 days all the other symptoms went away but the body aches are still here. I still feel pain all the time every where and my skin if touching it I feel bruised. The pain is not so bad that I can&#39;t tolerate it but its a constant ache that does not go away also when I am walking up and down stairs i feel like I am weak and cant extend my legs all the way.

                                                About 20 hours after 1st dose, I started becoming very tired and spacey. 24 hours after dose, I felt very exhausted with a headache behind my eyes and pain in my neck and upper back (felt more skeletal than muscular). I fell asleep for 2 hours and woke up with a headache, some disorientation and feeling slightly nauseated. I had gotten plenty of good sleep the night before these symptoms and hadn&#39;t felt any immediate side-effects.  ...I don&#39;t feel that these are serious side-effects, but thought maybe the feedback would be worthwhile.

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten. After discussion with Dr. will be cutting out chicken (chicken was eaten before all 3 instances) and all other meats until complete resolution of symptoms and will avoid any inflammatory foods such as nuts, berries and shellfish. 7p 25mg Benadryl &amp; Claritin taken 7:30p ate a banana, no reaction 8p Singular taken 9:30p put Vaseline on my lips, face &amp; ears flamed hot and swelling and redness followed. 9:45p took 25mg Benadryl 10:25p tongue thick feeling 11p took 25mg Benadryl tongue still feels thick 1/3/21 Fevers 101.6 and chills started in the night Face and lips are permanently swollen and red despite all the meds I?m taking.Lymph nodes are all swollen. I?m too afraid to eat for fear of more swelling while my face is already so swollen.

This lasted about 2 hours and then subsided.  For the last week, I&#39;ve had off and on headaches and feelings of tiredness.  I&#39;ve also had soreness in left arm at the injection site.  Yesterday, 1/5/2021 I noticed increased redness, warmth and a raised area at the injection site.  It&#39;s hard and a little itchy.  I&#39;ve also had soreness in my neck and arm pitt.  I have reached out to employee health through the hospital that i work at and whom i recieved that vaccine from in regards to my symptoms.  The only invervention I&#39;ve taken has been taking tylenol for a headache.

I went to sleep and woke up with general malaise, chills, body ache, sore throat, headache. the same feeling I had when I had covid, a heaviness in my chest, almost like a shortness of breathe. I was flushed and felt feverish although I never had a fever. The symptoms lasted all day.  On the first also my arm pain was severe, I could not even lift it the whole day. I went to sleep on 01/01 and when I woke up on 01/02 the symptoms were all gone. I took Tylenol 3 times to help me with the symptoms. 3 grams total in 24 hrs.

                                                I had the shot and my only symptom was bruising at the injection site and sore arm.  After a few days my arm no longer hurt, but the bruise remained.  6 days after my injection, I experienced mild itching at the injection site.  Day 7 I noticed my arm was red, swollen, warm to touch, and itchy.  Day 8, my arm continued to swell and the area that was red was larger and very warm to touch at the injection   site.  My arm was also beginning to feel heavy.  I contacted and saw my pcp on day 8 and was told to take an antihistamine.  I took clarity and my symptoms are starting to improve.

                                                I woke up from sleep with severe chest pain at approx. 0400. It was sharp and radiated up to the left side of my neck. The pain was worse with breathing whether I was sitting up or lying down. My heart rate was 150 initially, but came down to 110&#39;s after a few minutes of waking up.  My heart rate did not decrease with rest and the chest pain was not going away, so I drove to the emergency room to be checked. Before I left the house I used my albuterol inhaler once to see if it would make the chest pain and tightness any better.  I received an EKG, mylanta mixed with lidocaine, IV pepcid and IV torodol to help relive the pain. The pain eased some (was a 8/10 when I awoke to a 2/10 after treatment). My blood was drawn, a chest x-ray was taken and the provider informed me all of my lab results, chest x-ray, and physical examination was normal. My EKG showed tachycardia and my heartrate did not drop below 100 beats per minute throughout the whole ER visit.  My BP at the highest was 151/94.  I have never had a problem with a fast heartrate or high blood pressure in the past.  I was discharged with a diagnosis of pleurisy caused by a cough I have been having.  I spent the rest of the day with chest pain and left arm pain from the site of the vaccination.

If that is any sign of how covid feels, I am so grateful for the shot.  I did not take anything because I wanted my body to fight it off.

                                                I received the vaccine at 12:59 pm and at 1:05 pm my heart began to beat rapidly. I felt heat rush into the left side of my head, I was extremely light headed and couldn?t catch my breath. I asked if there was a nurse that could help me. There was 1 paramedic watching everyone. I stepped outside, took my mask off to catch my breath. One staff member accompanied me and sat next to me. I began to shake in my legs and arms involuntarily, my heart kept beating and I just tried to do deep breathing techniques to catch my breath.  The paramedic came outside and asked if I wanted help. I declined his help and I called my husband who was sitting in the car to help me walk to our car. At 1:15, my heart was beating less rapid, I walked back to the car and as my husband was driving us home, my heart began to beat rapidly again, I felt burning and heat in my head and I began to shake in my arms and legs. It lasted about 10-15 minutes. We got home and I could barely walk into the house because I was so weak in my legs. I went to bed where my heart began beating back to normal after 1 hour or so.

                                                My arm became swollen and sore to the touch at the injection site within the first hour. With in 2-3hrs my arm was so sore I could hardly lift it to shoulder height or rotate it.  It was way more severe then I have ever felt from a standard vaxx or flu vaxx in years past. That continued for a full 48hrs, after that it subsided but was still sore around the injection site and the muscle.  I was able to typically use the arm again with minimal pain. Around 14-16hrs after the injection I began to feel very achy and sick. My shoulders, neck and head hurt. I did not have a fever, but my skin all over my body was achy to the touch as well. I also found my self to he extremely tired, like feeling run down, around 12hrs after the shot (when I woke up). The ?fluish? feeling of a headache,  feeling achy and being tired did get a little better but has continued into the 3rd day (today when I am reporting this).

                                                Exactly a week after being given the fist dose of Moderna, I got a rash of about 4in long to 3in wide, in the left arm, at the site of the injection. The rash feels warm to the touch, and it is itchy. Symptoms began on 1-8-21 at night, and were fully present by 1-9-21 in the morning, beginning with itchy and arm pain. By the next morning of 1-10-21, the symptoms worsen to appearing red, warm to the touch, itchiness more than the day before, and discomfort in the entire arm. I then called my doctor for a telehealth visit, and was advised to take Benadryl (which I did that night only), and use cold compress to relieve itchiness. I also put Cortizone on the infected area to manage symptoms. By the morning of 1-11-21, symptoms continued and the redness and itchiness seems to continue down the arm.

                                                Swollen neck/collar bone area. Painful lump.  I tried taking Tylenol for the pain and swelling but it has not gone away. I also tried ice for the swelling and warm compress for the pain.  Lump is still there and painful on a scale from 1-10, its about a 7. The pain is worse at the end of the day.  Been this way since the 6th of January and I thought it was sore due to the shot and the other small issues I had( headache, low grade fever) The pain was not going away after all the other issues did.

At 8 days, noticed a red, warm, and tender oblong shaped spot around the injection site, which has remained for last two days. Pain is different than initial muscle soreness from injection and feels more superficial to the skin. Reported to occupational health nurse and am monitoring for increased size, warmth, pain, or streaking.

                                                On Wed, Jan13, 2021 I noticed pain in my right arm pit when using deodorant.  I got progressively more uncomfortable and swelling throughout the day.  On Thursday, Jan 14, 2021, I woke up to itchy, burning sensation in my right arm.  It got hot, hard and very itchy as the morning went on.  Sharp burning pain started in my right arm muscles.  I saw PA at my PCP&#39;s office.  She also had a doctor take a look as well.  I was prescribed prednisone taper for 12 days, and I was recommended to take OTC benedryl.   Today, Saturday, January 16, 2021 it is still continuing to get larger, covering most of my upper right arm.  Benedryl has been helping with the itchiness.  It is not as hot and hard, yet continues to spread.  The burning sensation has dulled but still uncomfortable.

I had a tingling feeling all over and cold, I wasn&#39;t running a fever. I ate supper and threw everything up and started shaking because I was really cold. I took Tylenol and Phenergan. The next morning I felt weak, I tried to get ready to work and my joints ached, I was sore/achy and I threw up again. I took  Tylenol and Phenergan again and called out of work. Then mid- morning I woke up in a cold sweat and I felt better.  Each time I checked my temp. I wasn&#39;t running a fever.  My employer had me take a Covid test and it was negative.

Day 3 reached out to physician and was told to continue with ibuprofen, likely lymph node swelling putting pressure on axillary nerves causing numbness/Tingling. Soreness resolved in a few days. Numbness/Tinging/tightness in approx 1 1/2 weeks. On day  7 notes severe lower back pain but was intermittent and worse with certain movements, lasting a few days. Day 9 noted fatigue during work hours, in the evening noted body aches/muscle fatigue/headache. Day 10 tested (PCR) for Covid which was negative. Day 14 extreme fatigue and intermittent headache still persist. Examined by PCP who wants to test again for Covid as well as do antibody testing. Also test to rule out flu and mono to be scheduled.

I stayed home from work and reported it and was told I could return to work on 1/11 (my next scheduled day) by workplace health. I felt fatigue and eye pressure headaches on and off since. I also felt like I was having vision changes. On 1/14/21 I noticed a small, raised, red area at the injection site. Over the weekend it continued to spread over my arm. It is warm and very mild tenderness to palpation but does not itch. I am also feeling tight muscle pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.

                                                Severe headache, nausea and cold sensation occurred within a few hours of receiving the vaccine.  Arm discomfort and fatigue quickly followed.  Low grade fever noted approximately 8 hours post vaccine.   I took acetaminophen.  Headache, fatigue, and fever/chills resolved within about 48 hours.  Nausea and arm discomfort persisted for about 5 days.   After approximately 48 hours, I noted vision changes, blurry up-close vision.  This change might have occurred sooner, but it was not until this time that I felt well enough to really read.  The change in vision led me to seek further evaluation in the emergency room on 1/16/2021.

This was not much helped by Alleve, therefore I took Tylenol which was mildly helpful. After the first 36 hours, the symptoms lessened in severity and lasted for about another 12 hours. After that, I felt well for several days in a row, then about 1 week later I felt sore, weak, tired and nauseous. This resolved in its own in about 2 hours. I have felt well since then. I am choosing to receive my second dose of moderna vaccine tomorrow, because I would rather experience these side effects then catch COVID ever again. I caught COVID19 in March 2020. With my COVID infection, I was sick for about 21 days with fever of 101 and more, bone pain, body aches, chest pain, back pain, headaches, nausea, shaking chills, sweats, trouble breathing, dyspnea, cough, runny nose, sore throat, pink eye, dizziness, tiredness, ?brain fog? and fatigue. I was not hospitalized. After about 21 days I began to recover, but the first week after my recovery began I was very weak and tired, and spent most of my time sleeping. I was 41 years old at the time, with health problems including well controlled asthma and being overweight. I never wish to experience this again and I am grateful that I am receiving the Modena vaccine. Thank you so much for logging my side effects.

                                                After receiving my 2nd dose on 1/22, my arm started to feel sore about 4hrs later. Around 1AM on 1/23 I  began to experience chills, and a fever (I took nothing to treat my symptoms at the time.) Around 8AM I my muscles began to ache all over. I still was having the fever and chills. This all continued until noon when I decided to take some NyQuil and apply Bengay. Around 4pm, the fever was broken and my muscles did not ache as they did before, my arm was not as as sore. This was not a fun experience.

                                                12/23/20 - I received my first dose.  Following that dose I had mild soreness in my arm and was just tired, for the next day.  1/21/21 I received my second dose.  This time I had a very sore arm, very sore neck muscles and back, generalized achy body, and tiredness.  Until yesterday 1/28/21 - I woke up early morning 0200 with a severe headache, I took some pain medicine and fell back to sleep, I woke up in the AM unable to function.  I could not keep anything down all day (food or drink).  I had the headache all day.  I emailed my PCP who called me in some medication that helped get rid of the headache and ease the vomiting.

                                                As soon as shot was given I bled badly. They used about 6 square gauze to control the bleeding. The injection was not put into left arm muscle like it was supposed to. Instead it was put into the back of my left arm. I&#39;m not sure it hit my artery or what happened. But now I still have a huge deep purple bruise, and my shoulder hurts and burns and so does my arm around the injection site.  I have been taking pictures to document bruising since date of injection.

Because of sever nausea, I could not eat or drink except small amount of water, but every time I felt stomachache after I drink water. I could not move from bed. The symptom did not change by the end of the day. 2 days after vaccination, fever was gone in the morning. However, I still felt severe fatigue, nausea, and muscle pain in the morning. I could not eat or drink except small amount of water by 5:00 pm. After 5:00 pm, I could drink and eat, and gradually recovered. 3 days after vaccination, I felt slight headache and muscleache, but it was manageable by painkiller.   I took pain killer 2nd day around noon and 3rd day in the morning. Other than painkiller, I didn&#39;t take any treatment.

                                                Shot 1 given Dec 29 in the morning. I had no symptoms. I got very sick at about 4:30pm Symptoms: muscle aches, chills, fever, headache, SOB, chest pain, sore throat, cough. I ended in the ED because I couldn?t manage my asthma and my HR was high on Wed. I was diagnosed with Covid as I found out my husband gave it to me. Then a couple days later my asthma got worse and I ended up in the ED overnight. They were able to get better management in my Asthma.  I was sick for 3 weeks. Went back to work week four 1/25 Monday and 1/27 they cleared me to get the second dosage of the vaccine. I got the vaccine 3:20 pm and at 5:00 I walked my son in Kung Fu and then waited in my car. I ended up passing out in my car at approx 5:15 pm and my 8 year old son knew something was wrong and had to wake me up.  I could barely drive home I felt very drunk. When I got home my temp spikes to 101.3. I had extreme muscle pain, fatigue, chills, sore throat, chest pain, cough, SOB. My left arm swelled up where I was injected and I couldn?t move my arm. I was told I couldn?t take anything tylonel or Ibuprofen for 8 hours. I suffered. Even when I could take something my body was very painful. This lasted  wed, thurs, and Friday morning.

Then my legs started to feel heavy and numb, then my face felt numb and then my arms. I could barely pick something up and I could not stand. Then my jaw started to shake and so did my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was having a shock/panic attack response to the vaccine. On Monday 1/25 I woke up in extreme stomach pain and went back to the ER and they said I needed to have my appendix out. I went to a hospital where they tried to just give me antibiotics, but still had to have my appendix out on Wednesday 1/27.

Upon trying to drink water, she started to feel sick and dry heaved (never vomited) then she said she had problems trying to swallow.  She did not report trouble breathing.  I called 911, they had me ask her a series of questions.  As soon as she said her throat was bothering her again, I administered the EpiPen at 12:10. We also called her emergency contact person.

                                                About 7 hours after receiving my injection I started experiencing neck stiffness and body aches. The following day I had really bad flu symptoms and was unable to do anything except use the restroom (with assistance walking) and sleep. I had a fever between 100 and 102.9 all day, it never broke. I would take Tylenol and it would decrease slightly after a bout of sweats so bad I had to change my clothes (3x). I also experienced chills and extreme fatigue. The 2nd day following injection fever and body aches were gone and I was now experiencing headaches and mental fogginess. This lasted almost the entire day. Once these symptoms cleared (early evening) I started experiencing bouts of dizziness, 2 instances prior to bed and 2 instances so far today.

Chills lasted the entire time the fever lasted.  After the fever came down to below 100, bodyache became more recognizable.  Most unusual pain, which began while the temperature was above 100, was in the muscles connecting my neck to the shoulders, more severely on the left-side where the injection was administered.  The pain was so severe that it felt the muscle was tense, numb and itchy at the same time. The severity of the pain made it feel like the throat was closing up even though I knew it was not true because I did not have trouble breathing.  This pain lasted (in similar intensity) approximately about 36 hours. After this, on the third day, most of the pain was gone but I experienced dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea.  I had a loss of appetite the whole time (over 72 hours) I was experiencing these side effect symptoms.

                                                I felt a little lightheaded after the first shot on 1/28/21, they had me stay an additional 15&#34; and I felt ok. After the 2nd shot on 2/25, I immediately felt a little lightheaded, sat for 15&#34;, when I stood up to leave I felt lightheaded and had to sit down. The staff member got me a cup of juice and some water. I stayed for another 15&#34;, I felt better, a little kind of &#34;flighty&#34; feeling but not like I did when I had to sit. I went home and did ok. I dont think i drank enough fluids that evening. That night around midnight I had chills and could not sleep, muscle aches, headache. Around 8 am when I woke up to go to the bathroom, I felt so lightheaded that I had to lay back down, my temp was 100.4. I drank some water. I got back up to take tylenol and get more to drink. I still felt lightheaded and fatigue, temp was down to 99.6. I drank 3 bottles of water and a gatorade before I needed to urinate. I dont know if the lightheaded feelings were a drop in blood pressure and the more intense lightheadedness the next day after the 2nd shot was a presyncopal episode. I continued to nap and drink fluids until about 2p when I woke up I no longer felt lightheaded and the fatigue was getting better. I still had a headache til that night. I did call Occupational Health to go over my symptoms, they told me to push fluids and rest.  Today I emailed my doctor, PCP to go over things and see if he thinks this was a reaction to the vaccine vs not drinking enough the night before, I am leaning toward a reaction since it made me feel weird right after the shot for both times. As of Saturday 2/27 AM I am feeling more like myself, still drinking alot and resting though.

                                                ~4 hours after receiving the vaccination, my arm was in extreme pain. It was far worse than anything I had experienced from previous vaccines  with known side effects of ?sore arm/punch in the arm discomfort?  That intensity lasted 2 days before it became milder form of sore arm.   The day before the rash appeared (08FEB2021) was 6 days post injection. I was experiencing pain and discomfort in my forearm that gradually followed to the injection site. Shortly after the discomfort feelings reached my injection site I experienced intense itching. The following morning, I woke up to a large rash with a mass forming underneath with heat coming off of the area. The redness of the rash got deeper in color as did the size and the mass underneath and presence of heat. This lasted for  lasted for 5 days and then by the 5th day the rash began to fade slowly and was gone by day 9  of it appearing (18FEB2021)

                                                Onset of leg weakness and instability that has progressively worsened. Constant imbalance noted more in standing and with walking resulting in feeling like I am &#34;rocking on a boat&#34; constantly. Increased sway in static standing that is more pronounced with rotational movements, eyes closed, and decreased base of support. Ataxic movements and lateral veering with walking at times. Episodes of low blood pressure/significant decrease in blood pressure from sitting to standing, tachycardia, and resting tremors in the hands that are intermittent in nature. Feeling of head being &#34;in the clouds&#34; constantly where something is not right.

                                                Got the shot Friday March 5th. Sore arm and muscle aches like the first dose on 2/5. Woke up March 7th with swollen lips/throat/tongue. went to urgent care and received an EpiPen and steroid. Monitored for a couple of hrs and went home for a nap. (refused the ER at this time as I felt better). Woke up around 2:30 and my symptoms worsened . We to ER and received another Epipen for anaphylactic shock. Remained at the hospital for 5 days. Had 5 episodes while there. Also, had tightening in chest and what felt like a heart attack. Been resting, still very tired and swollen nodes in my neck and sore throat as well as aches. Also, might be developing thrush. Didn&#39;t run a fever and Ive never had an allergic reaction  before this.

                                                Shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, muscle soreness / aching.  Shortness of breath was immediate; paramedics called.  Transportation to hospital refused due to lack of health insurance.  Other symptoms began the next evening.  Six days later, as I complete this form, the symptoms have improved.  The fever is gone.  The muscle soreness is gone except in the arm that received the injection.  The shortness of breath has improved.  It was really quite concerning.  It is still present but to a lesser degree.  The fatigue is somewhat better but still very much an issue.  There is no appropriate field below regarding the outcome because after only approximately one week, I am expecting that the remaining issues will resolve.  Since I was not hospitalized and did not die, I will mark &#39;Disability or Permanent Damage&#39; since I definitely can not currently do many of the things I normally do, however, I expect to recover those abilities.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of CHEST PAIN (Chest Pain), CHEST DISCOMFORT (Chest Tightness), LIP SWELLING (Swollen Lips) and ADVERSE REACTION (allergic reaction to the vaccine) in a 41-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 030M20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below. The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event. Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) for an unknown indication. On 06-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 06-Feb-2021, the patient experienced PAIN (Body Aches) and PYREXIA (fever). On 06-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CHILLS (Chills). On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PRURITUS (Itchiness), ERYTHEMA (Redness) and URTICARIA (Hives). On 20-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CHEST PAIN (Chest Pain) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CHEST DISCOMFORT (Chest Tightness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and LIP SWELLING (Swollen Lips) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ADVERSE REACTION (allergic reaction to the vaccine) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized on 20-Mar-2021 due to ADVERSE REACTION, CHEST DISCOMFORT, CHEST PAIN and LIP SWELLING. At the time of the report, CHEST PAIN (Chest Pain), CHEST DISCOMFORT (Chest Tightness), LIP SWELLING (Swollen Lips), PAIN (Body Aches), PRURITUS (Itchiness), ERYTHEMA (Redness), URTICARIA (Hives), ADVERSE REACTION (allergic reaction to the vaccine), PYREXIA (fever) and CHILLS (Chills) outcome was unknown. Following the first dose of the vaccine, the patient experienced fever, chills and body aches that lasted for 24-36 hours and then subsided. Following the second dose of the vaccine, the patient initially experienced the similar side effects of fever, chills and body aches that lasted for a similar time frame. Then, on 15 Mar 2021, the patient began to have full body itchiness. No rash was present, but wherever she would itch would turn red and break out into hives. This continued and then on 20 Mar 2021, the patient was taken to the Emergency Room because she experienced tightness in her chest, chest pains and swelling in her lips. There she was treated for an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Some symptoms have improved but all are still present at the time of the report. Treatment details included Pepcid, Claritin D, Mailax, Prednisone, and Benadryl.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The most severe symptoms so far set in at 3 AM and I won?t be able to work tomorrow.  This is much more intense than COVID-19 was. I don?t plan to get vaccinated again if this is what I have to go through every time.

                                                lymphadenopathy left axilla, induration and pruritus at injection site.  Narrative: Per patient: &#34;So I received the injection in my left arm and now have a itchy, sore knot at the injection site. That&#39;s not the issue. My nodes under my arm are swollen and painful for which I&#39;ve been taking NSAIDs with little relief. &#34;Really noticed it Saturday [1/2/21]. Been using a warm compress which helps a little but not much. Haven&#39;t seen anyone yet.&#34;

The redness started to improve on  1/5/21. On 1/6/21 the redness came back worse. I felt pain and itching at the site. It began welting. By that afternoon it was 3 inches around, dark red, small blister on top of the welting.  I  called my doctor&#39;s office, they had me call the COVID-19 number. The COVID-19 Nurse stated it sounded like a typical reaction. He recommended Benadryl cream and heating pad. Today is 1/8/21. The redness is at 4 plus inches around. Still sore and itchy. I still have some muscle aches and a headache. I haven&#39;t been seen by a doctor, but I may go to urgent care for evaluation.

I began having redness at the injection site on 1/1/21. It measured 1.5 inches around. It began fading on 1/4/21. On 1/6/21, the redness started to come back along with pain and itching at the site. It measured 2 inches. The redness began getting darker in color and welting. I called my doctor&#39;s office. They recommended for me to call the COVID-19 number they had. The COVID-19 Nurse said it sounds like a typical vaccine reaction. He said to use Benadryl cream and a heating pad. Today (1/8/2020) the redness is over 4 inches around, painful, and itchy. It has a small blister on top of the welting. It almost looks like rings of different redness levels. I think I am going to go to urgent care to have it evaluated. I still have some muscle weakness, fatigue, and a headache(3 days.)

                                                This is another reaction I experienced. My  left arm started to be sore again  8 days after vaccination, on 1/7/21 (I originally had sore arm on left the first 3 days of vaccination but then it was recovered).  I also feel there is some weakness on my left arm as well.  I wonder if this is a delayed reaction and if it would be permanent? I previously filed  an report on early adverse events-left arm soreness within an hour of vaccination, then spread  across shoulder, in the middle of night, I woke up with whole body muscle ache that lasted till next morning. The next day of vaccination, I was tired , yawning frequently and very sleepy. I slept for 11 hours on the second night of vaccination which was unusual for me. The sore arm disappeared after about 3 days. But 8 days later it occurs again with some weakness on upper left arm.

Thought maybe covid,  took test and it was negative, so now 7 days post vaccine still chest burning and scapula pain is intermittent. Contact pcp, going for bloodwork and chest xray. Outcomes to be determined. Pcp believes this is a vaccine reaction.

The evening after receiving the shot, I had a rash on my neck and arms that was itchy and I had hives on my face and back.  These subsided after the evening, the itchiness stayed till next day, but then subsided. My arms started to feel bobbly and tender, lots of little bumps under the surface. Around 1/5 I noticed it was red, it started to itch a lot and then it became very firm/solid lump with swelling, and it was very red.  Swelling and solidness has subsided now, but redness is still there, however it&#39;s subsiding.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

I worked out this morning hoping the movement and circulation would improve the pain but no improvement. Unable to lie on R side secondary to arm pain. Developed chills, fever 101.1, muscle aches throughout body, and headache. No nausea or vomiting.  Took ibuprofen to hopefully help the pain and aches. Will take tylenol if the fever persists.

                                                I felt very heavy (especially my limbs) and had a slight headache on Thursday (the day after receiving the vaccine).  This feeling continued into Friday morning when I nearly passed out (blacked out and collapsed for a split second) as I was crouched position for approximately 10 minutes at work.  I felt dizzy and slow moving for the next several hours.  My blood pressure was rated as normal, blood oxygen normal, and pulse slightly low by a nurse on staff who took my vitals after the episode.   My temperature, which had been 97.8 prior to the event that morning (typical for me) was elevated during this time to 100.2 and returned to normal after approximately 4 hours without medication.  I was fatigued, so I slept for approximately 4-5 hours that afternoon and began feeling better the following day (Saturday).

She developed myalgia and other flu-like symptoms and was followed by SOB in the last 24 hours. She also developed some headache and palpitations with heart rate in the 130s so she went to our ER yesterday and was sent home after she was stabilized. Patient however continued feeling poorly and claims pleurisy and pleurisy further worsened associated with dry cough hence the decision to come back to our ER where she presented febrile, tachypneic and tachycardic. Workups done showed mild hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia. respiratory symptoms found to be related to lung nodule. Pt. also noted to have redness, erythema and itching on Right arm, site of vaccination.

Started at noon next day, 1/20 (~23 hrs after receipt) severe headache followed by fatigue, muscle aches, and chills that began around 5pm on 1/20 along with a fever that lasted 16 hours. All symptoms disappeared at 11am on 1/21, approximately 46 hours after vaccination (fever, chills, and body ache lasted ~16 hours as mentioned above).  This came on fast but left just as fast.  Was bedridden the whole time and could not function.  Woke up at 11am in drenched sweat and everything was gone. Crazy!

My left arm was significantly sore all day, pain from my shoulder to elbow and into my armpit/chest.  On Wednesday, Jan 20th, I noticed a red mark, oval in shape, about 4 inches from the injections site that became warm to touch.  During Wednesday and Thursday, the red mark got larger, wrapping around the outside of my arm and slightly swelled.  It is still warm to touch but not as red today (Monday 1/25). I have applied ice to it twice a day for 20 minutes at a time.

                                                The next morning after I had trouble getting up.  I was achy and had a 99.7 fever.  Took tylenol and rested.  A few hours later the symptoms got worse and worse an my body  ached so bad I could barely walk.  The fever elevated as high as 103 during that time.  And I had what felt like pressure on my neck which made my voice sounded really rough.  I had chest pains, rapid HR and SOB  and the symptoms got so bad I went to the ER where I remained for about 8hrs.  While there I started getting a really bad headache which lasted from that Sun after to the end of the week on Friday.   Benedryl, pepcid, tylenol was given.  About 9:30pm I was released with a prescription for the headache and advised to take benedryl.  Once home I noticed my arm was swollen and white in the center.  I got a rash on that arm that carried to my face and was itchy and burning.  I had lymph nodes that devoloped under both arm pits but the side where the injection was given hurt worse than the other. Had to wear the holter monitor for a week d/t the elevated HR which in turn made the healthcare specialist prescribe metroprol to help lower the HR but to date I am still having issues with the rapid HR.

They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

                                                I received my second dose of the moderna vaccine on a Sunday at 10:30 am in my left deltoid.   Symptoms started with chills and swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes around 10:30 that night, and progressed to body aches,  joint pain, muscle pain,  and a low grade fever.   I was unable to sleep due to chills and pain.   The muscle pain would radiate down my arms and legs, and I would sometimes have a pinpoint sharp pain in the bottom of my left foot.  Symptoms persisted the next day, and also included extreme fatigue, nausea, and enlarged and painful axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  The  supraclavicular lymph nodes were large enough to visibly see.   A round rash/redness started around the injection site started on Monday as well.   This also occurred with the first vaccine, but is much larger this time.   Most symptoms had resolved as of Tuesday, except for fatigue and the rash which are still on going.

It started at 2-3 inches and has since gotten smaller but is now starting to feel sore again. After injection I began feeling slight soreness after 14 hours. Next day I had  pain at injection site and arm, I also had muscle soreness, fatigue for 2 days. After the 4th day my arm although still red was no longer sore. The redness/swelling at injection site went down some after the 5th day however it is now (10 days later)itching and sore once again.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0830. My arm felt sore during the day. In the evening (around 1700), I began to feel muscle aches and pain in my joints (wrists, knees, ankles). I also felt fatigue and brain fog. My injection site (L upper arm) was sore, felt hot to touch and was about 5/10 pain-wise.  I took Tylenol 1,000mg PO and rested for the next 24 hours. The muscle aches and joint pain resolved after 24 hours. However, up to 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt extreme fatigue and could not resume my regular level of activity. After 48 hours, I returned to regular activities.

                                                History of Present Illness: is a 42yo female who presents to clinic today for evaluation of redness and swelling that developd since last night on her left arm. She endorses some discomfort extending down the arm and into the hand. Denies itching at this time. She received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine/Moderna 8 days ago. She states that she initially had a slightly sore arm but no other injection site reaction until now. Denies fever, chills, difficulty breathing/swallowing, scratchy sensation of throat. Denies injection site reactions to other immunizations in the past. She has applied ice to the area and Tylenol. She also denies recent injury or break to skin.   Physical Exam: General:  well developed, well nourished, in no acute distress.   Lungs:  clear bilaterally to auscultation.   Heart:  regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.   Msk:  no deformity, normal gait.   Pulses:  pulses normal in all 4 extremities.

Problem # 1:  Other serum reaction due to other serum, initial encounter (ICD-999.59) (ICD10-T80.69xA) Outlined area of erythema. Advised patient to use Benadryl and topical steroid cream such as hydrocortisone or triamcinalone. May continue to use Tylenol or ibuprofen as needed. Per UpToDate, delayed injection site reactions to COVID-19 vaccine should not be treated with systemic corticosteroids given potential to reduce immune response. Advised patient to monitor for spreading erythema, fever, &#34;scratchy&#34; sensation to throat and present to ED if she experiences difficulty breathing or swallowing.  Patient Instructions: 1)  Area marked - watch for spreading of redness outside of marked lines. 2)  Use Benadryl as needed. 3)  Apply topical cream such as hydrocortisone or triamcinalone.  4)  Advise having second COVID vaccine dose in opposite arm. 5)  Monitor for fever, difficulty breathing/swallowing, worsening redness, pain at site. If having difficulty breathing/swelling go to nearest ER.  6)  Patient to call if any questions.

On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I felt so sick, my headache was horrible and I returned to the hospital to get tested. Negative. 7 days later I am still sick and then I decided to go back to get tested again and it was positive.  The symptoms lasted about 2 weeks, lost sense of smell and headache. Really bad headache.

                                                Red spot about the size of quarter at injection site, itchy,   Appeared about a week after shot.  Lasted a few days, benadryl helped.    Also had soreness under my arm,  felt like a sore muscle or something.    Started same time as red spot did and lasted only about a week.     Not too painful and caused no issues with working or exercising or anything.   Very mild discomfort.     Went away on it own,  only took Benadryl because it was sort of like a reaction I used to get when I took allergy shots so I knew Benadryl would help.

                                                Woke up early in the am on 2/13/21 with extreme chills, muscle aches, and joint pain. Did not check temperature at that time but took 800 mg of Advil due to the severity of the symptoms and went back to sleep. Woke up from nightmares x 2 throughout the night that I was being physically hurt. When I woke up I was crying and realized both times I was still having muscle and joint pain. Finally got up around 1100 in pain still. Calves, thighs, deltoids, triceps bilaterally had severe aching and soreness. Joints hurt generalized. Even my fingers on both hands hurt. I took 800 mg of Advil and 2 Tylenol 500 mg. After about an hour and a half went by and I finally felt my pain ease up, I did check my temp. It was 100.9 after the med dosing. I kept having to continue to take these meds throughout the day and slept the whole day. I did not get up until about 5 pm. Then went back to sleep at around 1100 pm. The next day, on 2/14/21, I seemed better but toward the end of the day I got a sore throat. The following day, on 2/15/21, I was very fatigued throughout the day. I did not feel better until 2/16/21.

                                                The morning after the shot, I had flu-like symptoms including body aches, chills, nausea and pain at the injection site.  By the afternoon, I had a pounding headache and was exhausted.  I got into bed at around 5pm and slept all the way through until Friday morning.  By Friday morning, the symptoms had improved and by Friday afternoon I felt back to my normal self.  On Sunday, I began to have pain in my armpit on my left arm where I received the injection.  The pain under my armpit lasted almost a week, feeling unnoticeable for the first time today (Sunday).

                                                Starting on Sunday Feb 28th I was very fatigued. I woke up on Monday after sleeping more than 12 hours with my head feeling tight and hot. My eyelids were burning, the skin around my neck felt irritated and my lymph nodes in my neck were swollen. The burning in my eyelids and neck pain went away by Monday evening. However on Tuesday I woke up with a visible rash on my neck. In the last few days it has stayed even though I have applied cortisone and neosporin on it. It is now warm to the touch and itchy. I also have a rash on my eyelids and my cheek which are hard to see in pictures because of my skin tone. I called my Primary for a virtual consult when I woke up this morning Saturday March 6 because I am feeling itchy all over especially on my back. Additionally, the skin of my elbows and knees (in the joint crease area) are now super warm like my eyelids were before the rash appeared. I also have neck pain again which started yesterday (March 5th) afternoon. It is not a muscular pain. It starts at the base of neck and radiates up to the crown of my head. It has not gone away with either Tylenol or Advil. My chest is also tight--not my lungs but my chest itself.

                                                It began with severe diarrhea and arm soreness, then came the extreme chills &amp; fever (101F) and the worst body ache of my life. Then my arm and armpit and back and breast on the left side began to swell and swell and swell until I couldn&#39;t keep my my arm down because it hurts my armpit but I also could not lift is because of the pain my shoulder and armpit and breast are all very swollen and red and hot. The fever and swelling are now working it&#39;s way down my torso and hip and leg and foot all on the left side. On Wed 4/21 I went to  Urgent Care and was tested for uti or kidney infection the result had blood in urine but as I am menstruating it was inconclusive. I had been give Ciprofloxacin to take Monday evening by a tele doc. Urgent Care ordered Prednisone 20mg 2 pills daily but the swelling keeps spreading. I have also been breaking out in sweats even just walking to the bathroom and am experiencing tiredness and severe loss of appetite and have lost 4 pound since 4/20 despite the swelling.

                                                I started with fatigue on 12/24/20 and on 12/25/20 developed fatigue and chills (could not get warm). On 12/25/20 I was walking downstairs when my husband felt I didn&#39;t look normal. I fell off the bottom two stairs sustaining injury to both feet. I was able to get myself up to standing position and then sat down. My husband reports that a few minutes later I had what he described was seizure activity for about one minute/stopped breathing and he called 911. Due to COVID visitor restrictions my husband was not allowed to go to the ER with me the night of the incident.  I had full work-up with labs, EKG and head CT that were unremarkable  at Medical Center.  I had an appointment with my primary care physician on 12/28/20 and was referred to neurologist. He did an exam, ordered MRI and sleep deprived EEG. My MRI was completed and reported as no abnormalities. I have the sleep deprived EEG  scheduled on 1/11/21. I have continued pain/physical therapy on both feet/ankles from the date of the incident.

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

Pain and swelling moved down into armpit and below followed by extreme itching.  Swelling and pain then moved down to left elbow. Then I developed throat itching, difficulty swallowing and wheezing. I also developed joint pain in opposite shoulder. I  immediately took 600 mg Ibuprofen and 50 mg Benadryl .  Itching, redness, and wheezing, and difficulty swallowing resolved about 30 minutes after taking the medication.  Next morning (today) I still have pain and swelling around injection site. Pain in left elbow and right shoulder joints. I still have moderate pain and edema below left armpit.

                                                Felt a burning sensation in my hands right after getting the shot.  Went home,  took 2  Aleve and iced my arm for 5 minutes at a time on and off about 4 times.  Hours later,  about 8 pm I was laying down on the couch on my left side for at least 20 minutes.  When I was getting up my upper left arm was very numb and I had a strange sensation on my left side like my blood had pooled over there but it was very numb in the area.  I never have felt anything like that.  The sensation did go away over the course of a few minutes.  Soon after I was having shooting pain in my hands.  It felt like arthritis pain.  This did not last too long but came back here and there.  My lower back started hurting a little bit out of nowhere.  And then when I went to bed I started having random body aches all over.  Like brief shooting pain in different parts of my body.  I did have some dryness, weird sensation in my throat at times. The body aches kept me up until 2 or 3 am.  It was resolved by the time I woke.  I never felt that I had a temperature.  And I was not sick prior so I felt it was a cause and effect from the vaccine.  I took 2 Aleve and I went to work.  Temperature checked at work and I was 97.1,  normal.  Wore a mask all day,  social distanced at work and I had mentioned to my manager upon arrival that I had symptoms/reaction? after my shot.  I did still have some residual,  arthritis type pain in my hands during the day and more so when I got home.  I also felt fatigued when I got home from work but I was half awake most of the night before due to the body aches.  Felt pretty good,  normal on the second day after the vaccine.

                                                24 hours after vaccination I had tingling and numbness on right side of face, heavy eyelids, &#34;pulling sensation&#34; in neck. Unable to lay flat.  Tingling and numbness would switch from right side to entire face but mostly on right side.  Headaches and noticed increased heart rate two days after vaccine. One week after vaccine numbness and weakness extended down right arm and leg, able to move leg just felt &#34;weak&#34;.  I thought I was having a stroke or TIA. Made an appt. with the NP and she did full neuro exam and everything came back normal.  Also, made an appt. with my PCP.  Still continued to have headaches and weakness improved. Did get a COVID test since was still having headaches and it so long since vaccine, received test 1/12/2021 and it was negative. This past weekend was the 1st time I felt &#34;pre vaccine&#34; 17 days post vaccination. I am truly hesitant to take my 2nd dose scheduled on 1/26/2021.

                                                Sunday, six days after I received the vaccine, my left arm began hurting a lot. On Monday morning, 7 days after the vaccine, I had swollen, a large  painful palpable bump near the anterior part of my armpit. The bump could easily be visualized. The pain was moderate and did affect my activity of daily living. The discomfort could be felt at rest, and took about 5 days to improve. Three and a half weeks later I can still palpate the bump. I am not getting the second vaccine. I did have a mammogram two months ago, which was normal. If the bump does not go away within the next two weeks I will go see my primary care physician.

                                                at 15 mins post injection started to get extremely hot from Right side to left. Then like half of my body was cut head to toe in half and the left side of my body went numb and tingly. I could barely move my extremeties. Tounge began to burn like a 9volt battery was being held on it. I was taken to the ER and was told I had a rash on my chest neck and chin. I was treated with Epi IM, Benedryl, famotdine, then had epi again because my tounge felt fat and like a 9volt battery again. Epi went IV second does and had extreme pain with that. Had IV tylenol . Along with IV fluids. For the next 5 days I have had pain in my right harm , shoulder , neck into my head to the tip of my nose. The first 4 days were so bad that I could barely move and would get nauseated and throw up if I moved just right. each day the pains in my right arm,shoulder, neck and head did get better by about 25 percent each day. You could feel it getting better with each day I woke up.  I was also having ear pain that seemed to be worse on 1/19/21. A PA checked my ears and said they were clear.Today, 1/22/21 is the first day I have been able to turn my head without being so sore and feeling nauseated. I was also very fatigued until today, 1/22/21. My hips and lower body are sore today and upper body seems to be less sore by 75%. I still am numb at times in my feet and fingers but can turn my head a lot better today.

                                                &#34;I received my first shot and had only a little arm discomfort. I received my second Moderna shot Friday (1/22) at 1:50 PM. Approximately 8 hours later I suddenly became very tired. I could barely manage to get out of bed at 2 PM on Saturday to take my temperature. My temperature was 102.3 (I?m normally around 97.4 per my morning COVID symptom checks 2x/week). I had aches, chills, joint pain, extreme fatigue, and injection site pain, redness and bruising. I was so out of it that I am not sure I would have been able to navigate taking a fever reducer, eating food, and other basics. My partner assisted me with these things. The first round of Tylenol on Sunday eventually got me to 99.5 or 8 or some such. I continued to take Tylenol throughout Saturday and Sunday. Sunday I woke feeling fatigued and out of it, but definitely on the mend. Sunday late afternoon/ early eve, even more like myself. Today (Monday 1/25) generally back to normal&#34;

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine at my workplace at 10:12am on 1/14/21 and waited the 20 minute observation period with no problems. I returned to my work station and noted a &#34;typical&#34; sore arm and slight fatigue. Appx. 5-6 hours later, the soreness increased significantly and was very uncomfortable. Tylenol 1300mg helped me fall asleep that night. The second day, the pain continued at the deltoid muscle and I was unable to raise my arm more than 90 degrees. The pain interrupted my ability to go about my daily activities or perform my job duties. That second night, the pain was debilitating to the point of crying and Tylenol was not helping. The third day, the severe arm pain continued and I was still in tears. I could not even raise my left arm to the level of my wait. I switched to ibuprofen with moderate success.   By the fourth day, 1/18, the pain had rescinded. I had little to no pain for the next four days (1/19/21 to 1/23/21). On Saturday, 1/23, I noticed my left arm was becoming sore again. Over the past three days, the soreness and pain have returned and have limited my ability to use my left arm. The arm pain disrupts my ability to get a good night&#39;s sleep as there is no position of comfort. When not moving, my left shoulder feels sore and uncomfortable. When moving my left arm, I feel pain when moving it in certain motions/directions. My range of motion is reduced and this along with the pain is disrupting my ability to drive my car, reach for objects and take a shower.   Because it has now been 12 days since my vaccine, I went to urgent care for help this morning. Because the pain left and then returned again, the physician determined that my mechanism of injury is not mechanical in nature, but most likely related to inflammation caused by the vaccine. She prescribed me an anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxers, and home physical therapy exercises to see if we can improve my condition. She also recommended me to file this report with VAERS.

I had a sudden urge to cry when this happened that lasted for 30 seconds.  I was not anxious or nervous to take the vaccine but my body may have overreacted to the sensation of my arms but it didn&#39;t feel like a panic attack that I had a few in my earlier 20s after the birth of my child and undiagnosed thyroid disorder.

                                                I got after the first dose what some people are to experience after their second dose.  This could be because I had Covid in November and probably have circulating antibodies already.  My right arm had 10/10 pain starting around midnight waking me up and was persistent with any movement which extended up into my neck and down to my elbow area.  Ibuprofen and tylenol did not help with the pain. Currently on post-vaccine day 3 I still am unable to get full ROM to my right arm due to pain but it is better than yesterday.  Other symptoms I had was the fevers, chills, headache, extreme hypersensitivity to my skin, and bone pain with movement especially to my hips and back with walking which seems to be subsiding.  whole body aches/pain which seems to be subsiding as well.  What I don&#39;t see mentioned in a lot of the expected side effects is TINNITUS.  I am experiencing moderate tinnitus.  I have experienced this previously in my 20&#39;s when taking a full dose of aspirin and I avoid aspirin products because of that.  I did not see anywhere that there is aspirin products in these injections.  It has not subsided yet at this time and I am wanting to report this.  Not sure if others are experiencing this as well.

                                                The first shot I received on December 28th.  I have fatigue and a headache for about three days and my arm did hurt for close to 2 1/2 weeks,  the second week it was red, 3 inches in diameter, raised, also it itched very badly for 4-5 days.                I received the second maderna vaccine on 1/28/21 about 5:45 pm. I had noted about 8 pm mild burning to the lower part of my legs and bottom of my feet that evening.  Later I started to have mild nausea about 9 pm, but it resolved, and I went to bed.  I woke up about 3:11 with diarrhea and my body and mainly &#34;my skin&#34; started to hurt, as if someone was taking a wire brush to my legs, and slowly pulling out each hair, but at one time. After another hour or so, I started to have severe chills with increased nausea and more severe severe body/bone/joint pains. I took Tylenol at this time. I noted that the bottom of my ribs or rib cage hurt with breathing, also I had upper abdominal pain, severe lower back pain and a headache. The next morning I stayed in bed all day and took a few baths, I had multiple episodes of diarrhea. I was nauseated, but no vomiting.  I still had chills, bodily shaking, fatigue, muscle and joint pain.  I tried to sleep off and on through the day.  That evening I did have a temperature of 101.4 with using Tylenol and Motrin.  It did come down later that evening, but I still had severe pain of my body and my skin hurt, even the hair on my head, during the night about 2:45 am I took a bath and that did help with my body.  on Saturday evening I was able to start getting up and moving around, but a severe decreased appetite. I&#39;ve noted a drastic change in taste since having the vaccine and have lost 9 lbs in the past week.  I am able to taste, but everything has a different taste.  I have had two covid tests PCR&#39;s in order to return to work.  I also have had the continued bilateral leg burning from the calves to the bottom of my feet.  The sensation is if you are cold outside and come back in and run your hands or feet under warm water to warm them up and that pain you feel when they warm up is how they feel, but on a milder level than that pain.  I also have had post nasal drip that has started in past 5 days and while at work in the ER on Tuesday I had a PA look at my ears and I had a large amount of fluid behind both ears.  I had a zpack that I had at the pharmacy that I had refilled and have taken that for the past four days with some relief.  I still feel fluid in my ears, but mildly better.  The headache and fatigue is getting better each day.  My appetite is still very diminished as well as how things taste in my mouth, it is way different than anything I have ever experienced before.  I also had an Issue on Monday 2/1/21 when I was working, I felt in my brain, as if it was just not as sharp, cloudy. I had an issue with typing on my right hand for a few hours (upper row on rt side) that has since resolved, but it was a truly &#34;off&#34; day.  It has taken me this entire week to start to feel even a bit more back to human.  So what remains- the bilateral leg to bottom of feet weird burning sensation, decreased appetite,  taste alterations, post nasal congestion with bilateral fluid in ears, shortness of breath with activity, mild burning in lungs with activity (working out/running in the cold weather).           this was just a side note that was copied to the bottom.       I was unable to touch my arm right arm due to swelling and pain for about three day, which I know is to be expected and actually wasn&#39;t as sore as long as the first shot.  I did take a few doses of Motrin 800mg but tried to stay with Tylenol and Zofran, and hydrate.              I noted that warm baths helped the most and the use of a heating pad on my lower back and an ice pack on and off my head for the headaches.   Thank you

                                                Moderns COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Upon injection, the site was very sore for 3 days with fever chills and then went away. On day 11 i developed covid arm with a large circular welt that was itchy and extremely hot. On day twelve until still today I have a slight rash with extreme itching, sore muscles, sore joints (all my joints), and fever/chills.

But worst is inability to lift left arm, severe left arm pain, even joint pain in left wrist. Could barely lift L arm on day 2 after (Sunday) and again unable to lift it day 3 after (Monday).  First dose, I had arm pain, trouble lifting it 1 day, pain for a week and mild soreness for the whole month. Pre-existing joint pains from autoimmune were worse for a week, but this second dose - it only seems to be vaccine side, including left jaw, left eye pain, left collarbone pain near a previously affected injury.

The next day, muscle aches &amp; chills continued, and were joined by exhaustion, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, migraines, chest congestion (for one day).  The symptoms continued to worsen each day, and on 2/09, I vomited and went to the clinic.  I tested negative for Covid-19, (both the rapid and 3 day tests), negative for the flu, negative for strep.  I started taking Excedrin for the migraines, and it helped, but prior to that, no medicine was working.  I continued to rest and take Excedrin.  Daily symptoms continued to include:  migraine, fatigue, chills &amp; aches, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, could only warm drinks &amp; bland food.  Also nausea, short of breath.  These symptoms continued to slowly improve, but I had them through 2/19.

When I woke up the next morning, the site was raised and swollen more than the night before. It had the appearance of cellulitis. It was still hot to the touch. I marked the edges of the rash and it progressively got bigger over the course of 48 hours. I still have a mark on my arm where the rash was. I also had severe jaw and neck pain. I felt like my wisdom teeth were pulled with no lidocaine.  I has boughts of nausea and was very tired. I tried to put ice on the area of my arm that was swollen, but it did not help.

Tylenol and ibuprofen did not touch back/shoulder pain or headache . I was very tired. Tuesday same thing horrible headache and arm soreness, yet not as bad for back pain. Didn?t go to work. Wednesday tried to go to work but had diarrhea horribly and a headache, ended up leaving only a few hours of being there. Thursday , called in sick again with a horrible headache. Called family physician to be checked. 3 and 1/2 days off work. Dr. Decided to treat it as a migraine, prescribed me medicine and headache has been gone since. It is late Thursday night, 25th. Also my blood pressure was high when I went in, usually 120/80 and today it was 144 or 140 over 80

The next day my arm remained sore and I could feel a bump and see redness at injection site.  It was sightly  itchy and I also had some neck pain and aches.   The third day my arm wasn?t sore to move only to touch.   The bump remained.  It was not as itchy. Day four no pain at all really. No aches or pains.  Felt normal.  On the 7th day post injection my arm became itchy again and red and warm to the touch and now feels like there are two small bumps.  My nurse friend it might be ?Covid Arm?.  I have asthma and allergies so am taking benedryl but from what I read this is harmless.

I had on fleece pjs and three blankets laying in front of fireplace and could not get warm.  Headache out of this world.  Every joint in my body hurt.  My ankles were so swollen I could barely walk.  I missed three days of work.  3/4/21 2nd dose of Moderna.  Same as above only joint pain was much worse.  Chills and then breaking out in sweats.  I?ve missed two days of work as of now with this shot.  It?s really wiped me out.  I haven?t been able to eat or sleep much because I hurt so bad.  My knees, ankles, and neck seem to be the worst.  I?ve never experienced joint pain as bad as these two times.  I could barely walk to the bathroom.

                                                Received vaccine on 3/3/21 at 2:30pm. Waited for 20 minutes at pharmacy for allergic reaction. Given the all clear, so headed home. Around 5pm, I started noticing how extremely sore my left arm was, almost as if somebody had hit it with a baseball bat (no bruising, redness, etc., just VERY sore). I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it&#39;s as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn&#39;t then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger. I am EXTREMELY concerned about the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger as it does not seem to be getting better.

                                                Have had tiredness since 2nd vaccine in February and noticed shortness of breath when walking or going up stairs in mid March.  Around 4/1, I started having left rib pain preventing me from sleeping on my left side and then could not breath during a massage on 4/8.   On April 9th, I was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms (clots) in both lungs, reducing my lung capacity to only 30% of normal.  This could be due to Loestrin birth control but I have taken hormones in the past for IVF and when younger for birth control.  The reaction may be due to a combination of vaccine, Loestrin and iron but triggered by vaccine.  I am currently on Eliquis to treat pulmonary embolisms.

                                                9 days after the injection itchiness started on my left upper arm.  After several scratches to alleviate the itchiness I checked the site &amp; noticed that where the vaccine was administered was red &amp; warm to the touch.  It progressively started getting more itchy.  Then the muscle soreness started.  It felt as if I just had the injection.

                                                On Jan 7, I experienced discomfort in left upper arm.  A new area is 3 x 4 cm, erythematous, indurated at the site of injection.  Also, new macular rash on anterior chest wall with pruritis.  No fevers or chills.  I took loratadine 10 mg daily with resolution of rash on anterior chest wall.  Injection site reaction remains.

                                                The day after I received vaccine I had severe arm pain at injection site, my body was achy , and fatigue. These symptoms resolved after a few days . I then had dizziness, nausea, unbalanced when walking, chest pain, feeling like my heart was racing,  palpatations, muscle weakness in my legs, and brain fog. The unbalanced feeling, dizziness, weakness ,and occasional palpatations remain. I had a covid test done on 1/6/2021.I had sinus pain started on 1/8/2021. I am being treated for possible sinus infection with Augmentin that I started on 1/11/2021 but my symptoms are still present . I have been unable to work because when I walk I feel dizzy and unsteady.  I have follow up with my primary doctor on 1/18/2021.

The hard red area has increased in size to about 2? diameter over 2 days.  Called PCP approximately 8 days after injection to see if symptoms warranted a visit - PCP advised that it was a common adverse reaction to the vaccine and recommended a hot compress if needed. Improvement seen approximately 9 days after, with almost complete resolution 14 days after receiving the vaccine.

                                                *15 mins. after receiving the shot - short spell of dizziness and a small headache. Lasted approximately 15 minutes. *Within 30 mins. after receiving shot - cold chills/burning up. Lasted off and on throughout the night. Used Tylenol to help. Never registered a fever though.  *Within 30 mins. after receiving the shot - soreness in arm of shot from elbow to shoulder. Lasted 2 days. By end of 2nd day only a space of 3 inches tall on arm  located around the shot area was sore. *The morning after the shot - diarrhea. Lasted almost 2 days. Anything eaten went straight through. Still loose, but pasty now on day 3 morning. *Right after shot through day 2 - arms felt heavy and weak. *Day 2 and 3 - itching. Started light and only on arm of shot. Then by middle of morning on day 2, whole body itched and stayed that way through day 3. Only occasional itching on day 4. *Day 2 and 3 - Cheeks down to chin would break out in red blotches then fade away. It would resurface again every so often. By day 4 only cheeks would get lightly rosy. *Day 3 and 4 - Nauseous. Forced self to eat, but stomach was very uneasy and felt pressure (like you would throw up ) under chin. *Day 4 - Woke up extremely fatigued and weak. Lessened as day progressed, but still a feeling of tiredness and weakness.

Day 7 some let arm swelling and heat at the injection site appear.  Contacted my primary care and was informed what to look for and if it gets worse contact again or if it last more than 2 weeks post vaccine.

The pain increased gradually and by Friday the lymph nodes in my left axilla were visible swollen and quite tender.  On Saturday morning 1/16/21 I had a faint red rash at site of injection.   By Saturday evening the rash was raised and more red.   I felt extremely fatigued on Saturday and Sunday.   On Sunday morning 1/17/21 rash was still quite red but no longer raised.  The rash was less red and less tender on Monday 1/18/21.  Rash barely visible on Tuesday 1/19/21.  Swelling in axilla has decreased since Saturday 1/16/21 but is still visible but to a much lesser degree than Friday/Saturday.

Was put on 40mg of prednisone by allergist to prevent a reaction since 1/21/21 because of reaction to first dose of the vaccine.

They&#39;re all mobile.No other symptoms to speak of.  No fever, no sore throat, no redness/swelling anywhere. Some mild baseline tiredness. I had some soreness in upper arm the first few days after the vaccine , some vague right shoulder/upper back pain last weekend that I attributed to muscle strain from overuse. I noted the 2 larger 1cm lymph nodes by mid-right clavicle 4 days ago, and the 2 smaller 0.5cm right sided lower cervical chain LNs 2 days ago.

Around 3 a.m. woke with a massive headache, chills and sweats, joint and muscle pain. Went to the kitchen for a glass of water and to take Ibuprofen but almost blacked out. Sat on the floor and placed forehead on cold tiles because of sweats and nausea. Crawled to the couch and remained there until 8 a.m. Moved to bed. In and out of sleep with mild chills and sweats the rest of the day.

I took 800 mg of Ibuprofen and I needed to take it every four hours and when I treated with this it was bearable. I did it for about 4 days or so and it began to get better. Took medicine (Ibuprofen) a week though until it was better and not painful. Slowly went away. Dr was consulted for the treatment with the ibuprofen and heating pad.

                                                At 2am I woke up with chills and body aches. My muscles felt very tight so I took some baclofen and Tylenol and tried to sleep. I woke again several more times, but at 7am I experienced severe pain all over my body. It felt especially bad in my hands/forearms and feet/calves. I felt as if my nerves were being peeled back. I had severe spasticity and some weakness. I normally walk with crutches outside and no crutches inside. I could no longer walk and had my family get my old wheelchair out for me. I had problems dorsiflexing. I had noticeable weakness in my core, quads, and glutes. My hands were weak and clumsy and while I could move my fingers had trouble grasping things. I was unable to raise my arms overhead completely, even on the side I didn?t get the shot. I did take tizanidine for spasticity and Tylenol though the day. My mother is a Pt and she came by to mobilize my shoulder. Because it started to improve  over several hours I did not go to the ER. Strength in my ankles is retuning. I can walk better, although I still have quite a weak and spastic gait and am continuing to use my wheelchair so I don?t injure myself. The pain improved significantly. I am still having some weakness in my core, which I notice if I try to sit on a couch or roll over in bed.

My throat did not close, but it clenched or got tight and my tongue seemed to tense.  Before I had time to think about that, I had a surge of adrenaline which left me a bit startled.  The tongue and throat tightening happened without an adrenaline surge approximately 4 more times.  I lost feeling in my left arm and felt lightheaded.  This lasted about 30 minutes, after which I felt fine.  I experienced sharp stabbing pains in hands, feet, pelvis and fingers, which are still present 48 hours later.  At 24 hours post-vaccine, I felt chills and developed muscle aches and a low fever, which are still present at 48 hours post-vaccine.

On Friday Jan 22 I started feeling unwell and had body aches. By Friday night I became very cold to where my body was shaking. My joints and muscles ached and I became very weak. Saturday Jan 23rd I spiked a fever to 101.7. I took Tylenol to help control the body aches and help bring down the fever. I got little relief. I continued to run a temp all day on Saturday, had body aches, joint and muscle pain. I also became very nauseated and lethargic. I had headaches the entire time

This morning most of the joint pain has subsided except in my feet and ankles. It was painful to wear shoes and very painful to walk. The balls of my feet were the worst. Through the day my right ankle has swollen that I have fluid on the front of my ankle that is  painful to touch. Both are very painful but especially the right.  I came home and have kept my feet elevated and it is throbbing and still swollen. My left hand joints are very painful to bend the fingers and throbbing. I have taken Motrin through the day there had been no relief.

The next day I experienced fever 100.5, body aches, joint pain, chills, and cough so I went and had a rapid covid and flu test performed and both were negative. Family doctor suggested the two day covid test and the results were negative on Friday. If I don&#39;t have covid then are they side affects from vaccine.

                                                At first I was feeling dizzy, then the back of my throat felt itchy. EMS came over, and took my temperature, which was 98 degrees. Then I started to feel compression and pain in my ribs on both sides, and the middle of my chest - like an elephant was sitting on it, or I had a corset wrapped too tightly around my diaphragm. Then I started having uncontrollable coughing fits, followed by wheezing. EMS got me some ice packs for my ribs and the middle of my chest, but I had to get up and use the bathroom.  When I get anaphylaxis, I usually take two aspirin, a benadryl, a cetirizine, a CBD capsule, a famotidine, a 20 mg steroid pill, and a hydroxyzine pill - all at once. EMS agreed I should take it, and they gave me a shot of epinephrine in the arm. then they loaded me on to the ambulance, where I got a shot of steroid, and we went to the hospital in. EMS also started an IV for me. At the hospital, they gave me another shot of EpiPen, over 20 minutes after the first one, and a shot of Benadryl. by the end of 2 hours, my breathing was back to normal, and I was able to go home. Today I still feel a little bit dizzy, but mostly my arm is sore where I got the vaccination. I also still have a headache.

                                                I had very mild pain in arm at injection site. On the 8th day after the shot, however, I hard a hard, red swollen area at the injection site, a small but hard swollen lump at the base of my neck and left arm, pains and aches throughout my body (especially lower abdomen, sides, and lower back,  a fever of 100  degrees that night which went away the next day, fatigue, and light nausea. It has been a little over 24 hrs now and all but the fever continue. This was unexpected as these side effects were all delayed rather than occurring immediately after the shot. There is a small likelihood this is all something else but it&#39;s doubtful.

                                                Approximately six days following the first vaccine, I started having pain in my armpit area. The lymphnode did not necessarily appear swollen, but it was painful to the touch for three to four days. Approximately nine days following the vaccine, I developed a rash on my arm where the vaccine was administered (it looked red and blotchy), and it was warm to the touch. The rash is still present, and it has been eleven days since my initial vaccine.

By the next morning, the hives and degree of &#34;itchy&#34; factor had covered most of patient&#39;s torso. Hives continued to spread throughout the day, at a much more rapid pace, also increasing in frequency over the entire body, onto face and slightly past knees and onto shins and ankles. Feet and fingers remained clear. Patient saw primary care doctor the afternoon of Feb 3 and took first dose of oral steroids at approximately 3:30pm. * Symptoms patient did not recognize as being related to eventual outbreak began as soon as two days after vaccine: intense soreness deep in left armpit and both ears were itching in a frequent basis * The hives cover more than 80% of patient&#39;s torso, some portions are completely red. There are pictures of this breakout. The only thing different in patient&#39;s routine in the last month is the Covid-19 vaccine.

                                                1/28- Moderna vaccine to left deltoid approximately 1000 AM. Felt fine the rest of the day. Very tired in the evening and went to sleep early. Took PM medications- Xyzal 1 tab PO HS, Xanax 0.5 mg PO HS. 1/29-Woke to Left arm was sore, felt like I had received TDap injection, like I was punched in the arm- localized to Deltoid.  Took AM medications as normal- Wellbutrin XL 150 mg QD, Effexor 75 mg QD, B12 SL, Multivitamins QD As the day progressed, left arm soreness and discomfort became more pronounced and then went from localized to circumferential to left arm. Also noted discomfort and soreness to left axilla and soreness to left lateral/posterior cervical neck area. Became increasingly tired, weak, left arm was weaker than right arm with grip.  Headache was pounding and predominantly bilateral temporally.  Decreased appetite. Non productive cough.  Mid day, started to have freezing bilateral upper and lower extremities. Applied wool socks and clothing layers to accommodate. Temperature to forehead was 99.0, Right ear 101.4 and Left ear 102.0. Pulse ox 97% on room air. Took 1 gram APAP prophylactically, also took Zicam SL. Tolerated as much PO fluids as possible, water.  Increased flu like signs and symptoms for the rest of the day, no actual fever recorded. Literally had on thermals, top and bottoms. 2 pair of wool socks, gloves, and a hoodie. Wrapped in bed with 2 blankets.  Through the night, had discarded all clothing and remained in shirt and had sheet covering. Difficult night sleeping with the soreness to left arm and left axilla, was not able to get comfortable.  1/30- Woke, still, felt signs and symptoms of flu, body aches, pains, weak, tired, and decreased appetite.  A noticeable audible wheeze, shortness of breath with minimal exertion, and persistent dry cough. Cough remained non-productive.  All other signs and symptoms from the day before remained and the soreness to the left upper arm, left axilla, and left neck. Flu like signs and symptoms were just as intense as day before. Chills were consistently inconsistent with start and end, noticeable bilateral hands and feet were freezing. Afebrile, pulse ox 97% room air . Continued to treat prophylactically with APAP and Zicam, po fluids, rest.  1/31- Difficult night sleeping again related to discomfort to left side of upper torso. Felt a little better concerning weakness and being tired. Headache subsided some from it?s intensity. Started to have stomach discomfort, diarrhea, and remained short of breath with minimal exertion. Felt as if I was not able to expand my lungs to their full capacity, thus yawned a lot and had to continue to try to expand lungs. Continued to have flu signs and symptoms (not as intense as past 2 days), diarrhea STARTED, and feeling tired continued. Shortness of breath decreased in severity and lungs continued to feel a decline in expansion with inhalation. Continued to treat prophylactically and rest. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/1- Difficult night sleeping related to left upper torso soreness and discomfort. Diarrhea continued into this day. No nausea. Tolerating PO fluids; however, feeling weak and tired.  Left upper arm soreness and discomfort less than initial onset. Left axilla remained sore and left side of neck. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/2- Diarrhea subsided, flu signs and symptoms continued to decrease in initial intensity. Shortness of breath not as extreme; however, continued to feel as if not able to expand lungs to full capacity. Left upper arm soreness and discomfort almost resolved, left axilla beginning to decrease in soreness along with left side of neck. Only prominent s/s is feeling tired and inability to expand lungs to full capacity. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile. 2/3- Feeling 95% better, closer to baseline. Worst days were the first 2 after the injection; however, still remain unable to expand lung capacity to full expansion with inhaling, thus requiring multiple attempts and yawning. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile 2/4- 99% to baseline and feeling better, continue to have decreased expansion of lung capacity. Pulse ox 99% room air. Afebrile

Day 3, felt fine. I could lift arm without any issues.  Day 4 to 5, started feeling the worse kind of fatigue, mild headache, all over body ache like my actual joints hurt and head feels pressure like it is in a fog.  I have a stuffy nose.  It is now February 5th and I still feel this way.  Everyone else I talked to had  just a sore arm and recovered within a day or two.  This is my 1st shot and I go back on February 26th for second shot.  I was asked by pharmacist that administered vaccine to report any side effects since this is a new vaccine.

                                                Approx. 14 hours after receiving the 1st part of Covid vaccine my arm became so sore I couldn&#39;t move it. It was sore from my neck down to just below my elbow. I began having chills and a low grade temp shortly after that. by 0130, I was dizzy, experiencing diarrhea, with episodes of diaphoresis, and acute nausea. I felt that I had some postural hypotension, was very pale and every time I would get up to walk I felt like I was going to end up on the ground. I remained in bed for approx. 16 hours before I felt like I comfortable even getting up and going to restroom. I still have intermittent dizziness, with syncope to this date.  I had to leave work early as well as calling in sick for the next shift.

                                                8 days after the vaccine, I developed a blotchy red rash that trailed down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was red, swollen and painful to touch. Mild itchiness noted on that arm. Otherwise, I was fine. Just seemed strange so long after the vaccination. It improved without intervention and was gone within 2-3 days. I did not seek professional help because I read that this reaction was noted with the Moderna vaccine and that it was just considered a mounting immune response and no cause for concern.  However, I still thought I should report it. I have since received the second dose of vaccine on 2/19/21. I had moderate side effects starting on 2/20/21 (lasting 15 hours) of fatigue, chills, body aches, joint pain, headache, generalized body swelling, swelling and pain at injection site and brain fog. I didn?t experience a rash (yet- the vaccine was only 3 days ago). Will update if that changes.

On 2/21 around 9:00am I had a fever of 101F and was very achy, tired and had a mild headache. At 7:00pm on 2/21 I had a fever of 101F and was still achy and had a headache. I took two regular strength Tylenol at 9:30pm on 2/21 and that took the edge off so I could sleep. I woke up on 2/22 feeling better but still had a sore neck and arm. The whole time I had a sore arm starting on 2/20 around 3pm.

                                                On day 12 (February 20), patient noticed some pain under her left bra strap (below the clavicle).   On day 13 (February 21), she noticed a bump about the size of a pea under the clavicle. At the injection site, she described her arm as being a little blotchy, sore and mildly swollen but it does not itch. She also felt a little tired and had a mild headache.  She took a nap and felt better.  On day 14 (February 22) the injection site reaction continues and the pea-sized bump under the bra strap (under the clavicle) remains, and the whole left side of the breast feels a little achy.   Patient wants to get dose 2 and plans to request it be administered in the right arm instead.

Also, low grade fever almost 24 hours after shot. 2/1/2021 at bedtime I had a very serious calve cramp that lasted 5-7 minutes. 2/2/2021 around 3 am I had a thumb spasm that lasted over 4 hours.  Since then I have had muscle spasms (all over my body including chest, eyes &amp; belly).  I also have joint weakness and numbness that sometime is on one side of my body (face, leg, arm &amp; eye).  I also have lower back discomfort every time I bend over.

After day 3, I went to hospital thinking I had Meningitis because my head hurt so bad and my neck was stiff. They ran an urinalysis and found a pretty bad UTI.  The doctor said that the UTI exacerbated the side effects of shot. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true. I got I. V. Keflex and prescription. Migraine continued for another 3 or so days. I missed 4 days of work. Honestly the symptoms felt like I was doing chemo again. It was awful.

That resolved in about a week, then after started to have pain, tightness in left side of neck area that still persists.  My dr advised she doesn?t feel any swollen lymph nodes and it?s likely a reaction to the vaccine. Taken Tylenol and naproxen with limited relief.

                                                They started about 2:30 in the morning, I woke up chilled. I had the muscle and body aches and then I had the nausea and fatigue. I had a headache. Initially, I took 600 mg of Advil and seemed to help. But fever spiked 102.5 - symptoms get worse throughout the day. Advil brought down the fever some. Sleeping helped the most. These symptoms lasted about 48 hours. I missed a day and a half of work because of it.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

                                                Slight right  facial numbness half hour post administration lasting 30 mins. Chills and Rt arm site pain and swelling on the first night. 2nd night, chills and increased swelling, pain to right arm site with slight weeping, warm to touch and redness. Throughout the first two weeks, I would have intermittent chills and right arm site redness, swelling, pain, warmth was gradually getting better but did not have any fever the first 13 days.  The night of 2/15/2021, I felt the chills, body aches and went to sleep. All night I felt I was about to get a fever. I was in bed until 1pm the next day on 2/16/21 when I started to have the severe tremors with my chills, back spasms, abdominal pain, and nausea. I got out of bed, took my temp and it was 101.5 F orally. I tried to take Tylenol but I could not because as soon as I sipped some water, I started vomiting yellow emesis first and then later on I was already vomiting greenish bile. I was getting weaker, lethargic and my tremors and chills were getting worst as well as my back spasms and abdominal pain. My husband, then brought me to the ER around 2:30-3pm. I was admitted in ICU for septic shock with unknown source on that day, 2/16/2021. I was on levophed drip via right chest central venous catheter for 48 hours and was given multiple antibiotics until discharged to home on 2/20/21. I developed red facial rashes more prominent to the right side on the second day of admission. Two days after discharge, I had headaches for two days with right shoulder pain. But, on the next day which was the 3rd day post hospitalization, I broke out with generalized reddened, raised, itchy and burning rashes. My husband brought me back to the ER on that day on 2/24/21. ER MD loaded me with dexamethasone steroid IV and Benadryl IV and sent me home with oral dexamethasone and anti-histamine orally. I saw my primary MD on 2/26/2021 for hospital follow up and referred me to Infectious disease MD and Endriconologist. On March 3rd, I was started on insulin SQ due to my blood sugars running 300?s to almost 400. As of now, my MD is still adjusting my insulin dosage due to persistent high blood sugar readings of 300-400 mg/dL.

I took Tylenol 1300mg on Tuesday evening. I woke up Wednesday morning with some discomfort and decided to take another dose of Tylenol 1300mg approximately 10:00 am. The pain increased and I took another dose of Tylenol 1300 mg approximately 1500. Tylenol was not relieving my discomfort and approximately at 1800 I took Celebrex 200 mg . I went to bed at 2200. Lying down was difficult. I could not turn my head from side to side without excruciating pain. I finally went to sleep. I woke up Thursday morning pain free.

                                                Was fatigued and had headache since about hour after shot day before, and was nauseated morning after shot but was tollerable.  About 1 pm was sitting at my desk when felt flush and neck hurt. Noted rash across neck and upper torso, swelling at lymph node L side neck area. Area was painful to light touch. Pt (self) went to urgent care to be further evaluated by someone else other than patient, once there began to get worse.  All over tingling but significant at fingers, toes and mouth lips. Unable to talk clearly, but never  became confused. So tired unable to stay awake; difficult to rouse. No difficulty with breathing; Epi was not needed or given. Transported to hospital via EMS due to inability to stay awake and difficulty speaking/unable to stand without assistance. It was very hard to talk - to get the words out - but I never did have any decline in mental thought process and was never disorientated. Looked intoxicated however.  At hospital when pt transferred from stretcher to bed, pt doubled over due to abdominal discomfort - it was where the EKG stickers were. All reflexes noted to be hyper - MD kicked on accident when checking reflexes. the EKG stickers felt like being punched or slapped. Needed assistance transferring. All over numbness/tingling noted. Breathing never affected. Symptoms resolved after a few hours.

                                                approximately 15 minutes after the vaccine was administered I developed numbness in my tongue, metallic taste in mouth, and headache and a fullness feeling in ears.  1 and 1/2 hours later I developed neck pain and numbness in the left side of my face that lasted for 48 hours.  Benadryl was taking for 2 days to help with the reaction.  Day 3 after the vaccine symptoms seemed to resolve except for a slight feeling of numbness in left cheek but much better than first 2 days and almost gone completely.

The pain started to subside however there was still mild swelling. Day 11 I noticed the swelling is more pronounced and the armpit is painful again.

                                                No symptoms the day of vaccination but on 1/9 I woke with a headache and pain at the injection site. I had significant tiredness throughout the day. I also started to develop a painful area of redness distal to the injection site. On 1/10 I continued to have a headache and tiredness. The redness had increased on my left arm to ~6x3 inch area. By the afternoon I had a bumpy red itchy rash on several areas of both arms and my back and stomach. At that point I took Benadryl. The morning of 1/11 the rash had mostly resolved but I still experienced itchiness of the arms, stomach and back. I also had left armpit pain.

                                                metal taste in mouth 30 min after injection received, itching sensation on left arm 1 hour after injection received. Pt. evaluated by their in house medical team who administered a Benadryl injection to the right arm, unknown dosage. The pt. told me the nurse on staff measured her SPO2 at 86% and wanted to call 911 for transport to the ER. Pt. reports she refused and left work to come to the urgent care clinic where I evaluated her. She is concerned that she could be having a panic attack vs. allergic reaction. Her itching arm and metallic taste has resolved but she feels chest pains on the left side of her chest and her left arm feels heavy.

Despite 4 blankets, a heating blanket and two corn bags I could not get warm.  The chills brought on unbearable muscle and joint pain. It was excruciating.  My fever fluctuated from 100 to 102. This lasted 24hrs. I had and continue to have a headache, on and off fever and extreme fatigue.

I was not given a copy of my Vaccination Record.  I asked for one and they said they did not have it to give.  I have no idea the medical professionals name or the Vaccine Lot # for my records.   I have NEVER had adverse reactions like this from vaccinations in the past.  I honestly thought I was on my death bed.

                                                On January 19th, 2021, i received the first dose of the moderna vaccination right after the following day i began to feel pain in the area where the vaccination was given and i thought the symptom was a normal effect of the vaccination. On the 23rd of this month i noticed my arm began to increase in pain and became itchy.  27th Jan left workplace due to severe pain at vaccination site; went to urgent care clinic for examination. Redness, swelling and bump at injection site. 29 Jan pain spreading to neck and back area.

                                                Day of vaccine I experienced brain fog for about 3 hours. Typical soreness in arm for a few days and bruising at injection site. Arm remained tender but not bad and no concern until day 8, which was yesterday. That is when I experienced itching around injection site and swelling. Day 9 (today) the area below injection site is red, swollen (hard), tender, and the left shoulder joint aches. No other symptoms to report and this seems fairly normal. I&#39;m going to watch closely and take action if there are adverse changes. As of now, this seems like a typical reaction.

                                                Within 40 minutes my arm started to ache badly.  About 15 minutes after that while I was driving my head started to feel strange - almost lightheaded.  Within a couple of minutes my eyes involuntarily went to the left and the right and then my vision went black (this all happened in a matter of seconds).  I stopped at a store and felt light headed and confused/brain fog.  That continued at home for around 2 hours.  The pain in my arm continued to get worse.   I woke up several times throughout the night with pain in specific sites.  Today I was unable to go to work because of the full body muscular and joint pain, muscular weakness, headache, pain behind the eyes, and feel like I have fluid in my head (kind of like when you have a cold).   I had a significant reaction after the first dose as well (1/5/21 Moderna Lot 026L20A) but it was completely different - mainly arm pain, fever, chills, extreme fatigue, and what feels like fluid retention.  I gained 9 pounds without changing anything diet/exercise following the injection. On day 10 a large red welt appeared on my arm at the site of the injection.  On 2/1 my Endocrinologist sent me for lab work and urinalysis.  Those results are not back.   I likely would not have reported any of this if it wasn?t for the visual occurrence with the mental confusion and lightheadedness. I have never experienced anything like that in my life.

                                                About 12 hours after I received the vaccine, I developed chills, muscle aches and fatigue. Approximately 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, I starting having neck and shoulder pain. I reached out to my doctors office on 2/4/2021 and I was informed that some people have experienced neck pain. I woke on 2/5/2021 around 2:00 in the morning with excruciating pain in my neck, rating my pain at a 10 using a pain scale from 0-10. Zero being no pain and 10 being the worst pain. The pain was slightly better throughout the day but I woke at 11:30 pm on 2/5/2021 with the pain again being at a level 10. I went to the ER where they told me it&#39;s a side effect from the vaccine. I will have missed 3 days of work so far.

                                                9th, in the late afternoon, I started feeling really cold and I started getting headache and a lot of arm pain. It hurt to reach out to grab steering wheel. I felt very tired. I checked my temperature - 100.5. I got really cold and shivering at about 6:00 pm and I could not warm up for about 2 hours. It went to 101.5. Horrible pounding headache and dizziness. I started having stomach issues and diarrhea but didn&#39;t vomit. That went through the night - I felt like I had the flu. Back of my  neck was really stiff and achy - from shoulders up to the back of my skull. I didn&#39;t sleep much. I woke up completely soaked in the morning. My fever had broken. SUnday, I felt a little better. Dull headache ( it came and went). My temperature would go up and down -96.8 - to 100.1-ish all day. When my temp went up I got a headache and fatigue and down my headache would be better. Rolling every four hours. Monday, I stayed at 99.2 to about 100.2. Stayed at that the whole day. I was really tired. I had trouble thinking and concentrating. My arm was feeling better by Monday. Monday afternoon, about 1:00 my fever went to 100.5 and I called the nurse then. She told me to call my doctor&#39;s office. They sent me to a call to a triage nurse and she advised me to get tested for COVID. So Tuesday morning,  the 12th,at 9:00 am - healthcare clinic - the results were negative for COVID. Tuesday, I was feeling a little better - fever stayed around 99.2 to just over 100 and the headache was dull. I wasn&#39;t quite as tired. Wednesday, I was feeling better - like I could go to work but I didn&#39;t because of my fever the day before. I went to work on Thursday or Friday. The whole next week then I was better and felt fine. I got the second dose February 1.

I also had a headache, joint pain and felt fatigue later that evening and it lasted until the 23rd.  On the 23rd I developed a fever of 101. Today I still do not have my voice and the fever has went away. The injection site has a red and swollen patch. I still feel tired and fatigued today.

Got up 3-4 times in the night to urinate (which is not normal) FIRST THING IN THE MORNING WHEN GOT UP around 6:30/7:00am:  body temperature felt extremely HOT and stopped being able to walk or function.  Almost fell down from feeling dizzy/out of it.  Had to drop to the ground and stay there for a while.  Within about an hour felt mostly normal again.  Did NOT take temperature or blood pressure, would have if I hadn&#39;t been in a state of fear/shock.  Also itchiness in left deltoid 12 days after the vaccination, fingers on left hand accompanied this itchiness.  Felt irritated in general at injection site up to two weeks after. Digestion affected - loose stools for the week after and increased gas up to a month after injection (current)

During the night, I experienced chills and excessive sweating.    The next day (02/26/21), I experienced body aches, joint aches (especially in my fingers), headache, chills, and a fever (highest 101.7).  Drank lots of fluids and took 400 mg of Tylenol every 6 hours.  Noticed around noon that I my taste buds were off, meaning I had a loss of taste even when consuming salty food.  Fever rose to 101.7 and experiences chills and excessive sweating during the night.    Today (02/27/21), I woke up with no fever and little body aches.  Joint pains and headache are gone.  Left arm (near injection site) is still tender.  Around 11:00 am, I had a low grade fever (99.9) but no other symptoms bu continue to experience a loss of taste.  It is now 3:45 pm, and I still have a low grade fever and a loss of taste.

                                                Adverse events occurred on two separate dates.  One was the day after the vaccine, I felt weak limbed and extremely tired. Approximately two weeks after the vaccine shot, on 4/4, I lost feeling and went numb on my entire right side, from my head to my feet.  I had no pain other than dizziness, my face did not droop but my tongue was numb.  In the ER they took my blood pressure, and it was 251/112 or so. It was extremely high.  Also, my numbness was intermittent, it would last about 10 minutes and then slowly go away, then a couple of hours later, it might come back.  Saturday 4/3 it occurred about 4 times, on Sunday 4/4, it occurred about twice while in the hospital. I was released to home the evening of 4/4. On Monday it occurred about 1 time.

                                                Following the vaccine I was slightly dizzy, after 25 minutes my chest started to get tight, had difficulty breathing, racing heart rate, some constriction in the throat.  I was taken to the ER, used Proair inhaler on the way to ER to ease breathing,  O2 sat slightly decreased but returned to normal in the ER.  Due to difficulty breathing, I had some increased anxiety which lessened after breathing became easier.  Nebulizer treatment given in the ER.  Benadryl 25mg taken.  Rash on L arm and upper chest, burning and pain in L arm.  Benadryl taken for 2 days due to returning rash and burning in arm.  Nebulizer treatments every 4 hrs on the day of the vaccine due to continued tightness and difficultly breathing.  The following day I had fatigue, slight fever, pain of 7 out of 10 in L arm, headache, neck and muscle pain.  Followed up w/ primary care physician on 12/29/2020, he advised not to take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  L arm pain lessened to 4 out of 10 on 12/30/2020.  L arm pain dissipated on 12/31/2020, but headache, neck pain and fatigue continued through 1/1/2021

                                                Within an hour and a half after vaccination my skin was flush and red and I developed hives. I work at this facility and was sent to the ER where I was monitored for two hours and received IV Benadryl, solumedrol, and Pepcid. The redness was gone within an hour and the hives disappeared after having to take an additional 25mg Benadryl pill after 6 hours. The next day I experienced fatigue, severe muscle pain, chills and this continued for an additional 2 days.

Between 1-2 hours after injection, I noticed a little bit of a scratchy throat,  increased thirst, and mild headache. No treatment required.  I took Benadryl and Tylenol when I returned home from my shift at work about 4 hours after the injection. The next day, 1/3/21, scratchy throat had disappeared.  I felt tired, slight fever of 99.5, increased thirst, and very sore arm.   On 1/4/21, I just have slightly sore arm and a little tired with no fever.  I took Tylenol.

This only lasted for approximately a minute. I sat and waited for about 30 minutes before I left. When I got into my vehicle I noticed that my chest was really tight and I called my husband to talk to me while I drove home. After arriving home and not feeling like my chest tightness was a normal symptom I called my daughter who is an RN and she checked my vitals which were fine. She told me that I should continue to self monitor and if I got any worse to go to the ER. My symptoms chest tightness did not get any worse and felt a little better by the time I went to bed between 10-11pm. The next morning I woke up to get ready for work and felt a lot of the common symptoms like:  Fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and my arm was sore. The highest fever that I recorded was 102.4.  I still have a fever as I am filling out this form. It is 100.2 and I took 2 Motrin an hour and a half ago.

I woke at about 2am with severe nausea. Went to the bathroom still suffering from chills, and in severe pain from joints and muscles attempted to use the toilet and passed out.  Revived and climbed back into bed.  The next day 01/16/21 continued to have chills, nausea, and joint and muscle pain.  At 2pm on 01/16/21 started to have a rash in my stomach.  By 8pm the rash was on my stomach, and back.  Sunday 01/17/21 still having mild chills and aches, the rash is now wide spread over my torso and back.

                                                About 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine starting at about 1:15 pm into the evening, I noticed some slight numbness in my lower jaw on both sides. As far as fatigue, I felt pretty tired yesterday evening. I obtained a decent night sleep (around 7-7.5 hours). I initially woke up feeling pretty good, but then after being up for about an hour I felt pretty tired again (so much so that I questioned whether I could make it through the work day). I&#39;m at work now and still feel tired; when I stand up I almost feel a little light-headed.  I&#39;m noticing a little returning of the numbness in my jaw area and short-lived, slight radiating down my right neck.  I listed muscle pain because my right shoulder is also sore in addition to the injection site.   I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s important to share here that I am lactating. I did get clearance from my PCP and provided that note when I submitted my consent.

                                                On 1/14/ 2021 @ aprox 6pm, the injection site suddenly began burning sensation and had a raised white ring around a red hot center. It began as the size of Suzanne b Anthony coin.  Over the course of a few hours the white rind turned I to a larger knot/lump the size of a silver dollar. I began feeling feverish and the entire arm ached. The itch was intense so I used topical anti itch cream in an attempt to subdue the sensation. It helped slightly. I also began oral antihistamines and a fever reducer , following protocol as if I had been stung by a bee/wasp and experience a similar reaction.  On 01/15/2021  in the am I decided to report my reaction via the V-safe app that was given in the pamphlet at the time of the drivethru clinic. It allowed me to set up my profile and make an initial report, however after an hour had passed my arm had continued to swell, itch, and become painful to use and I was unable to continue my daily activities. The swelling had a strange bruising appearance aprx 4inch in size  so I tried to report it to the app. At that point the app would not allow me to report and just kept sending sign in codes that would allow anything. Over the course of the next few days the app kept sending codes but would not allow for anymore updated reporting.  I decided to email our health department who had provided the drive thru vaccinations on 1/7/2021 and 1/8/2021. Thats was 1/14/2021. On 1/16/2021 a reply was finally received with only instructions to contact my person primary care physican. I do not have health care. health Department did send a link to this reporting form.  Today 1/20/2021 the redness and swelling have subsided leaving a faint 6inch discoloration under the skin. The shoulder joint and elbow joint ache dully and the bicep muscle spasms at times of use. Physically I feel better at the time of this statement. I did take a couple of pictures at the beginning of the reaction of the affected area/arm.  Others in our area on these same dates gave experienced delayed reactions to different degrees as well.

                                                Fatigue hit within a couple of hours; So tired and this was fall in to bed and be out. I slept for awhile - I rested all day the second day. I was getting dizzy and; muscle pain; a lot of joint pain (normally I&#39;m not in a lot of pain and never this tired). I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn&#39;t take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn&#39;t have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn&#39;t drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there. My sister said my speech was slurred; confused in my speech and I felt like that for three days. Both (Covid and flu) tests came back negative. Times when my sister couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and I slept more than I was awake (Thursday - Saturday was like this). Took Imodium for diarrhea when I had that. For joint pain - I treated it by tramodal 50 mg and I can take it as needed and I usually don&#39;t need it but took it consistently during this time.  What scared me the most was I could feel my Hip Implant  - ball and socket joint from bone all the way to my femur( I had Right implant on Hip on May 2019) - which is healed completely but I felt it at this time. I still can&#39;t lay on my right side without pain - like a deep bone pain.  I was going to call my surgeon today.  January 4th visit with my Dr - for check-in - He gave me a clearance to go back to work on Wed the 6th. I work two days a week; I&#39;m on disability and so have been able to work since then. Right hip pain is still  a lot and bouts of dizziness and still have joint pain. Have to take a minute and a couple of breaths to stand up. Some days I do have to use may cane. Chills are gone.

                                                No adverse event at 1st shot.  After second shot I felt dizzy driving home. Within 2 hrs my joints hurt and I had extreme fatigue. 24hrs later I almost fainted while taking hot shower and then vomited. The fatigue, joint pain, hot/cold feeling lasted till about 6pm the day after shot. The injection site is still red, swollen and itchy 2 days later. Appears to growing in diameter. As of this morning I feel much better and almost back to normal.

                                                Covid vaccine time line 1st Moderna vaccine on 1 2 21 (Sat) given at PMH at 5:10pm.  Tired x 3 days with some cognitive issues noted (very slight..like forgetting things I never do?was slowly resolving but never completely went away.  I did not even mention this to anyone because I was not sure it was the actual vaccine, or just my brain.) 2nd Moderna vaccine on 1 30 21 (Sat) given at PMH at 2:40pm.  Immediately had more pain in L arm, swelling in upper arm and redness, fatigue. --Sun. 1 31 21:  woke up with a low grade fever, increased fatigue, chills, nausea, diarrhea, headache, body pain, joint pain (it hurt to even shower).  Fever got higher?max 100 (I think, as I was taking Tylenol at this point) and fatigue got worse by nighttime. --Mon. 2 1 21:  Called out of work due to reaction but fever was lower around 99 and less fatigued (ie I could get off of the couch, clean a bit, take care of my son).  Still rested a lot, had diarrhea, nausea, headache off and on t/o day. --Tues. 2 2 21:  Had a planned day off anyway.  Same symptoms as Monday and same energy level.  Felt positive about going back to work on Wed. --Wed. 2 3 21:  Woke up feeling the best of the past days and went to work.  Still fever of 99 and I noticed I was ?off? all day.  Example:  I forgot my schedule book and Id tags at home (I NEVER do that).  Made weird ?forgetting? mistakes.  By 1pm I was EXHAUSTED and having diarrhea, nausea, chills, and headache.  Called the Employee Exposure Line and my manager.  Went and got COVID test at request of EL and contacted immunologist and primary MD.  Immunologist is on vacation x 2 weeks and covering MD deferred to whatever primary said.  Dr. covered for my primary MD, Dr.  She asked me to touch base with her on Thurs after results from COVID test, but she recommended that  I rest ?and let my body adjust to the vaccine?. --Thurs:  2 4 21:  Up at night from 2:30am on and off with nausea, diarrhea, chills, headache, weakness, shaking, brain fog, sweating.  I am also having some anxiety at this point.  COVID test negative.  I did send a message in MyChart to Dr. as requested.  She called me later in the day and instructed me to drinking fluids and rest.  She ordered blood work which I did go and do.  Also contacted Urgent Care though MyChart and spoke with a CRNP about my symptoms.  She felt that they were a reaction to vaccine and my anxiety. --Friday:  2 5 21:  Called out of work again due to all of above symptoms.  Diarrhea has resolved and no longer any fever, however fatigue, lightheadedness and dizziness,  headache, ?brain fog?, and cognitive symptoms remain.  I am off balance and have difficulty concentrating  and reading.  I did communicate with my neurology office and they stated that it is ?just a reaction to the vaccine?. --Sat:  2 6 21:  Called Employee Exposure line to report same symptoms as above.  Same headache (almost migraine?  Having an aura?)  I am not sure why I feel so foggy.  Did have some ?clearing? of my head in the afternoon. --Sunday:  2 7 21:  Woke up feeling worse immediately.  Horrible headache, lightheadedness, off balance, difficulty focusing and concentrating.  No fever.  Called Employee Exposure Line to report symptoms and they recommended that I call the Urgent Care MD again.  Called urgent Care MD through MyChart again and tried to go into see her at Healthcare, however it was snowing hard and I slipped 3 times so I called the Healthcare and made apt for Monday 2 8 21 for 10:30am. --Monday:  2 8 21:  Headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty with multitasking as of this AM.  Went to Healthcare and saw CRNP.  She wrote for Augmentin for possible sinus infection and I filled at the pharmacy.  She instructed me to see my neurologist regarding possible neuro symptoms from COVID injection reaction.  I communicated with workers from comp team.  I am allowed to see the neurologist from the Dr. office.  I called their office and office manager tried to refer me back to primary.  I insisted that I see the lady as I was referred from CRNP at Worker?s Comp.  They were agreeable to a telemed appointment as soon as I get my claim number.  I am exhausted, have a headache, and difficulty focusing at this point.  Sore throat started this AM and is way worse tonight.  B swollen glands near carotids.  Started Augmentin. --Tues: 2 9 21:  Cont headache, lightheadedness, fatigue, off balance, difficulty concentrating, difficulty with lights and sounds.  Trouble reading.  Saw neurology this AM at 10am in the office as opposed to telemed visit and had a MRI at 12pm.  She diagnosed a fair amount of things including vaccine reaction possibly causing intractable headache, migraine, dizziness w/o vertigo.  Wants me to start to Propanolol for the headaches.  Need to pick up from the pharmacy.  Out of work until 2 15 21 and then a partial return to work?  Not sure how that works.  Hopefully just feeling better and can go back full time.  I have to contact the neurologist through portal at the end of week to update on progress. Health care called me and wants me to have a visit with a vaccine specialist.  I need to fill out CDC form for vaccine incidents.  Bad headache tonight that started behind R eye and is now whole head.  Need to call ENT tomorrow to discuss MRI results.  Left the neurologist a question on portal about MRI.  --Wed. 2 10 21:  Woke up with light headedness, fatigue, dizziness, off balance, feeling ?off? cognitively.  Pressure around R eye and R sinuses.

It finally started to improve on the second day after the vaccine. The severity of symptoms lessened throughout that second day and I felt better by 8PM on 2-12-2021.

Within 12 hours from vaccination began to experience significant fatigue. At 26 hours from time of vaccination sudden onset of nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps, then within the next hour experienced diarrhea and chills. Stomach cramps felt like my stomach and intestines were being wrung out like a wet towel, after a few hours of diarrhea and chills went to sleep and symptoms  subsided.

My entire rib cage, inside and out were on a complete flare that I have never felt before. It was hard to breath, not shallow or during extent of deep breath, but in between the two. I was getting false chest pains as the intercostal pain over the chest would flare. This was constant pain that started within 12 hours of the dose. It resolved to about 90% by day 20, however I still have lingering intercostal pain. This may be a flare of my lyme reacting to the vaccine. It is still worth it to get dose 2, but I am not looking forward to the AE&#39;s.

Between every knuckle, my tailbone, between every rib - even my feet.  What has be concerned is the face flush. My cheeks are hot to the touch and are tingling, though I don?t have a fever. It?s been going on since about 24 hours after my 2nd injection, and it?s rather unnerving. I?ve been outdoors in about 50 degree weather, drinking plenty of fluids. Also my gut health feels completely different. I have been gassy and my stool is sludgy and I go multiple times a day (I?m a very regular person).

Called my daughter whom arrived within 10 minutes. After asking me some questions and exercises she  said my strength in the left upper extremity was weak compared to the right.  My daughter took me to ER, at check in I said I think I had a stroke. I was admitted, and neurology was consulted. In the ER they called it a TIA, and after imaging a  diagnosis of stroke was made.    Acute frontoparietal infarct, ASA/plavix, lipitor, PT/OT, Neurologist follow up.    After discharge I have been meeting with PT/OT following exercises. Met with my PCP and continued medications Aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg. Still have muscle aches, and pain in the left upper extremity- especially 3rd and 5th digits.

                                                Soreness in the right shoulder began a few hours after injection at injection site. The pain worsened over several days from the muscle to deeper in the shoulder joint and rotator cuff. Mobility was severely limited and painful. The pain with and without movement and limited mobility in the right arm at the shoulder have persisted now for 30 days. Arm cannot be lifted laterally more than a few inches; arm cannot be extended backwards at all without severe pain; I cannot sleep on my right side without pain, and shoulder hurts throughout the day and night.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On 05 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number:031L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of cCovid-19 infection.    On 05 Feb 2021, the patient started to have headaches and joint pain specially in the leg. The reporter stated the headaches and joint pain stopped, then came back this month (March).  The patient also stated they started feeling chills this month (March) as well. She was hospitalized (dates not reported) and was diagnosed with a viral infection and was told her heart was inflamed.   Treatment information was not provided.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the events, viral infection, heart was inflamed, feeling headaches, joint pain specially in leg, and chills, were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the events of headache, arthralgia, chills, and carditis.  The event of viral infection is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.

                                                Began with severe back pain on 3/04/21. I went to the ER and they checked heart because pain radiated to front. I went home and pain continued briefly the next day. By 3/6, I began to have numbness in my left leg, so again, I went to ER and they  prescribed oral steroids and recommended MRI to be scheduled in back. My Monday 3/8 I was unable to walk and had no sensation from mid chest down. I could feel Pressure, but had no sense of temperature or sharpness. From that point I was admitted to the hospital. I spent a week on the 6th floor and a week on the inpatient rehab floor. They ruled out demyelinating disease that could cause  the lesion that was found on my cervical spine from c6-T-2. The records indicate demyelinating disease vs post vaccine reaction. All tests for demyelinating diseases came back negative, so it is believed by the doctors that this was definitely caused by the Moderna vaccine. It caused a transverse myelitis reaction, which I am still dealing with. My walking is extremely slow, and the sensation issues persist, along with incontinence.  I have all of my medical records and diagnosis for record.  The hope is this will eventually correct, but for now, I am still in PT/OT twice a week.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Gallbladder disorder on 29-Jan-2021 and Gallbladder removal on 19-Apr-2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Indigestion. Concomitant products included FAMOTIDINE (PEPCID AC) for Indigestion, IRON, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C ACID), PROBIOTICS NOS and VITAMIN D3 for an unknown indication.   On 10-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form.

In the ambulance, they started IV, the patient&#34; blood pressure was low, and gave Zofran under the tongue. The patient said Zofran helped so much that within15 minutes it took the extreme nausea away. At the ER, around 8:40, the patient was feeling a lot better. The doctor in the ER said that people with inflamed GI were having the same problems with the Moderna vaccine. The patient experienced these symptoms from 7:30-9:20 pm and by 9:30pm the patient was completely fine. She went home and even had a snack. The patient did not have an ounce of arm soreness or any other symptoms after that. The patient&#39;s first gall bladder attack was on 29-Jan-2021. On 06-Apr-2021 at 4.30 PM the patient had a gall bladder scan. On 19-Apr-2021, the patient had a gall bladder removal. Patient could not eat or drink for 6 hours prior to scan. She said she did hydrate before the shot.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.

Symptoms began somewhat suddenly around 11am and lasted an hour or so, then waxed/waned, with another strong flare of it around 8pm also lasting around an hour.   Now 24 hours later, seems mostly resolved, not quite 100%.  Prior to this, there was only mild injection site tenderness, less than other IM vaccines.

Headache, fatigue, joint pain, lymph nodes under arm were very painful for about week. And of course pain at injection site. On 09 Jan 2021  a red rash appeared and itching. It is also warm to the touch on left arm at or around the injection site. (concerned about this sense it appeared a week later.) Did not have this for a week.   After all the symptoms went away.

COVID swab -rapid test, negative 27th - still nauseous but ate a little; injection site improved - flat hive rash from injection site down to elbow. took Ibuprofen each day once or twice a day which helped with joint aches.

                                                Received injection at 0930 on 12/29/2020 and was observed for 15 minutes after injection.  Around 1630 I developed a headache so I took a Fioricet as I have a history of migraines.  I had a few body aches and only ate toast for supper that night.  By 2330 my headache seemed to be worsening and I started experiencing a fever of 102, tremendous body aches, nausea, sore throat.  At that time I took 500 mg Tylenol at 2330.  By 2 am on 12/30/2020 my fever had reached 103 and I had difficulty walking as my body joints ached so bad.  My headache was unbearable and I asked my husband to drive me to the ER as I could no longer take the pain.  I also was hyperventilating.  In the ER I was given normal saline 500 cc, Tylenol 1000 mg IV, and Zofran 4 mg IV for the nausea.  I did fill prominently better thereafter, except I continued to have a headache. I was given Toradol 30 mg IV and advised not to take my Celebrex that day.  The ER Doctor did call and speak with ER physician, and discussed the validity of lab testing for Covid after vaccination as well as his recommendations as to whether I should receive the second dose of the vaccine. Since I did not really have anaphylaxis, the doctor recommended that I proceed with the second vaccination with extended observation. I was discharged and instructed to take Tylenol 650 mg orally every 4 hours as needed advised for fever/analgesia.

By day 12 after injection, rash was starting to lighten in color but was continuing to grow in size to approximately 5 inches in diameter, it was no longer raised or firm, but continued to be hot to the touch and itchy, even with daily use of oral Benadryl and Loratadine . Out of concern that it was not going away on its own contacted PCP on day 14 post vaccine and notified of  situation and office visit made on day 15 post vaccine on 1/14/21 for further assessment. PCP prescribed course of antibiotics (Bactrim x 10 days) as could not  determine if it was  truly infection or localized immune response, or combination of both. Was also prescribed  5 day course of steroids (prednisone) to take prior to and after next COVID vaccine injection.

                                                8 days post vaccination developing a large area of erythema local to the site of vaccination, posterior right upper arm. Systemic symptoms: body aches, swollen lymph nodes, axillary pain, pain at site of erythema, mild itching and tenderness at site of erythema. Afebrile on exam. Area of erythema 10cmX14 cm, tender to palpation and warm. Previous marked outline showed increase of size 3cm in 3 hours. Submandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy. Given this delayed reaction, there were concerns for cellulitis vs injection site reaction and side effect of vaccine. It was a Friday and given the presentation paired with limited follow-up availability due to the clinic being closed on weekend, and systemic systems, elected to treat for cellulitis. Follow-up on 1/12/2021 showed resolution of systemic systems along with lymphadenopathy and erythema. Now with more data available it would appear this was delayed vaccine reaction and not cellulitis.

                                                Initially had typical reaction after the vaccine: chills fatigue ending completely at 48h. But on day 8 at night I started to feel some muscle weakness and then woke up the next day Sat with widespread muscle and joint pain. It has moved around and even involves my teeth. The muscle aches abd joint pain started at the left arm, in the deltoid with the injection site. It was never red or looked infected, but it did swell and then the  first joint involved was the left shoulder.  I do have lupus so I recognize some of my autoimmune symptoms in this, but I have never had anything  like this even with any flare I?ve ever had in my life  and went into this feeling well. My neck, head and left jaw were involved on Sunday and Monday  and I experienced sweating and malaise, but no fever. That?s somewhat better, but it moved on to other areas and my teeth are so sore it is hard to chew food. I now get a little better in the morning. And then my hands, feet, knees abd lower leg muscles hurt and have swelling starting about 4pm, which gets progressively worse with movement until I go to bed.  I have no fever.  No one in my house is ill. Aside from Saturday and Sunday when I had fatigue, I generally feel normal energy it?s just the physical symptoms are so painful.

It is roughly 2? in diameter, however it is not a perfect circle.   I may have had it all weekend, but I did not notice it until Sunday evening.   Additionally, my  arm/muscle became very sore the evening of the vaccine, but I knew that was a common side effect.

                                                Within 8 hours of shot administration, I was running fever and experiencing chills.  Ran fever (as high as 102.7) for the next 48 hours.  Lethargic, no appetite, muscle and joint aches, severe headache.  The symptoms experienced in the 48 hours after vaccine were vastly more sever than the symptoms I had when I had COVID.  Fever broke during the night on 1.21.21.  Felt much better on 1.22.21, but was still very tired and had headaches.  On 1.25.21, I awoke with a SEVERE headache on the left side of my forehead and temple.  My eye was bothering me.  When I looked in the mirror, my left eyelid was swollen and red.  The left corner of my mouth was drooping.  My doctor diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s Palsy on 1.25.21.  Symptoms are worse today.  She prescribed a steroid dose pack to help with the inflammation of the facial nerve.  Steroids were started today, 1.26.21.

                                                Approximately 30 -45 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I started getting a sharp pain in my lower back and it seemed to be coming from my spine.  It continued for two days and affected my movement.  It seemed to improve with rest and not sitting in an upright position.  At times, it radiated down my legs.  Within 48 hours, the pain had decreased to a minimal level and has since gone away.  I did not report the back pain to a doctor because at the time, I did not think it was related to the vaccine.  The pain seemed to be in the region I received an epidural 17 years ago.

The pain returned four hours after the Norco wore off and I had to take a second Norco. I do not have chronic pain or any problems with pain.

At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 1/26/2021 I started waking up a lot and couldn&#39;t get comfortable.  I tossed and turned and body aches began and quickly worsened.  My knees, thigh bones, hips, pelvis, lower back, and shoulders all hurt like I had been beaten with a bat.  I took a sick day from work due to the severity of symptoms.  I had no fever, but did have hot flashes periodically throughout the day.  I was dizzy upon standing, had nasal congestion, and sever fatigue, and developed a moderately bad headache later that day.  I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m. on 1/26/2021 and slept through the night.  Upon waking on 1/27/2021, I felt much better.  I still have some lingering fatigue and stiffness but not enough to interfere with my normal routine.  I was vaccinated in my left arm and today, 1/27/2021 I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit that are quite sore.

                                                I felt impaired  (similar to being intoxicated) about a half hour to an hour later.  I had trouble saying some words., like my brain and my mouth weren?t communicating effectively.  My heart was racing at times and I was  a little short of breath. All of this subsided a few to a couple hours later. I then just became extremely fatigued,  sometimes light headed, with a slight headache and back ache. My arm hurts a little, but not near as bad as shot one. I ended up taking two days off of work to sleep and recover.

It is hot, bright  red, each day it gets redder and bigger and misshaping my arm from the swelling, arm feels really heavy,  It melts an ice pack within minutes.

                                                The same day on the 8th about an hour after the shot, my right arm at the injection site was getting a little tender and sore. Also had stomach cramps-took Midol did nothing for the pain which would normally help if I had normal stomach cramps from say my cycle. Nausea and a little bit of dizziness not much. Just a few cases when I was walking I would notice me having to either stop for a second or re-correct how I stepped. So really just two cases that I remember that same day as the shot. Also when I was driving home from work I noticed my words were a bit slow , more simple spoken sentences. That was it on that symptom , that didn&#39;t last that long. Because I went home and spoke to my husband and seem to speak just fine. Also noticed my appetite lower, not as hungry but that was between 330pm- on throughout the night.  On 2/9/21 my arm was really sore, armpit a little sore, but noticed a big pump at the injection site area. Really sore to touch and I really moved my arm yesterday and rubbed it and drank lots of water so not sure why I had swelling as much as I did. Still had the nausea this morning, little bit of a stomach ache but went away fairly quickly I would say within 30 min. The nausea however I still have and it is 9:30 am. Slept for about 10 hours last night, so definitely fatigued. Other than that I feel okay.

                                                I became very ill on Friday. I did not take my temperature but know it was high. I was sweating and had chills. My joints throughout my body ached. My head was pounding and felt like a migraine. I stayed in bed for a 24 hour &#43; time period. I was taking ibuprofen and Excedrin migraine but it only helped the pain a little. I also had green stool for 2 days when using the bathroom.  It was the sickest I have felt in quite some time. I am feeling better as of today.

                                                Immediately after shot: I felt some pain &amp; burning at injection sight. In general felt a little off, but nothing significant. After observation period, on the drive home, I began to &#34;taste&#34; the shot, as did my husband who received vaccine right after me. Then, my face felt a little funny, and my jaw felt tight, but no visible swelling. Then I felt a rush of burning sensation throughout my chest and abdominal region. After arriving home, 20 minutes later, I felt a little nauseated, but not bad. An hour later, I was unable to eat dinner, as I felt ill. I felt like I had a mild fever and I was shivering with chills. While trying to sleep, the chills continued. I then experienced unusual frequent urination, every 2 to 3 hours. I had no consumed abnormal amounts of liquid, but my urine was nearly clear, which was odd. After returning to bed after the first time urinating, my heart rate became very fast and I felt like I had a hard time finding my pulse in my neck, which is unusual for me.   The day after the vaccination I experience headache, a lot of tenderness around injection sight and arm muscle pain making it very painful to make certain movement, like putting on my top and reaching for objects. That evening I experience some muscle aches.   These symptoms have improved now that it is day three after the vaccination. I still have a mild headache and pain at injection sight.

                                                I developed extreme shoulder pain and weakness in my arm with limited mobility  the evening of my Covid vaccine. I kept trying to move my arm since I thought it was pain from the vaccine dose, but the pain continued to get worse over the week even with ibuprofen. I went to my primary care physician a week after the vaccine and he examined me and said the placement of the injection was much too high and it missed my deltoid muscle. I completed lab work to rule out infection, and I am scheduled to have imaging of my left shoulder to determine the extent of the shoulder injury from the misplaced injection. It has been 2 weeks and the pain is continuing to increase with very limited mobility. I have had to miss work, can&#39;t drive my stick shift car, and my sleep is poor because the pain wakes me up during the night.

                                                2/5 I received the 1st does of Moderna. The next day I had a massive headache. As the days went on my neck started to heart. The days continued and my back started to hurt. I thought my pain was just radiating down my back from my neck. ON 2/12 I have record of going to the pharmacy to get Lidocain patches. I continued on with pain from neck to middle of back. I made appointments with chiropractor and went there complaining that my back and ribs were out. This continued. On 3/5 I got the 2nd dose. I reacted as expected but this went on for 4 days. Went to a convenient care clinic where the dr ordered chest xray and D-DImer for suspected PEs. I got a call immediately to go to ER as my D-Dimer was high at 4.3. I went back to Local ER and had a CT Scan. The CT scan showed MULTIPLE PEs with infarct. I was admitted. SInce then I have been back to the ER and still struggling and have many tests coming up. My pulse is consistantly tachycardia. The ER docs do not want to entertain the thought that is was the vaccine because i was a smoker and on hormone replacement therapy. HOWEVER, I smoked for over 30 years and was on that HRT for almost 3 and never showed any signs of a clotting issue. I can pinpoint with pictures, and bank records of when the pain started and it reflects back to the 1st dose.  Who knows but after the 2nd does and out of the hospital I struggled with covid symptoms including the &#34;foggy&#34; head and that continues as well as other health related PE issues.  They may not want to contribute it to the vaccine but I know when this all started and it does need to be reported incase others. I have a whole story to tell that doesn&#39;t cover in writing!

Skin was extremely sensitive to cold and touch.  Heat and OTC pain reliever helped.  Symptoms had improved within 24 hours but not fully.  Some aches persist.  I tested positive for Covid-19 in October 2020 and although my symptoms were very mild when I had the virus, my long lasting symptoms still persist (numbness and tingling in both arms, taste and smell come and go, fatigue continues, phantom smells of cigarette smoke, etc).  I have also heard that symptoms can be worse for those that have had Covid before the vaccine.

                                                Woke up the morning of 1/12/2021 with a headache and soreness on the left side of my neck- when I got out of bed I realized my left arm was also very sore and itchy. I looked in the mirror and realized the injection site was very hot to the touch, swollen, read and inflamed. I called my dr&#39;s office and they made me an appointment for the next day which was this morning. The dr said he hasn&#39;t heard of any adverse reactions this far after the initial injection.  He said it&#39;s possibly cellulitis and to monitor it- if it gets worse present to the ER /Urgent Care to be seen. He prescribed an antibiotic and said to take it if the symptoms get worse or linger on.

When I saw it this morning,  it was about 2 cm in diameter, raised, hard,  erythematous area on Right upper deltoid. I marked it with ink. When I looked at it this afternoon, the area at the superior area of right deltoid appeared about the same but there was a trail of erythema going down her arm. She stated her elbow was now hurting and it felt like her elbow was swollen. I instructed her to see her PCP immediately as I felt she needed an antibiotic for what appeared to be cellulitis.

Site tenderness...then everyday, all day 1/4-1/10...lightheaded/dizziness(couldn&#39;t drive) Nausea ( thought i was pregnant) Diarrhea, headache, fatigue, night sweats, injection site became red, size of a half dollar and itching got worse as the week went on. On 1/10, most symptoms got better..On day 9 (1/2) I looked at sight and it was more red, and warm to touch...my face was also bright red...overnight the site grew to cover almost right around and the whole area was bright red. I went to my pcp who is treating as a cellulitis...itching persists, occasional dizziness but nausea and diarrhea have gotten worse..im guessing from antibotic?

The patient&#39;s medical history included migraines and a hysterectomy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included sumatriptan, naratriptan hydrochloride, and galconezumab.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A) in the left deltoid intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   A pharmacist called stating she received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 02 Jan 2021 at 9:45am in her left deltoid. Immediately after receiving the vaccine, she had facial flushing, blurred vision, dizziness, confusion and choking in the throat that lasted 20 minutes. After a few hours, she stated confusion would come and go, and she had no emotions. The next morning, the confusion was gone. On 03 Jan 2021, she reported having body aches and a fever of 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She reported chills, body aches, and a lot of pain in the left arm. If she tried to move her left arm, the entire muscle in the left arm hurt.  Treatment for the events included acetaminophen and an antihistamine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was withdrawn.   The events, choking, flushing, vision blurred, were considered resolved on 02 Jan 2021. The events, confusional state, emotional disorder, and dizziness, were considered resolved on 03 Jan 2021. The events, body aches, pyrexia, chills, and limb discomfort, were not considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48 year old female patient with medical history of migraines, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Choking, non-serious unexpected events of Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, Confusional state, Emotional disorder, Pain, and Limb discomfort, and non-serious expected events of Pyrexia and Chills. The events of Choking, Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, and Confusional state occurred immediately after administration of their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A). The event of Emotional disorder occurred on the same day when the patient received mRNA-1273. The events of Pain, Pyrexia, Chills, and Limb discomfort occurred on the next day of mRNA-1273 administration. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

After about a week from getting the vaccine, left was itchy at the vaccine site and coin sized red rash developed. At first I did not relate it as a reaction to the vaccine. But as the rash got little bigger I took zyrtec on 1/16/2021 &amp; 1/18/2021 and benadryl on 1/19/2021 &amp; 1/20/2021. Now the redness/ rash seems to have spread. It looks like a red oval outline (no redness in the center), size of the palm, and the site feels slightly warm to touch.

However, out of an abundance of caution, and as the facility the event was reported to, I wanted to enter this report for completeness due to the unusual events. Patient received 1st dose of moderna covid vaccine at an outside facility and (per patient) had a seizure at that site immediately following the injection (history of seizures due to past meningitis, no seizures in past 3 months per patient). No medications were given, 911 was not called, patient not instructed to go to ED (per patient). Patient went home. Once home, patient reported &#34;stroke like symptoms&#34; on her right side (weakness and inability to close right eye for 30 minutes, numbness in R thigh and heel). Then weakness moved to left side (numbness/tingling in L hand and eye, numbness in L lower leg) along with some swelling to face/tongue. Had back pain but no chest pain or difficulty breathing.  Extreme dizziness. No additional seizures. The next day she called our nursing line to report these symptoms and was instructed to go to the ED and also scheduled a visit with primary care provider the next morning. Patient stated she was feeling better and apparently did not go to the ED, instead choosing to see PCP next morning. On presentation to PCP, injection site was red and swollen, itching and swelling in hands, itching in bottom of feet, widespread joint pain. No visible rash, no dysphagia, no difficulty breathing. Other symptoms had largely resolved. Patient was prescribed benadryl (no steroids due to allergy to prednisone), cold compresses for injection site and sent home with instructions to go to ED if symptoms reappeared. Also recommended making an appointment with a neurologist for additional follow up as patient currently does not see a neurologist for seizures and is treating with CBD/THC only.

                                                About 4 hours after receiving my shot, I could not raise my arm to my waist.  My arm was useless.  I started taking 800mg ibuprofen twice daily starting the evening of the 8th until the afternoon of the 10th.  My arm appeared to be getting better.  By the 12th, I would say I was about 85%, still having pain upon raising my arm and using it in most circumstances - muscle weakness as well.  By the 15th, the full uselessness of my arm returned just like it was 4 hours after vaccine administration.  I again started 800mg ibuprofen twice daily through the weekend of the 17th. Again, there was gradual improvement.  It&#39;s now been 2 weeks since vaccine administration and my arm is still only about 80% functional, and always with some pain or discomfort.  I cannot take off my shirt over my head, for example. I will say the nurse who gave me the vaccination gave it way too high so this is definitely a shoulder injury, but I cannot say as to whether it is from her administration technique or the vaccine itself.  I have never had a reaction like this, ever, and I get vaccines every year.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. I am having knee joint pain, in the R knee. Have never experienced this before. I knew it was a potential side effect so I&#39;m not panicking, but felt it was important to report. I can walk fine but it hurts when I move it. Unrelieved by massage. I&#39;ve been taking Advil for the pain. If it continues I will contact my Primary Care Physician. I am an RN.

                                                Approximately seven hours after the vaccine was given, I started to get a headache. The HA was followed by extreme fatigue (around 2000). I went to bed with vaccine site pain (8/10), some chest pain (3/10) and back pain (7/10). I awoke about midnight (2400) with nausea and felt like a syncopal episode was imminent. My BP at the time was 115/75, HR of 75 (baseline is 125/75). I drank some water and elevated my feet. About 0230 on 1/24/21 another episode hit, with a corresponding BP of 105/72, HR 80. Again I elevated my feet and drank a glass of water. A third episode hit around 0600 with a BP of 96/65, HR of 87. I elevated my feet, drank a glass of water, ate something and considered going to the hospital.  I began to feel a little better. That was the last episode. The nextday on 1/24/21 I felt fatigued and weak with unusual pains occurring throughout my body (5/10). By 1/25/2021 I was feeling pretty normal and went back to most activities (I did a short, flat walk instead of my usual 45-minute treadmill incline).

At 11:50, I became shaky &amp; lightheaded. I ate my lunch at noon &amp; drank a coke. I took 1000 mg of Tylenol at 12:15. Took off my Apple Watch and sat &amp; took deep breaths for about 15 minutes. Then, heart palpitations slowed. By 6:00 pm on 1/27/2021 I began experiencing joint pain, muscle aches, headache, fatigue  &amp; was nausea. By 12:30 am on 1/28/2021 I had a fever, stuffy nose, and developed a cough.  On 1/28/2021 I had muscle aches, headache, fever (101) and fatigue. Also, I lost sense of taste on 1/28/2021. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen on 1/28/2021 at 12:30 pm and symptoms seemed much better by 4:00 pm on 12/28/2021. As of 1/29/2021 at 10:10 am I am asymptomatic other than sore arm at injection site and stiff neck or muscle soreness in neck on right side.

                                                I had a very painful injection site and also area got swollen and red. Like a bruise.  For about 4 days. I took Ibuprofen and Tylenol and it was hard to sleep because it was very painful. New Years eve I started feeling my throat scratchy so I made me some honey tea. As I sipped  the tea, my son entered the room and made a remark regarding the tea smell and then I realized that I could not smell the tea, but could still taste it. Concerned it could be a sign of COVID I sanitized all areas and stayed in my room. Next morning I noticed my smell and taste were compromised.  I communicated with the employee health and was tested on the 4th and my rapid test was negative and I could not believe it.  So I decided to go to the UC and I was tested for flu, strep and Covid I was tested positive around 4PM on the same day (01/04/2021).  On 01/02 I noticed I was nauseated around 6:30PM til 10PM and next morning it was gone. On 01/03 I had headache and chills about the same time, I developed diarrhea on the 4th later in the evening as well. On the 5th, 6th and 7th I had cough and on the 9th I had diarrhea again and after that by the weekend everything had resolved  and I felt better.

                                                I received my first injection of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on Monday evening (1/25/2021) and my arm became very sore. The next day, I could not lift my arm. By Wednesday (1/27/2021) morning, I had a terrible migraine type headache, chills, muscle aches and nausea. I went to bed and sleep the whole day. I took ibuprofen which helped ease symptoms. The headache went away by Friday but I had lingering nausea &amp; tiredness for several days and food tasted strange to me. I felt better by Monday, Feb 1, but then on Tuesday, February 2 in the evening, I developed a large hive and swelling on my left arm where I had received the injection. I also had smaller hives on my chest and neck. I took Benadryl and the swelling went down and by Wednesday morning (2/3)- the hives were gone and feel somewhat normal again.

                                                She received her first COVID vaccine on 1/18. No initial issues- quarter size lump, sore for couple days. The lump had gone down to a BB size. On 1/24, She experienced headache, nausea, stiff/achy. This continued and worsened over the following couple days. At this point her injection site was quite swollen- 2 in wide x 4 in long, red, sore, and hot to touch. She did go to her PCP who treated her for cellulitis at the site with dexamethasone 6mg po twice daily and Clindamycin topical cream twice daily and Bactrim DS po twice daily. I am wondering what I need to do, if anything. Also, I am quite reluctant to get the second injection.

I slept all weekend.  After shot two (right arm) on 02/05/21 I had all of those same reactions by early Friday afternoon. I woke up at 10:00 pm with the need to vomit. While sitting on the edge of my bath tub waiting to vomit, I fainted and fell backwards into the bathtub, hitting me head and wrenching my neck as I was wedged into the tub sideways. My son found me and roused me. I then urinated all over myself, had extreme diarrhea and vomiting x 2 rounds. I fainted a second time while sitting on the toilet with diarrhea and vomited 2x more into my bathtub.

                                                Twelve hours following her vaccination with Moderna, the patient experienced chills, PO temperature of 103.0, vomiting, muscle weakness, tiredness and a feeling of being delusional.  The patient took 2 Aleve and was able to fall back asleep for the night.  The second day she continued to vomit and her temperature was unknown.  She started developing mouth sores within 24 hours.  She had a difficult time tolerating food which she attributed to her inability to retain her two daily doses of Hydrocortisone due to her vomiting.  Within 72 hours she began to tolerate foods better.  Her temperature was unknown at that time.  Within 96 hours, the patient describes herself as 50% improved with a PO temperature of 99.

                                                On 2/3, I started to feel an ache in my left armpit, as if I had pulled a muscle. Added to that on 2/4 was an ache and heaviness to my upper left arm. Added to these 2 symptoms on 2/5 was a small light rash that I noticed around 6:30am. This rash grew in size and became hot around noon. I saw my PCP around 4pm on 2/5. After I was examined, it was determined that I was having an allergic reaction at the site of the injection. I was prescribed Amoxicillin-Clav 875-125mg and began taking in the evening of 2/5. The symptoms began to decrease within 36 hours. As of today, 2/11, the rash on my upper arm is barely visible. I will finish the full amount of antibiotics by Friday 2/12.

Headache,  I stayed febrile for the next 36 hrs 101-102.9. vaccinated on Monday afternoon, fever finally broke Wed afternoon. I have had an intense headache since the night of receiving the vaccine. Also have injection site swelling, redness, pain. The headache is very distinct, it is like no other headache I have had before. It is the same one I felt with the first dose of vaccine but didn&#39;t last this long. This time my neck is also very stiff.  My headache is so bad that when I sneeze I feel like my brain rattles against my skull.  Today is 3 days post vaccine and I feel like I&#39;ve had the flu. I am still not 100% . I am still very fatigued. Minor sore throat but my lymph nodes in my neck are slightly swollen too so I&#39;m associating the soreness to that.

I laid on the couch all day yesterday and went to bed.  I coughed throughout the night, and awoke with a sore throat.  My fever broke as I was &#34;wet&#34; waking up, to point I had to change my clothes.  My fever is gone.  I am very weak and my arm is still sore.  I do not feel like myself and still dizzy when standing.  I am better this morning but I am blah.

                                                Since 2/28- I have developed significant pain in my left arm. It starts where the shot was given and radiates down my arm  through my elbow area and into my hand at times.  The best was to describe it is as achy and heavy.  My arms just feels very heavy at times and I need to take the pressure off my arm to alleviate the discomfort.  I have been taking Ibuprofen and Tylenol to relieve discomfort but it does little to help.

                                                I started getting muscle aches around noon the day after the vaccine. It slowly got worse and worse and I was miserable. I had muscle aches, back ache, temperature of 101 and chills. My body hurt so bad that I needed help walking across the room. My fever broke at about 4 am and I was sweating. 3 days later, my heart started racing up to 265 BPM. I had diagnosed A-Fib for 6 years before up until this point that has always been able to be controlled with my Diltiazem. I had to go to the ER. I was admitted into the hospital for a day and 1/2.

                                                Two days after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I felt week, light-headed and had swollen eyes. I also started menstrual bleeding despite being in what I thought to be menopause, I had not menstrated for 6 months. Three days after the shot my left lymph node in my armpit began to swell and be painful to the touch.  I am now seven days post vaccine and my armpit and lymph node are still very sore and swollen and I do not feel 100%, a general unwell feeling. I am having serious doubts that I will get the second dose.

                                                Presented to the ED with cc of left sided facial and LUE numbness and weakness x 1 days. Patient received her COVID-19 vaccination on 12/30/2020 around 1PM. Immediately after the injection in her left shoulder, she began to feel warmth and numbness in her left shoulder, arm, neck, face, and chest. She reports later experiencing nausea, palpitations, and left arm weakness. Her symptoms persisted, and her family noted a left sided facial droop which prompted her ED visit.    In the ED, patient was noted to have some left sided facial droop and left arm and leg weakness. CT head and CTA showed no acute abnormalities. Tele-neurology was consulted who recommended admission to rule out acute stroke.  Ultimately, work up was negative and symptoms resolved.  Symptoms appear to be related to the vaccine.

The cough and spasms are ongoing 24 hours later. I then developed significant pain at the injection site three hours after, which has continued through the 24 hours that has gone by.  At 12 hours post-injection, I began to have myalgia, fatigue, headache and chills.  I used 1000mg of Tylenol at the 16 hour mark, with moderate relief. When the Tylenol wore off, all symptoms returned in full.  I am now 26 hours  post-injection, and still having all symptoms previously mentioned.  At no time, before or after taking Tylenol, did my temperature go above 98.5

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA  I had an immediate headache and metallic taste in my mouth within 1 hour of the vaccine. Those symptoms went away within 1-1/2 hours of the vaccine. Then on Saturday morning at 2am I developed chills, body and joint ache diffusely. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen at that time and they symptoms were gone by Saturday morning at 9:30am.

                                                moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Tachycardia sudden onset 4 minutes after injection (6:09am). Arms and legs cold and weak. Generalized weakness. BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

                                                About 2 hours after the shot, the injection area started to hurt. By the end of the first day, my left shoulder muscles were painful (pain grade: 2~3 out of 10).  This pain subsided in about 3 days.  Starting from 1/2/2021, a red, warm, and itchy papule is visible around the injection site, measuring up to 4 cm.  Meanwhile, a mildly painful (2-3/10) lymph node could be palpated in my left axilla.  The pain exacerbates upon pressure (4/10).  The swelling and mild pain persist until today.  Only occasional tylenol and topical anti-itch cortisol cream were used.

Next day, I went back to the site in my workplace where I got the vaccine, they said it looks like cellulitis and to go directly to the doctor. Doctor prescribed antibiotics. The redness became bigger even if I am already taking antibiotics although swelling subsided, but it is still itchy.  There is also a throbbing pain near my elbow. My Primary Care Doctor confirmed that it is cellulitis.

A week after injection I had Injection site swelling, redness, and itchiness at the injection site.  Red circle started small and has become larger (approx. 3 inches).  I&#39;ve used  Cortizone 10 creme a couple times throughout the day to help with itchiness.  I have a previously scheduled doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled for 1/18/21 and intend to report and show left arm to Dr.

                                                I had an array of symptoms that all lasted about 3-4 minutes and then another symptom would start about 10 minutes after. Started with feeling lightheaded but that symptom lasted about 10 minutes.  The other symptoms I&#39;m about to list each lasted about 3-4 minutes.  Moderate Jaw pain, mild radiating pain down my left arm, moderate bilateral clavicle pain,  radiating pain down my right leg. Moderate to severe pain at the base of my skull.  Felt woozy with this pain.  Then had severe sudden mid-chest pain with palpitations.   I Had high blood pressures the entire time about 168/88 but when this chest pain happened Bp was like 148/110.  O2 sat was 98%.  ICU dr came to assess me but stated my HR didn&#39;t seem that fast to him and offered to take me to hospital - next door to get further checked but my symptoms started to subside. I did get chills and was shaking after this but after that resolved I felt a lot better.  My BP came back down to like 118/72

My vitals were stable the entire time. My neck was sore and I had no energy.  My arm of course sore at injection site. This was on a Friday. Saturday residual soreness, and low energy. Sunday overall ok but neck was very sore. Monday same. By Tuesday afternoon (1/12/21) my joints ached severely (ankles, knees, elbows), I could not keep my eyes open, my neck continued to be sore and I had extreme fatigue and mild occasional nausea and loss of appetite. I had to stay out of work the rest of the week. 11 days later I still feel some fatigue and neck soreness but otherwise okay.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine, I awoke at 4am to severe pain, swelling, and stiffness at the injection site.  By 7am I was feeling nauseous, lightheaded and my arm was very stiff, itchy and swollen at the injection site.  I took Zyrtec D thinking that this was a delayed allergic response to the vaccine.  By 10am the symptoms were worsening and my lymph nodes in my left underarm and in my neck were swollen.  I called my physician who had me add another dose of Zyrtec and Motrin.  These symptoms worsened over the course of the day including tingling in my left arm and hand, numbness in my arm and hand until approximately 730pm when I was finally able to eat something and keep it down.  I went to bed exhausted, still with stiff upper arm and feeling general malaise.  I awoke this morning (1/20/21) at 6:45am and my arm is still stiff and swollen.  Other symptoms are resolving and I have been able to eat.

I started at 1:00 in the morning with chills and uncontrollable shaking and the feeling of never being able to get warm. I woke up with a 101 degree fever and a severe headache, muscle aches and the inability to get out of bed. I spent the whole day in bed and unable to eat that day. The next day I still had a fever of 100, muscle aches, severe headache and listlessness, but able to eat a little. I wasn&#39;t able to finally get out of bed that day until around 5:00 p.m. From then on all of the symptoms had pretty much subsided and I was able to get back to daily activities.

Today I woke up with red swollen splotch near site and wrap around additional red blotches along front of shoulder. I have now developed enlarged swollen lymph node along collar bone and swelling upward along side of neck. No shortness of breath no noticeable swelling in the back of the neck or towards ear.

                                                Lump in armpit muscular tissue.  Felt slight pain, discomfort about 5 days, did armpit/breast check and felt lump about the size of a small grape deep in armpit musculature. Mentioned to doctor and she called back advised it could be a lymph node swelling and I have dr. appt next week on 2/10/2021 for my physical so we will see if it is better.  It does seem to be getting less hard...softening and spreading out a little.

                                                I received my second dose of moderna vaccine on 1/23/2021. I had done well with the first one other than sore arm and fatigue. I felt ok day one, but day 2 arm injection site was painful. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. Woke up in the middle of the night with severe left shoulder pain that seemed to radiate to the clavicle and neck. Fever, chills also. I called off from work and slept until noon the next day, a full 48 hours post injection and felt much better with exception to the left shoulder. I have continued to have intermittent pain in the arm, that also now results in numbness and tingling of my fingers and left hand. I can hardly sleep at night due to the pain. there is not much that will relieve it, other than finding maybe a pillow for support, but that only lasts a short time and then I am awakened with pain again. It seems to be the joint itself that is affected. And instead of getting better it seems to be getting worse.

May or may not be related to the vaccine, but it?s new to me so I thought I would report  it.

Sore Throat, coughing with shortness of breath (seems to get better with movement, slight temperature 99.8 but using old ear thermometer, nausea, some trouble with eating but can taste foods fine.  I had a hysterectomy 3 months ago that had several fibroids, cysts and polys and Type 3 endometriosis.  This is still causing constipation and my physician said I was slightly dehydrated at lab testing taken January 28.    Was checking for pre-menopause symptoms which were inconclusive but did indicate I am still ovulating.

                                                EUA COVID-19 vaccine Moderna. Vaccinated with dose #1 of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 1/22. 1/23, client reports moderate arm soreness at the site of injection, joint aches and fatigue. She took ibuprofen 1/24 and 1/25, and &#34;felt lousy&#34; over the weekend. She noticed a spike in aches with chills on 1/25 approximately 3 hours post-exercise (strength training, moderate cardio). Fatigue and joint aches continued the rest of the week (through 1/30), but were not severe enough to limit normal activities or require ibuprofen or other meds. On 1/31, 9 days post vaccine, client reported a bilateral rash in the inner arm area. Within 24 hours, it spread to her torso and legs. Client is a nurse practitioner and described it as a &#34;measles-like&#34; rash; small raised dots, coalesced together in clumps that are largest on her thigh area, up to a foot in diameter. Warm to touch. Not a sandpaper rash. She denies itching or fever. This rash has been disappearing in order it appeared, and is still present on legs.The rash fading started 2/3 on inner arms, and client reports she can still feel the raised areas, but redness and warrmth is gone. Client did &#34;Chat with a doctor&#34; through telehealth and sent them a picture. Per her report, the provider said it may be a latent reaction to the vaccine, but is unsure if it&#39;s allergic. They offered a topical steroid which she declined. Client reports a history of topical allergic reaction on her face due to a cream, 10 years ago. She described it &#34;like chemical burn&#34;, and was prescribed a PO steroid. She reports atopic dermatitis as child, but doesn&#39;t have eczema or consider herself to have sensitive skin right now. She also reports one case of pityriasis rosea when working with school age children, &#34;text book&#34; rash, 20 years ago.  Due for dose #2 of COVID vaccine 2/19. Client plans to go to an in-person visit at clinic for further assessment.

                                                I began experiencing pain on the back of my head parallel to my left ear about 2 weeks after the vaccine. It started after I woke up in the morning, It hurt when I touch it and if I bend my head forward. I took 600mg of Motrin and it went away. The next morning I experienced the same thing. I took Motrin again and it went away. Since it kept happening I went to see my Dr on January 14th. He concluded it was muscular related and told me to ice/heat it. I proceeded to do that but that didn&#39;t help. I received my 2nd shot on 1/23/21. I called my Dr again 2/3-21 and he prescribed a muscle relaxer. So far it is not working. The pain is most intense after laying down for a while and then getting up. It only happens on the left side of my head.

I did not panic (although it was very scary) because my pharmacist/friend had told me that this happened to her overnite after her first dose.  By morning  my mild headache &amp; warmth went away &amp; I was able to move but was extremely sore with muscle aches throughout my body.  I was unable to do anything all day &amp; night.  I was better the next morning but still somewhat achy &amp; my aches proceeded to continue over the next few days but decreased daily.

Body tingling sensation turned into body aches.  Most were in the lower back and shoulders.  Random shooting pains in thigh muscles.  First temperature check at 8:00 am was 101.1 it increased throughout the day, peaking at 102.6.   I took 500 mg of Extra Strength Tylenol at 3:30 pm .  The fever dropped to 100.1 by 6:30 pm.  I took another 500 mg.  At 11:00 pm, the fever was up slightly to 101.6.  By 7:30 the next morning, the fever was down to 99.8.  It was gone a few hours later. Headache associated with fever, but not severe. NO fatigue, so I could not sleep off the fever.  I was wide awake and miserable. Felt fine by 8:00 am, so side bad side effects lasted approximately 24 hours.  By approximately 40 hours after the vaccine, I felt fine.  Very minimal soreness in arm remaining.

                                                After receiving COVID-19 Moderna vaccine dose 1 on 1/28/2021, came down with headache and soreness in left arm the next day. Throughout the night on Saturday, 1/31/2021 began having stiff neck and left side, including arm and leg, became weak with numbness throughout. The numbness was mostly felt in fingers and toes of left side. These symptoms continued and progressively became worse throughout the following week 1/31/2021-2/8/2021. In addition to the left side symptoms worsening, numbness and weakness developed in the right side fingers and toes. On 2/8/2021 numbness and weakness in left side became so bad that left leg was very heavy and dragging when trying to walk.  I was unable to work that day and was told to call Employee Health.  Employee Health directed me to go to the Emergency Room. While at the Emergency Room, I received lab tests, XRay, EKG, CT Scans, and MRI of neck. MRI was evaluated by Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon who diagnosed me with Cord Compression Myelopathy and told me that I needed immediate urgent surgery. ER Doctor, Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon and Hospitalist all felt that the COVID-19 vaccine could have caused the inflammatory immune response that led to further cord compression.  I had anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery on 2/11/2021. The hope of the ACDF surgery was to stop further progression of the symptoms of numbness and weakness, but was not guaranteed to restore normal function of the left side. I am currently still experiencing numbness and weakness in left side postoperatively.

                                                Within minutes of the vaccine (in my right deltoid), the heavy/warm/numb sensation radiating from the vaccine site moved up my right shoulder to the right side of my neck. There was no itching.  One hour after my vaccine, the heavy/warm/numb sensation moved into the entire right side of my face, though my facial movement was unaffected. I kept looking to make sure I had symmetrical movement on both sides of my face, and I did, but it took several hours for that sensation to subside.   Note: My daughter and sister have had intermittent Bell&#39;s Palsy (unrelated to vaccination) in the past, but I never have. I was concerned that might be what was about to happen, but it subsided. I&#39;ve not heard of any of my relatives having this reaction to the vaccine, so I wanted to report it for data keeping purposes.

                                                My left arm was very sore , red and hurting pretty bad. I went to bed around 10:00pm thinking everything was ok and it was a normal reaction. Woke up around 1:30am arm hurting so I got up to get some more tylenol. I immediately felt sick to my stomach (both ways) and I passed out and broke my nose.  I was coherient at times and other times I could not seem to answer any questions. My husband got me to the ER and they took my blood pressure 4 or 5 times and the nurse said &#34;I can&#39;t get a blood pressure&#34;. Another nurse came in and said we will take this one ! My blood pressure had bottomed out and caused all sorts of things going on. I left ER after 4 1/2 hrs. with a BP of 107/57 but I am not sure how low it got! At one point my husband looked at monitor and my bottom number was 39 but it is all a blur to me. As of today I still feel week (heavy arms) and I am concerned about taking my second dose!

During the first 2 days, I experienced &#39;typical&#39; side effects--chills, fatigue, joint and muscle pain,  and a headache.  However, there is one effect that still lingers.  Ever since having the shot, I have had a stiff neck on the right side.   Where it&#39;s stiff, there is also a pinkish-purplish &#39;stripe&#39; underneath the skin on my neck, which runs from my right ear to my clavicle.  It&#39;s a few centimeters wide.

I&#39;m hoping tomorrow is better. I read that the Moderna dose may be higher than what is needed. I am only 120lbs. I am afraid to get the second dose because I&#39;ve read the 2nd dose is usually more intense reaction for most people.

I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

                                                Neurological response/trigger  - severe leg pain and weakness in both legs. Extremely difficult to walk and not able to climb stairs.  Disrupted sleep (woke up in pain throughout the night). This lasted for a couple of weeks, the worst (debilitating) being 48 hours from initial onset.  I also had difficulty breathing and nausea about 15m after injection which lasted for about 24 hours, then subsided.   I contacted my neurologist, Dr., early next morning, and notified her of what happened and she advised that I increase the dosage of gabapentin until symptoms resolved. After 48 hours, I began to walk without experiencing so much pain and weakness, and it slowly subsided over the course of a couple of weeks. I still experience flares of pain in both of my legs periodically.

I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

Felt like when I had mono. Had headache, back and neck aches, fever of 100.2. Felt like glands were swollen. After 4 hours, symptoms began to subside, but still mildly present. Fever subsided and was gone from 11AM on. Injection site pain still present with redness. Skin felt very sensitive on the arms Today, 12-31, felt good, no fever, slightly tired, but good enough to work. Came to work and when in the process of writing this RL, I was reviewing the side effects and looked at my injection site. It looked red so I asked a coworker, who thought it looked like hives. We had our medical director and PA look at it and although they didn&#39;t feel like it looked like hives, I developed hives on my chest, neck and chin while they were in here. Called employee health who recommended either PCP or urgent care. Went to urgent care. During visit, hives began to subside, had 99.6 fever at the beginning of the visit, 98.7 at the end of the visit. Rapid COVID test was negative. Received inhaler for asthma and returned to work at 1245 today.

My lymph node (armpit where vaccination was administered) is swollen and painful, neck hurts, and have a very low fever.  The vaccination site is swollen, warm, hard and has a red circle below injection site that was the size of a nickel day 1 but now it takes up my entire deltoid region&#34;.

                                                I started to have mild symptoms (malaise, flush feeling and then numb, tingling, weak hands followed by joint pain) in the afternoon of 1/7. The symptoms progressively worsened into what my husband (an immunologist) called an intense hyperimmune response. I had severe COVID symptoms (intensified from my experience having the virus in Sept): fever 100-102, flushed face, intense muscular and some neurologic symptoms--joint arthralgia and myalgia, headache, shivers/rigors, extreme weakness (especially my hands) and later I could barely stand or walk, glandular pain with minor swelling (axillary and neck), nausea, and my hearing was temporarily diminished--nearly lost for a few minutes; tylenol 500 mg taken the night of 1/7. The intense symptoms have subsided. Currently I am tired, weak, achy, and afebrile (last ibuprofen 200 mg taken last night). My hands remain weak.

                                                symptoms started about 20 hours after vaccine- extreme muscle aches and joint pain to the point movement of any kind was unbearable. Extreme chills, headache, nausea - I took Advil and Tylenol every 4 hours and nothing eased the pain. After all day of suffering I started to vomit and have severe chest and stomach pain and went to local ER.

A few mintues later she developed tachycardia (she did not wait the 15 minutes she was supposed to wait before moving).  Her heart was racing in the 120s. About 15 minutes after the injection, she started having a tingling sensation in her left face. About an hour (maybe two hours) after the shot, she developed a heaviness in her leg on the left.  She was able to move it, but it felt heavy.   Pt continues to report intermittent heaviness, weakness and paresthesia on L side of face and in L upper and lower extremities x10days

Over the next couple hours: muscle aches, nausea, sharp pain in joints, headache, chills, fatigue. Unable to sleep that night due to all-over muscle pain, like having the flu. Very uncomfortable. Severe chills overnight. Next morning, same symptoms plus cough. Nausea worsened. I was unable to work at my computer or care for my 6-year-old son. I was camped out on the couch all day, in and out of naps, covered in blankets. Around dinner time, all symptoms started lifting. A bit of nausea remained, plus cough. I slept VERY well that night -- best I&#39;ve slept in years. The next morning, I was completely normal and felt better than I did before the vaccine.

Developed what felt like swollen nares, a little more difficult to breath and developed a weird smell  that I can only describe as &#34;dog poop&#34;.    at 1900 arm was so painful I could not lift it, like being stabbed.  Took 600mg ibuprofen and 2 tablets of  Benedryl to sleep.  Breathing just fine, still bad smells. Friday 1/15: 0600, pain in arm severe still and did not have full range of motion.  Weakness in hand.  Developed neck pain.  Temp 99.  No medications.    15:00, developed severe myalgia on right side of body and back (like a bad flu).  Temp 102.0,   Fatigue, and still bad smells.    Took 600mg ibuprofen for headache and neck pain. Saturday:  (sorry no times), temp remained at 99 until the evening then went to normal.  Injections site is red, hot, painful over entire deltoid.  Able to move arm more normal, just sore.  No medications needed.  The weird smell went away.  Mild-moderate fatigue Sunday:  Felt like I usually do after a vaccine, just a little tired and a little sore.

On Sunday evening around 7, started itching and turning red and the lump was no longer noticeable. By 9 there was a ring of welts around the injection site, with a pale area in the middle about 4 cm in diameter. Red, swollen area was 12x14 cm, extending downward from the site in an L shape. Mild pain and stiffness, very warm to the touch. Took 25 mg of Benadryl  at 9 pm with minimal improvement to itching and no other changes to the site.  Had been taking my normal meds throughout the day for a migraine that started 1/16, last dose being 600 mg Motrin just before 9 pm 1/17. Given 10 mg IV dexamethasone by mouth around 10:45 pm. At 8 am 1/18, the site was less swollen, had not extended past markings, and was less warm to the touch. Still some mild pain. Prescriptions for Prednisone 20 mg daily x 5 days and Keflex 500 mg QID x 10 days provided.

Was taken to the nurse&#39;s station and given fluids and graham crackers and observed for 30 minutes.  Was feeling well enough to leave.  Later that evening and throughout the weekend, I continued to experience fatigue, lightheadedness, brain fog, nausea. two days later, I also developed a moderate headache and sore throat.  I slept long hours for two nights, and by Monday morning, the fatigue and nausea remained, but were mild.  Within a weak, my symptoms had dissipated.  However, on the morning of Day 8, my injection site had become more red, swollen, and itchy.  These symptoms are still present on Day 11.

She stated that after the vaccine she had the regular sore arm, muscle aches and pain, swelling and redness at injection site, diarrhea and headache (72 hours). The swelling at injection site didn&#39;t go down until day 6.  On day 7 it came back worse than it started and the patient went into her doctor and they decided it may be a delayed reaction response. At last time of contact patient was going into doctor office again thinking she may need to start antibiotics as it may be cellulitis. The injection site was very far back on the deltoid and MD thinks it may have gone into the soft tissue instead of the muscle.

                                                I had my first Covid 19 vaccine on 12/31/2020; I was obviously a little nervous and after the shot I was a bit light headed (likely related to stress and after some deep breathing it went away).  The next few days I had pain in my arm and it hurt to lift it.  As well I had pain in my elbow and shoulder joints. Stomach issues and a headache followed.  About 8 days after my injection, my arm swelled up, bright red and tender to touch with a fever. Noted small red welt encompassing injection site and about a 1/2 dollar coin size red mark (similar to the one above).  It continued to spread across my upper arm and the swelling was quite significant. Went to the doctors, they thought it was Cellulitis and treated for this. However, after 5 days being on antibiotics it was back with a vengeance. This time it started on outer and inner part of my arm; welts on back of arm and rash on part of arm closest to chest; it burned, itched like crazy and was again feverish. Back to the doctors, doctor thought it odd that it came back even though I have 5 more days of antibiotics to take and stated she believes it to be a post injection site reaction (not necessarily an allergic reaction, but definitely a reaction to either the need or what was in the needle). I was put on another antibiotic, prednisone and benadryl. This was Wednesday 1/13/2021 (2 weeks after my vaccine, noticed the welts on Tuesday 1/12/2021) and today is 1/17/2021; it is still very much there.  Less red, less irritated, less painful...still quite itchy.  With that said, doctor advised not to get the shot, but if I decide to I need to take benadryl and ibuprofen before the shot and be monitored for another reaction, possibly worse than this one. I also spoke to the place where I got my vaccine and they advised the same per-steps before getting the second dose on 1/28/2021.

The next morning when I woke up I was unable to move my shoulder without excruciating pain. I had almost no range of motion. I had absolutely no strength. I started to take ibuprofen and cycle with Tylenol. I treated with heat, ice, icy hot and salon pass patches. My pain is located where my joint or rotator cuff would be located. I had no deltoid pain this time. My shots were both from the same lot. It is now eight days and I have some relief but still some pain, loss of motion and loss of strength. When I reported it to health programs they asked me to fill out this form. I am going to continue on the same regimen and hope it resolves itself. I have been doing a lot of things one-handed and trying to avoid use of my left arm.

The arm pit - the swelling has gone down but still a little sore. The armpit hadn&#39;t gotten better when I had my second dose on January 26th.

                                                At 10pm I got chills which lasted for 2 hours. Those subsided only to be replaced by fever. I took Tylenol every 5 hours during the night. At some point during the night I also became nauseous. My fever broke at some time early morning. I got out of bed at 9am and took a shower. After my shower while washing up, I became light headed.  I went and laid down in bed for a few minutes. That passed and I was able to get up and dry my hair. My arm and neck hurts and I have a headache. My neck started to hurt while I was waiting during my 15 minutes after the vaccination, but it was very minor and I thought I just hadn&#39;t noticed it earlier,  but it is definitely more sore this morning.

I took my temperature orally (the only thermometer I had at home), it was 101.9.  I took Tylenol, it helped a little. I was lethargic throughout the day. My head and neck hurt all day and into Sunday, even with Tylenol. I did not sleep well Saturday to Sunday, started coughing, but only when laying down, (maybe allergy related?) so I sat up and slept in a chair. I woke up Sunday without a fever, no Tylenol, but still had achy neck and a slight headache. I did continue to take Tylenol because my neck and head still hurt.  But I was able to move around, a little, if I overdid it, I had to sit.

Fortunately her O2 sat is 100% on room air, she is not tachypneic. Her lungs demonstrate no wheezing, her oropharynx is widely patent. She was observed for 3 hours after given Benadryl, Pepcid and Solu-Medrol, was able to ambulate to the bathroom. Still with some remaining symptomatology but appears more comfortable. Will discharge with close outpatient follow-up with PCP and neurologist. Recommended patient follow-up with her neurologist and her PCP regarding guidance regarding second vaccination dose as this did not truly represent an anaphylactic reaction but still symptoms could worsen with second vaccine.

                                                About 4 hours after the vaccine, I experienced sudden nausea and abdominal pain. The symptoms lasted for about a week. They were intermittent at first. I had 3 episodes of sharp adominal pain that radiated up my back and made me short of breath. I felt pain between my shoulder blades when I tried to breathe in. The first two subsided, but the third episode on 02/16/21 was more pronounced. I felt generally unwell, like something was really wrong. I first thought it was a normal immune response or side effect. But the nausea and abdominal pain had grown worse. On 02/16/2021 I went to the ER, where a CT Scan showed I had Epiploic Appendagitis. I suspect the inflammation or a sudden ischemic event after my vaccine had caused this. I had absolutely no such symptoms prior to the vaccine, but the nausea came on exactly 4 hours after my first dose like a switch had been turned on.    In addition to the above, I experience facial flushing on the left side of my face for about 7 days after the vaccine. My forehead and right side of my face would read a normal temperature, but my left cheek averaged 101 degrees. The flushing would come on suddenly, often in the evening. I also had heart palpitations.   Other symptoms: I had the typical sore left arm for a few days. I developed joint pain on my left side, including my arm and my jaw. In general, I feel like I had a pronounced inflammatory response.

She states she did not have any of this pain before. The medical assistant checked the arm and there was no redness and swelling at the time. The patient waited her 15 minutes and she states she had no relief in the issue. We offered her a ice pack but she declined. The Doctor talked to the patient and advised that the muscle may be sore and that she should experience less pain over the next 24 hours. He advised she could take Tylenol and use ice if the arm became red, swollen and to reduce pain. Her arm did not have any swollen or redness when The Doctor examined it. Patient was informed to contact her PCP to advise of the reaction and to keep in touch with him. We also advised the patient to call The Doctor Saturday morning at the office if she was having any further issues or not feeling better.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced intense pain and immobility in my left arm.  I had soreness as one would expect after receiving the injection but this was different.  I took ibuprofen and went to bed. I awoke several times in the night after rolling over in bed with pain.  I awoke in the morning and could not move my arm. My husband had to assist me in dressing.   That day (two days following vaccine), I had myalgia, neck pain, mild headache, fatigue, and a low grade fever.   My arm continued to be very painful although no swelling or redness.  The following morning (three days following vaccine), although I still had pain and decreased mobility, it was improved.  I am filing this report on the evening of 1/8/2021. Although I am not back to baseline, I anticipate that I will be in the next few days.  I thought it was important to report this given the severity of my symptoms.

                                                Just mild arm soreness day 2 and 3.  No symptoms through the entire week and weekend after, then Monday afternoon (1/11/21) I noticed a pain developing on the underside of the arm, just around from the injection site (if you drew a line from the top of the arm where the injection was delivered to the underside immediately under site).  As the afternoon progressed in to the evening the pain became even greater.  When I used that arm to steady myself over the sink while brushing my teeth it was definitely greater while my muscle was flexed.  It feels deep inside my arm, almost deep center, and is heading up in to my armpit.

                                                I received the shot at 8:10 am and felt nothing.  As the morning progressed, I developed a sore arm, similar to a flut shot.  However, it was worse, and I also felt achy in my neck.  I drove home from work around noon, and I couldn&#39;t even use my arm on the steering wheel.  These symptoms continued and I finally took Tylenol in the middle of the afternoon, and evening going to bed.  I slept horribly and woke up feeling like a train wreck.  I took my temperature. It was 102!  I started taking the Tylenol again.  I couldn&#39;t even raise my arm, either. My arm didn&#39;t hurt if it was just still, but it would hurt if it was touched, and I could not raise it for 3 days.  Despite taking the Tylenol, I felt awful all day and really had to stay bedridden.  I was also very thirsty both the day of the vaccine and this second day.  Saturday morning I woke up feeling better, but as the day wore on, the aches and fever came back.  Sunday was the same as Saturday.  Monday was similar, but better overall.  Today is Tuesday.   My arm still feels a little weird and I cannot completely raise it. I did have the COVID-19 back in March and have antibodies, as far as I know as I have donated to Red Cross 4 times.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving my injection on Thursday, I noticed my upper lip felt like it was swelling.  Over the next 30 minutes, I felt the same in my lower lip and cheeks.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl at that time.  I slept for nearly 20 hours after that.  On Friday, I experienced severe body aches from head to toe.  I felt somewhat better Saturday.  I woke up Sunday with nausea and dizziness that lasted all day and evening.  I woke up feeling better Monday morning but noticed 2 enlarged lymph nodes above my collar bone and pain from my R deltoid, across my shoulder and into my lower neck.  It is Tuesday and and the lymph nodes are painful to touch and I&#39;m experiencing 5/10 pain in my upper arm, shoulder R side and back of neck and above my R scapula.  I am considering calling my PCP.

I was answering the text messages and there was not anywhere to document what was going on because I felt fine.  I stopped getting the texts today so I couldn&#39;t talk with anyone about how swollen my lymph nodes under my arm is. I have not been able to get anyone on the phone to ask what to do.  It is a very strange coincidence that my nodes are swollen for the first time in my life and the only thing that is different is that I received the vaccination.

They determined it was muscle pain  as all test came back normal.

                                                The day of the vaccine I just felt a little tired but the next morning I felt extremely tired, joint/body aches and chills. I also had fever and called my PCP and told them what was going on they suggested me to take Tylenol (100.2F) 500mg my doctor told me to take 600mg. The fever started going down. At night I took 1000mg and the fever went away I still felt very drained, tired and the next day as well. I did not go to work because of that.  I have a mild pain on my neck, close to my spine cord and also I have a sore throat now. I also don&#39;t have sense of smell and my face is painful/sore - my doctor told me that my sinus cavities are all inflamed and that is why it is painful. Not sure if the vaccine made it worse or not, but it is happening.  I also am having dry eyes for about a week and a half and it feels like I have &#34;light&#34; coming out of my eyes.  Specially when I am in front of a computer for a long time. It is not double vision, it is like a &#34;hologram light(?)&#34; a colorful light coming from my eyes. It is also painful.  About ten min after I took the vaccine I felt a &#34;medicine taste&#34; in my mouth, and in the back of my throat/tongue and that is when my throat started feeling scratchy/sore. I had Covid on 05/18/2020 (positive)

                                                Chills started around 10:30 the evening of the 2nd dose. After going to bed I started getting a sever headache as well as joint, muscle pain, and a shooting pain into my left hand/fingers lasting all night. Dizziness and heart racing when I got up several times to use the bathroom. The chills stopped sometime in the early morning but the fatigue, headache and muscle and joint pain lasted through out the next day. Tylenol was taking every 6 hrs and helped relieve most of the pain. I did not seek treatment. The second day out I am still feeling fatigued and slight headache but seems to be getting better.

                                                Severe bone and joint pain started about 21 hours after the injection and lasted for approximately 36 hours. I took oxycodone (7.5mg), but  it only took the edge off of the pain. It felt like a nasty RA flare up. Since then, I have more bone and joint pain than usual. I am afraid to take the second dose.   Insomnia since receiving the injection. (ongoing) I can&#39;t be sure that this is related to the vaccine, but I work with others who are also experiencing ongoing insomnia since receiving the Moderna vaccine.

                                                About 5 minutes after the vaccine, I felt like the vaccine going through my body, mu fingers kept tingling, heart rate started to race. They game me some orange juice and monitored me for about 15 minutes. I went back to work and I felt shaky for about 3-4 hours. I then had a terrible headaches and back ache. That same night I got some hives and chest tightness with increased in throat production and the headache continued that night.  The next day I still felt tired and achy, felt like a mild flu. I had chest tightness with difficulty breathing.  I continued to feel sick Saturday and Sunday and Monday I had a Covid test done, which was negative.  On Monday I had rashes on my arms and legs and continued to have the hives and on Tuesday I started to feel a bit better with a dry cough.  On Tuesday 01-12-220 I had a chest x-ray which was negative.  On Wednesday, I woke up and felt much worse and that&#39;s when I called the NP and she prescribed three inhalers for my breathing issues. On 01-27-2020, since I was still feeling not better I called off work.  As now, I am slowly getting better, but I still continued with the hives.

Kept up and got more pronounced throughout week and started feeling burning sensations in both arms through Feb 15th. Self referred to Neurology on Feb. 16th.  Feb 17th, began to feel worse, spreading to both legs feeling weak, burning sensation, fatigue, and began feeling VERY foggy brained.  Have been sleeping a lot, but legs and arms go from burning sensations, weakness, to cold sensations, and achy right leg thigh muscle, to this moment.  Brain fog and fatigue seem worst in morning.

                                                The initial symptoms started out as the typical potential side effects such as muscle aches, low grade fever, headache, and overall malaise. The symptoms progressed throughout the evening of the vaccine administration as pretty intense myalgia mostly in lower extremities. On day 3 post vaccine as I recovered from the typical symptoms I noticed some minor weakness in my legs as I resumed normal activity. That progressed to muscle spasms all over my body that were like rapid fire from one area to the next. It started primarily in my right thigh but then moved all over to upper and lower body as well as left and right sides of the body. This did not hurt but was a bit concerning and definitely out of the norm. I would say the spasms peaked on days 4-5 post vaccination and then gradually decreased in frequency over the following week. Each day got a little better until I had very intermittent spasms in my left shoulder until they went away completely.

It started to get better 3 days after, but it didn&#39;t go completely back to my normal, and I am already on the 10th day after the vaccine. Today I woke up again with chills, joint, and muscle aches, and I am having cough, sniffle, watery eyes, and sneezing.  Since I have asthma and allergies in this period of the year, it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise, but the fatigue, chills, feeling sleepy, and body aches, make me wonder if this is still related to the vaccination, or it could be that I was unfortunately infected with COVID roughly at the same time  I got the shot?  I had to stay for 15 minutes at the vaccine place, there were other people, we were 6 feet apart, but the room was not well ventilated, so who knows.

It is now  1 week after the rash developed and 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine and the rash and itchiness are still present. The rash is also growing in diameter. It is now covering most of my upper arm.  I have also suffered from neck pain since having the injection. This is subsiding though.

Resulting in bursitis,  a very painful joint and restricted movement of the arm/shoulder.  The patient was given 40 mg of Prenisone for 7 days and 10 mg of Toradol every 6 hours as needed for 5 days.  This was resolved in 48 hours. The patient also experienced vomiting twice, on the third day after the administration of the vaccine. She also experienced a headache four days after the administration. This patient tested positive for COVID in mid November.  She had severe, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headaches during her acute phase.

Fever 102.5 on Sunday, fatigue and body aches. Localized pain at injection site. Yesterday she felt better. Highest temp yesterday was 101.5. She noticed redness and swelling on Sunday and this morning she noticed it is larger-swelling and redness the size of a silver dollar that is hot to the touch. She is unsure of her temperature today and does not feel febrile today. She does not feel well today-feels body aches and general malaise. Her arm is painful, 5/10, and radiates up into shoulder and neck and causing a headache. Her right jaw was painful on Sunday and Monday. If she applied pressure to her jaw the pain would subside. Reports diarrhea Sunday into Monday that has since subsided. Employee reports being diagnosed with COVID on 11/15/2020.

                                                My first symptoms were expected-- sore arm and slightly tired feeling -- a few days later my shoulder itched where I got the shot. Then a week later, two things-- and one is PMS. Obviously not the shot but I mention this as it is possible that these side effects are related to the PMS. On Sunday 1/3/2021 I was experiencing breast tenderness PMS and that extended under my arms and by the end of that day my glands were swollen and hard in my right armpit. The next morning, they were still hard and swollen and the glands are still today. While I often have breast tenderness, I have never had swollen glands or painful underarms as part of this. Also yesterday 1/4 my right shoulder near where I received the vaccine was i was itchy and it continues to be and red and also hard there... I don&#39;t want to overplay any of these symptoms and they might well relate to PMS but I think in this instance particularly with the very painful swollen glands on the right underarm it&#39;s important to report them

Temperature highs ranged from 100.8-101.4, and I felt as badly as when I had COVID-19 in March 2020. I was unable to go to work as scheduled on Friday 1/8 and Saturday 1/9. I am concerned about getting the 2ND DOSE as it has been stated that 2nd dose may create more severe symptoms than the first. PLEASE ADVISE. Also, is there a correlation between having had COVID-19 and having strong &#34;side effects&#34; to the vaccine? Please advise. Thank you!

Coworker mentioned my complexion was yellow and eyes were red. Feels faint and fell over but didn?t lose consciousness. Saturday felt lightheaded and still went to work and passed out at work. Today is Monday 10 days after vaccine. I can?t work or drive due to weakness, lightheaded and faint. I?m slow with speech and get confused very easily. Didn?t recognize my own kitchen at one point. Wasn?t sure where my bathroom was earlier. No appetite. Sharp pains randomly in my head.

By 730p the temp was 102.8 with chills/muscle pain/tremors/nausea.  Began the fever reducing strategy.  No response - fever continued to climb and symptoms became worse until about 11pm.  Temp was 103.8 -took additional meds, cool water soak.  Temp finally began to respond and came back down in the 102 range.  Continued fever for an additional 4-5 hours.   I took fever reducers and cool water.  I was able to keep the temperature below 104.  I did not seek medical attention.

My skin and joints felt inflamed and very hot. The injection arm was untouchable and hurt badly for 48 hrs.  The pain was close to excruciating.  It hurt to move it hurt to stay still.  I moaned and cried in pain.   I treated it with motrin and Tylenol alternately. I felt a little relief sat at 2pm then it kicked back in around 6pm sat night.  Through sun and Mon the pain faded a little at a time and I still get shooting pain into my joints.  My insides were so raw I acquired a scratch down the back of my throat and probably esophagus that is still blistered and I can taste the ulcerations.  I have never had a reaction to flu or other vaccines.  I expected achey etc but this was a little extreme!  I had blood on my qtips this morning from my ears. &#34; Advised to contact PCP ASAP.

                                                following day after shot: body aches and pains that seemed to move around: in back, neck, limbs, hips; slight cramping in feet and calves, exhaustion, weak, coughing, earache, weird sensation in arm where the shot was given and some swelling at that site. Pain got less as each day went on and subsided a few days later. Sore throat a few days later in glands area but only lasted a day. Sciatic nerve flared up afterwards...still dealing with that and it&#39;s 2 weeks later but I have had issues with that before: still tired but not as tired, ears bothering me and some nasal congestion but not unusual for this time of year.

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

                                                During time of COVID-19 Moderna vaccination, was taking Allegra Allergy medicine daily. On 2/15/2021, the vaccine was given and in the following 2 days afterwards, there was pain at the injection site and Tylenol was taken, then later a little Ibuprofen. In addition, experienced mild fatigue. At Day 11, on 2/26/2021 after 1st Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administration, had a fist-sized red, inflamed rash appear on upper left arm. This included both the area of vaccine intramuscular shot was administered, as well as the area directly underneath on the upper left arm. There was some hardness spots noted, as well. However, did not experience itchiness, but the reddened arm area did hurt when it was brushed up against a wall by accident. It reddened and was warm to the touch,  over the next 1.5 days before medication of Zyrtec allergy 24-hour tablet taken and a cold press placed externally on the arm site. The plan is to continue Zyrtec for 5 days.  Allegra tablet was stopped at Medical Primary Care&#39;s direction, as she does not recommend it during adminstration of the COVID-19 vaccine. Upcoming 2nd dose is due 2/12/2021 and is expecting to take it; but, in the right arm instead.

                                                Five in a half hours after vaccine ,vaccinated arm became more sore, soreness traveled up arm to fingers and spread to rest of arm and body as time passed.  Body aches progressed and became more intense, went to bed.  Was unable to sleep, had a left ear ache and neck ache that intensified as the night went on.  I was unable to move at all in bed, I was sweating and in SEVERE  pain I was finally was able to crawl out of bed at 5:30 and took some aspirin.  The aspirin only took the edge off for a few hours as I tried to sleep,the ear ache and the headache intensified.  If I would of had a pain killer I would have taken it, as I was in so much body ache pain.  Stayed in bed all day until the evening and continued to take aspirin every 4-6 hours, used a heating pad and pushed water.  Applied CBD ointment which helped quite a bit.  Every hour that passed in the evening the intense pain would subside a bit and by 8:30 pm I started to feel like I was feeling back to normal.  Day two rested and have body aches but am able to control the pain with aspirin.  Ear pain almost gone, left neck pain almost gone, right neck pain started and is controlled.  Sweating  with a low grade fever and fatigued.

                                                This is for the EAU for the Moderna vaccine.   Due to recent injury to my left side, including an old Rotator Cuff injury on the left, I opted for my right arm.   As with the first dose, the actual injection was nearly painless. The first dose resulted in localized pain to upper left arm for a day or two. Second dose was significantly different. I have a headache that is nearly the worst in my life (and I&#39;ve recently cracked or traumatized my skull on 1/5/2021). If I laugh, cry, raise my voice, the pain increases to &#34;worst ever&#34; but only stays there for a few moments. The pain is around the base of my head and facial bones, particularly strong behind the eyes.    In addition to this monumental headache, I have the same fleshy soreness to the arm as occurred last time. Except this is extremely more painful. Extending my arm forward  feels very painful for the entire joint. Even flexing my muscles in that arm leads me to a severe pain in the entire arm that is most intense in the joint.   My fever --- With acetaminophen ---  is about 102*. I am having chills, exhaustion, wheezing. I feel like the worst hangover of my life (I&#39;ve only ever had one, this dwarfs it).   I understand that &#34;If it hurts, that means it works.&#34; so probably these are minor symptoms that will pass, but I had no idea how difficult it would be!

Pain occured when shot was administered.  I felt needle moving in mass/muscle.  The pain increased the longer the needle was inserted.  I actually let out a muffled yell at the same time the nurse removed needle.   The pain is a 6/7 on a scale of 10.   I cannot lift my arm without experiencing pain.  When I walk my left side/shoulder is lowered.  The left side feels weighted.

                                                At 8 PM the day of the shot (Thursday), my arm became extremely sore and I was very tired.  I went to bed.  By 9 PM  I had chills and could not get warm. I dozed off and on until roughly 12:20 when I got up and vomited.  I dozed from then until 5 AM continuing to have chills and vomited 3 more times. I  got up and proceeded to work.  By 10 AM (Friday) I was unable to stay at work as I continued to have chills, exhaustion,  muscle aches,  a headache, and was unable to focus on the easiest task. I had also dry heaved 2 more times. Upon arriving at home I got into bed and slept until 8:30-8:50 AM the next morning which was Saturday.  Saturday I was able to eat crackers and soda without issue.  I was just extremely tired. No more chills, mild muscle aches and a slight headache still.  Slept a full 9 hours and was fine on Sunday.

                                                No pain with injection.  Left shoulder pain began around 4 pm the same day, unable to raise left upper extremity against gravity without severe shoulder pain.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol immediately after injection and 600 mg of Advil at 9 pm as well as used Ice to decrease swelling and pain.  The pain increased and I was unable to sleep at all secondary to pain.  The shoulder pain has continued and loss of active shoulder range is apparent.  I am stretching and taking NSAIDS as able for the pain.  I have been unable to sleep well since receiving the vaccine secondary to the pain.   Today is day 7 and I am slowly getting back some active range however I continue to increased shoulder and peri scapular pain that limits my ability at home and at work.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving vaccination, I started to sweat profusely. almost immediately  pain started in my Lt eye which progressed to my Lt side of the head and Lt side of the neck started to stiffen up. About 20-25 minutes later, I started to feel tingly (like goosebumps) on my Lt side of the body and felt cold on the same side. All these symptoms lasted for the whole night but did not get any worse though.

The next day, my left arm hurt and I developed a red patch around where I received the shot. The important thing was that the red area spread all over my upper arm and became hard, indurated, mildly swollen and very itchy and didn?t resolve for at least 2 weeks. It?s 3 weeks out and the area is still mildly discoloured, (red), though I have no pain, hardness or swelling. I think antihistamines helped.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA received on Saturday.  Sunday morning in the middle of my sleep, I woke feeling hot and sweaty, slightly nauseated, and like I had to defecate.  I stood up, felt like low blood pressure but wanted to get to the bathroom.  I walked towards the door, opened the door and fainted, falling backwards.  My spouse  states I was pale,staring at the ceiling and kind of stiff in my arms and legs for about 3 minutes.  He spoke to me, checked my pulse, covered me, poked my feet. As I came back to awareness I tried to speak and was unintelligible but then became more conscious.  He tested me with questions to make sure I was ok.  I defecated after that but did not vomit.  I was tired the rest of the day and napped for several hours.  I don&#39;t seem to have hurt anything in the fall.  I am instructed to be off work Monday by my supervisor.

By day 3, it was gone. I took some ibuprofen to helpthe injection site. Day 9 started feeling unusual ?quarter sized? specific pain sites (left upper thigh, right upper thigh, left wrist). One spot at a time until today day 11 and each spot throbs in sync. Not sure if it?s related but thought since it?s a strange and unusual occurrence it may have something to do with the vaccine.

Later that night around about 2:40am I was awakened with a headache that has been constant since then. Around or about 5am I started feeling generalized malaise and aching joints including eye sockets. Aching is mild to moderate about a 4-5 on pain scale.  Low grade temperature of 99.7F

I was so sick that I had to take pain killer all day long around the clock.  Luckly it went away by Thursday morning but I had lower back pain around my tail bone as a new symptom.  I still have hard time walking and changing postures freely.  I ended up going to ER.  ER doctor confirmed that it was a reaction to covid vaccine.  I was dischared witih pain killers and muscle relaxant.  Today is Jan 19, I still have same symptoms.

Tried to take Tylenol - it didn&#39;t take it away -  maybe slowed it down but then it came back. Thursday morning - I woke up really sick - joints hurt, hot and feverish and I called ambulance. My temp was over 100 degrees. They took me to ER. They took my temp there and it was 101.6. The Dr. requested morphine and I was given that for the pain. They observed me for awhile and sent me home with Tylenol with Codeine (300 mg). The morphine helped and I came home and I went to sleep and the next day my pain was not as bad as it was the day before. I was able to start moving around even though I was still achy. By third day I was feeling better. By fourth day, I was doing a lot better and the pain had gone back down. Felt shortness of breath when I first got symptoms and was using my inhaler. My shortness of breath lasted a little longer - for about a week. Had a Telehealth visit with doctor to refill meds if I needed it.

Muscle and bone aches through my spine and hips, nausea with some vomiting, chills, severe weakness, no recordable fever but felt feverish, skin hurt. Woke up Tuesday drenched in sweat but the bone pain had subsided. Still very weak, nauseous, continued in bed. Woke up today feeling on fire, eyes burning hot, skin no longer hurt but felt hot.  Injection site hurt through Sunday-no redness, no rash or swelling.  I took Tylenol and Advil throughout.  My previous trunk rash completely disappeared. I began taking the prednisone last night. 50mg BID. I have a 5 day supply.  Took a Covid test on Monday-results pending.  Tried to see my doctor today giving them the above information-there were no appts til Friday and I was referred to the ED.  I will not go to the ED where I could actually catch Covid. I was unable to get past phone triage with the doctors office.

I had not felt this since surgery 5 years ago. (Lasted about 15 minutes). 1/13/21 went to work, a little extra tired, went to bed early. Woke up in the night with severe pain in hands, had hard time sleeping. I called off work and slept most of the day 1/14/21. When I woke up 1/15/21 I could not put my full weight on my left leg without pain running from behind my knee up my outer thigh. I called my Dr and took Tylenol and worked a mostly sedentary job.

Although we don?t think it?s related I will mention I experienced tightened upper back muscles to the point that I couldn?t sit up from my bed the Wednesday morning after receiving the vaccine. Similar tightness (could barely turn my head as well the following day as well). Some stiffness is still present today.

Sometimes the next day,  I noticed rashes developed on both sides of neck,  started near the angle of mandible and travelled down towards the clavicles.

                                                Muscle pain on the arm that radiated to shoulder, neck and head. The pain started in the arm but in half an hour the pain eventually progressed.  I had no fever but I felt feverish and achy. The injection site was so swollen.  It was so hard like I had the muscle of a body builder.  It was so painful too.  The pain  and swelling lasted for 2 days.

                                                Office visit 1/26: The employee is having right-sided back pain radiating down to her knee since 1/19/2021. She relates this pain to a vaccine for Covid which she received on 1/12/2021.  She has a history of right-sided shoulder tendinitis after flu vaccine and so she refuses to get the vaccine in her deltoid muscle and usually gets vaccines in her right gluteal area.  She had the vaccine for Covid on 1/12/2021 in the right hip area a little bit higher than where she normally gets it.  She developed some redness to the injection site which subsided but soon afterwards began having right-sided sacral pain and then right-sided knee pain. The pain is described as a ache and burning.  She does not have numbness and tingling down her leg.  And she does not have any limitation in terms of flexion or extension of her back but she finds that she cannot lie on her back at night because it hurts.  She also has trouble getting out of a chair because of right knee pain. She was seen by the orthopedist,  he has ordered an EMG which came out negative, and ordered to take Naprosyn twice a day. Dx: Lumbosacral radiculopathy at L3. F/U on 1/28: At this time she still having some dull right-sided back pain and pain to her knee but it is tolerable. She has been able to rest over the course of this week as she has not gone to work. She feels at this time that she can manage her pain and is able to start working this weekend on 1/30/2021. We expect that the pain will gradually subside as the effect of the injection subsides as well.

I slept restlessly and at 3pm woke up with severe upper right arm pain and could not raise my arm. tried icing arm, eventually was able to go back to sleep. when I woke up around 8 am, my arm still hurt badly and I could not fully use it. I had to have my husband wash my hair and comb it and help me get dressed (this is not normal). I took some aleve and within a few hours I could move it some and the pain was less but I still could not do normal daily activities with it without pain and still could not raise my arm above shoulder height. I also was quite tired and took a nap mid afternoon (also not normal). My arm was still sore when I went to bed that night but not as bad. When I woke up the next morning, it was sore but I could do all of my normal activities on my own with minimal discomfort. I still feel like I have limited ROM and weakness in my right arm. I had my son help me with dinner because I could not lift a heavy skillet or roll out some dough.  I had normal amounts of fatigue today.

My arm started aching and my muscle felt tight.  When I looked I saw a big red circle around the injection site.  It was warm to the touch and sore.  I looked it up and found out that it was something that some people get.  I have not recovered yet, but expect to in a few days.

All my muscles were trembling/twitching, this started 7-8 hours after the vaccine and lasted several hours even after taking Tylenol and Advil.  chills that lasted 3 days, no fever, joint pain that lasted 3 days. Shortness of breath after taking showers, this would last a few hours after and require me to use my rescue inhaler. This would be abnormal for me as I don&#39;t normally become short of breath during or after taking a shower.   Arm pain with 2 in x 2 inch swelling just above the injection site.  9 days out and I still have a red , raised  bump at the site of the vaccination. At day 9 post injection, I am still very tired and take several naps everyday. I have not been to work in a week. I normally work 10 hour days with no problems of fatigue. Of note, I did not have any reaction other than mild arm pain at the injection site with the first vaccine that I got on 1/20/2021.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  For the first vaccine, I was not expecting much of a reaction. I have all the symptoms: soreness of injection site, headache, body/muscle ache, nausea, fatigue. I had COVID-19 in March 2020, but was only confirmed through antibody test. My antibodies now measure low. Also I am talking a dietary supplement MCT ( medium chain triglycerides). I wondered if either would exacerbate the symptoms.

                                                I had the normal arm soreness experienced by an average flu shot. It started the day after the vaccine and only lasted for 3-4 days. Everything seemed fine. Maybe 2-3 days after completing the smartphone vaccine check-ins my arm felt a little itchy. In the days that followed I had pain in my armpit,  then it streamed down my underarm making it difficult to lift or extend  my arm. As of Saturday, I have a large circular red ring on the outer injection sight portion of my arm as well as redness under my arm.  The pain and itchiness continue. I&#39;ve only used cool compresses and Advil to treat it thus far. Advil helps with the pain.

                                                I woke up in horrible pain all over my body and couldn&#39;t straighten my fingers for approximately 2 hours. It took me 3 hours to get the strength to get off couch to pee. Felt as I was being beaten in my lower back, hips and legs. Also, hurt in my neck and eyes were painful. My face and eyes were also swollen. It also felt as if a hot ice pick was being stabbed in the sides of my hips, back and thighs. I hurt all over my body, including a headache. I had hoped to die. I have had 3 children and one was a natural birth and I have never experienced so much pain and exhaustion together.  Took Tylenol and Turmeric and didn&#39;t get any relief. The injection sight was very swollen and was painful, could but lay on my left side. I was down for 3 days with the 3rd day finally able to take shower and dress.  I had diarrhea the 2nd day.  The sides of my hips hurt to touch for weeks and are still sore. I have had a lot of breathing difficulties and asthma flares. I related the asthma issues to having a new dog but now I wonder if it was due to vaccines?? I have rehomed the dog and asthma isn&#39;t getting any better. I had to miss a day of work after the 1st vaccine due to flu-like symptoms and was prepared to have a reaction to the 2nd. However, I was not prepared the  severity of a reaction I had.

                                                By 6PM my arm was swollen and red on outter left shoulder vaccine injection site. I could barely lift my left arm.  Day #2, developed large baseball sized lump under left arm pit Day #3 and #4, couldn&#39;t put my arm down  because of large lump under left arm. Day #5 swelling went down Day #6, returned from going out to dinner and tried to get out of car and my legs would not work. I fell to the ground in the garage. I couldn&#39;t speak or respond..... then my left side started to seize and convulse. My left clave, thigh, hamstring, glute and abdomen was in the worst ever constriction of cramping and convulsion. I could only scream out and cry.  After about 10 minutes my sons had to carry me into the house. I was exhuasted and fell asleep. I had a bad headache for 3 straight days and loss of dexterity and strength on my left side.

                                                Started a few hours later with Diarrhea. Then next morning just a slight sore arm (typical of flu vaccines) but then the unbelievable fatigue and muscle soreness took over and restless night sleep. When to ED and had PCR done to make sure I didn&#39;t have Covid - it was negative. Cough came and went, mostly at night. I&#39;m 3 days in and just now getting back to normal but the muscle pain and fatigue are still there. No fever. No headache.

Became nauseous and extremely dizzy. Was forced to call off from work.  Contacted the occupational health doctor at the facility where I received the vaccine (my employer) and reported my reaction.   Was advised to rest, take pain reliever and report back if symptoms were not gone after 2 days

Although lymph node swelling/tenderness was mentioned, I had pain deep in my armpit and lympadema extending from shoulder to wrist. I&#39;ve used a TENS unit crossing the armpit area to stimulate the lymph nodes, massaged and ace wrapped the arm. The swelling has gone down but is not fully back to normal.

I had a virtual visit on the 28th and got tested and got the results on the 12/29 and was positive for COVID-19.  I went to the ER on 1/3 because I just wasnt feeling well and was advised my bone marrow were throwing off immature white blood cells. And after about 8 or 9 days is when I finally began to get some relief an symptoms began to resolve.

Still had bad body aches , weak , headache.  This continued till Sunday January 17.   By afternoon I felt completely fine.

On Jan 7, 2021, I had mild pain on my armpit and left shoulder (Note: my left shoulder had an injury ~ 3 years ago. However, it only has pain now and then when the weather is cold or on rainy days). The pain on my armpit went away on Jan 15, 2021.   The mild pain in my left shoulder is still there. On Jan 9, 2021, I got a ~8 cm in diameter BCG-like rash with induration on the edges. I took Claritin one time a day for six days, and alternate Tylenol and Motrin every 12 hours for six days. It got better on Jan 12, 2021. Now the rash is almost gone.

                                                I got my vaccine at 4:00 p.m. About 10 hours (2:00 a.m.) after the vaccine I started getting aching back pain and bilateral shoulder pain.  About 12 hours after the vaccine I spiked a fever and felt like I was hallucinating.  I was unable to check my temperature until 10:30 a.m. the next morning and it was 102.4.  I had a fever, body aches, and headache the entire following day. My fever broke to 99.0 around 6:00 p.m.  I also had severe pain at the injection site that started several hours after my injection and continued to get worse.  The pain was so bad it was too painful to move my arm.  Today is day two post-vaccine, I have no fever but feel very weak and lethargic.

I took 2 Tylenol 500 mg each &amp; rested. My scalp felt like it was on fire &amp; itched severely.  My scalp was red but no lumps of bumps observed. That evening when changing into pajamas, I noticed both my legs had purple blotches from above my knees down to both feet. It looked worse when I stood. As a nurse, I knew this was mottling. I have never had this in my life. I immediately took 3 baby aspirin 81 mg each. I was so exhausted, I went to bed. 01/06/21 I woke up feeling better. My scalp still itched but not as bad. My legs were still mottled from above my knees down to feet, still worse when I stood. I took 3 baby aspirin 81 mg each at 08:00. My arm still was sore but less severe. Mild headache &amp; ache and pains in joints. The mottling in my legs has continued &amp; improved but I notice it mostly after showering now. I reported these symptoms to my doctor. He has advised not to get second dose &amp; to continue aspirin 81mg daily. Prior to getting the vaccine I informed the infection control nurse about my symptoms that began 12/23/20 &amp; the negative covid test taken on 01/04/21. She recommended I take the vaccine.

                                                Diagnosed with iritis on Jan 25. I had had irritated eyes since having covid (diagnosed on Nov 17, fairly ill) so I am not sure if had iritis before, but definitely became more symptomatic after getting vaccine, formally seen by OD on Jan 25 and diagnosed with iritis of both eyes, right greater than left. I also had symptoms post vaccine x 3 days of chills, headache, myalgias, nausea and diarrhea (same symptoms I had with covid). Treatment for iritis ocular steroids, treatment ongoing.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

                                                I do not believe my seeking medical attention was related to the vaccine, however I have been asked to provide this information. I have chronic back pain and had a microdiscectomy at the level of L4-5 in 2000. The day after I received the vaccine as above, I had an acute episode of severe back pain. I called for an appointment that day and was seen 3 days later in the facility. At that time, the pain seemed very much to be related to my chronic condition. I was referred for testing (lower back X-ray and subsequent MRI) and also saw a neurosurgeon in consultation. The testing was consistent with degenerative disc and facet disease in my lower spine. I am currently receiving physical therapy.

                                                I had a severe headache daily. I had fatigue and chills that eventually went away. On Jan 1st, the symptoms returned with a fever of 104, muscle aches and achy joints. Tylenol and Ibuprofen would only help it to go down to 101 or 102, but it would go back up. I went to urgent care around the 3rd, where they tested me for COVID but it was negative. I was still having symptoms days later, so I called my PCP. My doctor decided to do another COVID and a flu test, but both were negative. I gradually improved and then once I was fever free for 72 hours, I returned to work. I still had the headache, though. I am continuously completing my vsafe checks, but I was scared about getting the 2nd dose.  I went ahead and got it.  I had fever, chills, body aches and joint pains, but it only lasted two days.

                                                I received the shot approximately 7:20 am.  When I first got the shot I had an itchy throat approx. ten minutes after the shot with a small hot spot at the back of my tongue.  Then at approx 4:00 pm I started feeling fatigue.  I went home from work after 5:00 pm and I ate dinner and felt very fatigue and achy.  So I went to bed and had cold chills, was achy had a rapid hard heart beat and had a head ache.  When I woke the next morning I felt like I could not get out of bed, at approximately 5:10 in the morning.  My muscles felt like they could not get me up so my husband pulled me up to my feet.  I continued to walk around the house and get ready for work.  I am at work now at 9:00 am and still feeling fatigue.   I emailed my doctor to give him information of how I am reacting and questioned him whether I should receive the second shot.

These symptoms went away in about 12-18 hours, including the cough. Took tylenol .

                                                Arm turned red at injection site and hot. There was really no pain and went away within a couple of day but turned red again exactly a week later from injection date. This time it was hard, hot, red, itchy, and bigger. Dr treated it with clindamycin and dose pack of steroids. It got better after a few days. Next, I got a UTI and called my primary care physician. She ordered CIPRO and phenazopyridine. That got better but before CIPRO was finished, I got a crick in my neck that turned into excruciating pain in my neck and was unable to turn head from side to side. At the same time, my left foot became painful, red and swelled. I have been treated for arthritis in that foot 6 years ago with an injection. I have not had any problems with it since the injection.  Dr. treated my neck problem with Robaxin and a steroid dose pack. This seemed to help my foot too temporarily. Neck pain improved but not gone. It was excruciating pain up the back of my scalp at times. I can turn my head some now but it&#39;s not back normal. Can&#39;t turn it all the way.  Dr. did another injection in my foot but did not work this time. I got worse and I can no longer put any weight on that foot. I have not been able to work since January 20. Have had to apply for leave of absence and short-term disability

                                                After both doses of the Moderna vaccine, about 2-3 minutes post-injection, I noticed a metallic taste in my mouth for about 2 seconds.  The taste was there just long enough for me to notice the metallic taste and then it was gone.  I had no other adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did have the muscle aches and fatigue that been documented as common side effects post-vaccination but those eased after about 36 hours. I searched online for &#34;metallic taste&#34; but was unable to find any information as to whether this is an expected side effect, hence my reporting it now.

                                                Started with a headache and cough about an hour after the injection (Monday). I woke up the next morning (Tuesday) at 5 AM with a fever of 102.2. I then proceeded to run a fever the rest of that day up to 104.4 although I was taking both Tylenol and Motrin alternating. I also had severe muscle aches and pain and very tired. On the next day (Wednesday) my fever did not get above 102 and finally got down to 99.6 about 6pm that evening. The body aches, tiredness and pain continued that day. On Thursday the low grade fever resolved and the body aches, pains and tiredness started to lessen. On Friday I felt like myself with just some minimal tiredness. The cough also continued throughout the post vaccine period and finally resolved on Sunday.

                                                Starting several days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine I developed muscle spasms on the left side of my neck which is on the same side that I received the vaccine. This does not feel like anything like I have ever had before. Multiple muscles in my left neck feel very stiff, almost like a dystonic reaction. This continues so far 1 &amp; 1/2 weeks after vaccination.

Symptoms were even worse in the morning the next day (18-20 hours after the vaccination). Headache across scalp, pain and swelling at injection site, body aches and stiffness diffusely, significant fatigue, loss of appetite. I had to take the day following the vaccine off work--I stayed in bed most of the day until about 2:30 PM. I did not take any medication/pain medicine and the headache went away around 2 PM (26 hours after the vaccination). Other symptoms improved gradually at that time, too. By 3:00 PM (27 hours after the shot), I felt well enough to file this VAERS report.

At 25 minutes after receiving, I was driving home and all of a sudden I felt my muscles in my neck/shoulders and back tighten up.  Other than a sore arm, all was okay.  That evening I started running a temp, chills, fatigue, shortness of breath, could barely walk, headache, as if I had Covid all over again.  I called my doctor on Monday.  I stayed home in bed Monday and Tuesday and possibly Wednesday after the first injection.  I worked at home the rest of the week as I was too fatigued to get dressed and drive into town.

                                                Day 1 pain in left arm vaccine site, fatigue. Day 4 pain in left arm grew to more intense pain and spread up left shoulder to neck and left side of face and around eye area. Same exact feeling as Bell&#39;s Palsy.  Day 5 - I took Valtrex I already had 1 gm Day 6-13 doctor prescribed Prednisone 60 mg &#43; Valtrez 1 gm for first day (adjusted to 50 mg Prednisone days 7-12 due to Prednisone side effects, then 20 mg on day 13).   After day 7 facial palsy began to decrease in eye area. Overall Bell&#39;s Palsy symptoms after full course of treatment have finally subsided after day  20, for now.  Hoping they will not return.  Very scary and intense experience.  Exercise and PT helpful.

The next morning headache and lethargy and a feeling that something was not normal but nothing out of the ordinary and I thought I was lucky until 10 am (16 hours after injection) I had chills with violent shaking and could not get warm (temp never went above 100) not matter how many blankets or heating pads. Stomach upset and diarrhea. Loss of appetite and taste buds off. Severe headache (like an explosion)   with sensitivity to light and sound. Muscle cramps, joint pain and lethargy. Inability to get warm. Some symptoms still persisting 4 days later. No bruise this time and arm pain is less severe than first injection which several nurses looked at an think the first shot went too deep.

By that evening, I had the normal fatigue, headache, and sore arm at my injection site that evening which even became swollen, red, and rashy by that next morning with some joint pain but attributed to normal side effects and dismissed it. But I woke up early Sunday morning, 04:30, very sick, with a fever, chills, diarrhea, cramping and aching abdomen and joints and also developed a rash and hives on my arm, up my neck, into my hair and down my chest left chest with some swelling as well. I took some Benadryl, it went down some but continued but I called the Tele service line to be evaluated as my symptoms were getting worse, not better. I continued experiencing these side effects as they increased intensity, especially the watery diarrhea that occured almost immediately everytime I drank and the rash and hives and ache in joints. I lost all appetite and even got so nauseas it woke me from a 10 minute nap vomitingI had an appointment w/MD 04/06/2021where she prescribed Zofran and told me to take Imodium, which I did not think I could since I was told nothing but Tylenol after the vaccine.She told me to follow -up with my primary or ER if I wasn&#39;t better by Thursday, today, but didn&#39;t think my diarrhea and stomach had anything to do with my vaccine.My fever, chills, rash, hives and itchiness came back and continued throughout yesterday as soon as I tried to stop taking Benadryl and Tylenol for a day as my stomach was so upset, cramping and sore. I went online to request an appointment with my PMD for follow-up and further evaluation as I am still nauseous too, and as I discovered after trying to eat toast and rice again, my taste is off.I received no response to my requests online so I called my doctors office today and they made a special appointment by telephone @08:30pm with Dr. so I do not have to come into the Clinic and get others sick.I&#39;ve had to submit a LOA claim as well from missing now what will be 5 days of work. I hoping to be better soon.

This happened right away, and within a few hours increased in size and then remained very swollen for several days. Pain was tolerable. Sinuses are aggravated which is a usual immune response for my body.  By 2nd day, experience sleep disruption in morning (jerking awake every hour) and then slept most of the afternoon. I also started getting a pain under my armpit, like a swollen lymph node that hurt., I put up with it for two days and then took an NSAID and the pain was faint by the next day until it faded out two days later. No other side effects were experienced.

I took over the counter medication and nothing seemed to happen.  On Sunday, 01-03-2021, it was so sore that I could not swallow and the neck was sore to the touch. I went to the emergency room and they ran several tests and it was determined that I experienced an allergic reaction to the dose.  They prescribed two (2) medications.  I followed their instructions and did not report to work on 01-03 and Tuesday, 01-05-21.  The throat is still sore but getting better slowly.

When I felt it it had swelled. To say it itched is an understatement. Day 8: Right arm lymph node mildly swollen, no pain. Injection site red in area slightly larger then the area of my palm. Slightly warm and SUPER itchy. Day 9: Injection site still red, although slightly less so, slightly warm , and barely itchy.

Left sided arm/leg mobilitylimited. Jaw, head, ear and neck pain radiating up to left arm into head.  Next day after vaxx (Thurs 1/7/2021) woke up thinking it would have resolved and was worse, shaking chills, fever still elevated, face swollen and hot, difficult to stand up straight, heavy limbs and unable to walk normally. This lasted all day, very fatigued almost a change is mental alertness as well. Tried to stay hydrated, took tylenol and motrin alternatively all day, loss of taste and smell, could not focus to read anything all day and into evening of 1/7/2021.  At about 830 pm on 1/7/2021, began to feel slight improvement in balance and cognition. Went to bed early and woke up about 2 or 3 am on 1/8/2021 drenched from fever breaking I suspect. Rash on face after fever broke. Continued with tylenol and motrin and hydration, gradual improvement into early morning of 1/8/2021 and by the afternoon, I was very much improved. However, lingering parastethesias in left jaw, neck, ear and into left arm and fingers, even today 1/11/2020.

                                                Right shoulder impingement for 4 weeks prior to immunization.  Much improved with RICE and OTC ibuprofen.  So much better that I did not think twice about receiving injection in that same arm.  I  had been pain free for over one week.  Received injection to right deltoid without a problem at time of administration.  About 36 hours later injection site was so painful that it resulted in nausea, waking during the night, unable to perform ADLs, having to seek orthopedic physicians care for evaluation and meloxicam daily.  Pain has persisted beyond 3 weeks post injection.  I received a referral for physical therapy.  I am still struggling with pain that continues to wake me during the night.  I am a 55 year old female who has delivered three children and I would describe this pain at injection site from three weeks ago as the most pain I have ver experienced in my life time.  Pain still remains at injection site and radiates to the shoulder joint and up into the neck.  Currently receiving  physical therapy treatment for the pain and discomfort.  Unsure as to whether or not I will receive the second dose.  Looking for some guidance.

It was not red, it was not swollen, it was just sore. I decided to take a bath, and went to bed. Felt tired and my arm was sore but it was mild, around 8 or 9 o&#39;clock.  I went to bed at 8 or 9 o&#39;clock and woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning and arm was very sore, would call it moderate. I took 500 Tylenol and 200 ibuprofen together.  Throughout the night my head hurt and i tried to go back to sleep. at 5 in the morning my head was excruciating, I would it an 8. My arm was very sore, I would give it an 8. My body hurt really bad so i give that an 8. so I&#39;m thinking ok this is what you get when you get a vaccine so I went back to bed. from 5-8 am  tossed and turned. at 8 o&#39;clock i got up and was very wobbly and weak and had chills. I checked my temp and it was 101.5. I went down stairs but had to take one stairs at a time because I was so weak, I went to kitchen because I was so thirsty. I tried to fix some ice water and lemon but it spilled. Went back upstairs because I had so many chills. I called my job at the Clinic but all they had was a voicemail. My face hurts my jaw hurts and my neck on the side where they gave me the shot, my right side. I was trying to put something in my stomach but I could only eat a few sunflower seeds. My body head and arm hurts so bad, moving is excruciating. I felt great all week and yesterday.

Slept most of day.  Seem better now, 3:30 pm.

I had one episode of dizziness associated with standing in the afternoon (approx. 25 hours post dose). My highest oral temperature recorded was 101.8 F. These symptoms continued until approx. 35 hours post vaccine. At that point the fever abated and the next day I felt somewhat better but was still achy, congested and significantly fatigued. On the third day after vaccination I felt much better.

Onset while at work, day 3:4.  Pain worsened and moved down into flanks.  Severe arthritic type pain in thumbs.  There was no CVA tenderness.  No actual fever.Symptoms have not resolved.  I am reporting event, in case it worsens, or turns out to be meningitis, encephalitis or worse, an aneurysm.  Most likely it is muscular strain.  But have never had chills with a muscle strain.

                                                Received the vaccine in the morning, and came home and didn&#39;t feel too much of anything until 6-7 hours  later.  She went to stand up and felt like she was under water, head pressure.  Her lower extremities felt very head like lead, very weak.  Sat down, took some Tylenol and called her doctor, who told her that it was from the vaccine and to take Benadryl, which she did.  She laid down and woke up about 2 hours later and her muscles in her lower extremities felt very tight, fatigued, weak.  That night she felt chills, feet were cold.  The next day she woke up and felt very light headed and dizzy and her arm was really red, tripled the area of the vaccine, size of an orange.  Was red, hot.  Put some ice on it, took Tylenol, and still had head pressure, dizzy like she was under water.  That night felt chills for about 6 days, no fever.  Still felt dizzy, muscles weak and heavy and fatigued.  She was on Prednisone and weaned off of then.   On Saturday she did not still feel good and was told to take Tylenol.   She still feels very weak in the legs, fatigue and her arm is still tender, not swollen anymore, but is still tender.  Monday she notified her doctor and they told her that it was from the vaccine, rest, drink fluids.  She is due to get the 2nd shot on Thursday and wondering if she should get it.  Nobody knew what to tell her to do for treatment of the reactions.  Lower leg muscles still feel very weak.

                                                Extreme arm and shoulder pain and great difficulty moving arm and shoulder.  Onset of pain and difficulty in use was within hours of vaccine administration and worsened over the next three days.  The pain was significant enough to require use of pain relieving medications throughout the day and night.  The pain woke me up at night.  Unable to lift arm more than a few inches for several days.  Difficulty moving arm, arm felt very heavy, so much so that if I was rolling over in bed I couldn&#39;t move my arm and needed to use the hand of  my other arm to do so.  Unable to lift arm to the back of my head (for example to put an elastic in my hair) for a week.  A high degree of pain for about 5 days, reducing somewhat after that and lasted about 2 weeks.  Still, nearly 4 weeks later, my arm is sore when I move it at the very top into the shoulder.  It&#39;s difficult to hook my bra.  I am not in pain but often have little twinges of pain/discomfort in the upper arm/shoulder, particularly when I lift my arm upward from the side of my body.

                                                About one to two minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt dizzy and lightheaded. Nurses came to help me and put me on the floor. I felt flushed throughout my whole body and the nurse said my face and chest was very red.  My blood pressure went up and I remember at one point the top number was in the 180s and bottom number in the 110s. My heart rate was fast, but I don&#39;t recall what it was from the monitor. At one point my jaw got tight, my face felt numb, and my fingers were tingly.  They  gave me a 50mg shot of Benadryl. One of the nurses wanted to give me an Epipen, but the other nurse said to wait and monitor me for a few more minutes to see if the Benadryl would take effect, which thankfully it did.  I would say the entire episode lasted about 20 minutes.  I never had a problem with breathing, throat closing up, or wheezing and the nurse told me after that my oxygen levels never went down.

                                                presenting to the ED for evaluation of reported reaction to the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient reports undergoing her 1st COVID-19 vaccination recently and did not experience any reaction with this whatsoever. However, she received her 2nd vaccination yesterday and initially felt well, but awoke this morning with the feeling of &#34;an elevated pulse&#34;, along with fatigue, nausea, nagging diffuse headache, left flank/low back pain, and soreness surrounding the vaccination site. No redness or significant swelling around the site. Also notes a brief episode of RLQ abdominal pain described as &#34;cramping&#34; earlier this morning that has since resolved. She has tried taking 500 mg Tylenol at 0800 without relief in her symptoms. No fevers, chills, dysuria, hematuria, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Patient reports being recently diagnosed with thyroid disease and began taking medications for this about two weeks ago. She denies any past medical history otherwise.

                                                Thursday after walking down 2 flights of stairs and getting into car numbness occurred in the left neck and lower side of my face. I took advil and it has came and went for the last several days along with numbness and tingling in my left arm and hand.  Yesterday and today the numbness in my face is along my mandible and throughout sometimes I feel strange sensations in my left ear.  This morning I woke with additional numbness and tingling in my left foot and leg. As I have been awake this morning, my left leg feels heavier, tingly and my lower right leg is having some issues.  I am also having an extreme cold sensation in my feet and the thermostat reads 70 and I am dressed with socks and shoes on. My feet are white with no discoloration.

                                                I had the normal soreness in my arm, slight nausea the first few days. On Wednesday, February 17 all my joints started to hurt. When I woke up on the 18th I could barely walk. My right knee was swollen, both hands were swollen, I had pain in my neck to the base of my skull.  I called the doctor&#39;s office and told this was normal and to take Tylenol. I spent the weekend barely able to move by the following Thursday, February 25th I went to my doctor, who immediately sent me to the ER. I was admitted to the hospital. My inflammation was high.  I was dehydrated. I spent the night in the hospital. Doctors say there is not enough research to say this vaccine did this but  I know it did. I am still having problems, still can barely walk, pain in the joints of my hands and pain radiating up my neck to the bottom of my skull.

I took Advil,  it was like the worst &#34;flu shot&#34; I ever got. Then the muscle pain started. I went home and took some Advil, tried to walk my dogs and couldn&#39;t. I usually walk 3 miles with them and did not walk even 1/2 mile. Went home and took a hot shower with Epson salt and laid down. My arm started aching. I can&#39;t even wash my hair, the injection site itches and is painful and my scalp was itching too. Overall headache, joint/ muscle pain like flu like symptoms. Wednesday morning before I left work my back started hurting really bad, severe back pain. When I arrived home and used the bathroom I was having abd pain, and diarrhea. It was all fluid. I ate some chili the day before and when I wiped my bottom it was red like bloody. My PCP was closed. It happened about 4 times. It is like I have a kidney pain (the back pain)

Last Wednesday 12/30/20 injection site came back with itching, redness about a dime size again, never gone away. Last night it was bigger about a size of a quarter, warm, red and itchy, took Zyrtec. This morning 1/6/21 it is about the size of my palm, warm, little itchy. I had headache and neck stiffness last week, but none as of yesterday. Forgot to mention on phone this morning.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   I had chills, low grade fever of 99.4 initially, fatigue, lightheaded and  felt like I was moving in slow motion.  As the evening progressed, I felt worse and worse, had no appetite, very slight nausea, but no vomiting. During the night, my fever went up.  I only checked it once and it was 100.1, but I was having severe chills, my knee joints were aching, as well as some of my fingers.  The next morning I had a headache, and was dizzy (which may have been from not eating the night before). The symptoms continued throughout the day, but were managed fairly well with Tylenol.  Additionally, my arm was extremely sore.  It hurt to move it in any way.  Even worse arm pain than with a Tetanus shot, which has always caused me a great deal of pain.  Thankfully the symptoms only lasted about 28 hours.

                                                Began feeling extreme fatigue and injection site soreness around 7:00PM on 1/13 and went to bed very early for me at 8:15 PM.  When I awoke at 5:00 AM my head felt foggy, I had chills, and headache.  I took extra strength Tylenol at 6:00 AM with relief of headache, but returned to bed from 9:00 AM to noon due to fatigue, muscle aches and chills.  I have continued to have fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and chills throughout the day (1/14/21). I also developed a fever of 100.6 at 5:00 PM.  Second dose of tylenol has reduced my temp to 99.5, but I continue to feel fatigued with headache.  The current time is 6:15 PM on 1/14.

                                                I am considering as side effects not adverse reactions. The day after vaccination I experienced: weakness, joint pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting,  chills, headache, fever of 101.7. The symptoms were intense. On the second day after vaccination I felt better with temperature of 100.5 and headache. On the  third day I was back to normal.  Should I take the SECOND dose on 27th of January? Thank you.

                                                The patient received her first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on 12/29/2020.  However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

Day 10 (today) Less sore but still slightly tougher feeling, leathery, slightly pink in the area of injection, dome shape seems to have lessened.

                                                Patient felt adverse effects after receiving vaccination. Approximately two hours after her vaccination, patient felt a radiating pain on lower right back down the right leg to the point where she could not walk. She used an ice pack and took an OTC pain medication (she could not remember name of) as well as an old gabapentin prescription later in the night. She states she could not walk from the pain all night. Her left knee experienced pain as well but for a shorter period of time. The next morning she can walk and feels it is improving, but there is still pain.

                                                Achy arm at injection site felt on the eve of the injection, but overall moderate- severe  muscle fatigue felt with exercise the next  morning, specifically burning buttock and thigh muscles while power walking the same route I do 4 x/week and difficulty catching my breath on the usual hills.  None of the fatigue was felt the next day on the same route. Also noted on day 7 was a droopy left eyelid that was mostly relieved by using refresh eye wetting drops but that still is present daily. I have had this occur once in my past and had a negative EMG workup. I have a scar on my left eye which may have been the cause and may be what is causing this to happen again. At 14 days I noticed new onset tight achy hips bilaterally, which is funny because one coworker has sudden knee pain/stiffness, and  another awoke with back pain and difficulty getting out of bed. They are still achy today

                                                I expected possible side effects from getting the vaccine. I had a fever of 102° F beginning about 12 hours after inoculation, lasting about 36 hours, then an unrelenting severe headache lasting about 20 hours along with fatigue and weakness. I also experienced muscle/joint aches and nausea throughout the first 72 hours. All somewhat expected but to a greater degree and longer lasting than the many. What was not expected, and which began after about 48 hours after inoculation, was hyperhydrosis (even after fever was gone), lightheadedness, imbalance, intermittent palpitations and a neurologic tingling and buzzing in my body. Some of these are symptoms I experience intermittently with Long Covid, but they had been heightened by the vaccine. These symptoms along with the headache and muscle/joint aches continue though not as severely today, four days after receiving the vaccine. I do not believe these symptoms are due to any issue with the vaccine itself, but rather my pre-existing condition of Long Covid. To my knowledge there is no data on people with Long Covid getting the vaccine and I felt it was important to report my experience and unusual adverse reactions to the vaccine. Again, the vaccine had such a severe or prolonged reaction.

But on Fri 01/01 I woke up with severe HA ( I have migraine HA, so have tolerability for pain) and had pain in my neck and hands(like arthritic kind of pain). This HA was Migraine like but on both sides of my head and in both eyes. Regular migraine meds didn&#39;t help. HA lasted for 3 days. I was ready to go to ER but started feeling better and by the middle of the day HA was gone. I signed myself for 2nd vaccine on 1/27/21, but would like to check before I do it.

Began to get mild muscle cramps in side of face, jaw, down both sides of neck, upper left shoulder with finger and upper right foot tingling, left wrist tightness, and itching in both armpits, upper inner arms and upper back and irritability while driving home. Went to Urgent Care. All seemed to resolve except itching, muscle pain, irritability. Itching started in legs. Was given shot of Benadryl and oral Prednisone which helped. Woke up with nausea, headache, fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, but no itchiness. No continued irritability. Feel dehydrated now. Have had fluids. Still very dry. Headache is worse. Having some trouble getting enough  fluids  in. Will keep trying and call physician next.

                                                Left upper arm pain that is involving the entire muscle of the upper arm. Increasingly getting worse, not better. After 7 days the aching is intermittent waves of throbbing. Like a tooth ache. Had to use heat on the arm on day 6 to get comfort during the night.  Discomfort when moving of touching the arm. No local swelling or redness.

Initial onset of LLQ abdominal to suprapubic pain about 4 hours after injection on 01/19/21, later that night chills, fever of up to 100.4° with worsening abdominal pain 8/10.  On 01/20/21 App used for video MD visit prescribed Augmentin 875/125, started later that day.  In bed 22 of 24 hours on 01/20/21 and 01/21/21.  Acute onset of non-traumatic R ankle /foot severe swelling and instability with severe pain, unable to bear weight, waking me up early morning 01/22/21.  Due to diverticulitis and unable to walk, stayed home, conservative care (RICE), ace bandage and Norco 5 mg 01/22/21-01/24/21.  X-rays R ankle/foot taken on 01/25/21 at Imaging .  Unable to get into PCP, went to Urgent Care, orthocast placed, prescribed Norco 5 mg.

I made a phone call trying relax but mid call  I could not speak due to throat and tongue swelling and then development of a cough trying to clear my throat.  I grabbed my sons epi pen but I was able to still get air so I didn?t use it. My husband transported me to the ER. They took my straight back took my vitals and administered Benadryl, Pepcid and Dexamethasone  IM  and worked well, they observed me for few hours and I was released. I have follow-up appt tomorrow with primary care,

Spoke to Dr, advised to use Benadryl and take Zyrtec daily. Had under armpit discomfort, also faed after few days. Hives faded after few days.  My shoulder area where vaccine was given is achy and burning still after 3 weeks. Unsure if getting the 2nd dose is safe. All above did not happen initially but began 9 days after vaccine was given

However, obvious left arm muscle weakness and mild cramping in same arm is still present. Maybe a coincidence? Getting an EMG test today to evaluate the extent of nerve involvement and check for signs of muscle atrophy.

Itching back of throat, felt allergic reaction. Itching, coughing, first hour. Then pain over whole body, HA, nausea, diarrhea. &#39;felt like hit by a wall, severe HA&#39;. Took benadryl and tylenol. Intense for 4 days, &#39;living off of benadryl&#39;. The muscle and joint pain continued, nausea and diarrhea.  By sat, I could finally eat.  Sunday I could move again. But if I did anything, was hard to catch my breath with any exertion.

My cheeks were also slightly puffy.  The intensity decreased after about an hour from the onset of the effects (1.5 hours after the vaccine.)  After 24 hours my face still feels tingly and tight, but only slightly compared to  the day of the vaccine.  I also have have waves of feeling nauseous about 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine and it continues after 24 hours after receiving the vaccine.

                                                The next morning, 12/24 and I woke up my head was very heavy and I was dizzy and I had a hard time getting out of the bed, my leg felt like jello, like sea legs, like I was on a boat. That continued all day and I also had chills and did not feel good later in the day. I did not work 12/24 and 12/25 I felt a little better but my legs specially my thighs felt really heavy. Saturday the dizziness continued and then that is when I went to the UC (12/26) to get a covid test (rapid and sent out one both negative). The dizziness improved, I still have a funny heavy feeling on my upper tights. I had a little numbness on my hands on the 12/24 and 12/25but it seems to have resolved.

                                                Severe pain, swelling in arm that kept me awake most of Friday night requiring Motrin x 2 doses and ice to area and still continued into Sunday. I had fever, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, extreme fatigue and slept for hours all day Saturday, Sunday into Monday, which I called off work. I felt as if I had the virus all over again , except this time it felt much worse. I am worried to get the second vaccine as it states it is worse than the first. Would like and appreciate any feedback on this.

I told her she could take Tylenol for the aches. She is going to monitor the other symptoms and if they progress or get worse she will call her primary care doctor. She thinks it is just the start of a cold.

                                                Vaccination initially caused only a sore arm day 2.   Very mild no fever, joint pain or muscle aches.  No HA. Day 7  late in the day I developed axillary pain.  By the next morning the site of injection was hard warm, red and raised.  Palpable tender mass which resolved over 4 days.  I am not sure if I should have second vaccination.  This was clearly a delayed reaction to the vaccination.  I have seen others complain of the same reaction.

                                                1/5/21-Soreness initially started at 3:00 and progressed with increased pain and able to only lift to 80 degrees of shoulder flexion. Increased pain through the night and in morning of 1/6/21 only able to raise arm to 30 degrees with significant pain and had to help with my right arm to raise the left and to dress myself. The pain woke me up at night. I could not go to work for 3 days because of limited active movement to 45 degrees and significant pain and weakness. I am  taking 600-800mg Advil every 6 hours, icing and performing range of motion and massage and kinesiotaping my shoulder. 1/11/21 to present, pain has decreased but soreness still present with internal rotation of my arm and muscle weakness in shoulder muscles and occasionally discomfort with arm positioning at night wakes me up still.

I felt like I was 100 years old, but on Monday 1/11/21 I was fine. This only lasted 1 day. ALSO, one week later, the injection site got swollen, red and itchy. (this was Saturday 1/16/21). This seems to be better now (meaning today 1/20/21). Other than that, I am fine. I did not need to see a doctor for these side effects.

                                                Two hours post vaccination:  tongue heaviness followed by metallic taste sensation, vomited once after this.  Four hours post vaccination:  nausea, bilateral forearm pain evolving to all over body aches and muscle cramping along with a pulsating headache.  Spiked a fever of 102 F that I treated with 500 mg of Tylenol.  Later took ibuprofen for body aches.  Had frequent urination along with unexplained crying.  The lowest the fever would measure for the next 24 hours was 100 F.  I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen as directed on a regular basis.  On Thursday 1/21/2021 at 5:55 pm, I woke up drenched in sweat.  I felt weak yet improved.  Headache and back pain were less.  Showered and moved to the couch in living room attempting to watch TV.  Could not stay awake.  Woke up three hours later again drenched in sweat.  Showered and went to bed.  Slept through the night and woke up at 8 am with body aches, muscle cramping and nausea gone.  Night gown and sheets were damp with sweat. Lingering symptoms:  Skin from lips and inside my mouth appears to be sloughing off.  There are very tiny cuts on my bottom lip.  Left with mild headache I attribute to dehydration.  No longer nauseous although I have no appetite.

                                                Significant back pain occurred approximately 48 hours after the vaccination. It subsided after two days, but re-occurred two weeks later (on the evening of 1/16/21). Forty-eight hours later I phoned NP and requested help. She prescribed Prednisone, 20mg, twice daily for 5 days, which I began taking on the evening on 1/18/21.  The pain slowly subsided and after 3 days I was feeling better.

                                                ? Pt reports severe muscle pain and aches, predominantly lower half of body.  Used both OTC APAP and IBU, with minimal benefit.  Tried a Salonpas patch applied locally to where there was pain, with a little improvement.  Pt admits high pain tolerance, but muscle pain/ache was bothersome throughout day and night.  Started night of vaccine administration.  Not localized pain.  Pt denies fever, SOB, rash.  Possibly a little bit of nausea but could be secondary to increased APAP and IBU intake.  Seems to be decreasing but still painful, as of 2 days post vaccine.  Pt advised to monitor 1 more day.  Pt counseled to continue with OTC.  Call MD if worsens today 1/29/2021, call before end of business day.  Pharmacist to check in with pt on weekend to see if improving (i.e. decreasing pain level).

Other course of several hours the (L) deltoid muscle was sore (deep muscle ache and superficial &#39;burning sensation&#39;).  Other reactions included chills and myalgias in both shins (these resolved within 12 hours).    Over night, the left deltoid became painful to even light touch (almost like a severe sunburn). The area was not erythematous and there was full ROM.  Over ensuing 3 days the pain gradually resolved.    On 1/31/21 the (L) deltoid became very &#39;itchy&#39;...deep within the muscle.  The sensation was alleviated by deep massage and superficial scratching of the area.  No nodules were appreciated on deep palpation.  On 2/1/21, the left deltoid region was markedly erythematous and pruritis persists.  Reporting event due to new vaccine.

                                                I received the vaccine on 01/13/2021 and only had mild arm tenderness at the site for a couple of days with some mild to moderate fatigue and sleepiness. On the 10th day after the vaccine which would have been on 01/21/2021 my left arm which was the arm that I received the vaccine in was itching and red with hives and warm to the touch and these symptoms lasted until the evening of 01/24/2021 and then that night I developed a fever with severe stomach pain along with vomiting and diarrhea  and headache which lasted throughout the day of 01/25/2021. I was very fatigued and sleepy and then on 01/28/2021 I woke up with a blister to my forehead and then later that afternoon developed another one on my neck and then a few more later that night to the back of my neck on my c-spine. On 01/30/2021 my left ear was very sore to the back side of it and also the inside of my ear was itchy and painful as if I was developing a small pimple . This developed into itching to the inside of my ear and also redness and what looks like a rash and some eczema as this was looked at by  one of the RN&#39;s here at the clinic. I am still continuing to have fatigue and sleepiness which is not normal for me and I am still having bouts of diarrhea and stomach pain that is not my normal stomach pain. I also sent this to doctor as I wanted this to be documented in my medical record as I am due for my booster vaccine on 02/10/2021 and I am not feeling up to par to receive this at that time. Another concern is the fact that at times I do feel energetic but then all of a sudden I just feel weighed down like my arms and legs are too heavy to use. I have continued to exercise during this time but not for my full hour that I normally do every day. I am very concerned how I will react to the booster if this first one caused all of these reactions as on a normal day I only weigh 114 pounds and at my heaviest maybe 116 and I dropped down to 111 pounds this past week and I am aware that this is more than likely due to the vomiting and diarrhea and was dehydrated for a couple of days. I am going to wait for my booster until I can get more reassurance on this and am feeling more like myself .

                                                Started not feeling well as the afternoon of 2/8/2021 went on.  I left work at 4:30PM (instead of 5:00). By evening, my joints were getting achy.  The next morning, 2/9/2021, I had SEVERE joint pain.  Hurt to move and while laying still.  Had a headache and arm was very sore and swollen. Also ran a fever of 101.  Only had Mortin, but fever hovered around 100.4.  Joint pain decreased somewhat by 2/10/2021.  Was less painful when laying still or when moving.  Arm still sore, but not as swollen.  Still had headache even while taking Motrin.  Fever finally broke early afternoon and have been fever free.  As of today, 2/11/2021, joint pain is almost completely gone, arm still sore but not swollen and head ache is gone.  Still fever free.  My body feels tired, weak.  The longer I am up the  weaker I feel.  So I rest

I took Tylenol every 6 hours. It helped my symptoms about an hour after taking the Tylenol then about 5 hours later the symptoms came back. The next day, I felt about 50% better and this evening I&#39;m about 90% better.

Required ibuprofen every 4hours for 30hours and sporadically thereafter to manage symptoms. I was ready to call 911, but was able to reach friends as a safety check through the night and the next couple days. Very difficult to manage this living alone.

                                                Initially, I had a sore arm and was tired.  About 4 or 5 days after the vaccine, I felt some swelling  &amp; tightness in my knees.  On Saturday, February 13th, I wore my hiking boots and was running some errands.  After a few hours, I felt extreme pain in both ankles so much that I had difficulty walking.  By Monday, I was able to go to school and taught all day.  On Wednesday, February 17th I noticed my right ankle was noticeably swollen that evening.  Thursday and Friday were inclement weather so we had virtual instruction.  When my ankle remained swollen, I contacted my doctor.  She thought it may be a serum reaction to the vaccine and suggested I try to contact the center where I got the vaccine and ask to speak to the epidemiologist.  Unfortunately, the COVID call center was not available and did not leave a way to leave a message.  I am concerned because my ankle is still swollen and my second dose is March 4th.

These are still occurring, even though the general symptoms as listed below are subsiding.  Before receiving my vaccine, I was careful to drink a lot of fluid. Eight hours after receiving my second dose, intense body aches began including headache. It was a fitful night of sleep as I remember moving around in an attempt to stretch out the muscles that seemed to be tightening. The next morning as I arose I felt weak and chilled.  Highest temperature recorded was 99.0. Muscle aches, headache, joint pain (especially in my knees) persisted throughout the day. Rest and tylenol helped somewhat.

I called out sick and had to use a vacation day because still had headache, fogginess, and temp of 98.8.  At 3pm I started to have a lower back ache that went in to my mid back.  I was tired.  Then on Tuesday, 01/12/2021 I started with diarrhea at 11AM.  I called work and explained that it was a side effect of the Covid vaccine.  They still would not let me go to work even though I was covid negative.  I took 2 Imodium tablets. I will email you tomorrow, 1/13/2021 and continue to monitor.  Yes I am a RN.

The pain in my right arm and around the back of my head and neck increased all day on Saturday, latter that night the pain woke me out of my sleep, and as I attempted to go to the restroom, I passed out.  I woke up on the floor where I had passed out face down, with a busted bloody lip and bruises and broken skin on both knees.  Very frightening, Thank God that I woke up because I live alone.   Thank you.

                                                After the injection I experienced soreness at the site. Within that same period I started having a lot of muscle pain in my arm, shoulder and neck that I attributed to exercise. Yesterday, the area around the injection site began itching, became swollen and a light rash developed. Today, the itching has gone away, but the injection site is still swollen and and I have muscular pain at the injection site, and on the upper part of my back and the lower part of my neck on my right side.  My husband is a physician so he has examined the site and is monitoring it.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

The lump is shaped approx like an egg after 12 hours (not the thicknesss of an egg). I feel a strange sensation like I do with allergies and had  a slight headache off and on though the day.

                                                suddenly had severe dizziness the next day.  Had trouble walking and extremely weak.  Had the usual muscle pain and feeling blah.  I was asked to report this by health dept due to this being an atypical response.  I have never reacted to a vaccine before.

                                                Side effects started the same day I received the vaccine, which were reported on the V-safe app.  Started with very sore arm, within 24 hours progressed to extreme fatigue, joint and body aches, loss of taste and headache. I also experienced some mild nausea. By Wednesday evening, I began to experience heart palpations which I listened to as a nurse which sounded like PVC&#39;s. I have never had this happen to me before. I assessed my vital signs and noted that as the arrhythmia progressed, my O2 sat level began to decrease and my pulse began to increase. I could hear a definite pause in my heart rhythm. Within an hour, I had chest pain in the area of my left chest over my heart which progressed into a feeling of pressure as if someone was standing with a foot on my chest. As time went on, this sensation radiated into my back at an angle from left to right. It was at this point that I had my father take me to the emergency room. When I got there, my pulse was in the low 100&#39;s and my blood pressure was 230/130. I have never had this happen to me before. I ended up on a nitroglycerin drip. My magnesium level was low and my sodium level was low normal.   I was kept in the emergency room until Thursday evening then transferred to Progressive Care Unit where I remained until early evening on Friday.I was sent home on 2 different cardiac medications, Coreg and Lisinopril. I am to follow up with my PCP and a cardiologist. Both are brand new to me. I am now feeling better, but I am very reluctant to have the second covid vaccine. Also, the Hospital does not know what happened to me. (Facility where I received my Covid vaccine.)

Nurses took vital signs, then referred her to the vaccination clinic that was onsite. She was observed by vaccination team for a period of time. She reported shoulder pain radiating into shoulder blade in arm vaccine was received. Vaccination team offered ice pack to her, observed for a period of time, and released back to work. About 10pm that evening, she sent a text to another coworker that her pain was &#34;off the charts&#34; and that she had pain covering her whole left side of her body.  She did not come to work in the morning and did not contact work. Well being check was performed at approximately 9am on 2/2/2021 and she was found dead in her home.  911 was immediately called and authorities took over the scene.

                                                After my shot, I stayed at the facility for 15 minutes. When I started my drive home, I noticed a medicinal taste  coming from the back right side of my mouth. Approximately 10 minutes later I had a numbing/tight feeling in my right jaw. This quickly traveled to the right half of my mouth, the right side of my nose, my right cheek, my right eye (even behind the eye/a lot of pressure), above my right eyebrow, and to my right ear.   I called the health department. They said they could not give me medical advice and I should call my doctor or go to the ER. I called my doctor. In the meantime, the numbing/tightening somewhat subsided. However, it was still quite there and noticeable.   By the time I went to sleep that night, the numbing/tingling had just about all gone away. The next day I still noticed it in the corner of my right, my mouth and right cheek. By that evening it was entirely gone.   My doctor?s nurse called the next day. She said my doctor still suggested that I get the second shot. However, I?m very nervous to do so.   I wrote on a previous page that the time of my shot was 2:20. That was my appointment time. The time of my shot was 2:37 pm.

I had severe spasm in my diaphragm/abdomen (seemed to last forever) and all of my muscles ached. I felt weak and had difficulty moving my legs.   I thought about going to the ER but what could they do?  I just took a lot of aspirin, tylenol and some old expired  muscle relaxer that I found in the cabinet.

I took 2 OTC Motrin which improved but did not eliminate pain. A few hours later, prior to taking additional NSAIDs, I checked neck and underarm for swollen lymph nodes as that was what the pain/ache reminded me of. I did not feel and lymph nodes in my neck or underarm but I did notice  2 new lumps in my breast on that same side. One was tiny and hard ~1mm, the other was about the size of a pea. Both were located in the upper, outer quadrant @ about10:00.  I called my PCP and got appointment.  By the time of my appointment, I could no longer find the tiny lump. My PCP ordered a breast ultrasound which I had which did not show any new lumps

                                                A few hours after receiving the vaccine, I had the muscle pain in my left upper arm, as expected. This time it felt a bit different and by the evening, I had my daughter check the site because it felt to me as if I had a hard metal plate protecting my arm. Everything looked good. The next day the pain continued, but it was a bit duller. That evening, however, I woke up with intense shoulder pain. I was confused why I was in so much pain. I was on my back and there was nothing obstructing my shoulder. When I got up the morning of 3/13, I was in intense pain and had limited mobility of my left arm. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen, but that didn&#39;t help. I went in to see the doctor and she prescribed naproxen and has referred me to physical therapy. In the meantime, I continue to be in severe pain and my left arm (dominant arm :() is extremely limited.

                                                The day after my 2nd vaccine, I was in excruciating pain in my right arm, hand and fingers.   It felt like someone had driven a nail into my hand (and I&#39;m not a Christian).   As of today, my hand and fingers are almost completly numb and my fingers tingle all the time.   I was given a sterioid treatment, prescriptions for Gabapentin, Tizanidine, and Hydrocodone after days of being in bed with debilitating pain.   I am no longer on the steriod, and can function without the Hydrocodone.   However, I continue to take the Gabapentin and Tizanidine because I have a completely numb right hand with painfully tingling fingers.   Every day is a challenge for me to function because I often feel stinging pain at the injections site along with shoulder pain, in addition to the pain in my hand and fingers.

Within 2 hours my arm was stiff, hurting and very sore to the touch at the injection site.  This lasted approximately 4 days, each day having less soreness.  On 1-10-21 while in the shower I found that in the bottom of my arm pit area was very sore and tender to the touch.  I have taken no other medicine for the pain or discomfort.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

Starting 1/16/2021, 10 days after injection I started having tenderness at the injection site again. Also there was itching, red raised bumps similar to hives, swelling of the area, muscle aches and headache. Tylenol did not alleviate the symptoms but Motrin did help with the achy muscles. Sunday Night 1/17 the itching became worse so I applied Benadryl cream to the injection site and that provided relief of the itching. On 1/18 there was still some mild tenderness, swelling and redness at the injection site. the muscle aches had significantly decreased and the headache was gone.

                                                Lot number might be 026L20A. My first Moderna shot was on 1-7-2021. My arm was a bit sore, red, and swollen for just a couple days and then it was fine. On 1-14-2021 I woke up with a sore upper left shoulder (the joint, not the surface injections site), left neck, throat, and jaw. It hurt a bit to eat. Later that day the injection site became hard, red, and itchy again. By 1-16-21 the injection site was no longer itchy but my shoulder, neck, throat and jaw have continued to be sore, on and off. I don&#39;t know what else could be causing this - it&#39;s not bad but it&#39;s odd. The soreness feels like lymph gland swelling. I have not consulted a doctor because it&#39;s not bad but may call clinic. I called the Moderna 800 number and filed a report that way but decided to also file this report.

Very sore in all large joints, bad headache, cold chills, fever or 100 degrees.  Called Dr. office to be sure i was ok -- felt exactly like the first days of COVID -(I had it most of the month of August 2020 followed by pneumonia.)  I took Advil, went back to bed.  At about 46 hours post-vaccine it eased off and was shortly gone.  I stayed in bed, sleeping most of the time from early afternoon Tues, 12/28 until the morning of 12/30 when i returned to work.

This numbness in my face and head and severe arm pain has not returned but scared with second shot, I still been experiencing slight left-sided headaches  nothing bad but I never previously had headaches before vaccine, So many I know did not have any side effects from first, and now wondering why I did and fearful of second shot now. thank you, so much for any help, I truly appreciate it, and thank you all for what you do for us.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccine given, woke up from sleeping all night with joint pain all over, low back pain worse SI joint pain, ,etc.  I have an autoimmune disease that causes back and joint pain.  It seems that I had a ?flare? or worsening in condition following the injection.  Arm hurt where vaccine given is also but that happens with most all vaccines.  That was not the reason I am writing this up.  Writing it up to the the inflamed state I was in.

                                                After receiving the injection I experienced slight soreness at the injection site, which was expected.  later that evening I experienced swelling in the left axilla lymph nodes. The swelling in that area was extreme on 01/20/2021 throughout the night and has continued until day of reporting on 01/27/2021. The pain and swelling involved the entire underarm and pain could be felt deep in the tissue. On pain scale of 1-10 with 10 as extreme, I would rate pain as a 9 on days 1-5. Pain has gradually diminished in severity on subsequent days and is a 2 today. Measures to reduce the pain included elevation of arm and shoulder during the night, discontinuation of deodorant during period of discomfort and application of warm and cold compresses to decrease pain and swelling.  Initially contemplated seeking emergency room evaluation and treatment for evaluation , but decided against because there is no way to remove the vaccine and treatment would probably include measures already implemented.

But the next morning it doubled in size. Consulted with my employee health who suggested me being seeing at the UC or doing TELADOC they were fear it could be cellulitis. The Teladoc MD prescribed me antibiotics (doxycycline), steroid (prednisone), naproxen and Benadryl and called it cellulitis. My arm pit pain went away by my second dose of prednisone. The itching stopped also with the prednisone. I took the doxycycline for 3 days only instead of a week as prescribed. Also took the prednisone only for 2 days once the itching and the arm pain went away I stopped. All symptoms were resolved by 4 days.

Redness was gone in about three days and the soreness was gone after two weeks. The second dose was given 1/27/21.

These symptoms were expected and my temperature was normal after taking a shower and drinking some water.  The chills persisted and I checked my temp a few times to make sure I didn&#39;t have a temperature.

For the dizziness I had a banana and potato chips to stabilize the sugar in the blood and took about and hour nap.  Co-workers and Supervisor monitor me in case EMS needed to be call. For the pain in general I took 1 capsule Tylenol 500.  Nothing for the nausea and plenty of water to reduce swelling.

I awoke six days after  the injection (1/26/21 feeling anxious, agitated, distracted.  Poor appetite throughout the day.  Later iin evening, I felt something a lot like a hot flash, I felt my face flusing, followed by hives on my chest and abdoman.  The left deltoid muscle started to itch incessantly, and the deltoid muscle began to swell.  A hard nodule at the injection site formed, initially the size of an m&amp;m.   It grew to the size of a golf ball, then to the size of a tennis ball over the next two days.  It resolved on it&#39;s own over the next week.

I THOUGHT I was having a blood sugar issue, but that was not the case.  I went to sleep for about two hours, then woke up about 9pm feeling a little better.  I had NO pain in my arm or anywhere else and slept the entire night.    Friday (1/22), I developed pain and swelling in my breast, armpit, and injection site.  I literally  felt crappy all weekend.  Weird...????  I was confused this happened about ONE WEEK AFTER the vaccine. The injection site was the size of a golf ball, hard, and  quite warm.  I began to feel better after about 3 days, but the arm was still slightly red, sore, and there&#39;s a slight bump.
