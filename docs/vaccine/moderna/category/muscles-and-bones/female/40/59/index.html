                                                6 hours after vaccine developed fatigue and mild soreness. Over night had severe muscle and joint pain. The next day muscle/joint pain continued with headache, fatigue, fever, chills, and my urine turned dark brown. The next day fever went away and all symptoms improved except the urine continued to be brown. The following day I was seen at the ER and was diagnosed with hematuria of unknown cause. I have to have a CT scan on Monday to evaluate further.

                                                About 1  hour after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19, I started feeling extreme pain in my left shoulder and arm, where the shot was administered. The pain continued to intensify throughout the day and night and was 10/10 on a pain scale. In addition, I began to lose my ability to lift my left arm or use it. It became so weak that I had to use my right hand/arm to pick up my left arm to move it. My left arm was &#39;hanging and drooping&#39; and my left shoulder was very  noticeably lower then my right shoulder. I called my primary care and employee health. My primary care doctor advised me to take advil and go to urgent care if the pain persisted and worsened. I could not sleep at all that evening of 12/29/20 because the pain was so intense and I had to keep picking my left arm up with my right arm to keep re-adjusting to try and get comfortable. The next morning I went to an orthopedic urgent care where I was diagnosed with nerve damage from the shot and prescribed Methylprednisolone 4mg dosepack. The doctor who saw me explained that he could not assess the extent of the damage at this time because my nerves were so agitated and inflamed. He scheduled a follow up visit with me for Thursday, January 7th and stated he will then proceed with an MRI and further investigation to assess the extent of the nerve damage.  During the days that followed my immunization, I was unable to do anything with my left arm and was dependent on my husband to help me get dressed, showered, household chores, etc. It is unknown at this time whether this will be temporary or permanent damage and disability.

                                                1/5/2021 - Day 1:  R) deltoid pain at injection site around 1600, mild headache viewing around 2100 when going to bed. I took ibuprofen prophylactically to prevent pain getting worse.  1/6/2021- Day 2 around 00:00, I was woken up out of bed with severe body aches all over. Mostly to bilateral hip joints and lower. Arm pain and headache were barely noticeable d/t other pain. Pain radiated to arms down to both shins. It hurt to touch skin and took ibuprofen around 0130-0200. It was so bad I couldn&#39;t roll my body up without assistance and I&#39;d need to use restroom for almost 2 hours at this point. Had to call out of work because I knew this pain wouldn&#39;t go away in a few hours in addition to lack of sleep, I knew it&#39;d be better to rest with OTC, rest, And heating pad.  Later this day I was still feeling the same, went to store to get something for body aches. It wasn&#39;t until I was in this store, when my left femur bone hurt so bad I had to grab onto a shelf. I felt my bone was about to break - scary. (My1 st time experience the bone pain symptom) Later at home same day, spent an hour going back and forth to bathroom with large loose/water diarrhea. I slept most of the day, as I was too fatigued to do simple tasks. Went to bed around 21:00 after taking ibuprofen, laying on heated and covered in electric blanket.  1/7/2020 woke up at 05:50 to get ready for work and instantly felt the pain again and headache, I&#39;m usually not so tired after sleeping, so contributed that to same fatigue. Although is not pounding, still dull.  1/7/2021 0900 took my HCTZ, Propranolol, and Potassium. Today the pain is not as high, but better than yesterday. I expect to feel a lot better tomorrow to go into work.

My tongue was still numb but not getting any worse so i felt it was ok to leave. I decided to go home after those 2 hours and i took 10 min of zyrtec and about 5 hours later i still had a little numbness and tingling on the right side of the tongue but the rest of the tongue and lip had resolvedf. Had fatigue and myalgia for the rest of the day.

Red and itchy rash grew to size of softball next couple of days, armpit became more sore.  Rash and armpit soreness improved over next week, and now 95% better.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use reported included vitamins, bupropion and trazadone.   On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 039K20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 29 Dec 2020, the patient reported that the vaccine was administered in her left shoulder but that it seemed kind of high.  The patient mentioned to the nurse giving her the vaccine that it felt strange going in and that it did not feel like a normal injection. A few hours later, she stated that her pain level was 10/10.    On 30 Dec 2020, she followed up with her primary physician and was instructed to go to urgent care the next day if she did not feel any better.    On 31 Dec 2020, patient reported that she literally could not move or lift her left arm at all and had to use her right arm to lift it due to the pain.  She also stated that her left shoulder was much lower than the right.  On that same day, she went to an orthopedic urgent care where she was told that the vaccine had potentially nicked a nerve causing the issues in her arm.  However, without an MRI, the urgent care was unable to provide a definitive diagnosis. The patient was prescribed steroids and was told that she could not be referred for an MRI until the nerve became less agitated and inflamed once the steroids took effect, in approximately one week. Treatment for the event included oral steroids.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events, vaccine was administered in should and seemed kind of high, shot felt strange going in, can&#39;t move or lift arm at all, nicked nerve, left shoulder much lower than the right, and level of pain was 10 out of 10 a few hours later, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 40-year-old female patient who experienced the events of vaccine was administered in should and seemed kind of high, shot felt strange going in, can&#39;t move or lift arm at all, nicked nerve, left shoulder much lower than the right, and level of pain was 10 out of 10 a few hours later. The event of shot felt strange going in occurred on the same day when the product was administered, and the events of can&#39;t move or lift arm at all, nicked nerve, left shoulder much lower than the right, and level of pain was 10 out of 10 a few hours later occurred within 2 days following administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, Lot #039K20A. Based on the limited available information, a definitive assessment with regards to a drug: event-causal association cannot be provided at this time. However, due to the temporal association between the onset of the event and the administration of the drug, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Hence, the events of shot felt strange going in, can&#39;t move or lift arm at all, nicked nerve, left shoulder much lower than the right, and level of pain was 10 out of 10 a few hours later are assessed as possibly related to mRNA-1273. The event of vaccine was administered in should and seemed kind of high is a procedural issue and assessed as not applicable.

Everything was good until about an hour after I got home, and I developed a headache and was very tired. Went to bed at my normal time which is 9o?clock, and slept all night. When I woke up the next morning which is January 15, 2021 my left arm was very sore and my headache was gone. Went to work at normal time, 7:00 am and began feeling very fatigued with muscle soreness and joint pain. Left work and came home and slept for two hours. Still experiencing aches and pains and fatigue. I do feel it necessary to report I have had a positive covid-19 result in April of 2020.

I was tired, had body aches and a severe headache for 3 days. This all subsided on the 4th day post injection. On the 6th day post injection my shoulder and neck began to hurt with swelling and a hard knot at my clavicle. It was tender to the touch and caused pain when moving my arm. I saw my doctor on the 7th day post injection with complaints and he said it is most likely a  viral infection and gave me meds to relieve pain. That night my shoulder started to throb and when I looked at it it is red, hot and swollen again. I still experience pain and discomfort to my shoulder and neck. The area where I received the vaccine itches as well.

                                                The injection site is rock hard, my arm is swollen and red. I have a fever, chills, it hurts to touch my skin, my neck feels like it?s in a vice, horrible headache, I feel lethargic, and I have a very upset stomach resulting in diarrhea. Symptoms started around 5:30 pm 1/16/2021, and have gotten worse as time progresses. The fevere comes and goes, but it always comes back.

                                                I was vaccinated on 12-30 after 4 pm.  By 3:30 on 12-31 my neck quickly swelled up, my throat becoming sore, glands swollen, headache, and fatigue were my first symptoms. An unusual symptom occurred from day 2-6. My facial skin did not hurt unless I applied pressure. When I applied pressure it felt bruised and highly sensitive but didn&#39;t hurt unless pressure was applied.  I also developed a small sore along my gum line on the bottom right front of my mouth.  Both of these symptoms disappeared after day 6. 7-8 days after receiving the vaccine my neck, jaw and shoulders became extremely stiff, including a runny nose. This symptom has persisted and is the worst of all symptoms (jaw and neck stiffness and sore throat). On day 12 in addition to the ongoing sore throat,  and stiffness in my neck and jaw I developed white spots on my right tonsil.  3 days after the white spots disappeared, but the red sore throat is current. On day 20, I developed 2 more sores on the right side of my mouth. One on the bottom gum line and one on the top right gum line (this feels like a canker sore). Today I have a slight earache in my right ear.   NOTE: I tested positive to COVID June 2020. I ended up taking 1 month off work due to persistent symptoms. I still cannot properly smell and taste, and I can smell water.  Occasionally, the brain fog from COVID comes up but that is more rare.

                                                typical side effects with in the first 48 hours. then 8 days post injection began to have side effects again. Began with an itchy arm at injection site and thought nothing of it b/c there were not marks. by the end of that Sunday my arm was red and warm with round spots. I took some Cetirizine and used a topical cortisone. Monday morning I woke to two lumps, itchiness, heat, tenderness, sore muscles, headache. I took some APAP and IBU and applied some more cortisone, went about my day with a two hour car ride and a walk. i was stiff through the day so i completed stretches several times through the day. When i got home that night most of my major joints hurt enough that I could not sleep through the night even with Naproxen 440 mg , APAP 1000 mg, Cetirizine 10 mg on board. My arm began to be more swollen, my nervous system began to be off. I had no appetite, was dizzy, felt shaky but when I held my arm and hand out, I did not shake. I have continued on a with Naproxen an d APAP since Tuesday after read not to take PO IBU if had Moderna vaccine.  I have not been able to complete house hold chores, missed three days of work, and been able to be with family.  As of today, January 22nd 2021, thirteen days post injection I still have fatigue, intermittent dizziness, loss of appetite, joint pain, headache with no relief with OTC&#39;s. The redness, swelling, heat have dissipated in left arm at and near injection site.

                                                Got my vaccine early morning.  Left arm where injection site given,  started to become really sore 30 minutes after injection.  I ate breakfast at around 9:30am. Went to my Doctor&#39;s appointment for 1030am, started having mild chills that would come and go. After Doctor&#39;s appointment,  around 1130-12pm, started to feel nauseous and loss of thirst and appetite.  I called the vaccine line at my job at around 2:59pm, but nurse just stated nothing to do right now, to call back following morning.  I knew things would get worse so I made the judgement call to call out this was close to 4pm. My chills started increasing,  despite not having any high temp was 98.9 f. Then around 5pm started having mild joint pain all over my body. Around 7pm joint pain got unbearable,  that I even started to shiver from more chills and pain.  I couldn&#39;t sleep,  except just laying and tossing and turning in bed, I also started having stomach cramping . Finally I fell asleep at around 12:30 midnight,  due to the pain. I finally woke up around 3:30am, took 2 Motrins. Then I woke up around 06:30am with body aches all over. Last night just took sips of ginger ale, didn&#39;t eat anything since 9:30am yesterday.  Finally had a small breakfast at around 7:30am with a glass of water. Still feel warm at times, with body aches, and nausea.  Will call vaccine line again today.

I took tylenol / motrin not knowing this could even be associated and thinking maybe I overworked my muscles running around at work that weekend. Over the following few days the reaction has become much more severe. I have nodules that are red, painful and flat all over the front of my legs and thighs and continued swelling and pain to my ankles and knees. This makes it difficult to walk. I followed up with a Dr. on health online as I am unable to drive myself to an appointment at an office at this time who diagosed me with Erythema Nodusum and started me on prednisone. I missed 2 days of work with the initial reaction to the vaccine and will miss 3 shifts this weekend as I cannot walk and need to start prednisone&#34;

                                                210 am woke up hot. Walked downstairs had ringing in my ear and saw stars, held the wall almost passed out. Began profusely sweating drenching my clothes. Nausea began. Went back upstairs sat on my bathroom floor due to nausea/ dry heave. All of a sudden SEVERE abdominal pain began 10/10. Cried for my husband. Dripping sweat gave me a cold rag and foam large diarrhea began. Still 10/10 pain in abdomen. Felt like my lower abdomen was getting ripped out.  About 45 minutes or so later still 10/10 wanted to go to ER. I could not stand. If I stood my legs and body felt like I wanted to curl in a ball on the floor. He called an ambulance. I was pale as a ghost, no fever, normal vital signs. Went into full reynauds flare from body stress. Ambulance was unable to get oxygen sat and glucose at the time due to flare. Arrived at the ER labs drawn. WBC 10.9 and Glucose 194. I am not or never have been diabetic. Vaccine related. Like a lightswitch all symptoms stopped except sweating hot and cold spells, sore arm and drowsiness. Discharged at 6am

                                                Vaccine was given at 10:30 am on 12/29/20. The injection caused mild discomfort at the site (right deltoid) followed by swelling, redness, warmth, and soreness. The swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness to touch worsened by 24 hours, peaked at 48 hours, and has since improved (but continued well over 120 hours post vaccination). Other than the arm discomfort, I felt well the rest of the first day however I woke at 1:30 am (15 hours post-vaccine) with severe muscle cramps in my lower legs and feet. I was freezing and had significant chills. PJs, a robe, and 3 blankets weren?t cutting it. I took Ibuprofen 600 mg and a robaxin 750 mg because the cramps were severe and unrelenting. Tmax was 100.5. Sleep was poor and intermittent. I got out of bed around 24 hours post vaccination and was extremely nauseous and weak. I took Zofran 4 mg and Tylenol 500mg and laid around the rest of the day. I forced some food down at hour 29 (had not eaten in 20-21 hours).  My eyes and the injection site were itchy prompting me to take Benadryl 25 mg at hour 22. I got a second round of shaking chills, nausea, and worsened myalgias at hour 32. I also felt as though the injection site pain migrated towards my right axilla. Took a second dose of Ibuprofen 400 mg, Zofran 4 mg, and robaxin 750 mg and fell asleep by 7:30 pm (unheard of for me). When I woke to go to work at 6:30 am (44 hours post vaccine) I was still very achey and fatigued. My right axilla was very sore and tender to touch, moreso than the injection site. This same discomfort migrated to the right side of my neck and behind my right ear (which was worse by hour 55 and brought on a headache). Thank goodness it was a short shift due to the holiday!  While caffeine and a third dose of ibuprofen and Zofran help me through the 6.5 hour shift I was still not myself. The fatigue and achiness did not let up until a little after 96 hours. I really didn?t feel like myself until day 5 (118 hours post vaccination) and the injection site and my right axilla are still sore and tender to touch. There is still redness and occasional itchiness at the injection site. I took my usual doses of Advair and Claritin despite the nausea all 5 days. I should also mention, that while on shift (hour 48-ish), I felt a very brief, unprovoked heaviness in my chest similar to the sensation I felt after I recovered from COVID in March. Sensation lasted seconds and came a few times throughout the day. No SOB, diaphoresis, or wheezing. That same discomfort started 2.5 weeks after I was diagnosis with COVID and about 5 days after feeling &#34;fully recovered&#34; from the fever, body ache, fatigue and nausea I had experienced with COVID. That chest sensation would come and go with decreased frequency over 6 weeks post COVID. I?ve had a total of 5 episodes of the chest heaviness but none today (day 5). I wonder if that?s what will happen with the vaccine. I also wonder if the side effects I?m feeling have anything to do with having had COVID 9 months ago. My husband and other ED colleagues who did not have COVID had no side effects with the first dose of the vaccine but the few colleagues that had COVID all had some degree of an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I never want to feel as bad as I did in March but I?m dreading my second dose of the vaccine. Is it recommended in my case? I should also mention, I had an adverse reaction to the pneumonia vaccine 1.5 years ago - arm blew up, no respiratory symptoms. Needed Benadryl and Prednisone. I?ve had a MMR booster and flu shot since with no adverse reaction. Not sure if it is relevant.

I had a low grade fever of 99.9 that went up to 100.0 measured by ear thermometer  I had joint pain and over all muscle pain By the evening I had mucous in nose, post nasal drip and slight difficulty breathing. I took 2 advils which relieved the fever and body aches On Saturday and into Sunday, I continue to have an over arching malaise, I do not feel healthy.  I feel like my body is fighting something, I developed a slight sore throat and my head feels heavy and foggy. I&#39;ve continued to take advil.

Was very shaky and my tongue felt itchy and tight; not swollen just tight 12:40p made it home and took Benadryl 1:00p symptoms dissipated, ate a chicken salad sandwich thinking that would help with the jittery feeling. 1:25p The whole body flash came back and the tightness in the tongue increased. 1:27p Called employee health for information on this type of reaction. Wanted to call me an ambulance, I declined. After much discussion they suggested I come back to the vaccination observation room where they have epi, then decided it best that I go to Urgent Care. 1:40 on the way to town I told my husband to take me to the ED instead as my bottom lip felt swollen and tight, and my tongue felt thick like it was a bit swollen too. Was not short of breath, airway did not feel compromised, breathing normal, and heart rate normal. 3:01 Was given 40mg Methylpredinisone (solumedrol) &amp; 20mg famotidine (Pepcid) given- immediate improvement in tongue thickness and swollen lips. 440p 50mg Diphenhydramine (Benadryl), 10mg loratadine (Claritin), &amp; 40mg prednisone given prior to discharge 8:20p Top lip started to swell just before my next dose of Benadryl 8:30p Took next dose of Benadryl, once it kicked in had quick resolution of lip swelling 9:00p joint pain started setting in, was uncomfortable but not too painful 1/121 Joint pain is still present but not uncomfortable. Injection arm a little sore, no redness or swelling at site of injection. Swelling of mouth, face and tongue is persistent as it nears the 4-hour mark for 50mg of Benadryl. 1p ate a couple of bites of chicken fried steak, face is increasing in redness and swelling, and mild tongue swelling. At max dose of Benadryl per box states to only take 6 doses in a 24 hour period. 2p Mouth and face swelling not relieved with Benadryl 2:52p checked into ED for 2nd time. 4:08 Given 10mg dexamethasone (decadron), 20mg famotidine (Pepcid), 10mg montelukast (singular) Swelling improved. 5:54p Potassium low on lab work given 40 mEq of potassium chloride 6:00p discharge with scripts for famotidine, epi pen, montelukast 7:00p taken 25mg of Benadryl 8:20p lips feel mildly swollen again. 8:45p next dose of 25mg Benadryl. Did not have complete resolution of swelling but did improve. Mild hives, swelling of hands and feet. 1/2/21 All joint pain is gone, and injection site pain is only noticeable if someone bumps into my arm. 6a 25mg Benadryl &amp; Pepcid 10a 25mg Benadryl 2p 25mg of Benadryl 3:30pm felt fine all day with only mild swelling and redness to hands, ate chicken nachos. Face became very hot (like my face was too close to the oven when I open it), redness from eyes down, lips swollen, mild itchiness too the tongue but nothing too concerning. 4p 25mg Benadryl I strongly believe the exacerbating factor is eating as all times the symptoms increased in intensity I had just eaten.

This lasted about 2 hours and then subsided.  For the last week, I&#39;ve had off and on headaches and feelings of tiredness.  I&#39;ve also had soreness in left arm at the injection site.  Yesterday, 1/5/2021 I noticed increased redness, warmth and a raised area at the injection site.  It&#39;s hard and a little itchy.  I&#39;ve also had soreness in my neck and arm pitt.  I have reached out to employee health through the hospital that i work at and whom i recieved that vaccine from in regards to my symptoms.  The only invervention I&#39;ve taken has been taking tylenol for a headache.

I felt mild pain in my arm in the evening of the 31st and then the pain started from my elbow to my neck on my right side. I went to sleep and woke up with general malaise, chills, body ache, sore throat, headache. the same feeling I had when I had covid, a heaviness in my chest, almost like a shortness of breathe. I was flushed and felt feverish although I never had a fever. The symptoms lasted all day.  On the first also my arm pain was severe, I could not even lift it the whole day. I went to sleep on 01/01 and when I woke up on 01/02 the symptoms were all gone. I took Tylenol 3 times to help me with the symptoms. 3 grams total in 24 hrs.

                                                I had the shot and my only symptom was bruising at the injection site and sore arm.  After a few days my arm no longer hurt, but the bruise remained.  6 days after my injection, I experienced mild itching at the injection site.  Day 7 I noticed my arm was red, swollen, warm to touch, and itchy.  Day 8, my arm continued to swell and the area that was red was larger and very warm to touch at the injection   site.  My arm was also beginning to feel heavy.  I contacted and saw my pcp on day 8 and was told to take an antihistamine.  I took clarity and my symptoms are starting to improve.

                                                I woke up from sleep with severe chest pain at approx. 0400. It was sharp and radiated up to the left side of my neck. The pain was worse with breathing whether I was sitting up or lying down. My heart rate was 150 initially, but came down to 110&#39;s after a few minutes of waking up.  My heart rate did not decrease with rest and the chest pain was not going away, so I drove to the emergency room to be checked. Before I left the house I used my albuterol inhaler once to see if it would make the chest pain and tightness any better.  I received an EKG, mylanta mixed with lidocaine, IV pepcid and IV torodol to help relive the pain. The pain eased some (was a 8/10 when I awoke to a 2/10 after treatment). My blood was drawn, a chest x-ray was taken and the provider informed me all of my lab results, chest x-ray, and physical examination was normal. My EKG showed tachycardia and my heartrate did not drop below 100 beats per minute throughout the whole ER visit.  My BP at the highest was 151/94.  I have never had a problem with a fast heartrate or high blood pressure in the past.  I was discharged with a diagnosis of pleurisy caused by a cough I have been having.  I spent the rest of the day with chest pain and left arm pain from the site of the vaccination.

I felt heat rush into the left side of my head, I was extremely light headed and couldn?t catch my breath. I asked if there was a nurse that could help me. There was 1 paramedic watching everyone. I stepped outside, took my mask off to catch my breath. One staff member accompanied me and sat next to me. I began to shake in my legs and arms involuntarily, my heart kept beating and I just tried to do deep breathing techniques to catch my breath.  The paramedic came outside and asked if I wanted help. I declined his help and I called my husband who was sitting in the car to help me walk to our car. At 1:15, my heart was beating less rapid, I walked back to the car and as my husband was driving us home, my heart began to beat rapidly again, I felt burning and heat in my head and I began to shake in my arms and legs. It lasted about 10-15 minutes. We got home and I could barely walk into the house because I was so weak in my legs. I went to bed where my heart began beating back to normal after 1 hour or so.

                                                My arm became swollen and sore to the touch at the injection site within the first hour. With in 2-3hrs my arm was so sore I could hardly lift it to shoulder height or rotate it.  It was way more severe then I have ever felt from a standard vaxx or flu vaxx in years past. That continued for a full 48hrs, after that it subsided but was still sore around the injection site and the muscle.  I was able to typically use the arm again with minimal pain. Around 14-16hrs after the injection I began to feel very achy and sick. My shoulders, neck and head hurt. I did not have a fever, but my skin all over my body was achy to the touch as well. I also found my self to he extremely tired, like feeling run down, around 12hrs after the shot (when I woke up). The ?fluish? feeling of a headache,  feeling achy and being tired did get a little better but has continued into the 3rd day (today when I am reporting this).

                                                Exactly a week after being given the fist dose of Moderna, I got a rash of about 4in long to 3in wide, in the left arm, at the site of the injection. The rash feels warm to the touch, and it is itchy. Symptoms began on 1-8-21 at night, and were fully present by 1-9-21 in the morning, beginning with itchy and arm pain. By the next morning of 1-10-21, the symptoms worsen to appearing red, warm to the touch, itchiness more than the day before, and discomfort in the entire arm. I then called my doctor for a telehealth visit, and was advised to take Benadryl (which I did that night only), and use cold compress to relieve itchiness. I also put Cortizone on the infected area to manage symptoms. By the morning of 1-11-21, symptoms continued and the redness and itchiness seems to continue down the arm.

Been this way since the 6th of January and I thought it was sore due to the shot and the other small issues I had( headache, low grade fever) The pain was not going away after all the other issues did.

                                                On Wed, Jan13, 2021 I noticed pain in my right arm pit when using deodorant.  I got progressively more uncomfortable and swelling throughout the day.  On Thursday, Jan 14, 2021, I woke up to itchy, burning sensation in my right arm.  It got hot, hard and very itchy as the morning went on.  Sharp burning pain started in my right arm muscles.  I saw PA at my PCP&#39;s office.  She also had a doctor take a look as well.  I was prescribed prednisone taper for 12 days, and I was recommended to take OTC benedryl.   Today, Saturday, January 16, 2021 it is still continuing to get larger, covering most of my upper right arm.  Benedryl has been helping with the itchiness.  It is not as hot and hard, yet continues to spread.  The burning sensation has dulled but still uncomfortable.

I stayed home from work and reported it and was told I could return to work on 1/11 (my next scheduled day) by workplace health. I felt fatigue and eye pressure headaches on and off since. I also felt like I was having vision changes. On 1/14/21 I noticed a small, raised, red area at the injection site. Over the weekend it continued to spread over my arm. It is warm and very mild tenderness to palpation but does not itch. I am also feeling tight muscle pain in my left shoulder and left side of my neck.

Nausea and arm discomfort persisted for about 5 days.   After approximately 48 hours, I noted vision changes, blurry up-close vision.  This change might have occurred sooner, but it was not until this time that I felt well enough to really read.  The change in vision led me to seek further evaluation in the emergency room on 1/16/2021.

                                                Approximately 36 hours of fever of 101, chills, shivering, sweats, aches and pain in every joint in my body, back pain, headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, nausea, difficulty completing my daily work duties and household activities due to pain and not feeling well. This was not much helped by Alleve, therefore I took Tylenol which was mildly helpful. After the first 36 hours, the symptoms lessened in severity and lasted for about another 12 hours. After that, I felt well for several days in a row, then about 1 week later I felt sore, weak, tired and nauseous. This resolved in its own in about 2 hours. I have felt well since then. I am choosing to receive my second dose of moderna vaccine tomorrow, because I would rather experience these side effects then catch COVID ever again. I caught COVID19 in March 2020. With my COVID infection, I was sick for about 21 days with fever of 101 and more, bone pain, body aches, chest pain, back pain, headaches, nausea, shaking chills, sweats, trouble breathing, dyspnea, cough, runny nose, sore throat, pink eye, dizziness, tiredness, ?brain fog? and fatigue. I was not hospitalized. After about 21 days I began to recover, but the first week after my recovery began I was very weak and tired, and spent most of my time sleeping. I was 41 years old at the time, with health problems including well controlled asthma and being overweight. I never wish to experience this again and I am grateful that I am receiving the Modena vaccine. Thank you so much for logging my side effects.

Following that dose I had mild soreness in my arm and was just tired, for the next day.  1/21/21 I received my second dose.  This time I had a very sore arm, very sore neck muscles and back, generalized achy body, and tiredness.  Until yesterday 1/28/21 - I woke up early morning 0200 with a severe headache, I took some pain medicine and fell back to sleep, I woke up in the AM unable to function.  I could not keep anything down all day (food or drink).  I had the headache all day.  I emailed my PCP who called me in some medication that helped get rid of the headache and ease the vomiting.

                                                As soon as shot was given I bled badly. They used about 6 square gauze to control the bleeding. The injection was not put into left arm muscle like it was supposed to. Instead it was put into the back of my left arm. I&#39;m not sure it hit my artery or what happened. But now I still have a huge deep purple bruise, and my shoulder hurts and burns and so does my arm around the injection site.  I have been taking pictures to document bruising since date of injection.

The next morning I experienced brain fog, inability to formulate thoughts correctly, difficulty thinking, lack of concentration, muscle soreness, aches all over body, tired easily, shortness of breath, fever, chills,  and nausea.  36 hours after receiving vaccine, I still feel uneasy on my feet, light headedness, muscle soreness, stiff neck, nose bleeds, headache, nausea and extreme fatigue.

Then my legs started to feel heavy and numb, then my face felt numb and then my arms. I could barely pick something up and I could not stand. Then my jaw started to shake and so did my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was having a shock/panic attack response to the vaccine. On Monday 1/25 I woke up in extreme stomach pain and went back to the ER and they said I needed to have my appendix out. I went to a hospital where they tried to just give me antibiotics, but still had to have my appendix out on Wednesday 1/27.

                                                Chills began within 2 hours of injection.  Fever rose to 101 within 6 hours and lasted for approximately 48 hours.  Chills lasted the entire time the fever lasted.  After the fever came down to below 100, bodyache became more recognizable.  Most unusual pain, which began while the temperature was above 100, was in the muscles connecting my neck to the shoulders, more severely on the left-side where the injection was administered.  The pain was so severe that it felt the muscle was tense, numb and itchy at the same time. The severity of the pain made it feel like the throat was closing up even though I knew it was not true because I did not have trouble breathing.  This pain lasted (in similar intensity) approximately about 36 hours. After this, on the third day, most of the pain was gone but I experienced dizziness, nausea, and diarrhea.  I had a loss of appetite the whole time (over 72 hours) I was experiencing these side effect symptoms.

Saturday 2/20, 24 hours after getting the vaccine my tongue started to swell up/ was splotchy/ had bumps allong the side and my throat was scratchy. My breathing/asthma was also triggered and I increased use of my albuterol.  I took benadryl with minimum results, but symptoms did not get severe enough to go to the ER.   The next day, Sunday 2/21 my tongue was still swollen and my jaw/ face were also sore and had inflammation. This was in addition to the sore arm/joints.

                                                I developed severe shoulder pain within 3 hours of my vaccination.  The injection was given high on my shoulder, and after consultation with a physician it became apparent that the injection was into a bursa of my shoulder instead of intramuscularly. I am currently in a sling and unable to use my affected arm.

The soreness was then spread to the shoulder, then in the middle of night, I was awaken with whole body muscle aches that similar to flu. The next day, the aches were subsided but I felt tired and sleepy with sore arm the entire day. I went to sleep early and lasted for 11 hrs  (something that is unusual for me).

                                                My husband noticed my that my arm near the injection site was red and raised last night, January 2nd - over one week after the vaccine.  Then I was woken up around 1 in the morning January 3rd (today) with fairly intense itching at that site.  Today it is raised, red, and mildly itchy.  We took pictures to show the difference in arms.  Of note, the pain from the vaccine was so severe I couldn?t even pick up a water glass or put a shirt over my head with that arm.  It was only that bad on 12/27 and rapidly improved. I am just mentioning this in case people who have had itching over one week also had severe pain after the injection.

Injection site was extremely sore and swollen, to the point I could not even touch the area. This was the left deltoid. Extreme fatigue, I was in bed the entire day sleeping on and off. Overall muscle pain as well.  on 1/2/2021 I was feeling much better, my arm was almost completely improved. Only mild soreness, and only a low grade temp of 99.6.  Since then, on day 5, I seem to have some dizziness but it is goes away quickly.

I kept saying it felt like my whole body was floppy and melting into the couch, and I couldn?t motivate to stand or do anything for 24 hours.  Then myalgias and nausea continued for 2 days.  Around the same time as the malaise, I developed a palpable indurated area under the vaccine site.  Then day 8 my entire shoulder swelled up with overlying red leathery skin and axillary pain but no adenopathy.  Day 10, back to normal except for some residual red pruritic skin extending down my arm.

My nodes under my arm are swollen and painful for which I&#39;ve been taking NSAIDs with little relief. &#34;Really noticed it Saturday [1/2/21]. Been using a warm compress which helps a little but not much. Haven&#39;t seen anyone yet.&#34;

                                                I felt fatigue, soreness and redness at injection site, and muscle aches the next morning (1/1/21). Noted a red area that was 1.5 inches around. The redness started to improve on  1/5/21. On 1/6/21 the redness came back worse. I felt pain and itching at the site. It began welting. By that afternoon it was 3 inches around, dark red, small blister on top of the welting.  I  called my doctor&#39;s office, they had me call the COVID-19 number. The COVID-19 Nurse stated it sounded like a typical reaction. He recommended Benadryl cream and heating pad. Today is 1/8/21. The redness is at 4 plus inches around. Still sore and itchy. I still have some muscle aches and a headache. I haven&#39;t been seen by a doctor, but I may go to urgent care for evaluation.

I began having redness at the injection site on 1/1/21. It measured 1.5 inches around. It began fading on 1/4/21. On 1/6/21, the redness started to come back along with pain and itching at the site. It measured 2 inches. The redness began getting darker in color and welting. I called my doctor&#39;s office. They recommended for me to call the COVID-19 number they had. The COVID-19 Nurse said it sounds like a typical vaccine reaction. He said to use Benadryl cream and a heating pad. Today (1/8/2020) the redness is over 4 inches around, painful, and itchy. It has a small blister on top of the welting. It almost looks like rings of different redness levels. I think I am going to go to urgent care to have it evaluated. I still have some muscle weakness, fatigue, and a headache(3 days.)

She was diaphoretic at the onset of symptoms she was able to follow commands and answer questions but that became increasingly difficult. Symptoms worsen and patient started to vomit. Ambulance was called but patient refused to go with them. Felt better approximately 40 minutes after being vaccinated. Left accompanied by her husband.

                                                This is another reaction I experienced. My  left arm started to be sore again  8 days after vaccination, on 1/7/21 (I originally had sore arm on left the first 3 days of vaccination but then it was recovered).  I also feel there is some weakness on my left arm as well.  I wonder if this is a delayed reaction and if it would be permanent? I previously filed  an report on early adverse events-left arm soreness within an hour of vaccination, then spread  across shoulder, in the middle of night, I woke up with whole body muscle ache that lasted till next morning. The next day of vaccination, I was tired , yawning frequently and very sleepy. I slept for 11 hours on the second night of vaccination which was unusual for me. The sore arm disappeared after about 3 days. But 8 days later it occurs again with some weakness on upper left arm.

Thought maybe covid,  took test and it was negative, so now 7 days post vaccine still chest burning and scapula pain is intermittent. Contact pcp, going for bloodwork and chest xray. Outcomes to be determined. Pcp believes this is a vaccine reaction.

The evening after receiving the shot, I had a rash on my neck and arms that was itchy and I had hives on my face and back.  These subsided after the evening, the itchiness stayed till next day, but then subsided. My arms started to feel bobbly and tender, lots of little bumps under the surface. Around 1/5 I noticed it was red, it started to itch a lot and then it became very firm/solid lump with swelling, and it was very red.  Swelling and solidness has subsided now, but redness is still there, however it&#39;s subsiding.

                                                Thursday night shortly after the vaccine I was exhausted and headed home to go lay down. While driving, I developed a severe headache. I went home and went to sleep really early. Friday morning, woke up, went to work. Extreme lethargy and severe headache. Left work early (2 ish) with joint pain, headache, lethargy. In the evening (still Friday) I went to the grocery store and walking in the parking lot to the store my joints hurt with every step. I sent my partner in and I went back to the car. I could not do it. Went to sleep soon thereafter. Saturday morning, we woke up and had planned to go to the cabin. We were trying to run errands (coffee shop, post office, bank...simple errands) and I was exhausted and feeling bad. Still headache, lethargy, achy. Assumed it was flu like which was a side effect, so I continued to press on through the discomfort. Left for the mountains. less than 1 mile from home, started to feel tingling and &#34;buzzing&#34; throughout my body, like a vibration sort of. Stayed quiet and thought about this. Another block or two and the feeling was in my tongue. Then I felt it in each tooth root and spoke up. I asked to go home and rest for 30 minutes before going to the cabin. At this point, I could not move my hands. We got to the house and I could not open my car door or take off my seatbelt. I had hand paralysis for about 10 minutes. Made it in the house. Got to the couch and laid down for about 60 seconds. Got up had to use the restroom. Solid, not diarrhea, but took 45 minutes. Apparently, I was pale like a piece of paper. I do not remember being in the bathroom for 45 minutes, I felt like it was 5 minutes, partner said 45 minutes. Made it back to couch, laid down, freezing! Under 2 blankets, one of them was an electric blanket on high. Began throwing up, clear bile. Had not eaten anything yet. Stayed on couch, also lost track of time, was there for 5 ish hours. Tried to eat something so I could take Tylenol for the headache. Barely ate anything, so I never took the Tylenol. It lessened. Cabin trip cancelled. Still lethargy and dizzy yesterday but no joint pain, no nausea. Now, Monday morning, still dizzy/lightheaded. Symptoms are subsiding, but not gone.

I worked out this morning hoping the movement and circulation would improve the pain but no improvement. Unable to lie on R side secondary to arm pain. Developed chills, fever 101.1, muscle aches throughout body, and headache. No nausea or vomiting.  Took ibuprofen to hopefully help the pain and aches. Will take tylenol if the fever persists.

                                                I felt very heavy (especially my limbs) and had a slight headache on Thursday (the day after receiving the vaccine).  This feeling continued into Friday morning when I nearly passed out (blacked out and collapsed for a split second) as I was crouched position for approximately 10 minutes at work.  I felt dizzy and slow moving for the next several hours.  My blood pressure was rated as normal, blood oxygen normal, and pulse slightly low by a nurse on staff who took my vitals after the episode.   My temperature, which had been 97.8 prior to the event that morning (typical for me) was elevated during this time to 100.2 and returned to normal after approximately 4 hours without medication.  I was fatigued, so I slept for approximately 4-5 hours that afternoon and began feeling better the following day (Saturday).

My left arm was significantly sore all day, pain from my shoulder to elbow and into my armpit/chest.  On Wednesday, Jan 20th, I noticed a red mark, oval in shape, about 4 inches from the injections site that became warm to touch.  During Wednesday and Thursday, the red mark got larger, wrapping around the outside of my arm and slightly swelled.  It is still warm to touch but not as red today (Monday 1/25). I have applied ice to it twice a day for 20 minutes at a time.

                                                Around 730-8 I got a really bad headache. Throughout the night my back tightened up and my hips. I got up tp get ready to go to work, I felt really  light headed while I was brushing my teeth but went in to work. I started felling shortened of breathe and achy. I started feeling  bad and told my Head Nurse and he took my BP and I have a fever. My heart beat was rapid. I went home, slept and had no appetite . The I ended up going to the Hospital  my chest was hurting bad in my lung area, everything about me just hurt I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.  They did xray on my lungs, they were clear, my BP was still high, my heart rate had calmed down. They had me sit and relax. The next day I woke up and was ready to put my scrubs on, it was like nothing has ever happened to me. I felt worse with the vaccine then I did when I got the Covid, all I had with Covid headache.  Everything hit so rapid and fast after the shot.

                                                Right arm was sore to move and had armpit tenderness the first week. At the end of the first week I started to notice some redness along the injection site. The armpit began to swell about midweek after the vaccine as well. I began to use ice and ibuprofen to relieve the symptoms however yesterday (1-26-2021) I noticed that the redness was really starting to get worse and contacted my physician. Sent pics via patient chart and he suggested to keep doing what I was doing. This a.m. (1-27-2021) the redness was more apparent (quite warm to the touch too) and starting to broaden down my arm. Called Dr, had a visit. He recommended prednisone on top of icing and ibuprofen. Suggested I let CDC know as well.

                                                I received my second dose of the moderna vaccine on a Sunday at 10:30 am in my left deltoid.   Symptoms started with chills and swollen supraclavicular lymph nodes around 10:30 that night, and progressed to body aches,  joint pain, muscle pain,  and a low grade fever.   I was unable to sleep due to chills and pain.   The muscle pain would radiate down my arms and legs, and I would sometimes have a pinpoint sharp pain in the bottom of my left foot.  Symptoms persisted the next day, and also included extreme fatigue, nausea, and enlarged and painful axillary and supraclavicular lymph nodes.  The  supraclavicular lymph nodes were large enough to visibly see.   A round rash/redness started around the injection site started on Monday as well.   This also occurred with the first vaccine, but is much larger this time.   Most symptoms had resolved as of Tuesday, except for fatigue and the rash which are still on going.

It took about an hour to stop shivering and feeling warm. the lower back pain got better the next day, but  I still have the headaches the comes and goes. Almost like foggy feeling.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0830. My arm felt sore during the day. In the evening (around 1700), I began to feel muscle aches and pain in my joints (wrists, knees, ankles). I also felt fatigue and brain fog. My injection site (L upper arm) was sore, felt hot to touch and was about 5/10 pain-wise.  I took Tylenol 1,000mg PO and rested for the next 24 hours. The muscle aches and joint pain resolved after 24 hours. However, up to 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt extreme fatigue and could not resume my regular level of activity. After 48 hours, I returned to regular activities.

                                                I started with fatigue on 12/24/20 and on 12/25/20 developed fatigue and chills (could not get warm). On 12/25/20 I was walking downstairs when my husband felt I didn&#39;t look normal. I fell off the bottom two stairs sustaining injury to both feet. I was able to get myself up to standing position and then sat down. My husband reports that a few minutes later I had what he described was seizure activity for about one minute/stopped breathing and he called 911. Due to COVID visitor restrictions my husband was not allowed to go to the ER with me the night of the incident.  I had full work-up with labs, EKG and head CT that were unremarkable  at Medical Center.  I had an appointment with my primary care physician on 12/28/20 and was referred to neurologist. He did an exam, ordered MRI and sleep deprived EEG. My MRI was completed and reported as no abnormalities. I have the sleep deprived EEG  scheduled on 1/11/21. I have continued pain/physical therapy on both feet/ankles from the date of the incident.

                                                about 2 minutes after receiving the shot I felt like I was having an allergic reaction in my chest area. My lower esophagus got extremely tight and then it worked its way up to the back of my throat. It felt like there was a lump in the back of my throat, along with burning in my throat. This same reaction also occurs when I eat certain foods I&#39;m intolerant to. I felt very dizzy right after as well. After exactly one hour my throat symptoms went away but suffered from residual effects for the next few days.  The next day I couldn&#39;t lift my left arm(which went away 2 days later), I was out of breath with everything I did, dizzy, muscle cramps, chills, body aches(as though I had the flu) and had extreme fatigue. All of theses symptoms lasted for the next week almost two.

                                                The patient had a previous reaction to a flu vaccine.  She was treated for Bell&#39;s Palsy related to the flu vaccine 3 years ago.  The patient with the moderna vaccine started feeling left arm weakness and the arm felt heavy.  She was unable to lift arm.  She had a lump in her throat but minimal difficulty breathing and swallowing.  She then reported right arm weakness and being unable to move either arm.  She was having episodic type reactions. Every few minutes she would lose color and appear to be having difficulty breathing and swallowing but would come back to normal within a minute or two.  After the 4th episode in which she stated she was going to pass out and could not move her legs, we had EMS called to come monitor the patient.  EMS took vitals and monitored for and additional 20-30 minutes.  The patient refused to leave with EMS and I continued to monitor for a short time longer for the duration of about 1.5 hours.

Pain and swelling moved down into armpit and below followed by extreme itching.  Swelling and pain then moved down to left elbow. Then I developed throat itching, difficulty swallowing and wheezing. I also developed joint pain in opposite shoulder. I  immediately took 600 mg Ibuprofen and 50 mg Benadryl .  Itching, redness, and wheezing, and difficulty swallowing resolved about 30 minutes after taking the medication.  Next morning (today) I still have pain and swelling around injection site. Pain in left elbow and right shoulder joints. I still have moderate pain and edema below left armpit.

                                                Felt a burning sensation in my hands right after getting the shot.  Went home,  took 2  Aleve and iced my arm for 5 minutes at a time on and off about 4 times.  Hours later,  about 8 pm I was laying down on the couch on my left side for at least 20 minutes.  When I was getting up my upper left arm was very numb and I had a strange sensation on my left side like my blood had pooled over there but it was very numb in the area.  I never have felt anything like that.  The sensation did go away over the course of a few minutes.  Soon after I was having shooting pain in my hands.  It felt like arthritis pain.  This did not last too long but came back here and there.  My lower back started hurting a little bit out of nowhere.  And then when I went to bed I started having random body aches all over.  Like brief shooting pain in different parts of my body.  I did have some dryness, weird sensation in my throat at times. The body aches kept me up until 2 or 3 am.  It was resolved by the time I woke.  I never felt that I had a temperature.  And I was not sick prior so I felt it was a cause and effect from the vaccine.  I took 2 Aleve and I went to work.  Temperature checked at work and I was 97.1,  normal.  Wore a mask all day,  social distanced at work and I had mentioned to my manager upon arrival that I had symptoms/reaction? after my shot.  I did still have some residual,  arthritis type pain in my hands during the day and more so when I got home.  I also felt fatigued when I got home from work but I was half awake most of the night before due to the body aches.  Felt pretty good,  normal on the second day after the vaccine.

My hand and wrist does have pain in them at times and does make this bothersome and at times difficult to use at my line of work for the developmentally disabled.  This is the arm that I was given the vaccination in.

                                                24 hours after vaccination I had tingling and numbness on right side of face, heavy eyelids, &#34;pulling sensation&#34; in neck. Unable to lay flat.  Tingling and numbness would switch from right side to entire face but mostly on right side.  Headaches and noticed increased heart rate two days after vaccine. One week after vaccine numbness and weakness extended down right arm and leg, able to move leg just felt &#34;weak&#34;.  I thought I was having a stroke or TIA. Made an appt. with the NP and she did full neuro exam and everything came back normal.  Also, made an appt. with my PCP.  Still continued to have headaches and weakness improved. Did get a COVID test since was still having headaches and it so long since vaccine, received test 1/12/2021 and it was negative. This past weekend was the 1st time I felt &#34;pre vaccine&#34; 17 days post vaccination. I am truly hesitant to take my 2nd dose scheduled on 1/26/2021.

The pain was moderate and did affect my activity of daily living. The discomfort could be felt at rest, and took about 5 days to improve. Three and a half weeks later I can still palpate the bump. I am not getting the second vaccine. I did have a mammogram two months ago, which was normal. If the bump does not go away within the next two weeks I will go see my primary care physician.

                                                at 15 mins post injection started to get extremely hot from Right side to left. Then like half of my body was cut head to toe in half and the left side of my body went numb and tingly. I could barely move my extremeties. Tounge began to burn like a 9volt battery was being held on it. I was taken to the ER and was told I had a rash on my chest neck and chin. I was treated with Epi IM, Benedryl, famotdine, then had epi again because my tounge felt fat and like a 9volt battery again. Epi went IV second does and had extreme pain with that. Had IV tylenol . Along with IV fluids. For the next 5 days I have had pain in my right harm , shoulder , neck into my head to the tip of my nose. The first 4 days were so bad that I could barely move and would get nauseated and throw up if I moved just right. each day the pains in my right arm,shoulder, neck and head did get better by about 25 percent each day. You could feel it getting better with each day I woke up.  I was also having ear pain that seemed to be worse on 1/19/21. A PA checked my ears and said they were clear.Today, 1/22/21 is the first day I have been able to turn my head without being so sore and feeling nauseated. I was also very fatigued until today, 1/22/21. My hips and lower body are sore today and upper body seems to be less sore by 75%. I still am numb at times in my feet and fingers but can turn my head a lot better today.

But worst is inability to lift left arm, severe left arm pain, even joint pain in left wrist. Could barely lift L arm on day 2 after (Sunday) and again unable to lift it day 3 after (Monday).  First dose, I had arm pain, trouble lifting it 1 day, pain for a week and mild soreness for the whole month. Pre-existing joint pains from autoimmune were worse for a week, but this second dose - it only seems to be vaccine side, including left jaw, left eye pain, left collarbone pain near a previously affected injury.

The next day, muscle aches &amp; chills continued, and were joined by exhaustion, fatigue, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, migraines, chest congestion (for one day).  The symptoms continued to worsen each day, and on 2/09, I vomited and went to the clinic.  I tested negative for Covid-19, (both the rapid and 3 day tests), negative for the flu, negative for strep.  I started taking Excedrin for the migraines, and it helped, but prior to that, no medicine was working.  I continued to rest and take Excedrin.  Daily symptoms continued to include:  migraine, fatigue, chills &amp; aches, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, could only warm drinks &amp; bland food.  Also nausea, short of breath.  These symptoms continued to slowly improve, but I had them through 2/19.

When I woke up the next morning, the site was raised and swollen more than the night before. It had the appearance of cellulitis. It was still hot to the touch. I marked the edges of the rash and it progressively got bigger over the course of 48 hours. I still have a mark on my arm where the rash was. I also had severe jaw and neck pain. I felt like my wisdom teeth were pulled with no lidocaine.  I has boughts of nausea and was very tired. I tried to put ice on the area of my arm that was swollen, but it did not help.

                                                Received vaccine on 3/3/21 at 2:30pm. Waited for 20 minutes at pharmacy for allergic reaction. Given the all clear, so headed home. Around 5pm, I started noticing how extremely sore my left arm was, almost as if somebody had hit it with a baseball bat (no bruising, redness, etc., just VERY sore). I also started noticing numbness and tingling in my left arm that traveled down the outside of my arm into my left hand and into my left pinky finger.   As the evening progressed, I lost my appetite, developed a headache, felt extremely fatigued, was dizzy, had muscle and joint aches, had left kidney pain, and began to feel flushed and hot. I took my temperature and it showed I was running a low-grade fever of 98.7F (my normal temperature is anywhere between 96.9F and 97.1F). I went to bed around 9pm.  Around 3am (which is now 3/4/21), I woke up with nausea, and my left arm/hand/finger really experiencing numbness and tingling (it&#39;s as if that portion of my arm/hand/finger was semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was on the verge of throwing up. I broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed and went back to sleep.  Around 5am (still 3/4/21), I woke up again with nausea and my left arm/hand/finger still numb and tingling (semi-paralyzed). I went to the bathroom and was again on the verge of throwing up. I, again, broke out into a cold, clammy sweat but did not vomit. I got back into bed. I decided to take a Zofran around 6am for the nausea.  I slept from 8am-12pm on 3/4/21 due to the Zofran. When I woke up, I called the pharmacist at pharmacy to notify them of my symptoms. The pharmacist everything I experienced was normal and should go away in 2-3 days (if they didn&#39;t then contact my regular doctor), that I could take Tylenol for any pain, and I still needed to keep my follow-up appointment for the second shot.  The entire day on 3/4/21 from 12pm until I went to bed around 10pm, I still experienced an extremely sore arm, loss of appetite, slight headache, fatigue, dizziness, muscle and joint aches, left kidney pain, low-grade fever (for me), and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger.  I was able to sleep through the night, and woke up around 6am on 3/5/21. Currently, I am still experiencing an extremely sore arm, fatigue, and the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger. I am EXTREMELY concerned about the numbness/tingling/paralysis in my left hand and left pinky finger as it does not seem to be getting better.

                                                Initial swelling and soreness right after injection.  Swelling and pain continued for the next few days, Motrin 800mg and Benadryl 25mg  at bedtime were taken.  Swelling and pain persisted.  Area became hard, red, itchy and raised over the holiday.  Swelling, redness and itchiness became worse over the weeknd into Monday. I was unable to lift my arm, bring it behind my back or reach.  It was very painful and hot.   I then contacted employee health.  They did not feel it was infected but was the delayed reaction to the moderna vaccine.  I did not feel comfortable with this and I then contacted my physician who looked at it and felt it was in fact cellulitis, I was sent for a ultrasound to rule out a blood clot and labs and an IV infusion of Rocephin as well as oral antibiotics.  I received my first infusion yesterday.  The swelling has improved greatly, however the redness has spread beyond the marked area on my arm and I will be receiving another dose of IV Rocephin today.  My labs showed my CRP was elevated  and my ALT/AST were elevated as well.

                                                The day after I received vaccine I had severe arm pain at injection site, my body was achy , and fatigue. These symptoms resolved after a few days . I then had dizziness, nausea, unbalanced when walking, chest pain, feeling like my heart was racing,  palpatations, muscle weakness in my legs, and brain fog. The unbalanced feeling, dizziness, weakness ,and occasional palpatations remain. I had a covid test done on 1/6/2021.I had sinus pain started on 1/8/2021. I am being treated for possible sinus infection with Augmentin that I started on 1/11/2021 but my symptoms are still present . I have been unable to work because when I walk I feel dizzy and unsteady.  I have follow up with my primary doctor on 1/18/2021.

They&#39;re all mobile.No other symptoms to speak of.  No fever, no sore throat, no redness/swelling anywhere. Some mild baseline tiredness. I had some soreness in upper arm the first few days after the vaccine , some vague right shoulder/upper back pain last weekend that I attributed to muscle strain from overuse. I noted the 2 larger 1cm lymph nodes by mid-right clavicle 4 days ago, and the 2 smaller 0.5cm right sided lower cervical chain LNs 2 days ago.

The fever broke early Saturday morning but the headache, pains &amp; fatigue continued throughout Saturday. She felt better by Sunday, just a little fatigue but attribute that to the poor sleep from Friday &amp; Saturday.

My throat did not close, but it clenched or got tight and my tongue seemed to tense.  Before I had time to think about that, I had a surge of adrenaline which left me a bit startled.  The tongue and throat tightening happened without an adrenaline surge approximately 4 more times.  I lost feeling in my left arm and felt lightheaded.  This lasted about 30 minutes, after which I felt fine.  I experienced sharp stabbing pains in hands, feet, pelvis and fingers, which are still present 48 hours later.  At 24 hours post-vaccine, I felt chills and developed muscle aches and a low fever, which are still present at 48 hours post-vaccine.

The next day I experienced fever 100.5, body aches, joint pain, chills, and cough so I went and had a rapid covid and flu test performed and both were negative. Family doctor suggested the two day covid test and the results were negative on Friday. If I don&#39;t have covid then are they side affects from vaccine.

                                                8 days after the vaccine, I developed a blotchy red rash that trailed down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was red, swollen and painful to touch. Mild itchiness noted on that arm. Otherwise, I was fine. Just seemed strange so long after the vaccination. It improved without intervention and was gone within 2-3 days. I did not seek professional help because I read that this reaction was noted with the Moderna vaccine and that it was just considered a mounting immune response and no cause for concern.  However, I still thought I should report it. I have since received the second dose of vaccine on 2/19/21. I had moderate side effects starting on 2/20/21 (lasting 15 hours) of fatigue, chills, body aches, joint pain, headache, generalized body swelling, swelling and pain at injection site and brain fog. I didn?t experience a rash (yet- the vaccine was only 3 days ago). Will update if that changes.

On 2/21 around 9:00am I had a fever of 101F and was very achy, tired and had a mild headache. At 7:00pm on 2/21 I had a fever of 101F and was still achy and had a headache. I took two regular strength Tylenol at 9:30pm on 2/21 and that took the edge off so I could sleep. I woke up on 2/22 feeling better but still had a sore neck and arm. The whole time I had a sore arm starting on 2/20 around 3pm.

                                                Mild dizziness started within 5 minutes. Within 20 minutes my tongue started to swell, but only the front to middle part, not the back part. I was still able to breathe. After 25 minutes, I was unable to stand and nearly passed out twice trying to get to some place safe.  I could not verbally communicate and was lacked strength to move. I started drinking as many fluids as possible with the assistance of family. Symptoms began to subside after 3 hrs. After 4 hrs, I regained strength and was not dizzy if I stayed in place. I continued to push fluids and rested. I needed to be careful not to drink anything too cold as i would develop the chills. The next day, there was no dizziness but I was very groggy. I continued to push fluids. I would develop a headache if I did not drink at 16 oz every hour. The following day, I was still groggy, but was functional and felt okay to drive.

On day 13 (February 21), she noticed a bump about the size of a pea under the clavicle. At the injection site, she described her arm as being a little blotchy, sore and mildly swollen but it does not itch. She also felt a little tired and had a mild headache.  She took a nap and felt better.  On day 14 (February 22) the injection site reaction continues and the pea-sized bump under the bra strap (under the clavicle) remains, and the whole left side of the breast feels a little achy.   Patient wants to get dose 2 and plans to request it be administered in the right arm instead.

She had excruciating pain for 48 hours, especially if she tried to move it. It was better after 4 days, but still is uncomfortable 4 weeks later, when she reported this to us. She reports that she will go to her PCP if the pain does not resolve totally. She has been doing ROM excerises that her cousin who is a PT has recommended for her.

I also had  severe stabbing stomach pain, sweating, vomiting and pain in my back. Day 2-6 most of the symptoms cleared up except the headache and stabbing stomach pain. I am currently on day 6 and I have severe  stomach pain every time after I eat food. I am going to see a gastro doctor to rule out gallbladder inflammation.

Physical therapy twice a week little relief. The very next day after the second vaccine had another major attack that with same symptoms. Went to physiatrist linked the lyme and vaccine, placed me on cerebrex and in a little over a week I was able to go one day without any spasms and pain for the first time in over a month.

                                                First I got a headache, then I felt extra mucus in my throat. Then I started feeling compression, pressure, and pain in my diaphragm; and then the middle of my chest. Finally, I started coughing, and I wasn&#39;t able to breathe.   I had told all of the nursing staff that I had anaphylaxis to the first shot, but they acted like they didn&#39;t believe me. Also, there was no EMS staff on hand this time, unlike the first time, where they were on site. I think that made the difference in my medical care, because my husband heard the nurses at the facility say they were treating me for anxiety, not anaphylaxis, despite the fact that I was getting worse.   The nurses on staff didn&#39;t seem to understand or believe that a person could have anaphylaxis from the Covid injection, even though it&#39;s on record at the hospital that that&#39;s what happened the first time. It wasn&#39;t the same staff as last time, which also contributed to the problem. Once the ambulance staff got there, he took me seriously, and finally administered an EpiPen, and also put me on oxygen, which helped a little bit.  that was the most comprehensive care I got that day, from someone who was actually listening to me he also took an EKG, which which was normal.  When I got to Facility, the treatment wasn&#39;t as good as last time, either. Apparently they&#39;ve been really busy the day before, and all of the staff seemed fatigued because of it. Nobody really checked on me, offered me even ice chips to moisten my mouth, and didn&#39;t offer me any assistance in getting to the bathroom, either. a respiratory therapist came in to give me a couple puffs on an albuterol inhaler, and I got a Benadryl shot, but nothing else. I think if I had not taken my coterie of prescriptions to stave off anaphylaxis, it would have been worse.   20 minutes before the shot I took: two aspirin, a CBD capsule, and one each of the following pills -cetirizine, benadryl, famotidine, 20 mg of prednisone, hydroxyzine. I think that&#39;s what enabled me to recover with only one EpiPen, instead of two, like last time. if there&#39;s a third Moderna shot for the varients, or a booster, I&#39;ll try to take all those pills an hour beforehand, and see if having them in my system for a longer period of time we&#39;ll make the difference. It will be nice to have *no* anaphylaxis, and skip the hospital trip . Since then, it&#39;s taken me about a week to recover fully, the same as after the first shot. I&#39;ve had problems breathing, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, flushing, fever/chills, and in general just felt like I had the flu.

                                                Slight right  facial numbness half hour post administration lasting 30 mins. Chills and Rt arm site pain and swelling on the first night. 2nd night, chills and increased swelling, pain to right arm site with slight weeping, warm to touch and redness. Throughout the first two weeks, I would have intermittent chills and right arm site redness, swelling, pain, warmth was gradually getting better but did not have any fever the first 13 days.  The night of 2/15/2021, I felt the chills, body aches and went to sleep. All night I felt I was about to get a fever. I was in bed until 1pm the next day on 2/16/21 when I started to have the severe tremors with my chills, back spasms, abdominal pain, and nausea. I got out of bed, took my temp and it was 101.5 F orally. I tried to take Tylenol but I could not because as soon as I sipped some water, I started vomiting yellow emesis first and then later on I was already vomiting greenish bile. I was getting weaker, lethargic and my tremors and chills were getting worst as well as my back spasms and abdominal pain. My husband, then brought me to the ER around 2:30-3pm. I was admitted in ICU for septic shock with unknown source on that day, 2/16/2021. I was on levophed drip via right chest central venous catheter for 48 hours and was given multiple antibiotics until discharged to home on 2/20/21. I developed red facial rashes more prominent to the right side on the second day of admission. Two days after discharge, I had headaches for two days with right shoulder pain. But, on the next day which was the 3rd day post hospitalization, I broke out with generalized reddened, raised, itchy and burning rashes. My husband brought me back to the ER on that day on 2/24/21. ER MD loaded me with dexamethasone steroid IV and Benadryl IV and sent me home with oral dexamethasone and anti-histamine orally. I saw my primary MD on 2/26/2021 for hospital follow up and referred me to Infectious disease MD and Endriconologist. On March 3rd, I was started on insulin SQ due to my blood sugars running 300?s to almost 400. As of now, my MD is still adjusting my insulin dosage due to persistent high blood sugar readings of 300-400 mg/dL.

                                                Day 1: within 30 min  - severe sharp temporal headache (worst of my life); developed within a couple hours in this sequence: cold hands/feet, chills (no fever), much worsened vision, slight confusion/dizziness, weakness (had to lay down), both knee joint pain, swollen neck glands, moderate nausea and intestinal cramps, complete loss of smell/taste; all night - severe acidic stomach pain (barely relieved with anti-acids). Day 2: residual headache (50%), tiredness, weakness, sweating if doing things, residual knee joint pain, sense of smell/taste returned and heightened. Day 3: residual headache (25%), still not 100%, residual knee joint pain. Day 4 (today):  residual knee joint pain (comes and goes). I realize that these are not symptoms of an allergic reaction, but severe side effects.

I injured my scartic nerve one year in a 1/2 ago from lifting and for some particular reason that nerve started to hurt hours after vaccine.  Today is 01/05/2021 and my scartic nerve is still aching as of today. Nerve started aching and hurting after Moderna Covid19 vaccine. I was having any problems with nerve before vaccine.

Upon waking the next day(1/5/21) , I felt like I had a migraine on the left side of my face.  Head, ear, and jaw on the left side was painful.  Used  Aleve . The pain was still present, although a little less intense the following day (1/6/21). Arm is also sore but much more manageable than the head pain.

I had had covid in August 2020 and received the shot then experienced a strong reaction. Fever of 100-101 for two days, extreme arm pain at injection site for 3 days with swelling and redness, body aches for 3 days, joint and fingers swollen for 2 days. Headache continues still at 5 days and time of this report.  Most notably is that my left thigh and gluteus has gone numb. This also happened when sick in August but not to the extreme that it is now. The area of the hip bone is predominately the most numb and sore. This was not the injection site.&#34;

I took Tylenol 1300mg on Tuesday evening. I woke up Wednesday morning with some discomfort and decided to take another dose of Tylenol 1300mg approximately 10:00 am. The pain increased and I took another dose of Tylenol 1300 mg approximately 1500. Tylenol was not relieving my discomfort and approximately at 1800 I took Celebrex 200 mg . I went to bed at 2200. Lying down was difficult. I could not turn my head from side to side without excruciating pain. I finally went to sleep. I woke up Thursday morning pain free.

About 1 pm was sitting at my desk when felt flush and neck hurt. Noted rash across neck and upper torso, swelling at lymph node L side neck area. Area was painful to light touch. Pt (self) went to urgent care to be further evaluated by someone else other than patient, once there began to get worse.  All over tingling but significant at fingers, toes and mouth lips. Unable to talk clearly, but never  became confused. So tired unable to stay awake; difficult to rouse. No difficulty with breathing; Epi was not needed or given. Transported to hospital via EMS due to inability to stay awake and difficulty speaking/unable to stand without assistance. It was very hard to talk - to get the words out - but I never did have any decline in mental thought process and was never disorientated. Looked intoxicated however.  At hospital when pt transferred from stretcher to bed, pt doubled over due to abdominal discomfort - it was where the EKG stickers were. All reflexes noted to be hyper - MD kicked on accident when checking reflexes. the EKG stickers felt like being punched or slapped. Needed assistance transferring. All over numbness/tingling noted. Breathing never affected. Symptoms resolved after a few hours.

I also started to develop a painful area of redness distal to the injection site. On 1/10 I continued to have a headache and tiredness. The redness had increased on my left arm to ~6x3 inch area. By the afternoon I had a bumpy red itchy rash on several areas of both arms and my back and stomach. At that point I took Benadryl. The morning of 1/11 the rash had mostly resolved but I still experienced itchiness of the arms, stomach and back. I also had left armpit pain.

Pt. evaluated by their in house medical team who administered a Benadryl injection to the right arm, unknown dosage. The pt. told me the nurse on staff measured her SPO2 at 86% and wanted to call 911 for transport to the ER. Pt. reports she refused and left work to come to the urgent care clinic where I evaluated her. She is concerned that she could be having a panic attack vs. allergic reaction. Her itching arm and metallic taste has resolved but she feels chest pains on the left side of her chest and her left arm feels heavy.

Despite 4 blankets, a heating blanket and two corn bags I could not get warm.  The chills brought on unbearable muscle and joint pain. It was excruciating.  My fever fluctuated from 100 to 102. This lasted 24hrs. I had and continue to have a headache, on and off fever and extreme fatigue.

                                                9th, in the late afternoon, I started feeling really cold and I started getting headache and a lot of arm pain. It hurt to reach out to grab steering wheel. I felt very tired. I checked my temperature - 100.5. I got really cold and shivering at about 6:00 pm and I could not warm up for about 2 hours. It went to 101.5. Horrible pounding headache and dizziness. I started having stomach issues and diarrhea but didn&#39;t vomit. That went through the night - I felt like I had the flu. Back of my  neck was really stiff and achy - from shoulders up to the back of my skull. I didn&#39;t sleep much. I woke up completely soaked in the morning. My fever had broken. SUnday, I felt a little better. Dull headache ( it came and went). My temperature would go up and down -96.8 - to 100.1-ish all day. When my temp went up I got a headache and fatigue and down my headache would be better. Rolling every four hours. Monday, I stayed at 99.2 to about 100.2. Stayed at that the whole day. I was really tired. I had trouble thinking and concentrating. My arm was feeling better by Monday. Monday afternoon, about 1:00 my fever went to 100.5 and I called the nurse then. She told me to call my doctor&#39;s office. They sent me to a call to a triage nurse and she advised me to get tested for COVID. So Tuesday morning,  the 12th,at 9:00 am - healthcare clinic - the results were negative for COVID. Tuesday, I was feeling a little better - fever stayed around 99.2 to just over 100 and the headache was dull. I wasn&#39;t quite as tired. Wednesday, I was feeling better - like I could go to work but I didn&#39;t because of my fever the day before. I went to work on Thursday or Friday. The whole next week then I was better and felt fine. I got the second dose February 1.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to lose my voice. I also had a headache, joint pain and felt fatigue later that evening and it lasted until the 23rd.  On the 23rd I developed a fever of 101. Today I still do not have my voice and the fever has went away. The injection site has a red and swollen patch. I still feel tired and fatigued today.

                                                Following the vaccine I was slightly dizzy, after 25 minutes my chest started to get tight, had difficulty breathing, racing heart rate, some constriction in the throat.  I was taken to the ER, used Proair inhaler on the way to ER to ease breathing,  O2 sat slightly decreased but returned to normal in the ER.  Due to difficulty breathing, I had some increased anxiety which lessened after breathing became easier.  Nebulizer treatment given in the ER.  Benadryl 25mg taken.  Rash on L arm and upper chest, burning and pain in L arm.  Benadryl taken for 2 days due to returning rash and burning in arm.  Nebulizer treatments every 4 hrs on the day of the vaccine due to continued tightness and difficultly breathing.  The following day I had fatigue, slight fever, pain of 7 out of 10 in L arm, headache, neck and muscle pain.  Followed up w/ primary care physician on 12/29/2020, he advised not to take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  L arm pain lessened to 4 out of 10 on 12/30/2020.  L arm pain dissipated on 12/31/2020, but headache, neck pain and fatigue continued through 1/1/2021

Between 1-2 hours after injection, I noticed a little bit of a scratchy throat,  increased thirst, and mild headache. No treatment required.  I took Benadryl and Tylenol when I returned home from my shift at work about 4 hours after the injection. The next day, 1/3/21, scratchy throat had disappeared.  I felt tired, slight fever of 99.5, increased thirst, and very sore arm.   On 1/4/21, I just have slightly sore arm and a little tired with no fever.  I took Tylenol.

                                                About 10 minutes after I received the ?Moderna COVID-19 vaccine EUA?  I felt lightheaded and my heart started  to race.  This only lasted for approximately a minute. I sat and waited for about 30 minutes before I left. When I got into my vehicle I noticed that my chest was really tight and I called my husband to talk to me while I drove home. After arriving home and not feeling like my chest tightness was a normal symptom I called my daughter who is an RN and she checked my vitals which were fine. She told me that I should continue to self monitor and if I got any worse to go to the ER. My symptoms chest tightness did not get any worse and felt a little better by the time I went to bed between 10-11pm. The next morning I woke up to get ready for work and felt a lot of the common symptoms like:  Fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and my arm was sore. The highest fever that I recorded was 102.4.  I still have a fever as I am filling out this form. It is 100.2 and I took 2 Motrin an hour and a half ago.

                                                I had some common symptoms after the 1st shot.  Really run down a little nauseous arm hurt but not swollen for a couple days.  I also had some symptoms that I don?t think are common.  My arm muscle was twitching and my pinkie and ring finger were tingly and cold. All went away after a couple days.  Day 8 discovered a lump on my arm where the injection site was.  Was red, hot and a little itchy fingers tingly again.  Saw doc on day 9.  Gave antibiotics incase of cellulitis/infetion but not sure the cause.  Now that is 90% cleared up.

                                                My initial side effect on Monday 1/11/2021, was slight dizziness after about 5 minutes. I was not impaired, and it faded after about 10 more minutes. The next day, the arm that received the injection was very sore and achy.  It was difficult to get dressed, and the ache was located from my collar bone to my elbow of the injected arm. This ache lasted 3 days.  My range of motion has returned. On Wednesday (48 hours post injection) I began to develop an itchy rash on the insides of my arms in the soft tissue area.  I took two benadryl last night and applied benadry cream to the rash.  This morning, 1/15, the rash has spread down my arms onto the back of my hand, and onto my torso.  It is itchy.  Taking more benadryl, and I called my doctor.

                                                Nine hours after the vaccine was administered I began to have symptoms.  It started with severe chills. I bundled up and went to bed.  I woke at about 2am with severe nausea. Went to the bathroom still suffering from chills, and in severe pain from joints and muscles attempted to use the toilet and passed out.  Revived and climbed back into bed.  The next day 01/16/21 continued to have chills, nausea, and joint and muscle pain.  At 2pm on 01/16/21 started to have a rash in my stomach.  By 8pm the rash was on my stomach, and back.  Sunday 01/17/21 still having mild chills and aches, the rash is now wide spread over my torso and back.

                                                One week post-vaccine injection, sharp pains began on and off on the left side of my face. These moved from cheek to jaw to lip to left eye and at the nasal base. There was also stabbing pain in the left eye.  I thought this was due to just being tired from long days at work, but I was also aware it might have been related to the vaccine. Therefore, I took 1600 mg of acyclovir I had on hand to prevent occasional cold sores and went to sleep. The following day, unfortunately, these sharp pains persisted on and off throughout the day. I retook acyclovir and went to work. I reported this to my PCP, and she thought it was unrelated to the vaccine. I spoke with surgeons in my office, and after examination, they both clearly said it was a reaction in my 5th cranial nerve. They both recommended prednisone or methylprednisolone, but my PCP didn&#39;t agree, and therefore, I did not receive a prescription for prednisone. I retook acyclovir, and by the following afternoon of  Friday, January 15, I was no longer experiencing sharp pains on the left side of my face.

                                                On 1/14/ 2021 @ aprox 6pm, the injection site suddenly began burning sensation and had a raised white ring around a red hot center. It began as the size of Suzanne b Anthony coin.  Over the course of a few hours the white rind turned I to a larger knot/lump the size of a silver dollar. I began feeling feverish and the entire arm ached. The itch was intense so I used topical anti itch cream in an attempt to subdue the sensation. It helped slightly. I also began oral antihistamines and a fever reducer , following protocol as if I had been stung by a bee/wasp and experience a similar reaction.  On 01/15/2021  in the am I decided to report my reaction via the V-safe app that was given in the pamphlet at the time of the drivethru clinic. It allowed me to set up my profile and make an initial report, however after an hour had passed my arm had continued to swell, itch, and become painful to use and I was unable to continue my daily activities. The swelling had a strange bruising appearance aprx 4inch in size  so I tried to report it to the app. At that point the app would not allow me to report and just kept sending sign in codes that would allow anything. Over the course of the next few days the app kept sending codes but would not allow for anymore updated reporting.  I decided to email our health department who had provided the drive thru vaccinations on 1/7/2021 and 1/8/2021. Thats was 1/14/2021. On 1/16/2021 a reply was finally received with only instructions to contact my person primary care physican. I do not have health care. health Department did send a link to this reporting form.  Today 1/20/2021 the redness and swelling have subsided leaving a faint 6inch discoloration under the skin. The shoulder joint and elbow joint ache dully and the bicep muscle spasms at times of use. Physically I feel better at the time of this statement. I did take a couple of pictures at the beginning of the reaction of the affected area/arm.  Others in our area on these same dates gave experienced delayed reactions to different degrees as well.

                                                Fatigue hit within a couple of hours; So tired and this was fall in to bed and be out. I slept for awhile - I rested all day the second day. I was getting dizzy and; muscle pain; a lot of joint pain (normally I&#39;m not in a lot of pain and never this tired). I needed a cane to walk I went to work on Wednesday and I had to leave early (11:30). Wed - horrible diarrhea Started getting a little confused and  still had dizziness and joint pain was bad. Couldn&#39;t take care of patients. Went to work on Thursday and I had to leave earlier yet that day - by 9:00 am - Started having chills  but didn&#39;t have fever and still had other symptoms and was getting confused.   Had an excruciating headaches and nausea (no diarrhea but extreme nausea) and that day started light and sound sensitivity - so bad. Was getting scared driving home - and had very slurred speech. Couldn&#39;t drive for a week after that(. My sister was on the phone with me helping me stay alert and drive safely on the way home from work on that Thursday.) Thursday when I got home. - had Telemed visit - Set up appt for a rapid COVID test - and a flu test so my sister drove me and I slept the whole way there. My sister said my speech was slurred; confused in my speech and I felt like that for three days. Both (Covid and flu) tests came back negative. Times when my sister couldn&#39;t understand what I was saying and I slept more than I was awake (Thursday - Saturday was like this). Took Imodium for diarrhea when I had that. For joint pain - I treated it by tramodal 50 mg and I can take it as needed and I usually don&#39;t need it but took it consistently during this time.  What scared me the most was I could feel my Hip Implant  - ball and socket joint from bone all the way to my femur( I had Right implant on Hip on May 2019) - which is healed completely but I felt it at this time. I still can&#39;t lay on my right side without pain - like a deep bone pain.  I was going to call my surgeon today.  January 4th visit with my Dr - for check-in - He gave me a clearance to go back to work on Wed the 6th. I work two days a week; I&#39;m on disability and so have been able to work since then. Right hip pain is still  a lot and bouts of dizziness and still have joint pain. Have to take a minute and a couple of breaths to stand up. Some days I do have to use may cane. Chills are gone.

She was not verbally responsive and appeared to be apneic with her head shaking in her arms flailing rigidly in an up and down motion.  Symptoms lasted approximately less than 2 minutes and patient was not postictal.  She was not incontinent.  Blood sugar is in the 180s and her rectal temp is normal.

                                                Patient&#39;s received 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine Friday 3/12.  Her husband reported she had not unexpected fatigue,  malaise, and fever for 1 day but better after that.  On Monday she began complaining of shortness of breath.  This progressively worsened and she started having presyncopal episodes.  On Saturday she was unable to come down the stairs in the house so husband planned to take her to the hospital but she stood up and passed out and woke up quickly.  He decided to call EMS.  By the time she presented to our hospital she was cyanotic and agonal breathing.  On moving her from EMS stretcher to ED bed she had PEA cardiac arrest.  She underwent mechanical device CPR with only brief (&lt;1 min) ROSC x1.  She at some point did have a shockable rhythm.  Cath lab was notified and she was taken emergently to the cath lab with ongoing mechanical device CPR.  Peripheral VA ECMO was placed after about 1.5 hours.  Pulmonary angiogram was done which showed massive saddle PE with near complete obliteration of the right pulmonary tree and some filling defects in the left tree as well.  At that time she had severe mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis with a lactate of 24.  She also had no gag or corneal reflex, minimally responsive pupils, and no response to noxious stimuli.  Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted with some result.  She was transferred to the SICU with increasing pressor requirement, and DIC.  Ultimately, the venous catheter of the ECMO circuit malfunctioned thought to be secondary propagating IVC thrombosis.  Family decided to withdraw care and she passed away.

On  3/6/2021 at 11:24 AM I presented  with dizziness, slurred speech, a feeling of my lip dropping to the right, and weakness in left upper extremity.  Called my daughter whom arrived within 10 minutes. After asking me some questions and exercises she  said my strength in the left upper extremity was weak compared to the right.  My daughter took me to ER, at check in I said I think I had a stroke. I was admitted, and neurology was consulted. In the ER they called it a TIA, and after imaging a  diagnosis of stroke was made.    Acute frontoparietal infarct, ASA/plavix, lipitor, PT/OT, Neurologist follow up.    After discharge I have been meeting with PT/OT following exercises. Met with my PCP and continued medications Aspirin 81 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, clopidogrel 75 mg. Still have muscle aches, and pain in the left upper extremity- especially 3rd and 5th digits.

                                                Began with severe back pain on 3/04/21. I went to the ER and they checked heart because pain radiated to front. I went home and pain continued briefly the next day. By 3/6, I began to have numbness in my left leg, so again, I went to ER and they  prescribed oral steroids and recommended MRI to be scheduled in back. My Monday 3/8 I was unable to walk and had no sensation from mid chest down. I could feel Pressure, but had no sense of temperature or sharpness. From that point I was admitted to the hospital. I spent a week on the 6th floor and a week on the inpatient rehab floor. They ruled out demyelinating disease that could cause  the lesion that was found on my cervical spine from c6-T-2. The records indicate demyelinating disease vs post vaccine reaction. All tests for demyelinating diseases came back negative, so it is believed by the doctors that this was definitely caused by the Moderna vaccine. It caused a transverse myelitis reaction, which I am still dealing with. My walking is extremely slow, and the sensation issues persist, along with incontinence.  I have all of my medical records and diagnosis for record.  The hope is this will eventually correct, but for now, I am still in PT/OT twice a week.

                                                Onset of very noticeable arm weakness from the deltoid down, with some mild paresthesia most pronounced in the ulnar nerve distribution.  Symptoms began somewhat suddenly around 11am and lasted an hour or so, then waxed/waned, with another strong flare of it around 8pm also lasting around an hour.   Now 24 hours later, seems mostly resolved, not quite 100%.  Prior to this, there was only mild injection site tenderness, less than other IM vaccines.

                                                Starting 6 hours after the vaccine was given, I had severe pain that lasted for 3  full days and prohibited me from moving my arm.  It felt like my shoulder was broken.  The pain has mostly subsided, but I still do not have full range of motion.  In fact, I cannot take off my own shirt, because I can&#39;t do the movement of pulling and lifting my shirt over my head.  It hurts, but at  the same time feels like a pressure point that limits the movement.  Heat seems to make it feel better for a few minutes, as well as deep tissue massage - but this only lasts for a few minutes.  I feel handicapped.  At this point I DO NOT want the 2nd dose  because it could injure my shoulder more.  And I don&#39;t want it in my other arm for fear of having two arms that I can&#39;t use.

I am feeling much better today, so it was short lived, only about 24  hours, thank goodness. I&#39;m still not 100% back to normal, but I am much better today.

COVID swab -rapid test, negative 27th - still nauseous but ate a little; injection site improved - flat hive rash from injection site down to elbow. took Ibuprofen each day once or twice a day which helped with joint aches.

                                                Received injection at 0930 on 12/29/2020 and was observed for 15 minutes after injection.  Around 1630 I developed a headache so I took a Fioricet as I have a history of migraines.  I had a few body aches and only ate toast for supper that night.  By 2330 my headache seemed to be worsening and I started experiencing a fever of 102, tremendous body aches, nausea, sore throat.  At that time I took 500 mg Tylenol at 2330.  By 2 am on 12/30/2020 my fever had reached 103 and I had difficulty walking as my body joints ached so bad.  My headache was unbearable and I asked my husband to drive me to the ER as I could no longer take the pain.  I also was hyperventilating.  In the ER I was given normal saline 500 cc, Tylenol 1000 mg IV, and Zofran 4 mg IV for the nausea.  I did fill prominently better thereafter, except I continued to have a headache. I was given Toradol 30 mg IV and advised not to take my Celebrex that day.  The ER Doctor did call and speak with ER physician, and discussed the validity of lab testing for Covid after vaccination as well as his recommendations as to whether I should receive the second dose of the vaccine. Since I did not really have anaphylaxis, the doctor recommended that I proceed with the second vaccination with extended observation. I was discharged and instructed to take Tylenol 650 mg orally every 4 hours as needed advised for fever/analgesia.

                                                About 4 hrs after receiving the vaccine I had extreme pain in my right arm, unable to lift it or grasp anything. Today I am 9 days out and I still have pain and very little active range of motion. Cannot lift my arm above my head, behind my back, etc. The nurse gave the injection just below the acromion process and I am wondering if she inadvertently hit the bursa and missed the deltoid muscle.

Left and approx 45 minutes after shot I took a Benadryl which helped the throat.  Numbness in face persisted,  usually associated with migranes but was more pronounced. Resolved after 3 days.

Approximately 3 days before the rash (4 days after vaccination), there was soreness in the armpit of the left arm, almost feeling like swollen lypmh nodes. The soreness went away after taking naproxen.

                                                Received first in a series of 2 injections for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 12/30/2020. Headache, fatigue, joint pain  were noted for approximately after 24-72 hours and again on days 6 and 7 after injection, along with red circular rash at injection site that was about size of a quarter on right upper arm that became  apparent 24 hours after injection. Rash was also hot to the touch, and itchy.  Approximately on day 6 after injection, rash became raised, felt firm and spread in diameter to  approximately 3-3.5 inches, rash was raised and firm off and on for several days.  By day 12 after injection, rash was starting to lighten in color but was continuing to grow in size to approximately 5 inches in diameter, it was no longer raised or firm, but continued to be hot to the touch and itchy, even with daily use of oral Benadryl and Loratadine . Out of concern that it was not going away on its own contacted PCP on day 14 post vaccine and notified of  situation and office visit made on day 15 post vaccine on 1/14/21 for further assessment. PCP prescribed course of antibiotics (Bactrim x 10 days) as could not  determine if it was  truly infection or localized immune response, or combination of both. Was also prescribed  5 day course of steroids (prednisone) to take prior to and after next COVID vaccine injection.

                                                Within 8 hours of shot administration, I was running fever and experiencing chills.  Ran fever (as high as 102.7) for the next 48 hours.  Lethargic, no appetite, muscle and joint aches, severe headache.  The symptoms experienced in the 48 hours after vaccine were vastly more sever than the symptoms I had when I had COVID.  Fever broke during the night on 1.21.21.  Felt much better on 1.22.21, but was still very tired and had headaches.  On 1.25.21, I awoke with a SEVERE headache on the left side of my forehead and temple.  My eye was bothering me.  When I looked in the mirror, my left eyelid was swollen and red.  The left corner of my mouth was drooping.  My doctor diagnosed me with Bell&#39;s Palsy on 1.25.21.  Symptoms are worse today.  She prescribed a steroid dose pack to help with the inflammation of the facial nerve.  Steroids were started today, 1.26.21.

                                                I was vaccinated at 9am on 1/25/2021.  I had no noticeable side effects that day.  At approximately 1:00 a.m. on 1/26/2021 I started waking up a lot and couldn&#39;t get comfortable.  I tossed and turned and body aches began and quickly worsened.  My knees, thigh bones, hips, pelvis, lower back, and shoulders all hurt like I had been beaten with a bat.  I took a sick day from work due to the severity of symptoms.  I had no fever, but did have hot flashes periodically throughout the day.  I was dizzy upon standing, had nasal congestion, and sever fatigue, and developed a moderately bad headache later that day.  I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m. on 1/26/2021 and slept through the night.  Upon waking on 1/27/2021, I felt much better.  I still have some lingering fatigue and stiffness but not enough to interfere with my normal routine.  I was vaccinated in my left arm and today, 1/27/2021 I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit that are quite sore.

At about 28 minutes, voice changed very raspy, chest tightness worse, I could not stop coughing and a very mottled rash on the arm of injection.

I examined the area and found a quarter size rough patch, slightly red. Within 24 hours I had a large(3x3) red, itchy, hot welt in that area. It went away after 2 days, leaving an itchy dry patch on my arm.  2 weeks after the shot, I got a migraine that lasted 3 days and was untouched by tylenol or ibuprofen, along with body aches, nausea, cramps, and diarrhea.

                                                10 hours after receiving vaccination in my right arm I awoke with and experienced severe pain and inability to move arm without severe pain. Upon waking and checking into my arm further, it was noted that Bandaid looked to be placed very high on the arm. Severe pain and decreased range of motion continued for 3 days. Used ice/heat and Aleve.  Right arm continues to ache at 1 week post injection but greatly improved. Presumed injected in error into shoulder joint.

                                                Severe body and muscles aches in both arms, shoulders, arms, back, hips and legs.  Could not lift either arm above head. Skin was extremely sensitive to cold and touch.  Heat and OTC pain reliever helped.  Symptoms had improved within 24 hours but not fully.  Some aches persist.  I tested positive for Covid-19 in October 2020 and although my symptoms were very mild when I had the virus, my long lasting symptoms still persist (numbness and tingling in both arms, taste and smell come and go, fatigue continues, phantom smells of cigarette smoke, etc).  I have also heard that symptoms can be worse for those that have had Covid before the vaccine.

                                                Within 4 hours of receiving the injection I was unable to move my right shoulder.  There  was excrutiating pain.  Upon removing my bandaid it was apparent that the vaccine was injected just below my acromion.  I have a picture of the injection site.  My shoulder continued to ache (there was no aching in the muscles of my arm). I took Advil 600-80 mg tid and Tramadol 50 mg at night.  The pain woke me from sleep.  It was difficult to get dressed and undressed.  After 9 days of pain I finally took Prednisone 30 mg po.  This improved y pain by 30%.  It became clear that this is likely bursitis.

I looked in the mirror and realized the injection site was very hot to the touch, swollen, read and inflamed. I called my dr&#39;s office and they made me an appointment for the next day which was this morning. The dr said he hasn&#39;t heard of any adverse reactions this far after the initial injection.  He said it&#39;s possibly cellulitis and to monitor it- if it gets worse present to the ER /Urgent Care to be seen. He prescribed an antibiotic and said to take it if the symptoms get worse or linger on.

                                                developed redness and pain at the site of injection 24 hours after vaccination.   Symptoms seemed to subside however around Friday the site was painful, red, raised, and warm.  According to individual reactions seems to be cellulitis. Symptoms continued to worsen over the weekend with redness and swelling  traveling from just below the site of injection to just above the elbow. Feels mobility is slightly diminished compared to left arm. will seek medical care from a local urgent care today.

When I saw it this morning,  it was about 2 cm in diameter, raised, hard,  erythematous area on Right upper deltoid. I marked it with ink. When I looked at it this afternoon, the area at the superior area of right deltoid appeared about the same but there was a trail of erythema going down her arm. She stated her elbow was now hurting and it felt like her elbow was swollen. I instructed her to see her PCP immediately as I felt she needed an antibiotic for what appeared to be cellulitis.

The events, body aches, pyrexia, chills, and limb discomfort, were not considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 48 year old female patient with medical history of migraines, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Choking, non-serious unexpected events of Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, Confusional state, Emotional disorder, Pain, and Limb discomfort, and non-serious expected events of Pyrexia and Chills. The events of Choking, Flushing, Vision blurred, Dizziness, and Confusional state occurred immediately after administration of their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025L20A). The event of Emotional disorder occurred on the same day when the patient received mRNA-1273. The events of Pain, Pyrexia, Chills, and Limb discomfort occurred on the next day of mRNA-1273 administration. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                After the vaccine, the left arm was sore, whole body felt fatigue, and slight back ache. Took tylenol 2-times a day for 2 days. After about a week from getting the vaccine, left was itchy at the vaccine site and coin sized red rash developed. At first I did not relate it as a reaction to the vaccine. But as the rash got little bigger I took zyrtec on 1/16/2021 &amp; 1/18/2021 and benadryl on 1/19/2021 &amp; 1/20/2021. Now the redness/ rash seems to have spread. It looks like a red oval outline (no redness in the center), size of the palm, and the site feels slightly warm to touch.

                                                This may be a duplicate report, as primary care notes state the process has been initiated. However, out of an abundance of caution, and as the facility the event was reported to, I wanted to enter this report for completeness due to the unusual events. Patient received 1st dose of moderna covid vaccine at an outside facility and (per patient) had a seizure at that site immediately following the injection (history of seizures due to past meningitis, no seizures in past 3 months per patient). No medications were given, 911 was not called, patient not instructed to go to ED (per patient). Patient went home. Once home, patient reported &#34;stroke like symptoms&#34; on her right side (weakness and inability to close right eye for 30 minutes, numbness in R thigh and heel). Then weakness moved to left side (numbness/tingling in L hand and eye, numbness in L lower leg) along with some swelling to face/tongue. Had back pain but no chest pain or difficulty breathing.  Extreme dizziness. No additional seizures. The next day she called our nursing line to report these symptoms and was instructed to go to the ED and also scheduled a visit with primary care provider the next morning. Patient stated she was feeling better and apparently did not go to the ED, instead choosing to see PCP next morning. On presentation to PCP, injection site was red and swollen, itching and swelling in hands, itching in bottom of feet, widespread joint pain. No visible rash, no dysphagia, no difficulty breathing. Other symptoms had largely resolved. Patient was prescribed benadryl (no steroids due to allergy to prednisone), cold compresses for injection site and sent home with instructions to go to ED if symptoms reappeared. Also recommended making an appointment with a neurologist for additional follow up as patient currently does not see a neurologist for seizures and is treating with CBD/THC only.

                                                About 4 hours after receiving my shot, I could not raise my arm to my waist.  My arm was useless.  I started taking 800mg ibuprofen twice daily starting the evening of the 8th until the afternoon of the 10th.  My arm appeared to be getting better.  By the 12th, I would say I was about 85%, still having pain upon raising my arm and using it in most circumstances - muscle weakness as well.  By the 15th, the full uselessness of my arm returned just like it was 4 hours after vaccine administration.  I again started 800mg ibuprofen twice daily through the weekend of the 17th. Again, there was gradual improvement.  It&#39;s now been 2 weeks since vaccine administration and my arm is still only about 80% functional, and always with some pain or discomfort.  I cannot take off my shirt over my head, for example. I will say the nurse who gave me the vaccination gave it way too high so this is definitely a shoulder injury, but I cannot say as to whether it is from her administration technique or the vaccine itself.  I have never had a reaction like this, ever, and I get vaccines every year.

Ttoday is day 10 - I just took another claritin although it&#39;s feeling much better today and redness and heat are almost gone.

Patient received her COVID-19 vaccination on 12/30/2020 around 1PM. Immediately after the injection in her left shoulder, she began to feel warmth and numbness in her left shoulder, arm, neck, face, and chest. She reports later experiencing nausea, palpitations, and left arm weakness. Her symptoms persisted, and her family noted a left sided facial droop which prompted her ED visit.    In the ED, patient was noted to have some left sided facial droop and left arm and leg weakness. CT head and CTA showed no acute abnormalities. Tele-neurology was consulted who recommended admission to rule out acute stroke.  Ultimately, work up was negative and symptoms resolved.  Symptoms appear to be related to the vaccine.

The cough and spasms are ongoing 24 hours later. I then developed significant pain at the injection site three hours after, which has continued through the 24 hours that has gone by.  At 12 hours post-injection, I began to have myalgia, fatigue, headache and chills.  I used 1000mg of Tylenol at the 16 hour mark, with moderate relief. When the Tylenol wore off, all symptoms returned in full.  I am now 26 hours  post-injection, and still having all symptoms previously mentioned.  At no time, before or after taking Tylenol, did my temperature go above 98.5

Those symptoms went away within 1-1/2 hours of the vaccine. Then on Saturday morning at 2am I developed chills, body and joint ache diffusely. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen at that time and they symptoms were gone by Saturday morning at 9:30am.

                                                moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Tachycardia sudden onset 4 minutes after injection (6:09am). Arms and legs cold and weak. Generalized weakness. BP 167/78, o2 sats 100%. Tachycardia lasted about 10-15minutes and resolved to HR 88 and BP 138/78.  Still left with overall weakness, malaise, cold feeling. No other symptoms.  Released from the facility at 6:48am.  Drove 2 blocks to my husband&#39;s workplace (hospital). Had diarrhea x 2, dull diffuse headache, odd feeling and malaise that persisted. Sudden onset of terrible feeling, the need to get to the ER at 8:36am. Had a bathroom visit to urinate. By the time we got to the ER the intense malaise improved. I sat in the ER lobby not wanting to be admitted to the ER (didn&#39;t want to be having a vaccine reaction). I stayed in the ER lobby. Symptoms completely resolved at 9:45am. I stayed there for 30 more minutes to be sure and then drove home with no other symptoms but Left arm soreness. Tachycardia never returned after the first episode. No rash, no itching, no swelling, no dyspnea. Just felt toxic. Then it resolved completely at hour 4.

By the end of the first day, my left shoulder muscles were painful (pain grade: 2~3 out of 10).  This pain subsided in about 3 days.  Starting from 1/2/2021, a red, warm, and itchy papule is visible around the injection site, measuring up to 4 cm.  Meanwhile, a mildly painful (2-3/10) lymph node could be palpated in my left axilla.  The pain exacerbates upon pressure (4/10).  The swelling and mild pain persist until today.  Only occasional tylenol and topical anti-itch cortisol cream were used.

I took a zofran for the nausea.

                                                Got the injection 1/4/2021 in R deltoid at 1:50pm. Was fine that day, just had a temp of 99.8-99.9 degrees F that evening, but no symptoms. 1/5/2021 just had a sore right arm when raising it above 100 degrees flexion, and tenderness when touched. Everything else was fine. No other symptoms. Suddenly on 1/9/2021 I felt a burning sensation in my right armpit (anterior) and it lasted all day and I feared maybe the shingles was coming back (I had it back in August 2020), and Sunday 1/10/2021 still had the burning sensation in the armpit but it seemed to be getting less intense. Then on Monday 1/11/2021, the burning was gone, but when I went to take a shower, there was a significant lump in my right armpit where the burning was before. It was a bit tender to the touch but a pretty signifigant lump.  Upon inspecting the injection site on my right arm, I noticed that the bruise from the injection was still there, but now there was also a big red oval circle (almost the width of my arm), about an inch under the injection site that was not there before. I have called my doctor and have made an appointment to see him tomorrow morning at 11am.

                                                Immediately after vaccine, there was redness, swelling and soreness to the site.  This resolved within 3 days.  Then, 6 days after vaccination, area became hot, red, swollen, indurated and extremely pruritic, interfering with sleep, mobility and usual routine.  Affected area was approximately 15cm x 10 cm.  These symptoms remained until January 2, 2021.  On January 2, 2021, the redness and swelling dissipated except for the edges, where there remained a red, irregular ring marking the edge of the affected area.  Area continues to be pruritic. All visual abnormalities have resolved.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine I felt severe nausea and dizziness. My body was aching to the point that I was unable to even do the lightest of my daily activities. I had severe muscle aches and pains. I had fevers in the range from 103.7 to 104.5.  The symptoms continued throughout the day. One week later, I still have muscle pains in various areas of my body.

                                                Exactly 1  week after my 1st dose of Covid 19 vaccine (Moderna), my left arm felt so itchy, that night I saw redness and swelling. Next day, I went back to the site in my workplace where I got the vaccine, they said it looks like cellulitis and to go directly to the doctor. Doctor prescribed antibiotics. The redness became bigger even if I am already taking antibiotics although swelling subsided, but it is still itchy.  There is also a throbbing pain near my elbow. My Primary Care Doctor confirmed that it is cellulitis.

A week after injection I had Injection site swelling, redness, and itchiness at the injection site.  Red circle started small and has become larger (approx. 3 inches).  I&#39;ve used  Cortizone 10 creme a couple times throughout the day to help with itchiness.  I have a previously scheduled doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled for 1/18/21 and intend to report and show left arm to Dr.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine, I awoke at 4am to severe pain, swelling, and stiffness at the injection site.  By 7am I was feeling nauseous, lightheaded and my arm was very stiff, itchy and swollen at the injection site.  I took Zyrtec D thinking that this was a delayed allergic response to the vaccine.  By 10am the symptoms were worsening and my lymph nodes in my left underarm and in my neck were swollen.  I called my physician who had me add another dose of Zyrtec and Motrin.  These symptoms worsened over the course of the day including tingling in my left arm and hand, numbness in my arm and hand until approximately 730pm when I was finally able to eat something and keep it down.  I went to bed exhausted, still with stiff upper arm and feeling general malaise.  I awoke this morning (1/20/21) at 6:45am and my arm is still stiff and swollen.  Other symptoms are resolving and I have been able to eat.

                                                After receiving COVID-19 Moderna vaccine dose 1 on 1/28/2021, came down with headache and soreness in left arm the next day. Throughout the night on Saturday, 1/31/2021 began having stiff neck and left side, including arm and leg, became weak with numbness throughout. The numbness was mostly felt in fingers and toes of left side. These symptoms continued and progressively became worse throughout the following week 1/31/2021-2/8/2021. In addition to the left side symptoms worsening, numbness and weakness developed in the right side fingers and toes. On 2/8/2021 numbness and weakness in left side became so bad that left leg was very heavy and dragging when trying to walk.  I was unable to work that day and was told to call Employee Health.  Employee Health directed me to go to the Emergency Room. While at the Emergency Room, I received lab tests, XRay, EKG, CT Scans, and MRI of neck. MRI was evaluated by Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon who diagnosed me with Cord Compression Myelopathy and told me that I needed immediate urgent surgery. ER Doctor, Neuro/Orthopedic Surgeon and Hospitalist all felt that the COVID-19 vaccine could have caused the inflammatory immune response that led to further cord compression.  I had anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery on 2/11/2021. The hope of the ACDF surgery was to stop further progression of the symptoms of numbness and weakness, but was not guaranteed to restore normal function of the left side. I am currently still experiencing numbness and weakness in left side postoperatively.

                                                My left arm was very sore , red and hurting pretty bad. I went to bed around 10:00pm thinking everything was ok and it was a normal reaction. Woke up around 1:30am arm hurting so I got up to get some more tylenol. I immediately felt sick to my stomach (both ways) and I passed out and broke my nose.  I was coherient at times and other times I could not seem to answer any questions. My husband got me to the ER and they took my blood pressure 4 or 5 times and the nurse said &#34;I can&#39;t get a blood pressure&#34;. Another nurse came in and said we will take this one ! My blood pressure had bottomed out and caused all sorts of things going on. I left ER after 4 1/2 hrs. with a BP of 107/57 but I am not sure how low it got! At one point my husband looked at monitor and my bottom number was 39 but it is all a blur to me. As of today I still feel week (heavy arms) and I am concerned about taking my second dose!

                                                Within 6 hours I had overwhelming headache with injection site pain that radiated up to my ear and down to my elbow. I had lymph node pain and swelling. The next 36 hours I felt general malaise with a bad headache which continued to linger throughout the week.  A few days later on Feb 4 at 3am I woke up with extreme chest pain and trouble breathing. I was rushed to the hospital where I had an NSTEMI event resulting in a cardiac cath/thrombectomy  removing a rope-like blood clot in an otherwise healthy heart.

                                                Neurological response/trigger  - severe leg pain and weakness in both legs. Extremely difficult to walk and not able to climb stairs.  Disrupted sleep (woke up in pain throughout the night). This lasted for a couple of weeks, the worst (debilitating) being 48 hours from initial onset.  I also had difficulty breathing and nausea about 15m after injection which lasted for about 24 hours, then subsided.   I contacted my neurologist, Dr., early next morning, and notified her of what happened and she advised that I increase the dosage of gabapentin until symptoms resolved. After 48 hours, I began to walk without experiencing so much pain and weakness, and it slowly subsided over the course of a couple of weeks. I still experience flares of pain in both of my legs periodically.

I had nausea, vomiting, fever of 103.2, had trouble breathing, felt like someone was sitting in the middle of my chest, left side of my body was numb, weakness, migraine headaches, and muscle aches in neck and shoulder.  I went to bed after I took Tylenol and nausea medicine. I woke up at 4 am the next morning and told my husband to get the girls (our daughters) up and that i needed to go to the hospital. When I got there they did a chest x-ray, blood work and gave me a breathing treatment. I was admitted to the hospital. While I was there they gave me IV fluids and medicine for headaches and nausea medicine. I was released about 2:30 in the afternoon on Feb 26th. I still have muscle aches  and head aches. I have noticed my memory is real short, I have trouble remembering things from yesterday.

                                                AT 5pm the same day, felt a little fatigued and slight headache. The next morning 12-30-20 at 730, was so fatigued, couldn&#39;t hardly stand. Felt like when I had mono. Had headache, back and neck aches, fever of 100.2. Felt like glands were swollen. After 4 hours, symptoms began to subside, but still mildly present. Fever subsided and was gone from 11AM on. Injection site pain still present with redness. Skin felt very sensitive on the arms Today, 12-31, felt good, no fever, slightly tired, but good enough to work. Came to work and when in the process of writing this RL, I was reviewing the side effects and looked at my injection site. It looked red so I asked a coworker, who thought it looked like hives. We had our medical director and PA look at it and although they didn&#39;t feel like it looked like hives, I developed hives on my chest, neck and chin while they were in here. Called employee health who recommended either PCP or urgent care. Went to urgent care. During visit, hives began to subside, had 99.6 fever at the beginning of the visit, 98.7 at the end of the visit. Rapid COVID test was negative. Received inhaler for asthma and returned to work at 1245 today.

I called my doctor and they want me to go to urgent care this morning. She told me that 100% of healthcare workers are seeing the same thing 7-10 days after the Moderna vaccination.  My lymph node (armpit where vaccination was administered) is swollen and painful, neck hurts, and have a very low fever.  The vaccination site is swollen, warm, hard and has a red circle below injection site that was the size of a nickel day 1 but now it takes up my entire deltoid region&#34;.

                                                I started to have mild symptoms (malaise, flush feeling and then numb, tingling, weak hands followed by joint pain) in the afternoon of 1/7. The symptoms progressively worsened into what my husband (an immunologist) called an intense hyperimmune response. I had severe COVID symptoms (intensified from my experience having the virus in Sept): fever 100-102, flushed face, intense muscular and some neurologic symptoms--joint arthralgia and myalgia, headache, shivers/rigors, extreme weakness (especially my hands) and later I could barely stand or walk, glandular pain with minor swelling (axillary and neck), nausea, and my hearing was temporarily diminished--nearly lost for a few minutes; tylenol 500 mg taken the night of 1/7. The intense symptoms have subsided. Currently I am tired, weak, achy, and afebrile (last ibuprofen 200 mg taken last night). My hands remain weak.

                                                Patient called the pharmacy to inform us of her side effects. She stated that after the vaccine she had the regular sore arm, muscle aches and pain, swelling and redness at injection site, diarrhea and headache (72 hours). The swelling at injection site didn&#39;t go down until day 6.  On day 7 it came back worse than it started and the patient went into her doctor and they decided it may be a delayed reaction response. At last time of contact patient was going into doctor office again thinking she may need to start antibiotics as it may be cellulitis. The injection site was very far back on the deltoid and MD thinks it may have gone into the soft tissue instead of the muscle.

I took my temperature orally (the only thermometer I had at home), it was 101.9.  I took Tylenol, it helped a little. I was lethargic throughout the day. My head and neck hurt all day and into Sunday, even with Tylenol. I did not sleep well Saturday to Sunday, started coughing, but only when laying down, (maybe allergy related?) so I sat up and slept in a chair. I woke up Sunday without a fever, no Tylenol, but still had achy neck and a slight headache. I did continue to take Tylenol because my neck and head still hurt.  But I was able to move around, a little, if I overdid it, I had to sit.

                                                Approximately 28 hours after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced intense pain and immobility in my left arm.  I had soreness as one would expect after receiving the injection but this was different.  I took ibuprofen and went to bed. I awoke several times in the night after rolling over in bed with pain.  I awoke in the morning and could not move my arm. My husband had to assist me in dressing.   That day (two days following vaccine), I had myalgia, neck pain, mild headache, fatigue, and a low grade fever.   My arm continued to be very painful although no swelling or redness.  The following morning (three days following vaccine), although I still had pain and decreased mobility, it was improved.  I am filing this report on the evening of 1/8/2021. Although I am not back to baseline, I anticipate that I will be in the next few days.  I thought it was important to report this given the severity of my symptoms.

                                                Just mild arm soreness day 2 and 3.  No symptoms through the entire week and weekend after, then Monday afternoon (1/11/21) I noticed a pain developing on the underside of the arm, just around from the injection site (if you drew a line from the top of the arm where the injection was delivered to the underside immediately under site).  As the afternoon progressed in to the evening the pain became even greater.  When I used that arm to steady myself over the sink while brushing my teeth it was definitely greater while my muscle was flexed.  It feels deep inside my arm, almost deep center, and is heading up in to my armpit.

                                                I received the shot at 8:10 am and felt nothing.  As the morning progressed, I developed a sore arm, similar to a flut shot.  However, it was worse, and I also felt achy in my neck.  I drove home from work around noon, and I couldn&#39;t even use my arm on the steering wheel.  These symptoms continued and I finally took Tylenol in the middle of the afternoon, and evening going to bed.  I slept horribly and woke up feeling like a train wreck.  I took my temperature. It was 102!  I started taking the Tylenol again.  I couldn&#39;t even raise my arm, either. My arm didn&#39;t hurt if it was just still, but it would hurt if it was touched, and I could not raise it for 3 days.  Despite taking the Tylenol, I felt awful all day and really had to stay bedridden.  I was also very thirsty both the day of the vaccine and this second day.  Saturday morning I woke up feeling better, but as the day wore on, the aches and fever came back.  Sunday was the same as Saturday.  Monday was similar, but better overall.  Today is Tuesday.   My arm still feels a little weird and I cannot completely raise it. I did have the COVID-19 back in March and have antibodies, as far as I know as I have donated to Red Cross 4 times.

I went to bed with no issues then within a short time I felt an instant burning in my stomach...before I could make it to the bathroom....I began vomiting uncontrollably...this lasted for 3 hours. I had 1 bout of bathroom issues but that was it. I thought I was going to go unconscious because I couldn&#39;t stop to catch a breath. Each time last about 7 minutes. As soon as I went back to bed....I got that feeling and had to rush back to the bathroom again. Today  (24 hours later) my left arm is extremely sore.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving my injection on Thursday, I noticed my upper lip felt like it was swelling.  Over the next 30 minutes, I felt the same in my lower lip and cheeks.  I took 50 mg of Benadryl at that time.  I slept for nearly 20 hours after that.  On Friday, I experienced severe body aches from head to toe.  I felt somewhat better Saturday.  I woke up Sunday with nausea and dizziness that lasted all day and evening.  I woke up feeling better Monday morning but noticed 2 enlarged lymph nodes above my collar bone and pain from my R deltoid, across my shoulder and into my lower neck.  It is Tuesday and and the lymph nodes are painful to touch and I&#39;m experiencing 5/10 pain in my upper arm, shoulder R side and back of neck and above my R scapula.  I am considering calling my PCP.

I was answering the text messages and there was not anywhere to document what was going on because I felt fine.  I stopped getting the texts today so I couldn&#39;t talk with anyone about how swollen my lymph nodes under my arm is. I have not been able to get anyone on the phone to ask what to do.  It is a very strange coincidence that my nodes are swollen for the first time in my life and the only thing that is different is that I received the vaccination.

                                                Muscle pain in neck (only on left side) started about an hour after vaccine.   After a few hours I started having pain on inspirational breathing on left side which progressively got worse over night.    breathing became painful, (only on left side) and on the advice of the on call doctor I went to the emergency room where x-rays, Cat scan and blood work, EKG, BP was done.   They determined it was muscle pain  as all test came back normal.

Kept up and got more pronounced throughout week and started feeling burning sensations in both arms through Feb 15th. Self referred to Neurology on Feb. 16th.  Feb 17th, began to feel worse, spreading to both legs feeling weak, burning sensation, fatigue, and began feeling VERY foggy brained.  Have been sleeping a lot, but legs and arms go from burning sensations, weakness, to cold sensations, and achy right leg thigh muscle, to this moment.  Brain fog and fatigue seem worst in morning.

She felt awful within an hour of vaccination and persisted with symptoms for 2.5 days.  She described it as being out of it, headache, fever, chills, profound body aches, weakness and dizziness with palpitations.  She could not get out of bed for a day.  She literally thought she was going to die given the severity of her weakness.  As quickly as the symptoms occurred, they left her on March 7th, 2021.  She went to work on March 8th and noted similar symptoms to prior ITP flares - petechiae on legs, gum bleeding, fatigue, mild headache.  She also noted dark urine but no frank blood.  Since being admitted and receiving steroids, she is feeling improved and petechiae are lessening.  She also noted mild mouth ulceration to lower lip along with oozing.

Once in the observation area, cg became nauseous and raised her hand to report.  Cg was sitting in one of the back rows so observation RN came to her.  Observation RN was walking cg to lower level when she experienced syncope and fell forward down several steps and to the right hitting the front of her head and right shoulder on the wall.  Cg was unconscious for approximately 30-45 seconds.  Once alert, cg responded appropriately to questions, but slowly.  Vitals were 120/82 P 107 at 0915 and 150/84 P 96 at 0920.  Cg had 2 events of uncontrollable bilateral arm shaking lasting approximately 5-10 seconds.  Rapid Response Code was called and cg taken to ED at 0940.  C-collar and back board was used to transfer cg from floor to stretcher. Unknown at this time if caregiver was admitted.

                                                My first symptoms were expected-- sore arm and slightly tired feeling -- a few days later my shoulder itched where I got the shot. Then a week later, two things-- and one is PMS. Obviously not the shot but I mention this as it is possible that these side effects are related to the PMS. On Sunday 1/3/2021 I was experiencing breast tenderness PMS and that extended under my arms and by the end of that day my glands were swollen and hard in my right armpit. The next morning, they were still hard and swollen and the glands are still today. While I often have breast tenderness, I have never had swollen glands or painful underarms as part of this. Also yesterday 1/4 my right shoulder near where I received the vaccine was i was itchy and it continues to be and red and also hard there... I don&#39;t want to overplay any of these symptoms and they might well relate to PMS but I think in this instance particularly with the very painful swollen glands on the right underarm it&#39;s important to report them

                                                MY UPPER ARM/MUSCLE WHERE I GOT THE SHOT IS EXTREMELY SORE.  IT IS STILL SORE I THOUGHT THE SORENESS WOULD GO AWAY .  I CANT LIFT MY ARM LEVEL TO THE GROUND IT IS SO SORE I CANT HARDLY SLEEP ON IT , WAKES ME UP OUT OF A DEAD SLEEP, WHEN I PUT DEODORANT ON IT HURTS TO LIFT MY ARM TO THAT LEVEL.  IT IS A STRUGGLE TO PUT MY ARM OVER MY HEAD.

Temperature highs ranged from 100.8-101.4, and I felt as badly as when I had COVID-19 in March 2020. I was unable to go to work as scheduled on Friday 1/8 and Saturday 1/9. I am concerned about getting the 2ND DOSE as it has been stated that 2nd dose may create more severe symptoms than the first. PLEASE ADVISE. Also, is there a correlation between having had COVID-19 and having strong &#34;side effects&#34; to the vaccine? Please advise. Thank you!

                                                this is a report of my personal experience I received the 2nd dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine Wednesday January 20th at approximately 4:30pm Cox North. The injection was painful, the person administering the injection inserted the needle VERY slowly, and then pressed the plunger VERY slowly. However, other than injection site pain, I had no symptoms at that time. I then went home and went to bed for the evening at approximately 6:30pm. The following morning, Thursday January 21st, I woke up at 5am (normal time). Before getting up, my stomach felt &#34;funny&#34; mild nausea. When I stood up, I experienced weakness, mild lightheadedness, and nausea; and sat back down IMMEDIATELY. I then stood up to walk to the restroom with the intention to take Tums to settle my stomach. I walked approximately 12 feet, put one tums in my mouth and immediately passed out. (my partner reported that I was unconscious for approximately 2 full minutes). When I regained consciousness I was very disoriented. (did not know where I was, what day it was) I could not stand, and could not use my arms. My partner picked me up and physically put me back in bed. I was unable to roll over on my own. (he then called my supervisor to report the event. My supervisor called him back after speaking with the Nurse who advised &#34;bed rest and hydration&#34;) I slept on and off for the next 5 hours. at which time I attempted to sit up. I was unable to remain upright, but could sit in a recliner at that time. I was unable to hold a bottle of water on my own until approximately 2pm. I had no headache, no fever, no nausea (after the initial 5am experience) but DID experience extreme muscle weakness until approximately 2pm Thursday January 21, 2021. (too weak to chew food) Friday January 22nd, I felt &#34;fine&#34;, but still mild tiredness. ( I was told by our office manager that I should fill out an RL to report my experience)

                                                The first injection I received was from an empty syringe, the healthcare worker told me she didn?t notice it was empty until after she gave it to me and said she would need to inject me again, which she did immediately after noticing the empty syringe. I immediately felt a burning sensation going down my arm but did not have any immediate pain. Approx. 3 1/2 - 4 hrs later, my muscle where I received the injection began feeling very sore. After several days, I used a lidocaine patch on my arm which eased the pain so it was tolerable. However, today is the 11th day of my pain and I have not been able to sleep through the night for the past 3 nights due to excruciating pain that wakes me up and I am unable to raise my arm. The pain and my range of motion for my arm has progressively gotten worse by the day with today being close to unbearable.

                                                It started with a fever of 99.8 (norm is 97.4). I had brain fog. really slow thoughts. I felt like my brain was in slow motion. Big time fatigue. I felt like I was carrying a truck. I also noticed with my MS I am wobbly but I can catch myself but I felt like it was getting much worse. I called my Dr. and she thinks that the vaccine caused a flare-up in my MS. She gave me a prednisone pack. the last dose of prednisone I took, I was still fatigued. I began using a walker because I couldn&#39;t walk safely. I noticed as I tried to get out of my car a few days later I was thrown backwards which caused me to land on my glasses which cut my face and resulted in stitches. I did test but my MS was not in an active flare but they said it could be in a flare because of the COVID vaccine. they couldn&#39;t give me medication because that medication causes heart spasms. I was denied by my insurance to go to rehab. I cant walk and I am currently in the hospital.

                                                Resident had the COVID vaccine 12/30/2020. 12/31/20,  resident has been in bed all shift. Staff became concerned when resident was not easily aroused. Resident displayed signs of tremors, twitching, confusion, in and out of consciousness, low O2 sats, elevated pulse and fever, fatigue and weakness. Writer called NP. NP stated this is most likely a reaction d/t the COVID vaccine. She gave orders for Benadryl 25mg IM x1 now and Tylenol 1000 mg now. NP also stated resident will not be getting the second dose of vaccine. Will continue to monitor and update NP if worsening symptoms.   After receiving Benadryl and Tylenol at 145pm, resident began to appear as though she was feeling better and was talking to talk, fever had gone down. Tonight resident is not easily aroused, lethargic, continues to have tremors and twitches, almost appearing as convulsions. When asked if she knows where she is or what day it is, resident can properly answer. Resident denies SOB but staff has noted loud squeals while breathing. NP was updated and gave new orders to give Benadryl 25 mg IM x1 if needed and Ok to send resident to ED. Resident currently refuses to go to the hospital. Will continue to monitor. BP 152/112, P 116, T 99.1, O2 87-91. Resident&#39;s O2 at 1205am was 80% on 3LPM. Resident unable to be aroused from sleep by writer. NAR called to assist. NAR could not arouse resident. Writer and NAR attempted to reposition resident and resident&#39;s breathing became more labored. Resident turned back to previous position and writer called on call MD at approx. 1220am. MD returned call approx. 1235am with orders to send resident to ED. 911 called and ambulance arrived about 1245am. History of present condition given to EMTs and they stated resident would be going to Hospital. Writer has attempted to contact Hospital ED x3 but have been unable to get through. An EMT did just call to clarify when vaccine was given, what symptoms have been present and when they started. She said she has everything she should need and she will let Hospital ED staff know to call if they need anything else. Writer will again attempt to contact them though.  Resident&#39;s temp was 97.5 and BG 128. When EMTs arrived they got an O2 reading of 60%. Resident did open her eyes a couple times during transfer from bed to stretcher and while stretcher was going outside but no responses from resident were made.

Patient was having no problems breathing, no wheezing, no problem swallowing so we did not administer epinephrine.  We called 911 in case symptoms escalated at 12:55pm.  EMS was present in 5 minutes.  EMS monitored patient but left store at 1:23 because patient did not want to go to emergency room and her symptoms were not worsening.  Patient stated that her husband was home, very close by, and that he was a nurse practitioner and that he was going to monitor her at home.  Patient purchased Benadryl liquid and Claritin tablets.

                                                Low back pain so I went to neuromuscular massage where I go 1-2x a month. My back seized up in so much pain I could not get off the table. I had to stay another hour and still had to crawl off onto the floor before I could drive home.

I notified my direct supervisor how I was feeling. I woke up on Tuesday morning with the sickness and I called off work. I got into contact with my Doctor, on Wednesday and had a tele-appointment. He gave me three medications, and currently it has lasted for six days, and I am going to try and get an appointment with the doctor on Monday 01/11/2021.

Usual &amp; expected solicited SEs: fatigue, soreness, feeling &#34;off,&#34; transient headache, chills sx Day 2- strong R arm pain, cannot lift R arm.  Metallic taste in mouth and tingling tongue persists.  Also same usual Sx as day 1 plus mild nausea.   Felt really crummy.   Day 3- Still moderately strong R arm pain, can only partially lift arm over head, cannot straighten over head.   Strong fatigue continues, mild nausea.   By this day I recall having some unusual Noc . calf cramping.   Sx certainly improved after 72 hrs but some did continue up to 7 days.   Cramping returned as did odd R ear/jaw/throat nerve pain.  Scratchy throat.  Fatigue persisted, gradually improved.  I believe the non-standard SEs may represent an allergic reaction.  I deem this mild to moderate, as I was unable to perform daily functions at times.  I would like to be able to talk to a professional as to whether a second dose is recommended in my situation.  I am concerned to know if previous allergic reactions suggest increase likelihood of future and possibly worsened reactions.  Note: I have been unable to access my Vsafe reports today to confirm exact time frame.  The above is to best of my recollection.

                                                No pain with injection.  Left shoulder pain began around 4 pm the same day, unable to raise left upper extremity against gravity without severe shoulder pain.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol immediately after injection and 600 mg of Advil at 9 pm as well as used Ice to decrease swelling and pain.  The pain increased and I was unable to sleep at all secondary to pain.  The shoulder pain has continued and loss of active shoulder range is apparent.  I am stretching and taking NSAIDS as able for the pain.  I have been unable to sleep well since receiving the vaccine secondary to the pain.   Today is day 7 and I am slowly getting back some active range however I continue to increased shoulder and peri scapular pain that limits my ability at home and at work.

                                                the reaction began about 45 minutes after Moderna vaccine. I began to notice tingling in my hands and feet first. My right foot felt a little stiff when picking it up from the gas to the break while driving home. I noticed shortly after I arrived home itching and tingling all over and more pronounced picking, burning, numbness in my mouth(tongue and chin), hands and feet,  No rash, no shortness of breath. I took a Benadryl hoping just a mild reaction that would clear up. Next morning my feet and hands woke me up from the tingling and cramping. Other symptoms off and on were spasms in my feet and pain in index and middle fingers when touching cold. I called my doctor on Monday morning to get in for an appointment after I was awakened with some cramping in my calves and was more concerned. Was told if it worsened or I had any SOB or weakness in extremities to go to the ER. My reflexes were checked and normal and no weakness in my muscles. No other tests done at that time. The symptoms persist with buzzing feeling in them off and on, feeling of stiffness and stabbing feeling on occasion, no more cramps in calves. It remains mostly ankles to feet but some numbness to below knees. Hands, no further than wrist, along with chin and tongue remain numb and tingling at times.

Had our dr check it out. My dr wanted to see me .Found  It was lymph node that was activated. No treatment. Very sore; whole region around the lymph node really sore and tender to the touch  Had a hard time lifting arm up because it would slide under my clavicle and it really hurt. . Now it is down to the size of a pea. can still feel it  but the pain has subsided. My doctor has seen 12 people so far who has had that reaction.

By day 3, it was gone. I took some ibuprofen to helpthe injection site. Day 9 started feeling unusual ?quarter sized? specific pain sites (left upper thigh, right upper thigh, left wrist). One spot at a time until today day 11 and each spot throbs in sync. Not sure if it?s related but thought since it?s a strange and unusual occurrence it may have something to do with the vaccine.

                                                Around 7:00 pm I started to get sick and my body started to hurt. Joints hurt. Tried to take Tylenol - it didn&#39;t take it away -  maybe slowed it down but then it came back. Thursday morning - I woke up really sick - joints hurt, hot and feverish and I called ambulance. My temp was over 100 degrees. They took me to ER. They took my temp there and it was 101.6. The Dr. requested morphine and I was given that for the pain. They observed me for awhile and sent me home with Tylenol with Codeine (300 mg). The morphine helped and I came home and I went to sleep and the next day my pain was not as bad as it was the day before. I was able to start moving around even though I was still achy. By third day I was feeling better. By fourth day, I was doing a lot better and the pain had gone back down. Felt shortness of breath when I first got symptoms and was using my inhaler. My shortness of breath lasted a little longer - for about a week. Had a Telehealth visit with doctor to refill meds if I needed it.

Muscle and bone aches through my spine and hips, nausea with some vomiting, chills, severe weakness, no recordable fever but felt feverish, skin hurt. Woke up Tuesday drenched in sweat but the bone pain had subsided. Still very weak, nauseous, continued in bed. Woke up today feeling on fire, eyes burning hot, skin no longer hurt but felt hot.  Injection site hurt through Sunday-no redness, no rash or swelling.  I took Tylenol and Advil throughout.  My previous trunk rash completely disappeared. I began taking the prednisone last night. 50mg BID. I have a 5 day supply.  Took a Covid test on Monday-results pending.  Tried to see my doctor today giving them the above information-there were no appts til Friday and I was referred to the ED.  I will not go to the ED where I could actually catch Covid. I was unable to get past phone triage with the doctors office.

I had not felt this since surgery 5 years ago. (Lasted about 15 minutes). 1/13/21 went to work, a little extra tired, went to bed early. Woke up in the night with severe pain in hands, had hard time sleeping. I called off work and slept most of the day 1/14/21. When I woke up 1/15/21 I could not put my full weight on my left leg without pain running from behind my knee up my outer thigh. I called my Dr and took Tylenol and worked a mostly sedentary job.

                                                At around 7 pm on 12/31/20, I started developing chills, neck stiffness, body aches, shivering, surface veins on the injection site became more prominent.  Sometimes the next day,  I noticed rashes developed on both sides of neck,  started near the angle of mandible and travelled down towards the clavicles.

                                                Muscle pain on the arm that radiated to shoulder, neck and head. The pain started in the arm but in half an hour the pain eventually progressed.  I had no fever but I felt feverish and achy. The injection site was so swollen.  It was so hard like I had the muscle of a body builder.  It was so painful too.  The pain  and swelling lasted for 2 days.

                                                Office visit 1/26: The employee is having right-sided back pain radiating down to her knee since 1/19/2021. She relates this pain to a vaccine for Covid which she received on 1/12/2021.  She has a history of right-sided shoulder tendinitis after flu vaccine and so she refuses to get the vaccine in her deltoid muscle and usually gets vaccines in her right gluteal area.  She had the vaccine for Covid on 1/12/2021 in the right hip area a little bit higher than where she normally gets it.  She developed some redness to the injection site which subsided but soon afterwards began having right-sided sacral pain and then right-sided knee pain. The pain is described as a ache and burning.  She does not have numbness and tingling down her leg.  And she does not have any limitation in terms of flexion or extension of her back but she finds that she cannot lie on her back at night because it hurts.  She also has trouble getting out of a chair because of right knee pain. She was seen by the orthopedist,  he has ordered an EMG which came out negative, and ordered to take Naprosyn twice a day. Dx: Lumbosacral radiculopathy at L3. F/U on 1/28: At this time she still having some dull right-sided back pain and pain to her knee but it is tolerable. She has been able to rest over the course of this week as she has not gone to work. She feels at this time that she can manage her pain and is able to start working this weekend on 1/30/2021. We expect that the pain will gradually subside as the effect of the injection subsides as well.

It felt like my right arm was attacked by hammers because it was so sore.The next day (2/19/21) I had muscle soreness, chills, and felt tired and &#34;out of it&#34;. I took an ibuprofen (400 mg)  at 1:30 pm on 1/19/21 and felt immediately better. My arm where I got the injection was still sore and I noticed when I changed my hosptial scrubs my arm was red and swollen at 3 pm  and had a rash. I took a50 mg  benadryl at 5 pm and woke up and my lips were swollen. I could feel the tip of my tongue feel like my lips &#34;like they were going to sleep&#34; and tingly. I went to the ER.

My arm started aching and my muscle felt tight.  When I looked I saw a big red circle around the injection site.  It was warm to the touch and sore.  I looked it up and found out that it was something that some people get.  I have not recovered yet, but expect to in a few days.

                                                Within 6 hours of vaccination, intense pain in the right arm - could not lift it overhead without pain.  This continued - and got worse on Friday morning.  The Friday morning event is what I am reporting.  I got up to shower; put shampoo in my hair and then conditioner. My right arm was hurting so badly that I was having trouble rinsing my hair. Then I felt faint and nauseous. Got out of the shower and fell onto the bed in the bedroom. Woke my husband to tell him that I was feeling badly - faint and the whole room was spinning. Then I felt my airway closing. He went down to get my levalbuterol (rescue inhaler); took one puff and that opened my airways.  I was still weak and he had to help me get dressed.  (BTW- I&#39;m a competitive athlete/ swimmer.)  I held onto him going downstairs.  I was not hungry though did eat a bit.  I spent the day on the couch with the chills and the room spinning until early afternoon.  By Saturday I was starting to feel better.  The pain in my arm mostly subsided by Sunday and I went to swim practice.  It wiped me out for the entire day and I spent the rest of Sunday on the couch. It&#39;s now Monday morning. I am feeling a bit off but better.  I am concerned about getting the second shot.

                                                Approximately 3 hours after shot I became nauseous, intestinal cramps with diarrhea.  Approximately 1 day later began having breathing issues.  Not like an asthma attack.  Just could not catch my breath, coughing trying to get air. I could not speak on the phone or in person without coughing to get air in my lungs.  I started using an inhaler but it was not helping.  I began using a Nebulizer; this helped slightly at first.  On Feb 20th (I got a new box of meds for the nebulizer) since then I have gotten another box of nebulizer meds on March 3rd.  I have used half of this box now.  Also, on March 3rd, my doctor called in for a new inhaler, which started with 200 sprays and as of today I have 15 left.  This has been going on for over a month!  I have been using the nebulizer every morning and at night but still would wake up 4-5 times during the night to use my inhaler.  I have difficulty feeding my horse without almost collapsing from lack of air.

Although lymph node swelling/tenderness was mentioned, I had pain deep in my armpit and lympadema extending from shoulder to wrist. I&#39;ve used a TENS unit crossing the armpit area to stimulate the lymph nodes, massaged and ace wrapped the arm. The swelling has gone down but is not fully back to normal.

                                                On 12/25 after the vaccination I started feeling very fatigued and on the 26th and throughtout the next 3 days I had a low grade temp, body aches were mild that affected my knee joint but just a little, periodic taste loss, loose stool and the color change in the BM for 3 days.  I had a virtual visit on the 28th and got tested and got the results on the 12/29 and was positive for COVID-19.  I went to the ER on 1/3 because I just wasnt feeling well and was advised my bone marrow were throwing off immature white blood cells. And after about 8 or 9 days is when I finally began to get some relief an symptoms began to resolve.

That night I had severe left arm soreness to the point where I needed a narcotic, I had some at home. The pain woke me up. The next day I was more tired and had a stomach ache and more fatigue, left arm sore took Tylenol, fluids and did not call my doctor. Went to bed with a narcotic. Sunday into Monday 1/9 -1/10 I had severe diarrhea and could not eat, sore throat, muscle aches, decreased left arm soreness.  Full relief by Thursday.

                                                Received shot pn January 5, 2021. After a few days with intermittent headaches, I awoke on January 9, 2021 with severe dizziness. I could not ambulate without looking down at the ground. This grew worse over the next few days. I was seen by a Neurologist on January 12, 2021 who based on my neurological exam ordered me an MRI of the brain with gadolinium. Dizziness persisted and I could not work for three days that week . After a two week period,  it became more intermittent in nature.

                                                I got my vaccine at 4:00 p.m. About 10 hours (2:00 a.m.) after the vaccine I started getting aching back pain and bilateral shoulder pain.  About 12 hours after the vaccine I spiked a fever and felt like I was hallucinating.  I was unable to check my temperature until 10:30 a.m. the next morning and it was 102.4.  I had a fever, body aches, and headache the entire following day. My fever broke to 99.0 around 6:00 p.m.  I also had severe pain at the injection site that started several hours after my injection and continued to get worse.  The pain was so bad it was too painful to move my arm.  Today is day two post-vaccine, I have no fever but feel very weak and lethargic.

                                                First three days was just muscle soreness and fatigue.  On day 4 I started having tight chest and SOB while snowshoeing, which I did not have the day before on same activity.  That night I woke up with SOB and tightness in my chest and severe pain in area of my heart.  I could not lay on my left side.  It seemed like I was having heart attack symptoms.  Barley slept but upon waking my heart rate was 94 and the pain remained in LT Axilla area.  Took it easy for day and that night again had trouble sleeping, SOB but not as bad.  Woke up with excrutiating pain radiating up the base of my RT skull.  Was concerned about blood clot potential??  Had SOB when walking up stairs.  My throat hurt when bending over, as if my esophagus was crushing.  Friends said my face looked puffy and I felt bloated.  Landed up reporting to ER at the Hospital on Monday, Feb. 1st as directed by my PCP.  Hospital was told I had just had 2nd dose of vaccine, but did not think it was related.  I will mention all tests below, but upon arriving home on Feb. 2nd, I discovered a rash breaking out on underside of my LT upper arm, LT inner thigh and LT lower leg.

                                                Arm turned red at injection site and hot. There was really no pain and went away within a couple of day but turned red again exactly a week later from injection date. This time it was hard, hot, red, itchy, and bigger. Dr treated it with clindamycin and dose pack of steroids. It got better after a few days. Next, I got a UTI and called my primary care physician. She ordered CIPRO and phenazopyridine. That got better but before CIPRO was finished, I got a crick in my neck that turned into excruciating pain in my neck and was unable to turn head from side to side. At the same time, my left foot became painful, red and swelled. I have been treated for arthritis in that foot 6 years ago with an injection. I have not had any problems with it since the injection.  Dr. treated my neck problem with Robaxin and a steroid dose pack. This seemed to help my foot too temporarily. Neck pain improved but not gone. It was excruciating pain up the back of my scalp at times. I can turn my head some now but it&#39;s not back normal. Can&#39;t turn it all the way.  Dr. did another injection in my foot but did not work this time. I got worse and I can no longer put any weight on that foot. I have not been able to work since January 20. Have had to apply for leave of absence and short-term disability

                                                After both doses of the Moderna vaccine, about 2-3 minutes post-injection, I noticed a metallic taste in my mouth for about 2 seconds.  The taste was there just long enough for me to notice the metallic taste and then it was gone.  I had no other adverse reactions to the vaccine.  I did have the muscle aches and fatigue that been documented as common side effects post-vaccination but those eased after about 36 hours. I searched online for &#34;metallic taste&#34; but was unable to find any information as to whether this is an expected side effect, hence my reporting it now.

Itching around the mouth the next day(Saturday).  Red spots on chin started appearing on (Sunday) the third day. Red painful spots continued to come up on scalp, eyelid, eyebrow, and forehead all on the left side of my head.  Finally went to a Clinic (Saturday 2/20/21)and was diagnosed with Shingles.  Prescribed Valacyclovir Hcl 1 gram tablet.  Was told to contact eye doctor since most of the red areas were around left eye.  Also scheduled with family doctor to get something prescribed for nerve pain.

I then proceeded to run a fever the rest of that day up to 104.4 although I was taking both Tylenol and Motrin alternating. I also had severe muscle aches and pain and very tired. On the next day (Wednesday) my fever did not get above 102 and finally got down to 99.6 about 6pm that evening. The body aches, tiredness and pain continued that day. On Thursday the low grade fever resolved and the body aches, pains and tiredness started to lessen. On Friday I felt like myself with just some minimal tiredness. The cough also continued throughout the post vaccine period and finally resolved on Sunday.

This does not feel like anything like I have ever had before. Multiple muscles in my left neck feel very stiff, almost like a dystonic reaction. This continues so far 1 &amp; 1/2 weeks after vaccination.

I took over the counter medication and nothing seemed to happen.  On Sunday, 01-03-2021, it was so sore that I could not swallow and the neck was sore to the touch. I went to the emergency room and they ran several tests and it was determined that I experienced an allergic reaction to the dose.  They prescribed two (2) medications.  I followed their instructions and did not report to work on 01-03 and Tuesday, 01-05-21.  The throat is still sore but getting better slowly.

Around 10pm, right armpit got super itchy Day 6: Lymph node in right arm pit area super swollen and very painful Day 7: Right arm lymph node still swollen and sore when I woke up, pain and swelling dissapated during the day, however around 11am the injection site area started to itch. When I felt it it had swelled. To say it itched is an understatement. Day 8: Right arm lymph node mildly swollen, no pain. Injection site red in area slightly larger then the area of my palm. Slightly warm and SUPER itchy. Day 9: Injection site still red, although slightly less so, slightly warm , and barely itchy.

                                                On 1/8/21, the day after the vaccination I developed a headache, nausea, fatigue, chills and cognitive impairment.  I quickly started vomiting  which was intense and persistent.  I had no food in my system so vomiting was mostly dry heaves, bile and what ever water I could drink.   Shortly after the vomiting began, I believe I passed out, fell and hit my head on the floor.   I don&#39;t remember falling but my husband said he heard the fall and I developed a large lump/bruise on my forehead.  The persistent vomiting lasted about 4-5 hours and other symptoms gradually improved.  1/11/21 I still have a milder headache, slight nausea and some fatigue.

Left sided arm/leg mobilitylimited. Jaw, head, ear and neck pain radiating up to left arm into head.  Next day after vaxx (Thurs 1/7/2021) woke up thinking it would have resolved and was worse, shaking chills, fever still elevated, face swollen and hot, difficult to stand up straight, heavy limbs and unable to walk normally. This lasted all day, very fatigued almost a change is mental alertness as well. Tried to stay hydrated, took tylenol and motrin alternatively all day, loss of taste and smell, could not focus to read anything all day and into evening of 1/7/2021.  At about 830 pm on 1/7/2021, began to feel slight improvement in balance and cognition. Went to bed early and woke up about 2 or 3 am on 1/8/2021 drenched from fever breaking I suspect. Rash on face after fever broke. Continued with tylenol and motrin and hydration, gradual improvement into early morning of 1/8/2021 and by the afternoon, I was very much improved. However, lingering parastethesias in left jaw, neck, ear and into left arm and fingers, even today 1/11/2020.

                                                I got my vaccine at 3pm, I felt fine the entire afternoon, somewhere around 6 r 7 pm my arm hurt it was sore. It was not red, it was not swollen, it was just sore. I decided to take a bath, and went to bed. Felt tired and my arm was sore but it was mild, around 8 or 9 o&#39;clock.  I went to bed at 8 or 9 o&#39;clock and woke up around 2 or 3 in the morning and arm was very sore, would call it moderate. I took 500 Tylenol and 200 ibuprofen together.  Throughout the night my head hurt and i tried to go back to sleep. at 5 in the morning my head was excruciating, I would it an 8. My arm was very sore, I would give it an 8. My body hurt really bad so i give that an 8. so I&#39;m thinking ok this is what you get when you get a vaccine so I went back to bed. from 5-8 am  tossed and turned. at 8 o&#39;clock i got up and was very wobbly and weak and had chills. I checked my temp and it was 101.5. I went down stairs but had to take one stairs at a time because I was so weak, I went to kitchen because I was so thirsty. I tried to fix some ice water and lemon but it spilled. Went back upstairs because I had so many chills. I called my job at the Clinic but all they had was a voicemail. My face hurts my jaw hurts and my neck on the side where they gave me the shot, my right side. I was trying to put something in my stomach but I could only eat a few sunflower seeds. My body head and arm hurts so bad, moving is excruciating. I felt great all week and yesterday.

I constantly felt like I had to stretch my body out.  Jerking movements for close to two hours.  Husband gave me ibuprofen, which did help.  Nausea close to the end of the second hour,  but never vomited.  No HA.  Started approx. 12:22 am and started to feel better approx 2:00 am.   Did not go to work today as I was tired and sore.  Slept most of day.  Seem better now, 3:30 pm.

Over the next 4 hours the muscle aches worsened and I developed intense chills, headache, nasal congestion, joint pain and fatigue. I had one episode of dizziness associated with standing in the afternoon (approx. 25 hours post dose). My highest oral temperature recorded was 101.8 F. These symptoms continued until approx. 35 hours post vaccine. At that point the fever abated and the next day I felt somewhat better but was still achy, congested and significantly fatigued. On the third day after vaccination I felt much better.

The patient reports undergoing her 1st COVID-19 vaccination recently and did not experience any reaction with this whatsoever. However, she received her 2nd vaccination yesterday and initially felt well, but awoke this morning with the feeling of &#34;an elevated pulse&#34;, along with fatigue, nausea, nagging diffuse headache, left flank/low back pain, and soreness surrounding the vaccination site. No redness or significant swelling around the site. Also notes a brief episode of RLQ abdominal pain described as &#34;cramping&#34; earlier this morning that has since resolved. She has tried taking 500 mg Tylenol at 0800 without relief in her symptoms. No fevers, chills, dysuria, hematuria, chest pain, or shortness of breath. Patient reports being recently diagnosed with thyroid disease and began taking medications for this about two weeks ago. She denies any past medical history otherwise.

                                                I had the normal soreness in my arm, slight nausea the first few days. On Wednesday, February 17 all my joints started to hurt. When I woke up on the 18th I could barely walk. My right knee was swollen, both hands were swollen, I had pain in my neck to the base of my skull.  I called the doctor&#39;s office and told this was normal and to take Tylenol. I spent the weekend barely able to move by the following Thursday, February 25th I went to my doctor, who immediately sent me to the ER. I was admitted to the hospital. My inflammation was high.  I was dehydrated. I spent the night in the hospital. Doctors say there is not enough research to say this vaccine did this but  I know it did. I am still having problems, still can barely walk, pain in the joints of my hands and pain radiating up my neck to the bottom of my skull.

I took Advil,  it was like the worst &#34;flu shot&#34; I ever got. Then the muscle pain started. I went home and took some Advil, tried to walk my dogs and couldn&#39;t. I usually walk 3 miles with them and did not walk even 1/2 mile. Went home and took a hot shower with Epson salt and laid down. My arm started aching. I can&#39;t even wash my hair, the injection site itches and is painful and my scalp was itching too. Overall headache, joint/ muscle pain like flu like symptoms. Wednesday morning before I left work my back started hurting really bad, severe back pain. When I arrived home and used the bathroom I was having abd pain, and diarrhea. It was all fluid. I ate some chili the day before and when I wiped my bottom it was red like bloody. My PCP was closed. It happened about 4 times. It is like I have a kidney pain (the back pain)

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   I had chills, low grade fever of 99.4 initially, fatigue, lightheaded and  felt like I was moving in slow motion.  As the evening progressed, I felt worse and worse, had no appetite, very slight nausea, but no vomiting. During the night, my fever went up.  I only checked it once and it was 100.1, but I was having severe chills, my knee joints were aching, as well as some of my fingers.  The next morning I had a headache, and was dizzy (which may have been from not eating the night before). The symptoms continued throughout the day, but were managed fairly well with Tylenol.  Additionally, my arm was extremely sore.  It hurt to move it in any way.  Even worse arm pain than with a Tetanus shot, which has always caused me a great deal of pain.  Thankfully the symptoms only lasted about 28 hours.

                                                Began feeling extreme fatigue and injection site soreness around 7:00PM on 1/13 and went to bed very early for me at 8:15 PM.  When I awoke at 5:00 AM my head felt foggy, I had chills, and headache.  I took extra strength Tylenol at 6:00 AM with relief of headache, but returned to bed from 9:00 AM to noon due to fatigue, muscle aches and chills.  I have continued to have fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and chills throughout the day (1/14/21). I also developed a fever of 100.6 at 5:00 PM.  Second dose of tylenol has reduced my temp to 99.5, but I continue to feel fatigued with headache.  The current time is 6:15 PM on 1/14.

On the second day after vaccination I felt better with temperature of 100.5 and headache. On the  third day I was back to normal.  Should I take the SECOND dose on 27th of January? Thank you.

                                                The patient received her first Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on 12/29/2020.  However the patient was diagnosed with a positive COVID-19 test on January 4, 2021.  Patient complained of nausea, vomiting, back pain, and sharp chest pain.     On January 13, the patient presented to the emergency department again with shortness of breath and sharp, stabbing left-sided chest pain radiating to her back and right side. Initial work up ruled out cardiac etiologies. CTA chest demonstrated COVID-19 pneumonia.    The patient complained of bilateral lower extremity weakness which had been progressing since her COVID-19 vaccination, per patient report.  However, during her hospitalization the patient&#39;s bilateral lower extremity weakness began to accelerate.  On the 13th, the patient was able to ambulate to and from the bathroom herself.  Then on January 14 the patient required maximum assistance. Neurology was consulted and work up initiated for suspected possible Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) secondary to recent COVID-19 infection.    On January 15, 2021, the patient became obtunded and unable to protect airway.  She was emergently intubated for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to GBS. Neurology started GBS treatment with IVIG. Patient also developed NSTEMI and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Patient remains critically ill requiring mechanical ventilation.

                                                Did okay in the first hour, no issues.   Began to get mild muscle cramps in side of face, jaw, down both sides of neck, upper left shoulder with finger and upper right foot tingling, left wrist tightness, and itching in both armpits, upper inner arms and upper back and irritability while driving home. Went to Urgent Care. All seemed to resolve except itching, muscle pain, irritability. Itching started in legs. Was given shot of Benadryl and oral Prednisone which helped. Woke up with nausea, headache, fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, but no itchiness. No continued irritability. Feel dehydrated now. Have had fluids. Still very dry. Headache is worse. Having some trouble getting enough  fluids  in. Will keep trying and call physician next.

I made a phone call trying relax but mid call  I could not speak due to throat and tongue swelling and then development of a cough trying to clear my throat.  I grabbed my sons epi pen but I was able to still get air so I didn?t use it. My husband transported me to the ER. They took my straight back took my vitals and administered Benadryl, Pepcid and Dexamethasone  IM  and worked well, they observed me for few hours and I was released. I have follow-up appt tomorrow with primary care,

Getting an EMG test today to evaluate the extent of nerve involvement and check for signs of muscle atrophy.

My cheeks were also slightly puffy.  The intensity decreased after about an hour from the onset of the effects (1.5 hours after the vaccine.)  After 24 hours my face still feels tingly and tight, but only slightly compared to  the day of the vaccine.  I also have have waves of feeling nauseous about 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine and it continues after 24 hours after receiving the vaccine.

                                                The next morning, 12/24 and I woke up my head was very heavy and I was dizzy and I had a hard time getting out of the bed, my leg felt like jello, like sea legs, like I was on a boat. That continued all day and I also had chills and did not feel good later in the day. I did not work 12/24 and 12/25 I felt a little better but my legs specially my thighs felt really heavy. Saturday the dizziness continued and then that is when I went to the UC (12/26) to get a covid test (rapid and sent out one both negative). The dizziness improved, I still have a funny heavy feeling on my upper tights. I had a little numbness on my hands on the 12/24 and 12/25but it seems to have resolved.

                                                Severe pain, swelling in arm that kept me awake most of Friday night requiring Motrin x 2 doses and ice to area and still continued into Sunday. I had fever, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, extreme fatigue and slept for hours all day Saturday, Sunday into Monday, which I called off work. I felt as if I had the virus all over again , except this time it felt much worse. I am worried to get the second vaccine as it states it is worse than the first. Would like and appreciate any feedback on this.

I told her she could take Tylenol for the aches. She is going to monitor the other symptoms and if they progress or get worse she will call her primary care doctor. She thinks it is just the start of a cold.

                                                I had underlying body inflammation prior to getting vaccine, but otherwise no illnesses or issues.  Two days after vaccine I came down with a UTI.  Another 3 days after that my body went into an acute inflammatory response.  I had extremely pronounced pinkeye (first time ever) followed by acute gout flare-up (first time ever) followed by extreme edema in lower extremities (first time ever).  I&#39;m being treated with steroids, but these issues have yet to resolve.  I have not been able to work since Jan 4.  I can only stand for a few minutes and walk a short distance with the aid of crutches.  In all of my life, I have never had pinkeye or gout or edema, or a UTI for that matter.  I am a healthcare worker and I&#39;m needed back at my job asap.

                                                Vaccination initially caused only a sore arm day 2.   Very mild no fever, joint pain or muscle aches.  No HA. Day 7  late in the day I developed axillary pain.  By the next morning the site of injection was hard warm, red and raised.  Palpable tender mass which resolved over 4 days.  I am not sure if I should have second vaccination.  This was clearly a delayed reaction to the vaccination.  I have seen others complain of the same reaction.

I felt like I was 100 years old, but on Monday 1/11/21 I was fine. This only lasted 1 day. ALSO, one week later, the injection site got swollen, red and itchy. (this was Saturday 1/16/21). This seems to be better now (meaning today 1/20/21). Other than that, I am fine. I did not need to see a doctor for these side effects.

                                                Two hours post vaccination:  tongue heaviness followed by metallic taste sensation, vomited once after this.  Four hours post vaccination:  nausea, bilateral forearm pain evolving to all over body aches and muscle cramping along with a pulsating headache.  Spiked a fever of 102 F that I treated with 500 mg of Tylenol.  Later took ibuprofen for body aches.  Had frequent urination along with unexplained crying.  The lowest the fever would measure for the next 24 hours was 100 F.  I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen as directed on a regular basis.  On Thursday 1/21/2021 at 5:55 pm, I woke up drenched in sweat.  I felt weak yet improved.  Headache and back pain were less.  Showered and moved to the couch in living room attempting to watch TV.  Could not stay awake.  Woke up three hours later again drenched in sweat.  Showered and went to bed.  Slept through the night and woke up at 8 am with body aches, muscle cramping and nausea gone.  Night gown and sheets were damp with sweat. Lingering symptoms:  Skin from lips and inside my mouth appears to be sloughing off.  There are very tiny cuts on my bottom lip.  Left with mild headache I attribute to dehydration.  No longer nauseous although I have no appetite.

                                                5 minutes after the vaccine, I did have some tongue swelling, back 1/3 of tongue, however did not increase in amount, stayed the same until early evening. I did pre-medicate with Benadryl and Ibuprofen. After returning home added Benadryl and then Benadryl at bedtime. I also had slight leg cramps for approximately 2 hours post injection that lasted about an hour. No further tongue swelling at bedtime, back to normal.

                                                ? Pt reports severe muscle pain and aches, predominantly lower half of body.  Used both OTC APAP and IBU, with minimal benefit.  Tried a Salonpas patch applied locally to where there was pain, with a little improvement.  Pt admits high pain tolerance, but muscle pain/ache was bothersome throughout day and night.  Started night of vaccine administration.  Not localized pain.  Pt denies fever, SOB, rash.  Possibly a little bit of nausea but could be secondary to increased APAP and IBU intake.  Seems to be decreasing but still painful, as of 2 days post vaccine.  Pt advised to monitor 1 more day.  Pt counseled to continue with OTC.  Call MD if worsens today 1/29/2021, call before end of business day.  Pharmacist to check in with pt on weekend to see if improving (i.e. decreasing pain level).

                                                Patient felt unwell and had a fever on Wednesday (1/27) and went home early from work. On Thursday morning (1/28), she threw up once and then laid down to rest. Her son reported seeing her that morning with the episode of emesis prior to her getting on the couch. Son reports that when he came home at 5pm, she was asleep on the couch. Teenage daughter reports patient had been asleep on couch all day. Son tried to wake patient up and she was disoriented and lethargic.  Daughter (reporter) was contacted to come see patient and on arrival to house (5;45pm), noted patient was confused, lethargic, febrile (104), and hypoxic at 83% on room air with portable pulse oximeter. Patient was able to stand and ambulate to car with assistance and was driven to Emergency Department for evaluation.   At emergency department, patient was hypotensive 80/40s but was able to increase blood pressure with 3 L of normal saline to blood pressure of 90/50s. See all tests performed and results below.  Patient received antibiotics, anti-virals and tylenol for fever of 102.7 while in emergency department. She was admitted to ICU that evening at approximately 11pm and had a foley catheter placed overnight due to decreased urine output. patient continued to have low blood pressure through morning of 1/28 and was placed on levophed for blood pressure control at approx 10 am. Her blood pressures continued to improve through afternoon and levophed was titrated down and then discontinued around 4pm.  She continued to received antibiotics for 24 hours after initiation and continued acyclovir during course of hospitalization and is still receiving doses on 2/2. Patient&#39;s initial mental status was confused, lethargic, and unable to communicate. She was intermittently oriented to herself only and would not follow commands. She would localize painful stimuli. Her mental status began to improve on Saturday when she started to become more awake but was still unable to follow commands or communicate clearly. She was moved from ICU to IMCU (step down unit) on Saturday once mental status was improving and blood pressure was stabilized. Her mental status continued to improve from Saturday 1/ 30 to Tuesday 2/2 (current). She began to have diarrhea on Saturday afternoon that continued through Monday and occurred every 1-2 hours. She was unable to stand or move body on her own and had to be assisted by staff to be cleaned. She remained awake and alert and was able to get up and walk on Monday and began to eat. She continued acyclovir treatment pending HSV meningitis panel PCR results (still pending currently 2/2). Mental status not currently at baseline but continuing to improve. She is also still experiencing generalized weakness. Hospitalist team and infectious disease doctors report she should be discharged tomorrow (2/3).  No source for confusion and hypotension has been found at this time. Physician team think HSV is unlikely but awaiting final diagnosis until test is resulted.

I took Tylenol every 6 hours. It helped my symptoms about an hour after taking the Tylenol then about 5 hours later the symptoms came back. The next day, I felt about 50% better and this evening I&#39;m about 90% better.

Required ibuprofen every 4hours for 30hours and sporadically thereafter to manage symptoms. I was ready to call 911, but was able to reach friends as a safety check through the night and the next couple days. Very difficult to manage this living alone.

I called out sick and had to use a vacation day because still had headache, fogginess, and temp of 98.8.  At 3pm I started to have a lower back ache that went in to my mid back.  I was tired.  Then on Tuesday, 01/12/2021 I started with diarrhea at 11AM.  I called work and explained that it was a side effect of the Covid vaccine.  They still would not let me go to work even though I was covid negative.  I took 2 Imodium tablets. I will email you tomorrow, 1/13/2021 and continue to monitor.  Yes I am a RN.

Within that same period I started having a lot of muscle pain in my arm, shoulder and neck that I attributed to exercise. Yesterday, the area around the injection site began itching, became swollen and a light rash developed. Today, the itching has gone away, but the injection site is still swollen and and I have muscular pain at the injection site, and on the upper part of my back and the lower part of my neck on my right side.  My husband is a physician so he has examined the site and is monitoring it.

                                                1st dose December 23, 2020.  Arm pain, swelling, raised red 3 inch bump developed within 12 hours.  Subsided, and reoccurred about 10 days post vaccine.  10-14 days post vaccine I developed New onset forefoot weakness (foot drop) Right, new onset trigger finger Right middle finger, new onset bladder spasms with immediacy and incontinence - not bladder volume dependent, resurgence of body aches, new bilateral knee pain requiring two arm support for sit to stand,  Mental status changes including anxiety, paranoia, mania and depression (personality change!), motion induced nausea and dizziness, visual changes (blurry vision), New intensification of nocturnal muscles spasms - bilateral and progressive and intermittent headache up the Right neck to crown, New onset (01/14/21 - present) burning rubber scent when some food being cooked.  The muscle and joint pain were present with February illness, subsided by April, and came back with a vengeance within two weeks of the 1st injection.  I also lost three teeth (fracture vertically while flossing), thinned hair, and had intermittent dizziness during the initial illness in February.   February Initial loss of taste/smell included metallic taste with artificial flavors, rotten garbage - random, and ?iron taste with meats.  I can now taste some fruits but only get bitterness with other fruits and vegetables.  I had one sided facial paralysis after tooth extractions in September - resolved in 1 week.  I required dental implants to replace the fractured teeth.  I am a vaccinator, and have been administering our vaccines and swabbing for Covid testing since we reopened elective procedures.  I strongly encourage our staff to get the vaccines - and I am the one who gets the reaction.  The constellation of symptoms, temporal proximity to the vaccine with no intervening illness or injury, and commonality of some symptoms with my February illness have prompted further testing and evaluation for central nervous system insult.

I was asked to report this by health dept due to this being an atypical response.  I have never reacted to a vaccine before.

                                                Side effects started the same day I received the vaccine, which were reported on the V-safe app.  Started with very sore arm, within 24 hours progressed to extreme fatigue, joint and body aches, loss of taste and headache. I also experienced some mild nausea. By Wednesday evening, I began to experience heart palpations which I listened to as a nurse which sounded like PVC&#39;s. I have never had this happen to me before. I assessed my vital signs and noted that as the arrhythmia progressed, my O2 sat level began to decrease and my pulse began to increase. I could hear a definite pause in my heart rhythm. Within an hour, I had chest pain in the area of my left chest over my heart which progressed into a feeling of pressure as if someone was standing with a foot on my chest. As time went on, this sensation radiated into my back at an angle from left to right. It was at this point that I had my father take me to the emergency room. When I got there, my pulse was in the low 100&#39;s and my blood pressure was 230/130. I have never had this happen to me before. I ended up on a nitroglycerin drip. My magnesium level was low and my sodium level was low normal.   I was kept in the emergency room until Thursday evening then transferred to Progressive Care Unit where I remained until early evening on Friday.I was sent home on 2 different cardiac medications, Coreg and Lisinopril. I am to follow up with my PCP and a cardiologist. Both are brand new to me. I am now feeling better, but I am very reluctant to have the second covid vaccine. Also, the Hospital does not know what happened to me. (Facility where I received my Covid vaccine.)

Vaccination on 2/12/2021 and diarrhea and constipation began 2/15/2021 and lasted until 2/21/2021 3. A lump where I received the vaccination from 2/12/2021 until 2/20/2021 4. Warmth around the injection site (4 cm in diameter) from 2/12/2021 until 2/20/2021 5.  Extreme muscle spasms as a side effect of my vaccination 2/12/2021.  They came on Monday 2/15/2021) but subsided Tuesday. Pain came back Wednesday and then Thursday I had to go home early and take 4 hours sick time.  I then took 4 hours sick time on Friday in order to see the Nurse Practitioner. NP diagnosed as muscle spasms and prescribed Tizanidine 3 x day.  I took two doses of Tizanidine (4mgs) on 2/19/2021 4pm and midnight and one dose 2/20/21 and muscle spasms are now resolved.   The pain on Monday was on left and right flank (lumbar) but migrated to thoracic level by afternoon.  On Tuesday it was not there. On Wednesday it was on left and right flank all day.  On Thursday it was worse. The pain was an 8 on a scale of 0-10 with 10 being equivalent to labor pain. (Natural labor x 2, each 8 hours in 1994 and 2000). The pain 2/19/2021 was so severe that I left work in order to go home and made an appt with the medical provider for the next day.  I saw the NP on Friday 2/19/2021 at 10.30am.   Pain was worse when seated. Pain was extremely bad when driving. Pain lessened if I could press the area with my hand. Possible confounder is that I pushed a boat with arms outstretched on a trailer over uneven ground with my spouse on 2/13/2021 about 3 feet to its resting place. However, I was on the boat in particularly frigid weather outdoors for two hours prior to pushing the boat to its resting place.

                                                A few hours after receiving the vaccine, I had the muscle pain in my left upper arm, as expected. This time it felt a bit different and by the evening, I had my daughter check the site because it felt to me as if I had a hard metal plate protecting my arm. Everything looked good. The next day the pain continued, but it was a bit duller. That evening, however, I woke up with intense shoulder pain. I was confused why I was in so much pain. I was on my back and there was nothing obstructing my shoulder. When I got up the morning of 3/13, I was in intense pain and had limited mobility of my left arm. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen, but that didn&#39;t help. I went in to see the doctor and she prescribed naproxen and has referred me to physical therapy. In the meantime, I continue to be in severe pain and my left arm (dominant arm :() is extremely limited.

                                                The day after my 2nd vaccine, I was in excruciating pain in my right arm, hand and fingers.   It felt like someone had driven a nail into my hand (and I&#39;m not a Christian).   As of today, my hand and fingers are almost completly numb and my fingers tingle all the time.   I was given a sterioid treatment, prescriptions for Gabapentin, Tizanidine, and Hydrocodone after days of being in bed with debilitating pain.   I am no longer on the steriod, and can function without the Hydrocodone.   However, I continue to take the Gabapentin and Tizanidine because I have a completely numb right hand with painfully tingling fingers.   Every day is a challenge for me to function because I often feel stinging pain at the injections site along with shoulder pain, in addition to the pain in my hand and fingers.

                                                Monday evening - Extreme pain in the arm where the injection was given. Swollen (like a baseball) and very red. I realize it would be sore; however, the pain radiated down the arm to the hand and upwards into my neck. A fever of 100 so I took tylenol.  Headache throughout the night and by morning my whole body hurt to the point I could not get out of bed.  Tuesday - I got up to go to the bathroom with help and lost consciousness. When checked at that time, I had a fever of 102, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms took place all day. I continued taking Tylenol for the pain. Not much sleep due to pain.  Wednesday - Some of the pain in the arm subsided; however, the spine pain was extreme. I struggled walking the pain severe. Throughout the day I was feeling a little better. Thursday - still body pain but tolerable.

Could barely move without extreme pain for days. 2 weeks later, still soreness in the area and cannot walk more than 10 minutes or so without feeling discomfort. My orthopedic surgeon put me on a 6 day steroid treatment,  and started me on Meloxicam on the 4th day of that treatment and I am still taking it. Both my internist and an infectious disease doctor that she referred me to both feel it was from the vaccine as it is know to inflame the joints. I would like to talk to someone before taking the second of possible.

                                                On 1/22/21 at 6:30 pm both arms from shoulder to hands felt numb, mostly in the back of the arms.   I tried to pick up a spoon  with my right hand and my fingers would not wrap around the spoon or anything.   I could touch my thumb to pointer finger but other fingers turned inward like a cramp but did not hurt.  Could not feel my right hand.  This lasted about 1 1/2 minutes.  My arms were tingling for about 25-30 minutes.  Called my heart doctor and he told me to get to hospital.  When I arrived at about 7:05 pm I told them I had a COVID vaccine 2 days prior.  They preformed and EKG, a CT scan and a chest x-ray, did blood work, took a urine sample and everything came back normal.  They said it was probably a side effect of the COVID vaccine, sent me home and told me to take 2 Benadryl when I got home.  Also to take Ibuprofen for pain if I had any.  My hands, especially my right still feels a little tingle at 10:28 am on 1/22/2021.

It seems that I had a ?flare? or worsening in condition following the injection.  Arm hurt where vaccine given is also but that happens with most all vaccines.  That was not the reason I am writing this up.  Writing it up to the the inflamed state I was in.

                                                After receiving the injection I experienced slight soreness at the injection site, which was expected.  later that evening I experienced swelling in the left axilla lymph nodes. The swelling in that area was extreme on 01/20/2021 throughout the night and has continued until day of reporting on 01/27/2021. The pain and swelling involved the entire underarm and pain could be felt deep in the tissue. On pain scale of 1-10 with 10 as extreme, I would rate pain as a 9 on days 1-5. Pain has gradually diminished in severity on subsequent days and is a 2 today. Measures to reduce the pain included elevation of arm and shoulder during the night, discontinuation of deodorant during period of discomfort and application of warm and cold compresses to decrease pain and swelling.  Initially contemplated seeking emergency room evaluation and treatment for evaluation , but decided against because there is no way to remove the vaccine and treatment would probably include measures already implemented.

But the next morning it doubled in size. Consulted with my employee health who suggested me being seeing at the UC or doing TELADOC they were fear it could be cellulitis. The Teladoc MD prescribed me antibiotics (doxycycline), steroid (prednisone), naproxen and Benadryl and called it cellulitis. My arm pit pain went away by my second dose of prednisone. The itching stopped also with the prednisone. I took the doxycycline for 3 days only instead of a week as prescribed. Also took the prednisone only for 2 days once the itching and the arm pain went away I stopped. All symptoms were resolved by 4 days.

                                                The first dose was given on 12/30/20 with site soreness and slight redness.  Redness was gone in about three days and the soreness was gone after two weeks. The second dose was given 1/27/21. About 12 hours after given the 2nd vaccine, I woke up from a sleep with chills, temp of 99.2, muscle and joint aches, breast tenderness, site soreness, slight redness.  These symptoms were expected and my temperature was normal after taking a shower and drinking some water.  The chills persisted and I checked my temp a few times to make sure I didn&#39;t have a temperature.

For the dizziness I had a banana and potato chips to stabilize the sugar in the blood and took about and hour nap.  Co-workers and Supervisor monitor me in case EMS needed to be call. For the pain in general I took 1 capsule Tylenol 500.  Nothing for the nausea and plenty of water to reduce swelling.
