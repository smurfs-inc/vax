Unable to lift arm above shoulder without significant pain at about 12 hours post injection. About 13-14 hours post vaccine, began having myalgias, chills. Took ibuprofen with some improvement of symptoms, but unable to sleep due to the combination of arm pain, chills and aches. Body aches and chills were gone by the morning but the arm pain lingered, less than the night before and improving each day, still there today, but much more tolerable.

Cannot tie any of these symptoms to other causes. Back pain and hand numbness still present at 5 PM 1/10/2021.

                                                At the time of vaccination, a burning sensation was felt immediately upon injection. The person who injected the vaccine proceeded to flick the plastic tubing of the syringe while it was still in my arm, escalating the burning sensation. I let the tech know about the burning and he claimed it could be a side effect of the medication and that I would be fine. I did not suffer any medication related side effects. Left arm stiffness began about two hours after vaccination and after nearly 3 hours, I was completely unable to move my arm. Loss of shoulder posture, complete arm/hand weakness and extreme arm soreness were reported for nearly 5 days. Numbness from the injection site down to the elbow is intermittent currently. Tingling down from the shoulder joint to the fingers is constant when arm is laterally raised or when overused. The left arm is still having trouble externally/internally rotating/raising above my head, and while lifting heavy objects. I&#39;m in the process of starting physical therapy/occupational therapy to regain normal strength and functioning without the tingling or pain. An audible clicking noise is noted that was not there previously to the injection. I am unable to exercise normally and have been functioning at a decreased work and paperwork pace at my job as a nuclear stress technician. I have also been losing days of time at work due to various doctor&#39;s appointments and diagnostic tests needed to identify the problem.

                                                45 min after vaccination I got the chills. Throughout the night (within a few hours of vaccine) I had chills and extreme soreness to arm. Next morning I woke up with chills, terrible headache/migraine, high fever up to 103.3, cough, aches, neck and back pain, nausea, and vomited one time. No Tylenol or Motrin would break my fever all day long.

Nurse administering vaccine noted injection was &#34;difficult to push.&#34; Five hours post vaccine began to feel severe pain in left arm. Pain worsened overnight. 36 hours later unable to use arm due to pain and numbness noted in fingertips of left hand.  Went to emergency room, both nurse and doctor assessed area and could see injection site and noted it was inappropriate - not into the deltoid rather into my shoulder joint. Discharged with pain medication. This AM (1/14) left shoulder pain still significant.

                                                Had a mild headache at time of vaccine, unknowingly had a mild fever at the time, so did not take temperature. Went home to take a nap. Woke up two hours later with fever, stronger headache, chills, and muscle ache. Four hours later, the chills decreased, but the headache, fever, and muscle ache still persisted. 14 hours later (the next day), no chills, no headache, face still feels warm, but no fever. Muscle ache only in the location of the injection site.

                                                On Dec 28 - three hours after vaccine - started getting pain near injection site. It ached. 8:30PM that night I started getting itching from the midback to top of head on left side. Not left arm just the back, neck and face of left side. No rashes but a little red because I scratched. Then I noticed some bumps on my left side of my face and one hive on each knee and one hive on left shoulder. Telemed visit with dr. - took Benadryl - 25 mg. - within one hour of symptoms - at 9:00 pm per dr. Woke up next morning and had intense fatigue; muscles and back were really achy. Couldn&#39;t move my muscles very well. Felt like the wind had been knocked out of me. Bouts of itchiness. Slept throughout the day. That helped. But then had headache start - felt like a circle where my temples are to the back of my head and that is where is stayed. Next day - no fever and  but my symptoms improved except still had the symptoms but they had improved. Went to work on Wednesday because it started to go away - on and off headache - felt foggy. Bouts of itchiness and felt physically weak because my muscles had gotten so so tight. Felt a physical weakness for five more days. Headache went away by Wednesday night (Dec 30th). Itchiness went away. Three days symptoms went away although the physical weakness lingered until 5th  day. Used a heating pad for my muscles to help relax them.

About 20mins later I went to stand and when I lifted my legs they began to shake and felt weak. This weakness slowly got better over the next 4-5 hours. 2 days later I was working and I had the muscle weakness again. Today 01/19/2021 I had another episode of weakness, it is primarily in my legs and they shake if I attempt to lift them.

                                                Saturday- felt fine for a Couple of hours after vaccine. Felt fatigued around 4 PM, laid down, lost ability to move arm, extreme pain in neck.  Sunday- more of the same throughout the day. At night when I took a shower the pain moved over the course of a few minutes in the shower from my arm to my lower back. Arm was fine, Lower back pain bad enough that I was limping.  Monday- woke up &amp; pain was evenly dispersed between lower back and head. Slight soreness in arm and neck. Took extra strength ibuprofen because I had to work. Totally fine for the rest of the day time. At night my arm and neck started to become very sore again. After I ate dinner I developed a very intense fever, chills/ shakes, my arm felt like it had a heartbeat and my heart was racing. Laid in bed all night. Felt scared and disturbed that this was happening days after the vaccine. Considered going to the hospital but I couldn?t move. Slept for 10 hours.  Tuesday (today)- feeling almost all better aside from slight pain in neck.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received my first dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 15th. My arm was a little sore that day and the next, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad. Late on Saturday, January 16th I noticed a rash around my neckline/collar bone area that was on both sides, but more prominent on the right. The rash was red with many bumps that were not raised and were not fluid filled or blistering. The next day, Sunday (17th) the rash seemed to worsen but stay localized to that area. Monday morning (18th) I woke up with a tender right armpit indicating to me that I have a swollen lymph node. I noticed later that morning that the rash had spread bilaterally to my biceps and chest. Today is Wednesday the 20th, and while the rash looks slightly better around my neckline, the rash has now spread all over my breasts, abdomen, and a little bit to my hips. The right arm pit continues to be tender today.  I took Benadryl (25 mg) Sunday night (17th) and applied hydrocortisone cream to the rash when it was just along my neckline.

I got a massage, used a heating pad, used an at home massage device, and Tylenol and ibuprofen.

Next morning fever spiked to 102.7 and stuck on until 48 hours later. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea kept staying for about a week.

Prevented myself from itchy any further in case it worsens. Today my wrist on my left arm started to feel itchy.  Been keeping myself hydrated and would feel more muscle pain from time to time. The moment I felt relaxed is when I feel body aches. It is tolerable but this is only day 2 and will be getting my 2nd dose in March.

                                                1/25: I began to develop sudden intense arthralgia in bilateral hands. No history of carpal tunnel in past. Pain more prominent in Right hand. Pain extends from wrist to metacarpals of bilateral hands; pain does not extend to joints in phalanges. Arthralgia is still present today, right has subsided slightly and L hand has increased slightly. Pain over the last two weeks has been significant enough that I cannot type or hold a phone with my R hand. Treated with ibuprofen with no relief.   2/1: Working in COVID ICU for first time since vaccine. At 1700, intense headache developed and hot flashes. That evening, I felt body aches, fever (unable to take temp at home, probably low grade), swollen tonsils, slight nausea, headache, joint pain, and continued arthralgia. Symptoms present on 2/2 but less intense. 2/3 persistent headache, body aches at times, joint aches at times, continued arthralgia. Today 2/4 slight body aches at times, continued arthralgia, though it is starting to subside in R hand.

                                                About 12 hours post vaccination: stomach cramps and diarrhea, then about 18 hours post vaccination: muscle aches, chills, fever (up to 101.8 at one point), swollen lymph nodes. Now, almost 48 hours later: the muscle aches still remain, and the swollen lymph nodes have gotten worse. There is large, discolored swollen area under my left arm (the arm I got the vaccine in) and it is very very sore. I can?t put my arm all the way down because it is so swollen under there

                                                About 2.5 hours after the initial injection (like 1:30pm), my arm (around the injection site) started to feel sore like after getting a flu shot. It was manageable but noticeable. Around 10:30pm I began to run a fever. When I took my initial temperature (around 11:00pm) it was 100.5. A half hour later I threw up and took my temperature again and it was up to 102.3. I took Children&#39;s Chewable motrin (the only thing we had in the house and I don&#39;t like taking pills anyway) and went to sleep.  I woke up without a fever, temperature this morning was 98.8. The arm soreness continued into the next day and the soreness spread into my right armpit. The injection site is still extremely sensitive (even to put lotion on) at this time on 2/7/21 @9:30pm. Some chills continued throughout the day but nothing a blanket or a warm shower couldn&#39;t fix.

Body aches, headache, night sweats, and tiredness started the morning after vaccine administration and extended for 24&#43;hrs. Breathing painful at times due to severe muscle aches around the ribs. General life activities severely impacted.

                                                After the second dose, the next morning I had a low grade fever and slight headache. But extreme pain in my bones. It felt like they were all about to break. As well as extreme pain at he injection site. Symptoms lasted roughly 12 hours. Now 6 days after the vaccine, I am still having whiplash like neck pain.

                                                Got the vaccine on Feb 17, 2021 at 9am. On Feb 18 at around 8:30-9 pm, left cheek started feeling uncomfortable and a bit swollen. The next morning, swelling was extreme and extremely painful to touch. It was difficult to eat from left side and to laugh and talk. Also, had chills and felt weak.  I scheduled an online appointment with Dr.  he mentioned the condition is called acute pericoronitis and he suggested that vaccine might have increased the immune response to any infection that might have happened underneath the left wisdom teeth which hasn&#39;t come out yet. [Note: Same response had happened when I got my MMR vaccine on Feb. 1, 2021]. He prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg for a week.  As of Feb 22. 11 pm, after taking Amoxicillin and ibuprofen, the swelling has bit reduced but the pain persists.

At 2:00 pm, I tried to sit up in my bed - I proceeded to throw up and faint. I contacted doctor to see if I should take anything. I took an ibuprofen and drank fluid - but didn&#39;t drink as much as normal because of nausea. I was nauseated all day. It stayed about 102 until about 8:00 pm. At about 10:00 pm that night, I started feeling a bit better. The next day fever was 99.7 and with more ibuprofen it normalized to 98.6. If I didn&#39;t take ibuprofen for awhile it went back up to 99. something so I had to keep taking ibuprofen for the rest of that third day. Fourth day - mild fatigue and muscle aches. Everything was normal other than that. Fatigue and muscle aches were gone about Friday morning.

Noticed that I had hives around the injection site on the 30th, which then developed into a large, raised, circular rash around the injection site. Used hydrocortisone cream to treat the itchiness. The rash slowly dissipated over the course of the next 5-6 days.

I talked to a physician at a clinic my mother works at and they told me to take 800mg ibuprofen and apply heat. By the evening, my back pain subsided. My arm pit however, was still having a lot of pain. I continued taking the ibuprofen to help pain management. I noticed some soreness in my throat as well. I now know that my lymph nodes were swelling a lot and causing the pain. The right arm pit was so swollen I had a lump in it. Today 2/28, the swelling has gone down but I am still experiencing a little pain. Nothing compared to where it was.

                                                I first started feeling very cold around 5:00 PM that day. Once I went home I went to sleep around 10:30 and work up at 2:30 AM with vomiting and 8/10 epigastric pain that radiated to my back. I went to the hospital. They gave me morphine and Zofran but within 5 minutes of the first dose of morphine, my pain returned even more intense and I still vomited 20 minutes after the Zofran. So they pushed another Morphine and Zofran. Zofran helped at this point but the Morphine did not. At this point they gave my three different oral liquids to help calm down my epigastric region, including mylanta, lidocaine and a third medication. I went home and slept the rest of the day but Wednesday night I got diarrhea and spike a fever of 102.7 around 8PM. Now it&#39;s thursday morning and I still have a 2/10 epigastric pain, physically exhausted and had a fever this morning as well.

                                                Starting about 1 minute after vaccination I became extremely dizzy, blacked out/lost vision, had shortness of breath and a tight chest, lost feeling in my hand and fingers on my left side (the side I got the vaccine), was sweating but felt cold flowing through my body. These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

The bullseye - lasted about 7-10 days. About three days into I went to the  Urgent Care - they gave me a cream to put on it and Benadryl. The red bump was warm to the touch and it was painful. Those helped resolved the bulls eye bump within three days.

                                                One hour after vaccination on Saturday got lethargic and so tired. Same the next day. Monday, the fatigue improved but Instartes to get muscle aches and stiffness. Soreness in my joints. By Wednesday evening my chest started to hurt for a few minutes and my heart rate temporarily Increased. As the days went on the symptoms became more regular. I also got extreme anxiety, a very fast heartbeat (up to 130 BPM), insomnia, sweating palms and feet, and very difficult to breathe. I couldn?t even get up to take a shower sometimes or sit up. I was admitted to the ER on I believe Tuesday the 23rd of March. This is all in the records. All tests came back normal  aside from low iron, but anemia tests came back negative. After all doctors refused to give me medication to directly treat it, I finally went to an urgent care where they gave me prednisone. It?s currently helping me. I was finally able to go for a walk today.

I ended up throwing up around 4 am on Thursday 12/31/20 at work. Then over the weekend I  felt very lethargic, had body aches, and the hot flashes continued. My left arm hurt as expected, but the soreness went up into the left side of my neck as well. Today (1/3/21) is the first day since I got the vaccine where I no longer have a headache and feel basically back to baseline.

                                                I received my vaccine in my right arm around 3:20 pm on 1/5/21. My right arm started getting sore later that evening. The following day, 1/6/21, my arm was very sore and the injection site was tender to touch. I felt feverish and had chills. I also had a headache and felt very fatigued. I took some Advil that morning. I evaluated my arm in the evening and noticed a large red rash streaking down my right arm from the injection site. It measured approximately 3.5 in X 1.5 in. The rash was red, raised, painful, and firmer than my surrounding skin. I took 500 mg of Tylenol before bed. The next morning, 1/7/21, the rash had grown larger. The border of the rash was marked and I took an antihistamine around 7:00 am. At 1:00 pm the rash had grown larger, now measuring approximately 4.25 in X 2.25 in. My lymph nodes in my right armpit were also beginning to get sore. I visited the nurse practitioner at my hospital?s employee health clinic around 1:40 pm and we agreed to monitor my signs and symptoms at that time. The following morning, 1/8/21, the rash was bigger, but my skin was softer and more of a pink color than red. My arm did not hurt as much, though my right armpit was slightly more sore. Today, 1/9/21, my symptoms are much better. I have only slight soreness in my right arm and armpit. My rash has nearly resolved, though it is slightly itchy where the rash was.

                                                When I woke up the day after receiving the vaccine, the entire left side of my body was in pain. All the way from my arm, down to my ankle. I could hardly walk. In addition to this, I felt like I had the flu. Headache, fatigue, hot flashes, coughing. I vomited once in the evening. I received the vaccine on Friday, and Saturday was my worst day. I felt a bit better on Sunday, and back to normal on Monday.

                                                I am still not certain whether or not this is related to the vaccine, but it is very coincidental so I wanted to reach out just in case. I plan on seeing a physician this week if possible, but I am new to the area and do not have a PCP here so trying to get in to see someone is not very easy, and I do not feel that this is an emergency yet. Since Sunday night when I had the vaccine I am getting soreness in the muscles all over my body and have joint stiffness and pain, mostly legs, arms, and lower back. It is worse when I rest (sitting or laying) for extended periods of time. It relieves somewhat with NSAIDs but on some days it is so painful, stiff, and sore that I have difficulty going up and down stairs, and even walking or rolling over in bed sometimes. The last three days or so I have developed red and purple macules that first began on both of my legs and are now starting on both of my arms as well. Other than feeling fatigued and what I have described already, these are my symptoms. Like I said, I am not sure if it is related to the vaccine or not yet, but it did start the same day with the soreness. It has progressively gotten worse throughout the week and that is why I am now trying to seek help from a PCP. I may also try to reach out to my allergist on Monday when they reopen.

I ended up going to the emergency room after my shift but due to the physicians recommendations I deferred the lumbar puncture while there. Later Thursday night, the neck pain continued, and I started having fevers with a max of 102.1 so I returned to the ER the following day for the lumbar puncture. I was admitted to the hospital for aseptic meningitis.

I could not sleep on my arm, had difficulty lifting it over my head, and still experience some tenderness when I rub my upper arm.  I have never experienced this much pain following a vaccination in my entire life.

The next morning I woke up and couldn&#39;t move my head or neck from debilitating pain. I was not able to sit or stand on my own, and I could not walk more than a few steps without needing to sit down and rest. Severe upper back, neck and head pain for 3 days. Some intermittent irregular heartbeat, chest tightness as well. I lost 8 pounds (123lbs to 115lbs) in two days.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

By about 2pm I had body aches and a small fever. The second day, I was headachy with a sore arm.   the third day, Sunday, my arm was no longer sore, but my armpit hurt to move. At first it felt like a bra poke, but it would not go away. Monday and Tuesday, the irritant was high, but not painful. I believe this to be from a swollen lymph node. It currently feels like someone left a marble under my armpit.

On the third day, the formation is still present. The redness is uneven and looks a bit larger than before. Slight weakness in my left arm. No other symptoms.

As you requested, I have included an account of my appointment that occurred yesterday, 01/14/2021.   I was scheduled to receive the Moderna vaccine on 01/14/2021 at 1:20 pm. When I was finally attended, I sat at station. I was first patient that afternoon, and while she got acquainted with the template of the note, I focused my attention on the vial of Moderna vaccine that was placed in front of me. I noticed that the solution was a white, cloudy color, and being as excited as I was, I asked if it was okay to take a picture of it as a memory.   After going through the entire vaccine questionnaire, then began to draw the syringe. As she drew the solution, I noticed that the syringe looked clear, as if the vaccine solution had not been drawn into the syringe, and instead, air filled the syringe. At that point, I had some doubt that may not have drawn the solution. However, given the power dynamic and the vulnerability of the moment, I did not speak up because I did not want to question  technique, especially not in front of all the other people in the room. As she administered the vaccine on my left arm, I felt the needle pinch, and that was it.   I was then taken to for the 30-minute observation, and after 30 minutes, I felt fine. My left arm felt heavy post-vaccination, but that feeling only lasted an hour. That night, I began to press on my left arm, and to my surprise, I felt no pain or soreness. However, I believed that the following morning I would feel the soreness that I experience after I get vaccines.   Today, I have rubbed my arm, and I do not feel any pain or soreness associated with the site of vaccination. Further, I cannot distinguish where the vaccine was administered on my arm as I cannot sense pain, discomfort, and soreness. This added to my concern and suspicion that I perhaps did not receive a dose. The final incidents that led me to speak to you were when coworkers asked me if my arm was just as sore as their arm. Every person who shared their experience with me reported experiencing some level of local arm soreness and tenderness.   It has now been more than 24 hours since I was administered the Moderna vaccine, and I still do not feel a sore arm, nor any of the common side effects. I understand that every person is different and that we all react differently; however, I cannot shake off the feeling that I might not have received a dose.   As I posed the question earlier today, can an antibody test be done in a few weeks to determine if my body received the dose? I am aware that Dr. will be reaching out to Moderna, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.   Lastly, I want to say that I have no doubts about as a provider, but mistakes can and do happen in this field all the time. I want to point out that eased my nerves during my appointment, and I am grateful for her warm and caring approach during my appointment. Nevertheless, given the heightened rates of COVID infections throughout the community, I want to be certain that I have some level of protection against this dangerous virus that has taken so many lives.

                                                Within 1.5 hours, I started getting a bad headache.  She was not hungry, was nauseated and was becoming clammy.  She tried to eat but it did not make it better.  When she got home, she continued to feel &#34;really bad like she was getting over the flu.&#34;  She slept for over 10 hours.  When she got up, she could not move her arm and her arm was sore at the injection (it was hard, a little swelling but was not red).  Then she started feeling worse with bad pain (like she had a stroke).  This was around 12 noon to 1 PM on 1/21/21.  Around 7 PM that night, she presented to the ER.  The ER doctor said he thought she was having a migraine but she has never had one before.  Her blood pressure was high at 127/110.  Her supervisor walked into the room and said her face was pulling and it looked like a stroke to her.  She reported severe pain from her ear to her neck on the right side of her head.  She left due to having to provide care to her newborn.  She went to hospital on 1/21/21 about 2100.   Her blood pressure was still high and she had a heart rate of 120 bpm.  She did lab work and CT scan.   ER doctor believed she was experience Bell&#39;s Palsy and that she had had a mini-seizure.  She provided prednisone 60 mg X 1 dose, Valtrex tid and shot of Toradol.  She prescribed Toradol for outpatient pain relief.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I started to have an increased heart rate and heart palpitations that lasted about a second/1.5 seconds on and off. The increased heart rate would persist for quite some time (an hour or two), and then would stop, and happen again on and off.  The heart palpitations would occur multiple times per day. This lasted for about three days from the start date of the adverse event. On that start date, I also had some muscle cramping in my left arm (arm of vaccine injection), and had soreness beginning around my lymph nodes in my left armpit (that radiated into my chest a bit)  which was enough to make me want to life my arm up so it wasn&#39;t pressing down on it. The soreness is mostly gone now, but still there. I also had what I believe is muscles in my chest (on the left side mainly) cramping, as I had some aching and brief sharp pains occurring mainly during the time I had heart palpitations and increased heart rate, but it was hard to tell. I still get an occasional heart palpitation (one or two per day), but it is much less frequent than before.

                                                She presented to the hospital with acute typical angina approximately 72 hours after receiving her 2nd vaccine dose. The morning following her vaccine she developed fever, chills, generalized malaise, myalgias, and fatigue lasting about 48 hours. The following morning, she was awoken from sleep by a crushing substernal chest pain with associated typical anginal symptoms. Her initial troponin-I was elevated at 7.47 ng/mL and peaked at 19.19 ng/mL. An ECG demonstrated minimal ST elevations followed by an echocardiogram demonstrated preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of 60-65%. Due to her elevation in cardiac enzymes and persistent angina, coronary angiography was performed revealing no obstructive coronary artery disease. She was diagnosed with suspected myocarditis and treated successfully with anti-inflammatory medication. In follow-up, she had an uncomplicated treatment course with complete resolution of anginal systems and improvement in troponin and inflammatory markers.

Over the next two days she experienced and interruption in her normal sleep schedule, sweating, unusual fussiness, decreased appetite and twitching in her feet. Tylenol seemed to help her fussiness during the day.  I am still experiencing side effects 7 days later including muscle aches, fatigue, weakness, headache, and nausea. I was evaluated at a local ED and all lab work was normal, covid test was negative.

Though the red area is not exactly a circle, the diameter of the red area has steadily increased over the past few days. The area is not itchy. My arm is most painful when I move it (attempting to abduct at the shoulder feels impossible) and I cannot apply pressure (leaning or laying on that arm is also tremendously painful, as is the weight of a blanket touching the arm).    My arm soreness after the first dose I received resolved after 5-6 days. My arm was firm and warm around the injection site for that dose, but did not have this red area surrounding the injection site.

                                                My upper right side was completely in pain and stiff. The pain was shooting up my neck and reaching underneath my right breast. Soon afterward, I started catching the chills, a came down with a fever. My head was booming and I felt overly weak and nauseous. The pain in my arm was completely paralyzing to the point where even when I moved my head and was completely in pain. I had covid before in April and this experience was worse.

                                                I received dose 1 on 1/4/21 with relatively few side effects (no side effects I was not expecting). After receiving dose 2 on 2/1/21, I experienced more severe systemic side effects (fatigue, chills, muscle aches, headache) that started the next day on 2/2/21.  On 2/3/21, I noticed I had some discomfort while sitting down. By 2/4/21, I had noticed vaginal ulcerations that had formed on the vulva. I immediately made an appt to be seen by my Obgyn the next day on 2/5/21. I shared the following information with my obgyn during the appt: this was the first time I had ever noticed this, I have rheumatoid arthritis and am currently on Rituxan (rituximab) and get every 6 months, and I have been in a monogamous relationship for 2&#43; years. My Obgyn and I suspected that this was herpes and possibly had been dormant for many years.   However, herpes tests came back negative. I was then referred to an Obgyn who specializes in ID, and she was able to tell me by looking at the lesions that this was not an STI. She highly suspects the vulvar ulcerations are autoimmune in nature, and she mentioned that it was a Lipschutz ulcer.   While the trigger is not clear at this time, I am thinking there is a possibility that the second COVID vaccine dose could be what triggered the formation of these ulcers.

                                                Received my first vaccine 1/6/2021. I was very nervous about the vaccine, so I brought 4 epi-pens with me. My PCP and allergist advised me to sit x30 minutes after the shot. 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I felt very warm.  I looked at my hands and they were fire-cracker red in color. I began doffing my sweatshirt and my arms/neck/stomach and back were had a spotty rash. There was no hives/areas of elevation.  Nurses took my BP.  40 minutes without medication, rash and warmth resolved. A few hours later, I had a terrible headache and then around 8pm, I started with bad aches, chills, fever of 101. I took tylenol and did not resolved. The next AM, symptoms continued. I took advil and this had a better effect with sx resolving. My second dose, I received on 2/5/2021. I had a similar response about 10 minutes after the shot but warmth/reddness did not last as long, ~5-10 minutes. Had my BP taken, which was elevated (probably from my own anxiety). a few hours after the shot, I began with the headache, chills and fever--- though all mild. fever was 99 degrees the next day. 2/8/2021, I felt very fatigued and weird for a few hours. this seem to pass and I have felt normal since; just very tired. *** additionally, I did have COVID-19, testing positive 11/11/2020. my sx were mild compared to others.

                                                Within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I was dizzy, nauseous, and elevated BP (140?s/90?s). After about 30 minutes, these symptoms subsided. At 1:30 AM on 2/13, I woke from sleep with severe epigastric pain, chest pain, and pain between my shoulder blades. My arm (where I received the vaccine) was throbbing and I had severe under arm pain on the same side. Symptoms lessened with 2 extra strength Tums, 500 mg Tylenol, and 30 mL of Pepto, but were still present. I was able to sleep, I woke up later in the morning with these persistent symptoms, as well as fatigue. All of these symptoms continued for 24h. On 2/14, I had lessened arm pain and fatigue but continued to have epigastric/chest/back pain. I was seen at the urgent care near me and my physical was normal, they indicated that the chest symptoms were likely from epigastric pain since I was not having shortness of breath. I?ve continued to have these seemingly random chest pains and back pains, they?re very intense throbbing sharp pains in my chest and back that do not always coincide with exercise or stress.

The following day I was nauseous, light-headed, had a headache, muscle aches around my hips, pain at injection site, and was weak. I passed out for an unknown amount of time around 11 am that Sunday. I was unable to eat more than two pieces of pilot bread, but I kept drinking water and was hydrated. I kept rolling around trying to get comfortable, but the muscle pains in my hips would not let me until I used a heating pd. The following day I was weak, but no longer as nauseous or have as bad a headache.  On Tuesday, I was able to get up, but both arms felt very weak and it was a strain to carry my bag and computer. Wednesday I was still very tired, but more like myself. No symptoms today February 18.

Has seemed to increase since then, hurts to move the arm, holding it close to her with elbow flexed seems to be the least painful.  Has tried ice and heat, ibuprofen and acetaminophen without significant relief.  Pt is breast feeding 8 mo old daughter, having a hard time picking her up and caring for her as most motions with L arm cause significant pain.  Pt is here with husband who agrees that pt has cried with pain, reports at least 7/10.  No swelling or erythema, no fever, not feeling ill, just pain L shoulder.  Pt does state the vaccine was given in the L arm and points to very near shoulder as site of injection. Assessment / Plan: 1. Acute pain of left shoulder - likely SIRVA post COVID vaccination, recommend ice/heat, ibuprofen/acetaminophen for pain, husband to help with passive ROM and demonstrated pendulum exercises, topical options reviewed, PT offered and pt approves.  May wish to use Biofreeze for symptomatic relief.  Discussed possible duration of sxs, will try to decrease the duration with PT, if possible, as pt had 8 month old daughter, pt and husband agree.  To call if new or worsening sxs in the interim.  - PT EVAL AND TREAT; Future

Sharp pain in the chest/side/back (opposite the arm it was injected in) but I am also guessing this was stress related pain as I was very nervous about the vaccine (wanted to report anyway just in case) the pain subsides with 400mg ibuprofen. Then swelling, redness, and itchiness at the vaccination site starting the next day (3/6) and growing in intensity after (today). Currently the swelling is about 1.5 inches in diameter, it does not seem serious so I&#39;ll be treating it with topicals to ease the itching.

                                                Starting on March 13, I noticed the injection site was extremely red and swollen. On March 14 the muscle stiffness had moved from the injection site to my left shoulder. The muscles felt tight and bruised. The following morning, March 15 @ 10:30 a.m, the same pain has spread to my upper chest, around the collar bone. The area around also appears to be swollen, most noticeable on the neck. This is all accompanied by headaches increasing in severity as well as extreme exhaustion.

Most symptoms appeared overnight (about 8-12 hours post injection on 3/24) and have continued throughout the day (3/25). The shortness of breath began about an hour after injection (3/24), and has continued through the next day (3/25). So far treatment has involved taking ibuprofen at 10:30pm (3/24).

                                                On the morning of 3/24 I began to feel pain in my armpit on the side that I received my 1st dose injection. On the evening of 3/24 the injection site began to feel slightly itchy and warm. In the morning of 3/25 a rash began to form around the injection site and the pain in my left armpit persisted along with a warmth and itchiness at the injection site. After taking a bath the evening of 3/25 the rash appeared larger and more raised. In the morning of 3/26 the pain in the left armpit has mostly subsided but the rash is still present around injection site. The rash appears to have because more connected to have formed one large welt on my arm. It is still warm and itchy.

                                                Left arm began to have pain and muscle soreness within hours. Left arm began experiencing muscle twitches. Arm became so painful I could not lift it around 5 hours after the injection. By 2:00 AM (12 hours after injection) I experienced flu-like symptoms (aches, pains all over body), my left arm was so painful I took pain relievers to help me sleep. At 24 hours after the injection my body is aching and sore all over with significant pain in my joints. Arm is still painful, even with the slightest movement or touch.

                                                I got my covid 19 vaccine shot (Moderna) on 4/15/2021 on my left arm around 11:30AM After the vaccine I felt a discomfort, disoriented &amp; very sleepy &amp; tired. I slept, when I woke up that same evening I felt my neck &amp; my arm, all my of left side really hurt, a lot of muscle aching from my neck down to my arm, also my left ear hurt too.  I couldn?t sleep for long on the night of 4/15/2021 because of the muscle discomfort. I woke up on the morning of 4/16/2021 &amp; my arm &amp; neck was feeling a little better. Towards the afternoon I started to feel this aching on my middle part of my neck &amp; mid way of my back then towards the evening my left arm was way better but now the pain was on my right side of my neck &amp; arm, almost like the pain transition over to the other side. I couldn?t sleep at all on the night of 4/16/2021 because the pain &amp; muscle aching was now on the right side of my neck &amp; arm.  On the morning of 4/17/2021 I am still aching a lot when moving my neck left to right &amp; right to left and moving it in anyway it hurts a lot. My muscles on my neck &amp; arm ache a lot. I had to take time off work due to the vaccine date and recovery 4/15 4/16.

                                                On April 15, I noticed a pain in my right armpit. It was an achey sore pain, but also a more sharp, prominent pain at certain times. So I think it was a swollen lymph node. But by April 18 and 19, it only hurts when I raise my arm.   And also on April 15, my right arm was little itchy at the injection site, but I didn?t think anything of it. But by April 17, my whole upper right arm was very itchy, red, and warm to the touch. This has continued for the past few days. It?s not all the time, but a few times throughout the day and it lasts for probably a half hour to an hour.

                                                The morning after the vaccine( 17 hours post) woke up with headache, and full body aches. All muscles and joints ached including fingers and feet. Took Tylenol for pain and did net get relief. Took prescribed Gabapentien for pain and again felt no relief. Along with headache and body aches, I felt nauseous and cold sweats. No fever. Vaccine site is red and sore to the touch. Two days post vaccine still experiencing headaches although body aches have decreased significantly. Site of vaccine is red and the sore site starts to itch. Three days post body aches are gone, nausea gone but headache remains. Itching of vaccine site worsens but no change in color to site.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

Went to ED for further monitoring and had a hive show up while being seen, within 10 minutes of receiving PO Benadryl.  For the following 4 days had onset of migraine headaches. Treated with oral diphenhydramine 50 mg and observed for about 1 hour.

                                                About an hour after getting the shot in my right arm, I started to develop a pins and needle feeling in the same side of my body on my face and in my neck. My face felt hot to the touch but I did not at any point develop a fever. I do not have total facial paralysis but I have continued to have weak, sore, and somewhat painful facial experience on my right side of my face where I got the shot. It has been over 7 days... 3 days after the shot I had so much pain in the arm of the injection it hurt to move it, my finger tips felt like they were falling asleep all day, that went away after a day. I am extremely concerned to take the next dose due to the facial symptoms and I have contacted my health care provider.

The next day I felt moderate pain, swelling and firmness at the injection site. I was also lethargic and mentally depressed; however, the pain in my left wrist ceased. The third day I had no pain in my wrist or arm, but the muscle around the injection site felt firm and swollen. This is the 7th day and I still have firmness/ swelling at the injection site and experience itchiness.

That next morning I woke up and took a hot bath, which helped with the pain. I continued to have pain throughout the day, as well as fatigue. The second day after the shot the pain was gone, but I noticed I had a rash around the injection site, about 2 inches wide by 3 inches long.

Soreness was still there when I woke up, and the area began to itch a couple hours later. At 1:00 PM 1/26/2021 I looked at the injection site and there were raised red areas, hot to the touch, around the injection site. Not experiencing any fever or other symptoms.

                                                I got the vaccine approx 10:10am yesterday. About 4 hours post-vaccine, I developed severe pain in my left arm which limited flexion and adduction. I started to become nauseous, but initially thought this was due to pain. Once I returned home from work, at approximately 5 PM, I started to develop chills and a worsening headache. After taking acetaminophen, I took my temperature and found it was 101.5. This remained all night, and I had a difficult time sleeping, waking with chills, sweats and Aching in my joints. Today, I took off from work and slept all day, waking occasionally with the sweats. My fever began to go down slowly and is now approx 99.7 with use of fever reducers every 6 hours. Headache is still present. I anticipate these will dissipate in another day or two.

                                                In the evening of the same day (Monday around 7 pm), I began to feel severe fatigue and soreness at the injection site along with moderate muscle aches. At about 9 pm I felt chills and decided to take a warm bath. After the bath, I was not able to warm up and began shivering, the muscle aches increased as well. I took my temperature with a digital thermometer which read 102 degrees.  At around 11 pm I then experienced nausea and vomiting which continued until 3 am that same night. By Tuesday morning, all symptoms had decreased from severe to moderate, and no longer febrile. At night my fever rose again to 99.8 degrees with some mild nausea. The soreness at the injection site remained between moderate to severe with new pain at my underarm (same arm of injection). Today, Wednesday morning I continue to have pain and sensitivity on my underarm and at the injection site.

                                                After receiving the vaccine in right arm on 1/13 I had injection site pain and an severe upset stomach until 1/19. I was fatigued from 1/13 until 1/24. On Friday Jan 15 the pain in my injection site improved, but the pain moved to my right collar bone and right side of neck muscles. On Jan 16 the pain returned to the injection site and increasingly got worse in my collar bone and neck. The pain continued to worsen and become intolerable on 1/20. On 1/20 I was having pain in my injection site, collar bone, neck muscles, and my throat was sore and hurt to swallow. I went to the ER . After going to the ER and waiting for medications to be ready at the pharmacy the pain moved into my ear and I had a severe ear ache for two days. My symptoms improved after 2 days with ibuprofen 3x/day, muscle relaxers 3x/ day, Benadryl and lidocaine patches. The pain was localized to the right side of body and did limit the ability to complete ADLs

All through the evening and the next day patient continued to have paresthesias and hypoesthesia in the arm and hands.  Immediately after the injection she began to feel dizzy but drank gatoraid once she got home and began to feel better.  Within an hour she started to have some mild numbness around her mouth and tongue.  The next day she still has some mild numbness around the mouth and some tingling of her tongue.  She has had similar issues before due to fibromyalgia and has had a malar rash that comes and goes and has tested positive for lupus in the past.

Starting at 10am the next morning I noticed I was feeling fatigued and my heart rate was starting to increase. By 11am, I was experiencing diffuse myalgia, fatigue, and malaise. By the time I went home at 11:30am, I had a fever to at least 101F, chills, body aches, and headache. I rested in bed the whole rest of the day and the night. I felt better taking Tylenol but it only relieved my fevers somewhat. I had no GI symptoms, rash, or difficulty breathing. By the next morning my fever had abated and my energy level much improved.

                                                After the shot I went Back to work and experienced no other side effects except just a slight sore arm in injection site. I got home later that night and did school work and felt a tad more tired than usual, went to bed and woke up aT 1:45 a.m.  with intense body chills, body aches and soreness that it felt like I got Got By a bus , I also felt nauseous. Took a Tylenol and finally fell back asleep and woke Up feeling just tired. Tried to work but had to go home because I had no energy and feeling nauseous while working. I have been home and have not left my Bed since 10 a.m. and I still feel super awful.

                                                Began at 7PM with a severe headache.  took a nyquil and woke up in the middle of the night with very strong shaking, chills.  Memory of the nighttime is very spotty, don&#39;t believe I was fully aware.  I recall &#39;coming to&#39; at points in the night where I would drink water and lay back down.  Around 1:45AM the severe shaking/convulsing stopped .  I was able to walk and got up and went to the restroom where I got my thermometer and was at 100 temperature.  Went back to bed and regularly took my temperature - it proceeded to have temperature circles between 99-102 until around 5:30 am where it settled off at 100 degrees for the rest of the day.  Severe joint pain which made it difficult to hold my legs straight or bend them.  Around 5PM on 2/1/2021 almost everything was gone except for a lingering headache.  Went to bed on the 1st and woke up 2/2nd completely back to normal except for a headache which I believe would be diet related.

Around 6:00 pm, I measured my temperature and it was 95.0 degrees Fahrenheit. I could not get warm for and experienced tingling and numbness in first my feet, then arms and hands, and finally my face. This passed and I was left feeling nauseous and still extremely cold. After tossing and turning for most of the night, so of these side effects have resolved, but I have a splitting headache and muscle and joint pain throughout my body. No treatment has been undertaken. Some side effects have resolved while others continue.

                                                Arm pain started at 4:30pm the day of the injection. As the evening continued, I had muscle and joint aching of left side of my neck, shoulder, breast and felt very fatigued. During the night, I fell asleep quickly but woke up between 12-2 am sweating, with chills and muscle and joint aching all over my body specifically in my spine. The next morning I woke up with severe left arm pain and was unable to lift my left arm but I believe that is possibly due to the location of the injection site. (They injected me much closer to the AC joint rather than in the bulky part of the muscle.) The arm pain lasted 2 nights. I continued feeling fatigued and drained through the first full day and woke up after the second night feeling better. I had mild headaches on and off starting the second day after the injection and lasting about 5 days.

                                                The second dose was very painful, compared to no pain when the first dose was given one month ago. My arm was immediately hot and tender after administration. The area around the injection site had less feeling than the rest of my arm - it felt almost numb. My arm was very sore and warm the rest of the evening. I began having fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain last night as well. I woke up around 6 this morning and the room was spinning. I was also nauseous. I tried to roll over in bed but was unable to feel my arms and legs. I was also temporarily unable to see. Right after, I passed out and lost urinary continence. I regained consciousness a minute later and had normal functioning again. I have not had any more dizziness today but am still sore and fatigued.

All of my skin, back and spine hurt, in the way that your body is sensitive and extra painful when you have a fever but I checked and I haven&#39;t had a fever yet. All of the day on 02/28/2021 I experienced skin and back pain, headache, fatigue, and brain fog (difficulty focusing and making decisions) as well as swollen and tender lymph nodes in my left armpit and under the left side of my jaw. On 03/01/2021 I woke up and felt better in the morning, I went for a walk around 3 pm and around 4 pm when I got back and sat down I started to experience headache, severe nausea which turned into chest pain and chest tightness and I still have swollen lymph nodes.

                                                I noticed numbness in my arm within minutes after receiving the Moderna dose 1. I didn?t think anything of it, and took two ibuprofen for the pain. The next morning, my arm felt stiff and painful. I took two more ibuprofen. Around 3 or 4 pm (just over 24 hours after initial injection), there was a red circle, about two inches in diameter around the injection site. The area was a hard, tender bump. I iced the bump for about two hours, off and on, from 6 PM to 8 PM.

Fever of 101 developed in afternoon and persisted until around 9pm that night when it started to go down.  Rest of symptoms resolved within 24 hours of onset.  Felt a bit tired the next day, but that&#39;s it.  I did have a confirmed case of COVID-19 (positive test 12/4/20) prior to receiving this vaccination.

Woke up around 4-5a.m. to neck/head pain, tense muscles on head/neck and notable pains in the jugular region. Very sensitive skin and muscle aches at this time. getting up to grab ibuprofen caused initial worsening of head pains that quickly subsided as blood pressure issue(?) symptoms came on (blotchy vision, lightheadedness, notably diminished hearing). took around 20 minutes to realize head/neck pain seemed to be caused by stiffness from an unusual amount of intense teeth grinding in my sleep. Waited around an hour and a half while drinking plenty of water and taking a single dose of ibuprofen along with a second dose of clonazepam before feeling comfortable/safe enough to go back to sleep.

                                                I want to preface this by saying that I believe the vaccine was administered more posterior and superior than a IM injection into the deltoid should be. This was confirmed by other health providers. Approximately 1 week s/p vaccine dose 1, I was lifting weights around 8PM (bench press), when I noticed some sudden soreness/pain in my shoulder joint on my left side (5/10). I returned home and around 11PM my shoulder felt mildly pruritic and very warm to the touch. I noticed a nodule palpable under the skin, measuring approximately 1cm, and it was then that I realized that it was in the same location of my vaccination injection (I will include photos of injection site and reaction). The nodule continued to grow ~2cm, when I decided to call the advice nurse line, (I am a 2nd yr MD-PhD student). I was advised to take diphenhydramine and go to the ER if I felt anaphylactic reaction occurring, and they made me a morning appt with the NP at the clinic. The diphenhydramine seemed to stop the progression, however the following morning the 2cm nodule was still present and warm to the touch, but was no longer pruritic. The NP received photos and advised that I continue antihistamines - diphenhydramine at night and loratidine during the day for ~5 days. She did agree that the injection was not a proper deltoid injection. Over the course of 3 days the nodule disappeared. I had no issues with the second vaccination.

                                                I am twenty-eight years old, young, healthy active girl. I have always been into fitness and yoga. I live a generally healthy lifestyle. I have been a singer, a dancer, and a flight attendant! I decided sign up for the COVID-19 vaccine in order to help our world fight against this pandemic. I wanted to protect my family and friends to eradicate this virus once and for all. It was with no hesitation did I jump at the opportunity to get this vaccine when it became available to me on February 12th, 2021 at the Convention Center. As soon as I received my shot I proudly posted my photo with tears in my eyes letting the world know that we were one human closer to a COVID-19 free world. I was Moderna proud.   My entire family had already received their Moderna vaccines because I come from a family of nurses, but none of them had experienced any side effects. I was confident I would be in the clear after their clear symptom free vaccine. Immediately following my vaccine my arm was a little sore, as expected. However, I did experience fatigue and mild leg cramps in my calves. One very odd symptom was that I could taste the vaccine in my mouth, like a metallic, strange taste, which I reported to my family, but everyone just laughed it off. The leg cramps went away after a day or two as well as the taste, but the fatigue continued throughout the week. I felt these symptoms were pretty average. I signed up for the V-Safe reporting system and put in my report and thought nothing of my initial vaccine symptoms.   Things took a very strange turn on the morning of February 20th, 2021 at about 10am. I woke up and my face was numb, tingling all over, twitching in different parts of my face pretty severely and uncontrollably. By 4pm the tingling moved into both of my arms and hands and by 5pm it moved into both of my legs. Shortly after the cramping and twitching began in both of my legs and I lost the ability to walk, lift my legs, and just the ability to feel my legs at all. I could not walk.  Obviously concerning, I thought I was originally having a reaction to a medication I had been taking for over a year called, Topamax, a nerve pain medication which can cause numbness and tingling as a side effect. I called my prescribing physician and he immediately ruled out the possibility of a reaction to this medication due to the length of time I had been on this medication, that I had not missed a dose, I had not increased or decreased the dose, and I had not experienced a reaction like this in the time that I had been taking the medication. He recommended I keep an eye on my symptoms and go to an emergency room if things worsen.   Overnight, my symptoms remained the same. I woke up on Sunday, February 21st, 2021 and I still could not walk, I could not feel my legs. My legs were still twitching and cramping. My face was still numb and tingling, but the twitching had stopped in the face. My hands had stopped tingling. At this point my mother who is a nurse suggested that I call Moderna, the vaccine provider, to report a possible side effect of the vaccine. Upon contacting Moderna, the company thought that it could possibly be a reaction between the Topamax medication and the vaccine, but they had no current information about these two having any interactions. They thanked me for reporting and told me to go to an emergency room if my symptoms continued or worsen.   Throughout the day on Sunday, February 21st, my symptoms remained. I was able to get to my feet, but I walking like a newborn baby giraffe or as my mother described, like a 105 year old woman. I was unable to feel my legs completely, lift them, move them without lifting them with physical help of my arms moving them. At this point on Sunday night I decided to contact my Primary Care Physician. She noted that this sounded similar to Guillain-Barre and that I sound immediately go to an Emergency Department before the symptoms get any worse. It was late on a Sunday night and I was unable to drive myself, so I waited.   Overnight on Sunday into Monday I began experiencing light flashes in my eyes, heart races, lower back pain, and worsening cramping in my legs. I knew that I needed to seek treatment in an emergency room.   On Monday, February 22nd, 2021 I was taken to the Emergency Room Department. They conducted blood work and a physical examination, but did not want to proceed with any MRI?s or CAT scans. The ER the doctors were baffled. They could not figure out what was causing my paralysis other than the vaccine was the only new thing that had been introduced to my body, but they could not verify or diagnose anything. They let me go with a referral to neurology.   While we were sitting in the ER my cousin, a nurse anesthetist at another local hospital, called my mother who was with me with some very alarming news. Her co-worker, had experienced the same symptoms back in December and was just going through recovery after his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He was told by the CDC there had been 19 reported cases through the CDC where after the first dose of the vaccine people have reported numbness, tingling, and the lose of the ability to walk after receiving the first dose of the mRNA vaccine, both Moderna and Pfizer. Her co-worker was also in the same age range as myself, very healthy, young, active. He was officially diagnosed with Transverse Myletis. He has taken a full two months to regain the ability to walk and still has numb patches on his legs. He walks very slowly, but is walking. He returned to work, but cannot return to his normal life working out and being active because he does not have the strength. He was told not to get the second dose of the vaccine.   There are unreported cases in this area by physicians who do not know where to turn with this information. It is hard to link these symptoms and cases because they are so obscure, but these same symptoms are occurring with those who have also had COVID-19. When I was being seen for an EMG test of my legs the physician performing the test said to us, ?I have a patient who received the vaccine and has the symptoms, maybe I should report it!?. My Grandmother?s physician just last week just sent a patient of hers with the same symptoms to neurology. I think this uncommon side effect is more common than is being reported and no one knows where to turn with the information.   I finally got into the head of Neurology. I was told, ?it?ll probably get better?, basically saying that they don?t know what they can do and they are at a loss for knowing what this is and why this is happening to people after the first dose of the mRNA vaccine. Doctors don?t have answers and the vaccine companies aren?t offering information to help link these side effects together. The physician told me not to proceed with the second dose of the vaccine due to neurological side effect that I have had. I should benefit from the first dose and it is not safe for me to get the second dose from this side effect.   I was unable to walk for weeks since this began on Feb. 20th. It is just now that this week I am slowly able to move my legs, but they are still very numb and heavy. I haven?t been able to drive or live my normal life. I cannot use stairs, walk long distances, stand for very long periods of time. I am twenty-eight years old and I walk like an eighty year old woman, wobbly.   I have reported my case to CDC, V-SAFE, Moderna. The CDC said they would be in contact with me due to my report of extreme adverse side effects via the V-SAFE report, but I have not heard anything from them as of today.  These are the uncommon side effects that need to be heard and reported. I don?t know why they are being ignored because I have been left without answers and without hope.

                                                On Monday 3/8 I started feeling numbness, pain, and tightness in my left hand and elbow. During the next 24 hours my hand started to become very weak and my fingers began curling over each other. I had a video call with the doctor from family medicine and he referred me to OT for a check. I went to physical therapy and hand therapy on Thursday 3/11 and they evaluated and created a device to allow my fingers to still move, but prevent them from curling. Pain and weakness in the hand have continued.

                                                12 hours after receiving the second shot of the vaccine I woke up in pain. My pelvis and legs and ankles ached. As well as my arm at the site of injection. My temp was 99.8. I took  one tylenol around 8:30 am. As the day went on it got worse. I took one tylenol at 10:30 am. I was nauseous, my heart was racing, I felt like I was going to pass out, my arms and legs began to tingle. My temperature peaked at 102.5 around 5pm. All of my joints ached severely. It felt like my pelvis had been crushed. Even laying my knees on top of each other while laying on my side was too much pressure on my knee joints. The only other time I&#39;ve felt like this is when I had Influenza A. At 8:30 pm I took one tylenol and one benadryl and was finally able to sleep. A few hours after taking the medication the joint pain had greatly decreased.  In the morning I no longer had a fever.

Muscle spasm occurred from 8:40pm until 9:05pm when she agreed to go to the ER. Pain was 10 out of 10 for approximately an hour until medical intervention. Flexeril injection into lower back. 5% lidocaine patch applied. Cyclobenzeprine tablet ingested. Pain was managed and patient was released around 11:15. Oral prednisone prescribed along with oral cyclobenzeprine. Following day showed major reduction in acute pain but muscles are very sore from prolonged constriction.

States she went to urgent care for it on 03/18/2021, but they didn&#39;t do anything except tell her to take some Benadryl. When pt called, advised her to alternate between heat and ice for her arm to help with swelling and pain, and to take some Benadryl tonight when she goes to bed to see if that helps for tomorrow morning. Also advised her to call her PCP to see what their recommendation would be.

                                                Extremely sharp head pains and nausea started Tuesday (4 days after receiving the Vaccine) at 0245 AM. Thursday night around 0930 PM I noticed the swollen lymph nodes in the shower. After further investigation I noticed there were three almond sized swollen nodes (largest and most painful was in the left Clavicle and the other two were in the jugular area. Unfortunately after palpitations the nodes became extremely agitated and pain radiated from the neck down into the fingers in the left arm. On Friday (19 Mar I went to the clinic where I was tested for COVID and was negative) Over the weekend approximately 10-15 more Nodes became enlarged, followed by blurred vision in right eye and more intense headaches. 22 March I was sent to the ER for Lab work (testing white blood cell count) and an ultrasound of the lymph nodes .

                                                About 1 week after injection, my left shoulder around the injection site started becoming swollen, red, inflamed, and itchy. Within a few days, the swelling engulfed my entire shoulder and upper arm. The physical sensation was like an enormous, hot mosquito bite. No pain, unless I scratched it too much. I called my doctor for a telephone consultation, and he advised that I apply heat to it. I used a hot towel for the heat pad, and after a cumulative of 8-12 hours over the course of 2 days, the symptoms subsided, and my shoulder was completely back to normal.

                                                Pain immediately upon completion of injection, with slight tingling in hand. Within 2 minutes of injection, pain was experienced at site of injection in the arm. Within 30 minutes of injection, arm had very limited range of motion resulting in inability to lift arm away from myself and severe pain. Discussed symptoms with pharmacist at clinic and was told if symptoms do not improve within 4 days, contact doctor and to take ibuprofen for symptoms in the meantime. Contacted PCP 2 hours post injection due to how severe pain was and was told pain was normal and should clear up. 24 hours post injection- symptoms still remained - very limited range of motion of arm and severe pain at site of injection and surrounding area in arm and into shoulder and neck. 48 hours post injection- pain less severe and increased range of motion in arm. 72 hours post injection- slight increase from 48 hours in terms of range of motion and slight decrease of pain. Currently still monitoring symptoms and taking ibuprofen.

Arm was sore but nothing compared to joints (especially hips). Temperature was only slight at 98.7. Headache and body aches, joint pain were severe enough that I was forced to rest and unable to continue daily activities. Ache symptoms quickly dissipated after 48 hours, but a 2 inch diameter welt appeared, slightly raised and itching mildly like a mosquito bite. Welt is still present now, 5 days post-injection.

                                                This is my second pregnancy and at the time of my vaccination, I was 32 weeks 6 days gestation with an estimated delivery date of 2/15/21.  I tolerated the vaccine well initially with only a very minor sore arm the day after the vaccine. On 12/31/2020 (4 days after vaccination), I felt muscle fatigue around my hips and buttocks as well as significant fatigue. It seemed to improve over the course of the day and was not very noticeable for the next few days. On 1/4/21 (8 days after vaccination), my muscle fatigue in my hips, buttocks, thighs, and hamstrings bilaterally became very significant, preventing me from doing some activities that I had planned. I also had generalized fatigue. On 1/5/21, I had similar symptoms, but the muscle fatigue also began to include my shoulders bilaterally. 1/6/21, the muscle fatigue also included my neck and I was physically exhausted. 1/7/21 I started to note some improvement, and I also saw my OB who did bloodwork but also did suspect a possibly delayed reaction to my vaccine. Today (1/9/21) I am still experiencing muscle fatigue, but it does seem to be improved from several days ago.

This is awful. No one from VAERS will pick up the phone and I need to know what to do. This is so irresponsible.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen, and it took me 3 hours until I could have some relief and feel asleep. Chills fever and body aches I had for 3 days and it reached 100.7 on Christmas day. By Saturday no more fever but the pains were still there. Sunday I was fatigued and all those days I had pretty bad night sweats (about 5 nights). My nausea was so bad that one of the doctors I work with prescribed me some Phenergan that I took Christmas eve and day to help me be able to hold something in my stomach.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

She started to feel better and left. Started to feel bad in the car on the way back to work. Her boss is a dentist and advised her to take Benadryl, which she did.  Traveling to Hospital now.  She has not yet been seen by a physician. Current symptoms are throat constriction, hard time swallowing, and having a hard time concentrating.  She is pale and feels unwell.   Wed Jan 13, 2021 16:09  Followed up with patient.  Patient is currently in the Emergency Room at Hospital. She has so far received steroids and benadryl.   Thurs Jan 14, 2021 08:56 Followed up with the patient again.  She returned home from the first ER visit at 17:30 last night.  About 4 hours after that her heart rate became elevated again (130-140 bpm while lying down) and she was confused, lethargic, and had a HA and backache. She went back to ER last night around 21:30. They gave her more benadryl in IV and toradol for the HA. She is now on PO benadryl every 4 hours for 4 days. Symptoms today include: runny nose, feels like a mild case of flu, HA and backache. Upon awaking this morning, prior to the morning dose of benadryl, her heart rate was a little elevated. She was also told she could alternate Tylenol or ibuprofen prn and use OTC cold remedies but hasn&#39;t needed any. The doctor said she is not a candidate for the next the second vaccine dose.

                                                Morning after administration I had the typical extremely sore arm from injection.  Around noon that Wednesday (13th), I started to experience lower back muscle aches. As the day progressed my whole back was achy and began to have the chills. I felt as if I had &#34;been hit by a car,&#34; extreme aches. Through the night I had chills and drenched in sweat all night. I only took ibuprofen and rested. I never had a fever when I took my temperature. Thursday (14th) I woke up with minor back aches and the chills had resided. Just very tired from my body working in over drive. Again, I only took ibuprofen and began to feel better. I thought I was done with reactions.  Friday (15th) I woke up feeling better, no more aches or chills. However, I had extreme pain in my left arm pit, same arm of injection. My armpit was swollen and uncomfortable and seemed to be a swollen lymph node. I had no other symptoms this day, felt totally fine, just had this swollen lymph node. Again, took ibuprofen.  Saturday (16th) I was back to feeling like myself.   All the while I had a headache, however I experience headaches/migraines very often, so I did not include this as a direct reaction.

                                                On 1/11/2021 (day of first vaccine dose) at approximately 5pm I began experiencing the following symptoms: fatigue, chills, muscle aches, 99.7 temperature. These symptoms lasted throughout the night and did not continue the next day. I also experienced pain at the injection site which lasted for approximately 3 days.   On 1/16/2021 at approx. 3am I woke up feeling itching and stinging on both of my hips. I got up and looked in the mirror and noticed what appeared to be hives or rashes on my left and right hip. The rashes were red, slightly raised and approximately 3 inches long. I took Benadryl which helped to alleviate the itching and stinging. The following day (1/17), the rashes were still present but were no longer raised.  On 1/17, I noticed a smaller hive like rash on both the outside and inside of my right arm. Today (1/18) the rashes on my hips and arm are still present but no longer raised.   When I woke up on 1/18/2021 I had pain and itching on my upper left arm where I had received the vaccine injection. The area is red and warm to the touch. I saw my PCP who described the area as &#34;indurated&#34;. The redness, pain and itchiness have persisted throughout the day.   I cannot think of anything else that would have caused this reaction. I have not eaten anything new/different, I have not changed any detergents or body washes/lotions. I have not taken any new medications.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

This lasted through Friday/Saturday and my symptoms resolved. Starting 1/5 in the evening, the injection site began to swell, become red again and itch. I now have an almost 2&#34; diameter swelling that continues to increase. I&#39;m assuming its related to the vaccine although I don&#39;t understand the delay in the symptoms.

I did not experience any injection site skin reactions prior to this, just muscle pain in that shoulder for a couple days after the dose. The redness faded away within 24 hours.

The pain feels tender and constant. It helps to take tylenol to decrease the pain.   My left armpit feels tender and sore. It looks a bit swollen. I know I slept on my left arm, so it may be sore from that, but it does not feel like arm strain. It is just on my armpit area I feel the pain and discomfort. I do not feel pain on my injection site.  It is now day two that I am experiencing this pain. I do not feel pain on my right arm or armpit.

                                                Within a few hours of receiving the vaccine my arm was in excruciating pain. Was not able to lift  more than 45 degrees. Than dizziness and vertigo started. That evening I had the chills, night sweats (possible fever). Headaches persisted for the rest of the week with dizziness. Arm pain started to subside by Monday but then came the extreme neck pain. I was not able to move my neck side to to side and  forward flexion caused pain. I sought the help of a physical therapist who was concerned about my symptoms and astonished by the pain and level of inflammation in the neck region. I received treatment the week following the vaccine and I am now on week 2 and the neck pain is still here but not as severe only pain turning to the left and the headaches are less frequent.

                                                within a few hours of injections left arm pain increased. eventually could only lift arm about 45 degrees. Headaches and dizziness persisted throughout the day. that evening i had chills, night sweats and possible fever. Arm pain did not subside until monday of the following week. But with the arm pain subsiding came the extreme pain in my neck. could not move it in any direction. I sought the attention of a physical therapist who was shocked with the inflammation and pain. I have received treatment for the last week for the consistent headaches and neck pain. It is now week 2 and the pain is lessening but not completely gone. the headaches are less frequent and arm pain is gone.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/19/2021 at my place of employment. Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

When I got to work, I looked at my arm and it was very swollen, red, warm, firm, and itchy. By Sunday 1/17, I started to see progress with the swelling, warmth and redness.  It is still mildly itchy. Please note, when I got the vaccine on 1/06/21, I had the normal side effects of arm soreness, fatigue, mild muscle aches and a mild headache; all of these symptoms were gone by Friday 1/08/21. I saw [vaccine administrator] and she instructed me to use ice and hydrocortisone cream.  I iced it for 4 days and there was no change until day 4 (Sunday). I also used Aleve during this time as well. I saw my PCP on Monday 1/18 and she told me to continue the current treatment of ice and Alieve and to update her on Wednesday 1/20.&#34;

This lasted for two days. On day 3 I began to feel dizzy and have extreme low back pain and stomach pain with nausea with again lack of appetite. By this time the body aches and arm pain went away but I still have a headache. Now on day 4 the low back pain has gone away but still I have a headache and lack of appetite and nausea.

I took 600mg of ibuprofen and it helped with everything except my headache.  I alternated between 1000mg of extra strength acetaminophen and 600 mg of ibuprofen. My symptoms subsided in the late evening of 1/23/21. I felt back to normal on 1/24/21.   My sore arm started immediately after vaccination and is still a little sore but has significantly improved.

                                                Nausea, feverishness and chills started on Sunday morning, January 24th at around 2:30 AM. I was very pale and felt clammy, and the muscles in my upper arm, shoulder and neck were hurting more than just the normal ache from the shot. I had a hard time falling back asleep until I took more ibuprofen until the fever was gone. When the ibuprofen started to wear off I started to feel nauseous and fevered again, until I was able to take my next dose. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen every six hours for 24 hours to make the fever down to 99 degrees F. (My average body temperature is about 97.6 degrees F) At the time of this form I am still experiencing muscle pain, but it is more of a sore pain than the stabbing pain is had been on Sunday the 24th.

                                                After I received the shot, my arm was sore for a day or two, but then it was fine. However, about a week later, a red patch about the size of a half dollar appeared on my arm where I received the vaccine. Then, over the course of the next 4-5 days, my arm felt very sore, stiff, and tight in the shoulder/armpit area. The patch spread, became larger, and developed a ring around it. By day 5, it covered the majority of my shoulder/upper arm area, and had a dark outer ring similar to ring worm. It was itchy and red. This is still happening. I have photos of the progression of each day to share if needed.

Symptoms include severe myalgia, arthralgia, and constant chills but no fever. Moderate headache and tachycardia (100-130, most likely due to pain level). I had to leave work after about 2 hours d/t symptom severity. Symptoms were only slightly improved with 1gram of Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not history of adverse vaccine reactions. Symptoms resolved about 24 hours after onset.

                                                Three days after my COVID vaccine in my left arm (1/11), I woke up suddenly (1/15) with shooting electric pains down my whole left arm, a totally numb left arm, and extreme pins and needles and uncontrollable body movements throughout my body which slowly subsided over the next hour. I went to the ER, no testing was completed. 24 hours later my arm gave out completely, and while it has regained function over the last couple of weeks the top portion of my arm is still weak and feels twitchy and uncomfortable at the site of the injection.

Around 1:00am on 1/23/21 I felt a stabbing pain at the site of injection as well as an aching numbness from my left shoulder down to my left pinky finger.  The morning of 1/23/21 I was weak and could barely walk, and I had a fever of 100.9. I got chills and would feel inexplicable cold and have goosebumps despite my fever. I had no appetite and was extremely fatigued. When sleeping on and off throughout the day I had extreme sweats and soaked my bedsheets. My muscles ached and touch was painful, even the spray of a shower felt painful.These symptoms continued until the early morning of Monday 1/25/21 which was the last time I experienced chills.

                                                Everything was mild (low grade fatigue, minor injection site soreness and itchyness) until 1AMish. I startes feeling achey and had chills which made it hard to sleep.  My joints, hips, and knees hurt a lot. 400mg of ibuprofen helped me enough to sleep.  I woke around 8am. Significant muscle aches ans joint pain. Ate breakfast at too ibuprofen at 9:30am.  It didnt help much, I managed to hobble to the grocery store for food late morning.  11:30 am my appetite was low, muscle aches bad. I cant recall if I took ibuprofen. Fatigue soon set in and I slept for a few hours.  Around 630pm,  my chills are back. I feel warm but am afebrile. My body temp is higher than normal (97.8 vs 96.6).    My muscles and joints hurt a lot. I might be getting a headache. I have no appetite. My face feels hot but my body is freezing. All day I have brief bouts of nausea that are mild and fleeting. I only gagges once when a sharp wave hit.

It felt like when you hit your elbow too hard and get both a deep, dull, aching pain, and a burning, shooting nerve pain. I experienced it down both arms and both legs, with the leg pain lasting longer and feeling more severe than the arm pain. I also experienced muscle spasms in my arms, legs, and lower back, with nerve pain shooting from my lower back into my legs, almost like sciatica. The pain was between a 7 or 8/10 at most times and was some of the worst pain I?ve continuously felt in my life. The pain subsided around 16 hours after starting, however I?m still experiencing occasional shooting pain or sudden aching in my bones or muscle spasms, although it?s usually only one area at a time and very brief/manageable. During the 16 hours, I also had joint stiffness that was severe enough to limit my ability to move and I had difficulty walking to the bathroom or shifting positions in bed. It also mostly subsided after the 16 hours, however I am still experiencing minor joint stiffness still.

Later in the day developed muscle aches and chills. Overnight into the next 24hrs I had a fever (highest was 102 degrees F); extreme muscle aches, chills, headache, and an extremely sore left arm. Left arm was tender to any touch, other muscles were sore to firm touch. Treated with Ibuprofen. 36 hours later the fever, extreme muscle aches and chills subsided. Next day fatigued, slight headache, mildly sore arm.

It lasted about 40 minutes but my hand still felt weak. Went to the ER and the doctor said it was likely due to inflammation of the injection site compressing on my nerves.  Had a low grade fever of 99.4°F and body aches.

The dizziness worsened after about 30 minutes but the nausea went away. About 30-40 minutes after the shot, my head got very foggy feeling, my limbs felt heavy and weak, and I suddenly became very tired. I don&#39;t have any trouble breathing and my heart rate is fine. I&#39;m just going to sleep it off and drink lots of water.

                                                I woke up at approx 2:00am 02/03/2021 with my clothes soaking wet,even my bed sheets. I was chilling, very nauseated, had a headache, diarrhea, heart burn, and a fever of 101, very weak, muscle aches,  very fatigued, and no appetite. These symptoms lasted all day Wednesday 02/03/2021, Thursday 02/04/2021, and Friday 02/05/2021. I was able to eat very little on Thursday. When I woke up on Friday 02/05/2021 I was much more nauseated. I threw up two times Friday morning and was unable to hold my daily medications down. I still had all symptoms that I listed above. I called my endocrinologist Friday morning and he had me come to the infusion clinic to get a bolus of IV fluids and IV steroids....I was able to sleep for 3 hours whenever I came back from the infusion clinic and was able to hold some food down.  101.8 was the highest that I am aware of that my fever was. Saturday 02/06/2021- Monday 02/08/2021 most symptoms had subsided except mild nausea, heartburn and sinus drainage. I was able to return to work on Tuesday 02/09/2021. I had every symptom of COVID-19 other than loss of taste or smell. I was rapid tested and PCR tested on Friday 02/05/2021 and both results were negative.

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

                                                I experienced Covid Arm 7 days after my shot, as it became known to me after I looked up my symptoms and talked with my doctor. Started with itching at injection site, which became very warm. After about an hour or so I noticed it was very sore and swollen. It developed a red circle around it on the second day, and was at least 2 inches in diameter. It was hard, hot and itchy. Probably due to the swelling, my arm became sore from shoulder down through my hand for about 24 hours. Two days later the swelling began to go down, the heat went away, and I?d say the itching mostly subsided within the 48 hours since it started. All normal now!

At that point, my arm became hot to touch and severely itchy. On day 10 the symptoms began to subside and were manageable with tylenol and an antihistamine.   The second dose resulted in a similar reaction to the vaccine as the first dose. The symptoms were worse and included, headaches, exhaustion, muscle and joint pain to the point where I had to call out of work. The body aches felt similar to having the flu. This all occurred the day after the second dose. Two days after the second dose,  I am still tired and have a headache. The body aches are minor.

                                                right after getting injection, my left arm started getting swollen, warm and my arm felt heavy and numb it was hard to move my arm. I had to take a Benadryl for the allergic reaction.  but the reason why my arm got swollen was because the person who gave me the injection put the vaccine really close to my shoulder so most probably he poke a vein or nerve and injected the medication directly in my vein because in just seconds of getting the vaccine that started happening.  and the next day i also got normal side effects pain to my arm, bodyaches, fever, nausea, headache but i took tylenol for the fever and muscle and body aches and severe cold and flu medication

Throughout Saturday, I experienced hip flexor and quadriceps pain in addition to chills (no fever). At the time of the vaccine, I was 33&#43;6 days pregnant. No medication was taken so that fetal movement could be detected (10 movements in 2 hours). Normal fetal movement was detected on Friday and all days following injection. No pregnancy concerns so I did not call my OB office.

                                                Sharp upper back pain that radiated into chest. Pleuritic in nature, seemed to be concentrated at base of lungs bilaterally.  Slightly worse when taking deep breath. Not really associated with shortness of breath. No other associated symptoms. Made worse by lying down. Slightly alleviated by raising shoulder blades up and sitting with head in hands. Lasted approximately 1.5 hours with periods of worsening and getting slightly better. Was considering going to emergency room given severity of pain, but eventually resolved on its own with no further symptoms since that time. Have never experienced symptoms like that before. Pregnant at time of occurrence, 15 weeks 4 days along.

                                                I have had a non-stop pressure headache since the second dose. I drink plenty of water. I take Tylenol / Ibuprofen daily. Nothing helps. Laying down makes it worse. It throbs in the roof of my mouth and my nose. It is nauseating. I feel like someone is squeezing my brain. My blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen are fine.   I did reach out to a neurologist about this. I was thought to have IIH over two years ago when I was 70 lbs heavier, but I have not had a symptom since losing weight. Opening pressures and scans show no evidence of it. The headaches I am having now are significantly worse than that was. It hurts down my neck as well.  The headaches began approximately 18 hours after the second dose. I was nauseated. I had chills. I had a temperature. My joints ached. My muscles ached. My body ached I was seen at the hospital twice for the seemingly common and expected side effects. I received IV medication for nausea and plenty of fluids. The headache, however, did not let up. 60ish hours after the second dose and all other symptoms ceased. The headache, however, remained. It persists. The headaches get so intense sometimes that my body feels like it needs to jerk, or twitch. I honestly cannot explain this sensation. I feel like I have to really focus to keep my body from moving impulsively.  It is bothersome, but I am concerned with how long it is lasting, especially with reports of strokes following the vaccination.

                                                About 5 hours after my shot, I started to have a horrible headache.  As the evening progressed, my arm was extremely sore and a little red around the injection site.  Over the next couple of days I continued to have a headache and also ended up having nausea, muscle soreness, some food started tasting not right (I did not lose taste or smell), cough, &amp; horrible fatigue.   I went to Urgent Care on 1/17/21 due to feeling so poorly and had to miss work that evening.  While at Urgent Care, the doctor provided me with cough medication that also had something in it to help with nausea.  They also said that they would be doing a COVID test since I was having some symptoms and even though it was probably from the shot, they wanted to test anyway.  The test finally came back as negative.  A week after the shot was done, my arm turned horribly red and swollen around the injection site.  Over a few days, the spot on my arm grew a little bit but was just more so irritating that it was itching/hurting.  By week #2 after having the injection, the redness in my arm as well as all of the symptoms, minus the fatigue, went away totally.

                                                On the afternoon of the 24th of March, after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced chills but no discernible fever.  That evening I experienced night sweats.  Early on the morning of the 25th of March I experienced aches and pains -- largely in my joints -- common in previously experienced flu symptoms.  Later on March 25th, I experienced severe skin sensitivity -- air from the air conditioner felt painful against my skin.  I also saw the beginnings of a rash on my left arm at the injection site.  By the morning of the 27th of March, though other symptoms had largely faded, I noted something like a welt/weal or extremely large hive on my left arm, the diameter of which is several inches all the way around, that is very red, very swollen, warm to the touch, and very painful.  I also cannot move my arm at all without pain.

Also had mild pain on ball of RT foot, thought I had stepped on something. 1:30pm woke up with severe edema of bottom lip, rash also on scalp next to ears 3pm seen at urgent care, received and filled prednisone prescription  4pm lip edema started improving, so did not end up taking the prednisone 8pm lip edema gone, erythema and mild edema to DIP joint and tips of fingers, all fingers of LT hand and RT pinky. All hand joints and wrists sore. Soreness to toes and heels while walking but not at rest. Applied ice to fingers, then turned up heat. 1/1 3-4am finger edema/erythema totally resolved 8am foot pain starts resolving 5pm still with mild wrist pain, mild foot pain. Rash evolving -- most lesions improved but some have coalesced, new lesions on neck  Never any fever, checked x2, Tmax 99.0F. Did not end up taking any medications since my symptoms seemed to be resolving. Only other possible recent exposures were a new lotion tried 12/27 (but only applied to face, was careful to keep it away from my lips, and I did not have any rash on my face except the swollen lip) and a new dress that I did not pre-wash (but I had few lesions on my arms which would have also been exposed).

On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

                                                First day, shooting pain up the back of the arm. Next day noticed a firm lump 2&#34; from injection site, tricep area with redness and swelling, tenderness and pain all at inj. site. Marked for size and by 12/26 the lump, redness, swelling had increased in size.  Tylenol with no relief, applied heat to lump made it worse. Took Benadryl x 3 doses and symptoms are much improved.  Headache on 12/25-12/26, Fatigue x 3 days, muscle pain in shoulders/neck.

                                                At the time of the injection I had some tingling in my arm. I had arm neck and shoulder soreness as well which continued for a few days. A couple of hours after the injection I began itching all over. I deduced that it could be an allergic reaction so I took an antihistamine and relaxed.I did not check for hives as I don&#39;t know much about allergic reactions. the Itching went away. On day 8 I had the itching again accompanied by hives.  Once again I took an antihistamine and improved. On day 11 I had itching again and took an antihistamine. The antihistamine did not work as well this time. It is day 12 as I write this.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

The way I move my arm or hand causes pain of my armpit as well.

A general feeling of lethargy became progressively worse throughout the day. from morning to noon i felt off but thought i was just psyching myself out. My noon I realized i was experiencing side effects. Around 2pm i began to experience mild chills. While cooking dinner at around 5pm I felt like my muscle aches in my back were on the threshold of feeling likes spasms. around 8-9pm before going to bed the symptoms were at there worst and comparable to a moderate illness. By the next morning I felt about 80% better but got headaches between my eyes whenever i stood up or moved too fast. As of today I feel about 95% better but still somewhat lethargic.

By late afternoon I started feeling extreme muscle weakness in my whole body and had the chills. I took a hot bath to try to ease the pain and chill. After the bath I crawled into bed and experienced extreme fever, chills, and weakness through the night.   The next day I continued to suffer from extreme fatigue. Now it is evening of the day after the vaccine and I only feel a little weak.

                                                Beginning on Thursday, I had pain under my left arm, likely in lymph node. By Friday, I had pain under my right arm as well. On Saturday morning, I had a large red oval-shaped spot on my arm, starting about half an inch under the injection site. It was hot to the touch and the skin felt harder than the surrounding skin. It was not itchy or painful, but did cause some minor discomfort if I raised my arm high. Today, the color has faded to pink, but it is still a similar size.

I don&#39;t think they have gotten any bigger or smaller, but they are not quite as tender.

Then about 5 minutes after leaving, I felt weak as if I was about to faint. Once I got to Peds, I felt even more weak. I could barely sit up. Nurse advised me to go back. Once I got there I was still feeling weak. I was sent home. The rest of the evening I was still feeling weak and as if I was about to get a headache, The next day (1/8), I felt muscle aches and tiredness. It hurt to even walk. As well my arm where I received the vaccine was sore and hurt to move.

                                                Moderate pain at the injection site lasted ~36 hours after shot. Six days after vaccine was given, I experienced an enlarged lymph node on the left side base of my neck. The lymph node was about the size of a dime, firm, and tender to the touch. Minimal armpit pain was experienced (similar to an ingrown hair), except there wasn&#39;t an ingrown hair. On the 7th day, about  15 hours after noticing the enlarged lymph node, swelling and tenderness has reduced, but has not disappeared completely.

                                                Within 10 min of the vaccine,  I was very itchy at the injection site. I had typical muscle soreness and fatigue later that day, but continued to be itchy and developed a rad circular rash at the site within a couple of hours. I thought it was just a site reaction. Upon awakening the following day (1/7/21), the rash had formed a hive at the injection site. Being a nurse, I had my physician coworkers examine it. They confirmed a hive and recommended antihistamine. I took a Zyrtec, but the hive only increased in size, redness, itchiness. The area remained there through Saturday (1/9). No redness, only some itchiness to report. Then, Wednesday evening (1/13), I noticed my left arm was increasing itchy. Resisting the urge to scratch, I went to take a shower. While changing, I found the hive had returned, bigger in size and more red. I took Benadryl. Getting checked by my coworker physicians the following morning,  they confirmed  it was a hive. The redness, swelling, and itching increased throughout the day and lasted for 3 days. I took Benadryl around the clock until my skin color returned to normal (1/17)..

At 9 hours post vaccination, also developed nausea, muscle/joint aches, fever, chills, and severe headache. Tmax was 102 F, but averaged at 100 F for at least 24 hours (11 PM 1/20/21 - 11 PM 1/21/21); cannot gauge what occurred after 11 PM on 11/21/21 due to sleep. However, right arm nerve pain continues now on to day 3 (1/22/21) with also the development of small wart-like bumps on left ring finger. Tmax today is 99.8 F accompanied by mild chills, nausea and abdominal pain.

                                                Pt had typical first 48 hour side effects. Day 8 post injection pt began to have latent side effects including; itchiness at injection site and beyond, redness with heat, swelling at injection site with spreading for 36 hours, headache with no relief after PO OTC&#39;s, fatigue, muscle ache not relieved with OTC anti- inflammatory.  Pt reports to staff started on day eight with itchiness and redness in one area, a couple of hours later noticed a second reddened area then lumps by the end of the day. Documentation reported by pt to have swelling at site and near site to be more than a golf ball size below injection site (vs at injection site). Pt reported having latent side effects begin on day eight and continue past day 13 (the time of this report). Pt reports not being able to keep up with housework, children, job duties and school work due to side effects. Pt relied on older daughter (under age 13), and parents to assist so that pt did not miss work.

Next day it was on/off pain, with very intense pain when it came on to the point that I was unable to lift or do things. On Sunday (next day), pain seemed to radiate from the shoulder up through my left neck to the cranium area. Monday (today) this evening - pain so intense that I was screaming and sobbing. Husband (also MD) had to medicate me as I was laying on bed screaming unable to move or roll over. He had to manually lift me.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine waiting my 15 minutes it felt tingling and burning sensation from my shoulder across my clavicle bone towards my heart. First 5 day (Tuesday-Sunday) symptoms: swollen, sore, red, &amp; bruised arm at injection spot; body aches, joint  pain of knees, fatigue, no energy, loss of appetite, dry mouth, headache, chills, nausea.  I felt better on the 6th day (Sunday), the injection site looked like it was healing and going back to normal on my shoulder. Then on 7th day (Monday) my injection spot started to itch and break out in a huge hive and little hives around it.  It turned into a bright red circle around the injection spot.  It was hot to touch and very swollen. On 8th to current day (11th) my arm keeps getting worse with the swelling, hotness, itching, &amp; redness, and spreading down my arm.

I had to take the day off work and slept most of the day.  I also had terrible muscular pain at the sight of the injection (L deltoid).  Tylenol helped with the arm pain. I had absolutely no side effects with the first dose.

                                                Starting four hours after the vaccination I became fatigued and this lasted through the next day. I started getting headaches the day after the vaccine and took ibuprofen once to treat those. On 1/27, I developed a swollen, red lump about 2-3 inches in diameter around the injection site. My whole right arm was swollen and tingly and the red lump was itchy, uncomfortable to touch, and hot. On 1/27, I also got severe headaches and muscle pain in my neck, right shoulder, and back. I visited a nurse practitioner who thought this to be an skin infection developed from the introduction of bacteria in some way during the vaccine, and she prescribed cephalexin to treat it. After two days of taking the antibiotic, the redness and swelling subsided, along with the other symptoms. Now I am reading that other had similar delayed hypersensitivities in response to this vaccine and believe this was actually a reaction to the vaccine and not an infection.

                                                About 12 hours after the injection, severe myalgias began affecting the back, hands, and knees primarily. Associated symptoms included headache, intermittent nausea, loss of appetite, fever (up to 102F), rigors, and severe malaise. I began taking Advil 400mg Q6H in order to bring down the fever and help with the severe myalgia. The fever and other symptoms were severe for approximately 26 hours. After 26 hours, the fever subsided and myalgia only remained in the lower back. Throughout this course, there was also severe left deltoid soreness and pain. Approximately 30 hours after vaccine administration, a swollen erythematous rash appeared on the left arm. It continued to  enlarge and was warm to the touch. This rash started to migrate down the deltoid and over the bicep and was fully gone about 4-5 days after vaccine administration.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  At approximately 9:00pm on the day of my second dose I experienced some dizziness. At approximately 12:30 at night, I woke up due to the pain I was feeling all over my body (in particular in my joints and lower back). I also have a severe headache. At approximately 2:30am I experienced nausea and some vomiting followed by chills without fever. The headache, body aches, and extreme exhaustion continued until approximately 9pm the day after the shot. Two days later, almost all symptoms were gone (I still felt tired). I had a small red spot at the injection site that lasted 2 days but the injection site pain was way worse for the first shot than the second one.

The next day, at around 9:30am, the muscle aches started and I noticed a rash on my stomach. Around 3pm, I started to feel worse. I took a nap and woke up around 6pm soaked in sweat, with muscle aches, and a fever of 99. My fever never got above 100.8. The body aches were the worst part. It was extremely difficult to get comfortable. I did take Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it didn?t seem to help the body aches. It did however help keep the fever at bay.  I went to sleep that evening at 11:00pm. I woke up in the middle of the night around 2am, and all symptoms have resolved except for feeling extremely hot. The rash has gotten better but has not fully resolved.

Broke out in a cold sweat. Started to loose consciousness. Arms (middle-upper) to my hands began to tingle and went numb. I lost muscle control in both of my hands and my fingers were very stiff, I could not move them. My feet and lower legs were also tingly. I felt nauseous and in need of the toilet. I was able to crawl to the bathroom at which point I had diarrhea. I regained feeling and motor control of my hands shortly after but continued to experience extreme light headed ness for the next hour.

Next day the injection site was swollen and I had mobility problems. I had a fever but it didn?t linger and a cough that lasted for 2 days. On Thursday 02/04/2021, I felt pain in my armpits and neck. The next day it was completely swollen. I went to the ER on 02/06/2021 and the gave me Motrin and an IV to help with the inflammation. Today is 02/08/2021 and my lymph nodes on my neck and armpit on my left side are still swollen and painful to the touch and I?m having problems moving my neck.

I was concerned since I&#39;m pregnant that it might have to do with the pregnancy. By 2:00 pain had progressively worsened and I didn&#39;t have much of a appetite that day. Around 3:30, I started developing intense nausea - and vomited 3:45 pretty violently. I contacted the OB - and she thought I should come in to be monitored. Hospital is where I went and I got there and they monitored to see how baby was doing; did a urine test - found protein and ketones in there. Drew labs - lipase was significantly elevated - 324. 156 were where my Triglycerides were at- a bit out of range. They dx&#39;d me with Pancreatitis - idopathic since they couldn&#39;t determine cause. They admitted me to Hospital from 9th - 16th. While I was in the hospital they did further lab work. I was showing malnourished - after a clear liquids only for two days. I asked to be discharged by 16th. On the 29th, the day I took the vaccine - I had a glucose tolerance test after the vaccine (about 08:30 AM is when I started the glucose monitoring test) - they diagnosed me with gestational diabetes with that two days after vaccine on December 31st. Expected due date - April 20, 2021; low PAP A hormone; 1st pregnancy

                                                Saturday evening, started having sharp pins and needles sensation in joints (knees, hips, elbows and shoulders). I couldn?t fall asleep that morning I woke up vomiting. Had a fever of 101.1F. Had a fever all Sunday, got as high as 103.3F.  Had large red rash on the arm of the injection site that is hot to the touch, hard, itchy, and feels like a sunburn when you touch it (burns).  Had really stiff and sore neck and shoulders, hard to move head from side to side. Headache all day Sunday. Couldn?t sleep Sunday night because of pins and needles in joints again. Got up at around 6am vomiting. Fever of 100.1F. Temp lowered to 99.1 by 7:30pm. Tuesday, no headache or vomiting. Slept through the night without any pins and needles pain. No fever, but really stiff and sore neck and shoulders still. Red spot of arm has grown.

Woke up at 0300 with nausea and a fever of 100.9. Also had a mild cough, SOB, fatigue, and low appetite.  I called out of work that morning due to illness. I was instructed to get a COVID test that day. Results were negative. All symptoms resolved the following day with the exception of malaise which lasted until 2/5/21.

                                                8 days after vaccine I developed a delayed allergic reaction to the vaccine. My arm had stopped hurting days before, but I woke up Friday 2/5 morning and it was slightly sore again. By Friday evening, I had noticed that I was really tired and starting to get sore/fatigued, which is a common symptom of fevers for me. I also noticed that my vaccine arm was several degrees warmer than the rest of my body. I went to bed around 9:30 pm that evening and woke up around 12:00am with diarrhea and vomiting (1x). My whole body was sore at this point and it hurt to move (again, a common fever symptom with me, but it hurt to get up and actually find my thermometer to check). I woke up Saturday morning with a rash on my vaccine arm (several quarter sized red blotches), no itching or soreness at this point but at this point my body had no fever, but my arm was around 99-100 Fahrenheit for several days. By Sunday evening, my arm was still hot but started to get sore (like a sunburn) and itchy. The rash had grown in size so that my upper arm above the shoulder was red about 5 x 5 inches. The itching/ soreness continued to grow in size by about an inch before I went to the doctor on Tuesday afternoon. She prescribed me prednisone and it started working about about 3 hours (large spot of redness gone) and by next morning only a slight discoloration remained.

Acute pain and numbness has worn off, but there is still moderate pain when using the arm. About a week post-dose, began spotting.

Bleeding has increased daily, and is now fairly heavy. Accompanied by cramps.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

Took stomach meds (pepto bismol) with no effect.  Went to sleep and woke up in the middle of night with stabbing pain in my stomach. used a heating pad to help me go back to sleep.  the 2nd day my stomach felt as if it was a balloon- extremely bloated and it hurt to breath deep, and stand straight. Took pepto, gas x, and also tried tums- nothing helped.  Today is day 3, and I am back to feeling normal aside from still being very tired, and hazy.  No more stomach issues.  Called doctor to see what I should do today, and was advised to not take the second dose.  Would like a second opinion.

I?ve been using heat, ice, sleep, and my migraine medication to try to get rid of it.  My body has been achy all over today for the last 9 hours.  My neck and arm have ached since I got the injection at 6:00 PM last night, so for 21.5 hours.  I was nauseous when I woke up this morning, but that went away after 4 hours.

The severe headaches felt like the worst migraine /tension headache ever-it was hard to lift my head. Chills, fatigue, headaches and body aches persisted from 3/13/21 until 3/15/21. My symptoms have improved today, 3/15/21, but I still have a slight headache and fatigue.

Was somewhat concerned with how severe symptoms were after 1st vaccination. Within 24hrs of 2nd vaccination developed 100.6 - 103.0 degree fever that lasted throughout the day and did not decrease after multiple administrations of Tylenol and Ibuprofen. Associated nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, joint pain and fatigue during this time. After 48hrs from 2nd dose noticed moderately enlarged lymph nodes on the left side of neck and left axillary region and left breast that are still ongoing to date. Besides the enlarged lymph nodes and fatigue all other symptoms have resolved. Concerned about duration and sight of enlarged lymph nodes as there is a family hx of breast cancer.

                                                The following morning after I received my 2nd Moderna vaccine, I was awoken by my symptoms around 3:30am. My arm became so swollen and painful, I could not extend my arm at all.  I could only keep it bent and close to my body. I could not use my left arm at all for 2-3 days after the vaccine. The swelling got so bad that my entire arm felt numb and tingley and throbbed uncontrollably whenever I tried to move it.  I took ibuprofen and tylenol, every 6-7 hours as well as used warm and cold compresses, and that did nothing to help the swelling. The pain medications only took a slight edge off of the pain. I experienced these symptoms along with fever, body aches, muscle pain, joint pain, muscle spasms in my arm and leg muscles,  headache, and my nose was very runny after waking up in the morning.  All of those symptoms lasted for several days as well.  The numbness and pain lasted for a full week after the vaccine. It is now March 26th and my arm is still a bit sore at the vaccine site.  On Wednesday, March 24th, the vaccine site starting throbbing again and I did experience a low grade fever of 99.7 throughout the day. I felt very fatigued throughout the week as well.

                                                Presumed right arm muscle injury.  Several hours after the injection my arm was extremely sore and painful. The joint was painful as well. No redness or swelling. It was tender to touch. I was having difficulty reaching my arm up or moving it upward. Ex: it hurt to lift my hand to touch my face.  I also couldn?t let it fall. If I got my arm above my head I would have to assist it down. I couldn?t sleep that night because of the pain. I was having trouble with pushing movements in that arm. And also letting it hang dependently (like letting my arm hang when I hinged forward). I started taking Motrin 24 hours after the injection. Motrin helped, so I took it Friday and Saturday. Sunday, my arm felt 99% back to normal.  Monday and Tuesday I didn?t notice anything.   Wednesday  morning I woke up with the same pain again and difficulty moving my arm. Wednesday night, I couldn?t sleep again because of the pain/couldn?t get my arm in a comfortable position. I?m taking Motrin, with not as much relief as before. I?ve applied heat and I?ve tried to stretch it as well.   The only way i really know how to describe it? is that it feels as if my deltoid was injured. And my other muscles are fine. It?s hindering my movement in that arm. It is again, tender to touch my deltoid area. The tightness has extended in to my shoulder and neck. It has now been 8 days since my vaccination.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

The next morning the entire vaccination area was red, hot to the touch, swollen, and aching, and the redness had developed into an 11x7 cm area. The area continued to expand and later developed hives on chest, hips, legs in addition to joint pain (hips, left arm shoulder to wrist) and severe chills.

                                                for 5 minutes after injection, i felt slightly light headed and nauseous but that went away after 5ish minutes. Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

                                                Patient developed angioedema of the lips and face approximately 24-30 hours after vaccine dose was provided.  Of particular note, she reported prior dermal filler injections to the lips (Juvederm) approximately 1 year prior to vaccination (I am aware of other case reports and felt this was necessary to report an additional event).  The angioedema lasted approximately 3-4 days and was also accompanied by expected flu-like symptoms, fatigue, fever, and back aches.  There was NO immediate IgE mediated reaction.

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

On 1/20/2021 I noticed the site of injection is red, swollen, and a little hard, however, it is not painful at all.  The redness, swelling, and hardness didn&#39;t appear until the 20th of Jan, it was fine before then. I have been getting major headaches every day since I got the vaccine.

                                                Experienced severe redness about 2.5-3? in diameter around vaccination administration site Area was very swollen, warm to the touch, tough, and incredibly painful which caused me to have difficulty moving my arm/using my arm in general and limited my normal daily activities for 4 total days. Pain, swelling, redness, and toughness began to dissipate around Day 5 and was markedly improved by Day 8 when I completely returned to normal activities.  Additionally, the first day after the vaccination, I experienced muscle aches/pains and severe generalized fatigue that almost made me call out from work. This fatigue and muscle pain was very strong for ~72 hours after the vaccination. However, I was still able to go to work, though my productivity was not the same given the amount of fatigue I experienced and the inability to utilize my right arm to the same degree I would during a normal work day.

No relief with Excedrin. Fever broke 1/28 around 7AM All day today (1/28) I have alternated between chills and sweating. Aches are now mostly in my upper left back and hips/thighs. I have a large rash covering my left deltoid, where I received the injection.

Shoulder pain continued through to the day after vaccination (day 1) - had to take tylenol around the clock. By day 2 it was normal. On Day 0, around 8-10 hours post vaccination, I had rigors which lasted a few mins, chills, fevers, myalgias. Took tylenol. On day 1, about 17 hours from vaccination, I woke up with lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea. Felt like I was going to pass out. Laid down, and it passed. Continued with myalgias, fevers, chills, fatigue on day 1. By day 2, I felt normal. I took tylenol day 0 and day 1.

Of note, the covid-19 vaccine made me sick (chills, myalgia, fever).

                                                Almost 12 hours after receiving the injection I woke up from sleep with chills and a fever. This didn&#39;t last long - maybe a couple hours. I fell asleep without an issue and woke up in the morning with SEVERE arm pain as well as fatigue and like generalized weakness - I essentially felt like I was getting sick with a cold or something. This lasted a couple days but the arm pain was terrible. It felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to my upper arm - I had very limited range of motion and felt severe pain in the region of my joint capsule. This eventually went away, but I still feel like my arm is a little stiffer than it was previously - it cracks and pops when I do yoga and such and it never did this before.

It itched a little but it wasn?t particularly painful. My arm felt a little swollen &amp; tender but I kept second guessing that because I was just so surprised. I didnt put anything on it and it didn?t prevent me from doing any daily activities so I didn?t contact my PCP about it. Eventually it wasn?t there or faded and it?s been 2 weeks since my first dose as of today (2/8/21).

                                                I had shot on 29th - I had sore arm for two days after that. Morning of 6th, I woke up with really sore arm - worse than before and a couple of red dots that looked like hives and throughout the day my arm became more sore, redness increased and there was swelling. Next morning, the redness had taken over the whole upper arm and it was more swollen (the whole upper arm and it was painful). It worsened through the day. I was advised to see someone in walk-in at the hospital later that day - diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed cephalexin - an antibiotic. I took it right away. A few minutes after (at about the same time as I took the antibiotic) that I got a few hives and got more as the night went on. I woke up later that day after I had taken an antibiotic. I had chills, body aches, burning in my joints and I broke out in hives. The next day the hives were gone - still had the redness, swelling and body aches, chills. The next day, everything except the redness, swelling and pain were gone. By the 11th and 12th - swelling reduced and the redness went away soon after that. I completed my dose of antibiotic - I was told it was probably not cellulitis but more likely a reaction from vaccine.

                                                After receiving the second vaccination dose of the COVID19 Moderna shot, I experience soreness in my left arm around the injection site. Within 6 hours I had chills, achy and sore muscles, and mild sinus congestion which lasted on and off for about 24 hours once the symptoms began. About two days later I noticed that the around where the vaccine was injected was raised, warm to the touch, and painful, as well as a little itchy. After doing some online reading, it seems like I have the &#34;covid arm&#34; that is being talked about.

I also experienced cognitive function issues - memory gaps, brain fog, and could not walk a straight line. Those went away after the first week or so. I also had headache, body aches, fever, chills, dehydration, joint pain, and severe fatigue. This affected my daily life for about a week and half.

                                                Patient developed near immediate flushing, itching, and discomfort in her face and neck. Her heart rate sped up (&gt;120) and her blood pressure was elevated (&gt;140). Her oxygen saturation level was normal. She was observed at the vaccination waiting area for 30 minutes, but ultimately moved to the urgent care for additional monitoring and management. After 15 minutes there she was given a dose of epinephrine. She reported relief from her clinical symptoms including abatement of the  flushing, itching, and anxiety. She will take Benadryl at home and consider her Epipen if needed. She will follow-up with me on the increased blood pressure and heart rate

I couldn?t eat because eating made me feel nauseated. All I could do was drink water. This continued into the next day (Sunday). I slept almost the entire day. I had to call out of work on Monday due to severe exhaustion.

                                                Developed hives on opposite arm shortly after shot (but idiopathic hives are normal for me and it was the wrong arm so I thought nothing of it). Full body aches, especially in legs, from about 6:30pm on 3/13 to midnight of 3/14. Location of shot was warm to the touch, sore, and slightly swollen. Temp was 98.6 F.  After midnight the aches became centered on my legs and became more severe coming in waves every few seconds. Tachycardia. Muscle weakness. Nausea. Teeth began to hurt (from clenching?). Severe dizziness and vertigo starting from 7pm on 3/13 and peaking around midnight. Migraine with visual disturbances beginning at 7pm on 3/13 peaking at about 9pm and lasting at least several hours. Vertigo and migraine seemed related. Former worsened every time the pressure in my head did. Looked like the room lit up briefly every few seconds. My sense of touch felt off - textures felt different than normal and couldn?t feel my back when I touched it. Leg pain began to lessen around 4am, and fully resolved around 7am. Dizziness began to improve around 6am but persisted, albeit to a milder degree, for most of 3/14. Brain fog and sinus pressure from around 7pm 3/13 persisting through the following day. Some nausea throughout 3/14 but less severe than on 3/13. Poor temperature regulation from about 6pm 3/13 to 3pm 3/14. Symptoms became tolerable around 3:30pm on 3/14 and had mostly resolved by evening. Muscle weakness resolved by evening of 3/15. Pressure headache resolved by late morning 3/16.

                                                Yesterday (March 21) I felt a soreness above my right clavicle and palpated to discover a small hard pea sized lump. It is movable, not adhered, sore to touch, but not red.  I have been told in the past that due to my Grave&#39;s Disease (diagnosed at age 14) that I have an abundance of extra lymph nodes in my neck, axilla, breast tissue. (I get yearly thyroid ultrasounds). Am wondering if this is an enlarged lymph node due to immune response post vaccine. Ipsilateral to vaccine injection site.

Got 2nd shot and rash came back as well as hives all over my body and now I&#39;ve have hives and rashes for a few weeks. Prior to being vaccinated I was not prone to rashes and I had never in my life had hives for any reason. I contacted my dermatologist and she said it is possible the hives and rash could be related to the COVID-19 Vaccine, as I had a strong reaction (I had fever, muscle aches, chills, fatigue, headache, plus large rash and tenderness around the injection site for 2 days after the 2nd shot) and I don&#39;t have a history of rashes, allergies, or hives. My co-worker suggested I fill out this form and report it. So I am.

                                                About 3-4 hours after receiving my second dose of vaccine on 1/30/21, I began to experience side effects including headache, myalgias, and fatigue (which I had also experienced with the first dose of vaccine). I had no nausea or vomiting until around 8-9 pm on 1/31/21. At that time I began to have severe nausea and had 1-2 episodes of emesis before falling asleep. I woke up around 3 am and had another episode of emesis. This continued every 15-30 minutes. I was unable to keep any fluids down as a result. After a couple of hours of this I became lightheaded and began to experience abdominal pain after repeated retching. Sometime between 6 am and 7 am I called 911 and was connected to nursing line. I was advised to go to the emergency department. After vomiting another 2 times I called 911 again and asked for an ambulance to be sent. I vomited again in the ambulance before arrival. Once in the ED I was examined, found to be tachycardic, and started on 1L of IV fluids. I was informed lab tests were being drawn, including pregnancy test, urinalysis, CBC, CMP, and toxicology screen. I was given one dose of Zofran IV. Nausea began to subside, and I was able drink fluids without nausea or vomiting. I was informed that lab tests were unremarkable. Another 1L of IV fluids had been started, but I was disconnected after maintaining PO intake and eventually discharged around 12 pm.

                                                Around 10 am (2hrs post vaccination) I noticed some hives on my hands and dizziness. I also developed a mouth sore that later went away around 5pm. I drank 1.5 L of water and put some topical Benadryl cream on the hives, these symptoms resolved. At 8pm I began to get a temperature (temp max 101.2 around 11:17pm), a very sore swollen arm, massive headache, and myalgia/arthralgia in knees bilaterally. On 1/5 temperature has subsided to low grade (99.2F) but I still don?t feel well and have no sense of smell with a runny nose.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had soreness and mild fatigue. The soreness and stiffness was greatest in the arm of injection, and was less intense but present in my upper back and neck. This soreness and stiffness lasted the whole day after the vaccine but was becoming milder, until day 2 after the vaccine when it had completely resolved. No medications were required.  Day 1 after vaccine I also had a bright red, flat, rash that appeared as very close small circles near the injection site (where the bandage was placed) but not on the actual vaccine site. No itching, spreading of rash, or other symptoms. This resolved day 2. I have no known allergies to bandages at this time. No medications were required.

                                                Got the 1st dose of Covid vaccine on 1/8/21.  Left arm was sore  and have a swollen lump but it is a common reaction.  Left arm stop hurting after 1 day but the lump is still there.  On 1/12/21,  I start noticing my underarm starting to hurt.  I thought I pulled a muscle or maybe a swollen lymph node. Did a self examination no swollen lymph so I thought it was a pull muscle. Been taking Advil twice a day but now it is the 1/14/21 underarm still hurt and the lump on the left arm is still there and slightly swollen now. Still taking Advil twice a day due to left underarm pain.

I advised the nurse and they hooked me up to a monitor for my heart rate and O2 levels. My O2 was fine, however my heart increased to about 192 bpm at resting. After a couple minutes it slowed down to a resting rate of 130 This continued for 20 minutes until I took my beta blocker atenolol. After that it would only increase to 150 bpm during an episode and resting rate was 100-115bpm. I had a headache and was a little light headed.

                                                First I felt a soreness in my right arm, which spread to my neck and down my arm in the next few hours after the vaccine. Later that evening (around 7pm) I became sore and achy in my muscles and joints all over my body. I also alternated between feeling feverish and having chills.  My temperature was 99.8F. The next day I awoke with all the same symptoms and also a severe headache. My temperature that morning was 100.9F. I felt so tired and fatigued that I couldn&#39;t move my body or stay awake for too long. I stayed in bed all day and didn&#39;t have much of an appetite. I took NSAIDS and Acetaminophen to reduce the headache pain and control the fever. The following day (today) I woke up with fewer symptoms. I still had a severe headache, was overly tired,  and had a mild fever (99.8F). I remained in bed most of the day (napping), and have had a slightly improved appetite. I took Aleve this morning for the headache, but haven&#39;t needed it since (at 8:30pm). It seems that the side effects are subsiding. My right arm is still tender surrounding the injection site and I still have a faint headache, but it is now tolerable.

No previous rash noted after receiving the vaccine, then suddenly it developed today (day 9 post-dose). I had mild symptoms - fatigue, injection site pain, arm and armpit discomfort for several days following the vaccine but this resolved after a few days.  No other symptoms currently, other than the new rash.

                                                A few days after my first shot I noticed that the armpit on the side where I got the shot was sore.  The soreness persisted for over a week and only subsided yesterday or the day before.  A week after the shot, I noticed a blotchy, raised rash at the injection site.  By the next day the rash had grown to be almost the size of my palm and was uniformly red and raised.  The rash was not itchy.  I would say it was SLIGHTLY tender.  At first I thought it was herpes but by the second day I could see that it was not and also I had never had an outbreak in that location.  As of today the rash is almost entirely gone.  It is still observable but you probably wouldn&#39;t see it if you weren&#39;t looking for it.  It is still a tiny bit tender.  I had no other concomitant symptoms. When I first noticed the rash I called an Urgent Care and spoke with the doctor who said that I should monitor it and come in if I had trouble breathing.

                                                I experienced mild soreness the evening of the shot and the following day, which resolved by 1/14. Mild fatigue was persistent since Tuesday 1/12. I started experiencing mild swelling and tenderness in my L armpit/breast, with mild pain during movement and compression. Yesterday (1/18), the injection site became slightly raised, blotchy, and very itchy. I woke up this morning feeling like I had a cold, with joint soreness and a mild itchy rash around my ankles, in addition to fatigue and warmth/itchiness around the injection site

                                                Initially after vaccine within an hour I felt fatigue(drained within 1 hour of receiving vaccine). Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine I was having fever, chills, body aches, nausea, and vomiting, and diarrhea and dizziness and weakness and heart palpitations(probably related to dehydration). Symptoms remained for 3 days. Unable to hold down anything. Felt like I had covid all over again just without the respiratory issues and loss of taste and smell. Arm was very sore almost like a deep bone bruise. Brain fog developed again like after initially recovering from covid as did the fatigue. Still having lingering fatigue and now carpal tunnel like symptoms in both hands, slight weakness and numbness at times in right upper arm where vaccine was given. Reported event to Pharmacist to administered the vaccine and the CDC.

Continued though out night. Sunday - same symptoms but less painful (rate it around a 9/10) - went to store to get groceries with husband around 8:30pm and almost passed out, super weak and felt like puking - not sure if it was just the mask making it hard to breathe. Monday - woke drenched in sweat but not as bad as over the weekend, still achy but not as bad, headache, arm is still super sore and enlarged, hot to touch, fatigue, malaise - but able to go to work (pain down to 6/10, so definitely better than before)

Patient is a nurse.  She received her 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the day prior to arriving in the emergency department.  This morning she did feel some mild body aches but otherwise was feeling fine.  Starting later today after her shift at work she developed severe body aches bilateral upper shoulders and down her spine, she also reports some shortness of breath, dizziness.  She felt unsafe to drive home feeling like this.  She had taken some Advil earlier in the day around 10:00.  She denies any fever, nausea or vomiting.  No history of severe vaccine reaction or anaphylaxis.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to Enbrel prior.  She denies any throat swelling, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain.    patient is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive.  Likely due to pain.  Patient is experiencing adverse reaction to the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed with her she is having an immune response to the vaccine.  She does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis which could contribute to the elevated immune response as well.  The patient is given 30 mg of IM Toradol for body aches here in the emergency department.  She is instructed to call PCP for close follow-up, rest, drink plenty of fluids.  She has no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis at this point.

                                                Started feeling a lump forming under my right armpit. At first it wasn&#39;t hurting that much I just felt it was normal of the swelling and soreness, but then I started feeling more pain at night time when I tried to sleep. On Monday the 25th woke up feeling more pain bigger then a pea on my right armpit had a fever of 100.1 in the morning. I went to the doc around the same day in the afternoon. The doc said it was an infection and inflamed from the vaccine I recently got on Friday.

                                                There was very little pain until before bed the day I received the vaccine. At that time, I started feeling tenderness in the shoulder where I received the shot. The next day (today) the pain, inflammation, and swelling started moving down from my shoulder through to my fingers. I was barely able to get my wedding ring off because of the swelling. The tenderness now goes note my whole arm, under my arm pit, down my shoulder blade, and even my left breast. I have taken Benadryl for the swelling and tried to get it elevated, and I have taken ibuprofen for the body aches that I?ve had today as well.

I had a headache. A couple hours after vaccine I was told I was exposed to COVID. Got tested on 31st - I tested positive for COVID. Got shortness of breath, the bad muscle ache, the loss of smell and taste; coughing, sore throat, headache; fever. I still have headaches and I still have some congestion sometimes. It is getting better but my sense of smell and taste aren&#39;t back. Fever, shortness of breath, cough etc lasted 10 days. I was out of work for two weeks. Called the doctor  (January 4th, 2021)- for Oxygen levels - were dropping - they were in the high 80&#39;s - the doctor let me stay home and monitor on my own as I have a nebulizer and inhaler at home.

On Friday I started my period a week early and it was unusually heavy (this hasn?t happened much since I was a teenager) on Saturday I was bleeding so heavily and had lightheadedness, near syncope, headache, nausea, weakness, fatigue and brain fog. Usually menstrual cycle is not as heavy and doesn?t come early and I don?t experience these types of symptoms (usually just bad cramps and back pain with less heavy bleeding).

I went to sleep, slept poorly. Took tylenol the following morning, at 8:15am. Fever reduced to 98.7°F, headache reduced, body aches reduced and I took a nap from about 1:00-3:30pm. 2/4/21 I returned to work with only a mildly sore arm at injection site.

                                                I started to develop a reaction the first evening after receiving the vaccine. My arm was incredibly sore, I had neurological slip ups-i could not think thoughts fully all the way through and my tongue swelled overnight and I woke up to me frantically rubbing my tongue on my back teeth, which is extremely abnormal for myself.  the first night back started aching (I have never felt this pain before now), Developed swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and in my neck and chin on my right side of my body, was extremely lethargic.  and this continued for 3 days when the lymph nodes started to go down, and then an outbreak happened inside the right side of my throat, which is still in place today, seems to be healing now, but continued to get worse for 3 days before starting to heal. I am finally back to a normal level of energy and my mind seems to be working normally again, but my back is still in incredible pain.

Symptoms improved after 24 hours (36 hours after shot given), but the following day, I had strong heart palpitations increasing in frequency and severity throughout the day.

This vaccine has caused the most pain of any vaccine injection I have ever received. Worse than tetanus. It is sore to the touch, swollen, with a small red spot, and even hurts to raise my arm.

                                                Patient stated that her adverse symptoms started 6 days after she got the first vaccine, on 29 January 2021. It began as swelling, and redness at the injection site. She stated she had hives that were itchy and raised on her left arm around the site, and on 30 January 2021 the hives spread down her arm. She also noted that the lymph node in her left axilla was swollen.  On 6-7 Feb 2021 patient stated that the rash has mostly resolved, but that she started having neck pain, on the sides of her neck, near her collar bone. This pain leads to a headache, which she has been taking Ibuprofen for. The Ibuprofen only helps with the headache pain, not the neck muscle pain. She also stated that since the 6 and 7 of Feb in the evening her chest begins to feel &#34;heavy, like something is sitting on it&#34;. Patient stated that she went to see her primary care provider at the end of January and was sent to an allergist, who did not believe it was an allergic reaction. She was not prescribed any medication.

I spoke to a medical professional and they informed me that there can be swelling of lymph nodes after the vaccine. Currently (02/11/21) I have no more pain, but the lymph nodes in my neck are still slightly swollen. I have no more pain in my armpit. This only occurred on my left side, which is where I received the vaccine. Additionally, sometime between 02/09/21 and 02/10/21 I started itching my left shoulder around the injection site. When I looked in the mirror there was a big (2-3inch) red circle around the injection. The edge of the circle was slightly puffy, and the whole thing is super itchy and stupid. No pain associated with it, just a lot of itching.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

I also had SOB, joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue and body aches, sore arm and redness at the injection site.

                                                Received the vaccine intramuscularly in right arm at 1:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and muscle soreness began approx. 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Fatigue and headache present by 3:00 PM on 3/3/21. Began hydrating with water and Gatorade at this time. Muscle pain and join soreness present from right shoulder to right hand by 4:00 PM on 3/3/21. Pain and stiffness in fingers of right hand by 5:00 PM on 3/3/21. Mild congestion, brain fog by 6:00 PM on 3/3/21. Any contact between right arm and other objects or surfaces caused significant pain by 8:00 PM on 3/3/21. Took 800 mg ibuprofin to alleviate pain (pre-existing tolerance to NSAIDs necessitates higher than normal dosages). Swelling of the right arm and hand identified by 9:00 PM on 3/3/21. Swelling was most significant in the hand, and accompanied worsening joint pain and stiffness in the fingers. Applied a cold pack to address swelling (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off). Could not identify these specific side effects in the information available online, took a Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Swelling decreased overnight and was gone by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21. Diarrhea began at 6:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Will continue to hydrate with water and Gatorade. At the time of this report, pain in right arm still present from shoulder to wrist and entire arm is tender to the touch, but pain level has lessened. Pain and stiffness in right side of neck present by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and is still present at the time of this report. Lymph nodes in right underarm swollen by 5:00 AM on 3/4/21 and swelling is still present at the time of this report. Will continue with regimen of ibuprofin as needed.  * I am recovering fine at home, but I wanted to log these side effects for data collection purposes. I couldn&#39;t find any information about these side effects online and that really freaked me out, so I hope that writing this report will help people in a similar situation.

Throughout the night I experienced chills followed by overheating/sweating.  The body aches and low-grade fever persisted until 3:00PM 8 Mar 2021. I treated myself with rest and ibuprofen and noticed improvements. As with the first short, injection site swelling and soreness was prevalent for a few days.

                                                I felt fine after the shot until about 7 pm when I started experience an intense, pressurized sensation in my head, jaw, chest, and arms. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ringing in my ears, and feeling flushed. Over night I felt some numbness in my hands and arms. The next day the feeling of  pressure and tightness was gone but the dizziness and nausea has remained. I have more energy but  am feeling concerned about the persistent vertigo.  I have a history of allergic reactions. I was also scheduled to begin my menstrual cycle this weekend and it has been delayed.

                                                Saturday 3/13 - Moderna shot @10am on L arm. Onset of sx @6pm. Fatigue, irritability, mild body aches   Sunday 3/14 - Upon waking Fatigue and severe body aches. Painful to walk, exert, lift a spoon. Required some assistance with activities of daily living. Nausea. Some improvement around 6pm.   Monday 3/15 - Upon waking Decreased fatigue, body aches resolved, nausea resolved. Soreness and fatigue in carpel tunnel area, feeling as though I had held a heavy phone for too long. Adjusted by keeping off phone during the day. Hand/wrist pain increased in the evening. Noted wrist and hand swelling @8pm. After applying ice around 10:30pm pain became suddenly severe with movement. Suspected ice was somehow a mistake and applied heat. Pain became excruciating. Took tylenol XS to sleep.   Tuesday 3/16 - Upon waking Moderate swelling and complete loss of mobility in both hands and wrists. Shooting pain that knocked the breath out of me. Unable to complete any activities of daily living independently (bathing, toileting, eating). Wore carpel tunnel braces all day. Some improvement in range of motion in the evening, able to open and rest hands semi-flat on an angled surface. R hand demonstrating faster improvement than L. Noted mild red bumps present on both wrists (more on L) and mild-moderate shooting pain from L thumb toward inner elbow, more severe in area closer to elbow. Upon rubbing the area close to elbow noted soreness and bumps under skin when applying mild pressure that aren&#39;t visible to the eye.   Wednesday 3/17 - Upon waking Red bumps resolved. Some improvement in all areas. L hand improvements mildly lagging behind the R. Able to complete activities of daily living with supportive assistance. Increased range of motion and moderate pain. More improvement @5pm. Regained 90% range of motion, shooting pains were mild-moderate.   Thursday 3/18 - Upon waking I have full range of motion. Mild-moderate pain with certain angled movements and levels of exertion. PCP telehealth appt @9am. Diagnosis: adverse reaction to moderna. Suspicion that there may be some connection with the complex migraine (though there was no numbness or tingling present) and to update my neurologist (you!). Recommendation was to report it and monitor sx. If sx not completely resolved in one week referral to othopedic.

                                                Between 45minutes to 1 hour following injection of the vaccine, I experienced a tightness in the jaw and an extremely fast heartbeat lasting roughly 10-15minutes. As I had left the vaccination facility and was on my way home I was prepared to inject an epipen sensing an anaphylaxis  reaction, however my heartbeat went back to normal at around the 15 minute mark. During these 10-15minutes, I felt that there were a couple of times where I might lose consciousness, but did not.   Prior to leaving the vaccination center, I placed an ice pack on the injection site for roughly 45 minutes, only removing for my drive home. There was no redness or apparent swelling at the injection site.

She sat on the floor another 10minutes or so, then moved to a chair where she was monitor approximately 15 more minutes.

Odd spikes of intense hunger, and mild cognitive impacts like forgetfulness, distractibility, and some confusion. Tired.

My 8 month old daughter then exhibited symptoms the  following Saturday, 03/20. I took her to urgent care to be tested. She tested positive as well. The following Wednesday, 03/24, I had Covid testing for exposure through my employer for day 12 of my husbands case and day 5 of my daughter&#39;s. I took my 3 year old son, both of us asymptomatic at the time, for an exposure test as well. We received positive results that evening. I started to get a headache, congestion, dizziness and some minor muscle pains in my right arm. My 3 year old is still asymptomatic.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I woke up with a horrific migraine, aches, muscle weakness, and dizziness. The following day, Wednesday, at 5:00 pm I began experiencing Vertigo symptoms that ultimately put me in the ER. after rotating between vomiting and diarrhea every 10 minutes. I was given Zofran 4 MG orally and Meclizine 25 MG to control vertigo. The vertigo was severe and I could not lay down at all and even closing my eyes or changing directions made me nearly fall. It was another 24 hours when vertigo ended and just occasional dizziness remains. Diarrhea lasted until Friday, March 26. I had a CT brain and head scan at 3/25/2021 at 8:42 AM to rule out stroke.

                                                8 days after the shot I had an episode of tingling and numbness bilaterally from my feet up to my thighs. I had difficulty walking, a lot of pain and a vibration sensation in my thighs with weakness. I was admitted to the hospital for 3 days and had abnormal neuro reflexes upon admission and severe brain fog, which I have never had before. MRIs and blood work were done in the hospital but they could not determine the cause and the hospital questioned it being from the COVID vaccination and has had me follow up further with specialists to see if there could be any other diagnostic causes. I have followed up with my PCP, 2 neurologists, a rheumatologist, allergist, dermatologist and will be seeing a hematologist.  (I now have joint pains, extreme fatigue, brain fog, peripheral neuropathy--none of which I had prior to the vaccination and thus far conditions outside of the vaccination have not been found. I also got a positive ANA after vaccination (I had negative in the past and my doctors are questioning if the covid vaccination triggered an autoimmune disorder now in me with the joint pain and swelling, fatigue, positive ANA, rashes and pain).  I have been out of work since February due to health impairments and am a healthcare provider myself.

                                                I am writing to you in regards my Moderna adverse reaction. I got your information from a small Facebook group that?s going through the same issues as me. On 1/31/21, I received my first shot of Moderna. I was told to stay 30min because I have a Sulfa allergy. I also received a flu shot 3 weeks prior. After 15 min I started to feel tingling in my face and throat tightness. As time passed, I started to feel like I couldn?t breathe at one point. As I continued to have issues breathing and started getting nauseous and lightheaded, they informed a nurse to look over me. The nurse had a student nurse do my vitals manually. She gives out standard numbers 60 heart rate and 120/80 blood pressure. My normal blood pressure is elevated in 130-140/80-90. I had to be picked up due to feeling unwell. I went home took Tylenol and slept.  The next few weeks I kept feeling zaps of sharp pain in my chest area. On the 12th day after the vaccine, I had a panic attack. The panic attack started with a sharp pain in my neck and when I inhaled it hurt. I got heart palpitations and again felt like I couldn?t breathe. I never suffered from a panic attack, so we called 911. The EMTs came my blood pressure was 200s/100s and elevated heart rate (sorry don?t remember exact numbers). It was suggested I go to the ER since my numbers were high. In the ER I told the doctor about my vaccine incident. They got blood work done and she decided to do a CT scan and X-ray since something was elevated ( I don?t remember what was elevated. I am working on getting that info). My EKG, CT scan and X-ray all came out fine. I was then diagnosed with panic disorder. I was sent home and after a few hours I started to feel an internal tremor.  I describe the tremor as having a cell phone on vibrate its usually is in my lower abdomen to pelvic area. My blood pressure kept spiking up into 180-190/80-100. I kept reaching out for help by going to ER once more, 3 urgent care visits and my primary. No one could help me, and I kept getting labeled as having panic/anxiety disordered. My primary doctor said I could be having adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I just have to wait it out. The internal tremor I feel constantly and sometimes it?s in my chest. I have muscle twitching, tingling in my lower limbs, muscle pain, and blood pressure spikes. I do feel like my symptoms cause anxiety because ill have these spells where I feel adrenaline running through me which will cause anxiousness. My blood pressure is getting better, but I still have spikes and have had another panic attack.  I have been on Lexapro 5mg and gabapentin 300mg 3x a day for 5 weeks. During that time, my symptoms have not improved. I will be getting off the medication soon. I never had any of these issues prior. I don?t drink, smoke or do any drugs besides the medication prescribed.   On 3/30/21, I reached out to my psychiatrist again and went into more detail about everything and she said she believes me about the vaccine side effects.  She recommended I go back to my primary care doctor and ask to be referred to UCSD covid long haulers study to see if they can help me. I wanted to share my information to see if it might be help to your research.  Thank you for your time

Chills, low-grade fever, aching muscles and joints, fatigue, mild &#34;covid arm&#34;. I also experienced nausea which caused vomiting that put me in the hospital overnight due to dehydration. (This happened the day after I got the vaccine.)  Second dose: Similar symptoms as the first dose but they&#39;re much stronger. My fever reached 103F one day after the vaccine, strong chills and aches, headache, mild nausea, bigger &#34;covid arm&#34; reaction (I wish I could attach pics, there&#39;s a large area below the injection site that&#39;s red, hot to the touch, and the muscle feels hard), very sore joints and glands (esp. armpits). The fatigue and pain keep me from functioning regularly.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

These symptoms resolved after a day, but I have had a poorly delineated area of erythema, warmth, edema and pruritus at the injection site that began on day two post-vaccine and has been increasing in size until today (day 5 post-vaccination). Started as a small (2 cmx2cm) wheal, now  appears as painful/itching and warm blanching urticaria that takes up the entire width of my upper arm and half the length of the upper arm.

                                                Around 2 AM, roughly 14 hours after receiving Covid Modena vaccine (1st dose) I woke up in a violent shaking situation.  I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

Ibuprofen/tylenol didn&#39;t really help. Day 7 (1/14), still sore, but the injection site was red, swollen, warm to touch, and itchy.  Took benadryl. Day 8 (1/15) less itchy, but more red. Still a little swollen and warm to touch.

Was unable to do most daily activities. Extreme fatigue and slept almost all day, also due to fever and pain from body aches/joint pain. Took Tylenol (700mg at 7:30am and 2:30pm) but fevers continued to register between 100.2 and 100.8. Fever was definitely higher at night but temperature unknown. Took Tylenol again at 7:30pm and at this point did not have fever, mostly did not have body aches/joint pain at this time. No symptoms besides tiredness the next morning (1/18/21)  Large red welt appeared at injection site, about 4 inches by 3 inches. Hot to touch, itchy at times, very sore. Still has welt as of 1/19/21.

By the time I received the vaccine it was 1:15pm and by 2:30 I had a throbbing headache (I had a slight headache already before the vaccine). When I got home I took 2 extra strength Tylenol&#39;s and felt fine. At 3:30am that night I had pain and bruising on my left arm which I rolled on in my sleep and the pain woke up me. When I went to turn on my right side I heard a popping noise in my neck and was no longer able to move my neck to my right. I got up scared and started to experience chills, nausea, and dizziness. I went back to bed to try to calm down. I was not able to move my neck at this point or pick up my head off the bed. I called my sist

One week and one day after injection (1/19/2021) I developed 6x7inch red swelling, with irregular border at injection site. The area was itchy and very hot to the touch. No pain on palpation and no fever. I also experienced pain under my left arm pit. The next day (1/20/2021) the swelling has gotten larger with same symptoms.

I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                1 week after my injection I developed a approximate baseball size circle at my injection sight with mild warmth and tenderness and swelling. I had axillary lymph node swelling, neck muscle soreness, fatigue, and frontal and temporal headache. I still have a red circular area at my injection sight but it is gradually improving (4 days out from redness occurring). The symptoms seemed worse than the initial reaction the first few days after my injection. I am a health care provider and have taken photos daily but have not gone for an office visit at this time.

                                                On 1/19/21 I received my SECOND dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. 1/20/21 at around 0300, started with restless leg feeling and headache, nausea (dry heaved). At this time I took two Tylenol &amp; two Advil with a Ketorolac. The restless leg continued into full body aches, head to toe. Headache to migraine (this varied from on the top of my head to my left temple). These symptoms were consistent throughout the day, with severe fatigue. 1000 of 1/20/21 I was feeling chills and again nausea (again dry heaves). I drank ginger ale for the nausea, but I had no appetite till 1400. 1100 I took four more Tylenol. The aches subsided towards evening, however the headache in my left temple remained for the rest of the night. At 0500 on 1/21/21 I took more Tylenol and woke up later without the headache and body aches. However fatigue did linger with some back pain throughout the day. On the morning of 1/21/21 I did notice a lump and redness at injection site, as well as being painful to the touch.

                                                I received my second covid vaccine on Monday.  For the two days following the vaccine I felt very fatigue with nausea, 1 episode of vomiting, chills, elevated temps,  muscle and joint pain.  I left work early yesterday due to these s/s.  I also had some numbness to my left hand.  I had my vaccine given in my left deltoid.  The numbness in my left hand has resolved today, but now I am having right arm/hand,  heaviness, numbness with limited ROM.  It has progressively worsen throughout the day to the point that my hand is very shaky and I am starting to not have full control.  My handwriting has started to become sloppy and I am having trouble drawing up vaccines.  You can phone follow up, or you can reply via email.

                                                The evening I received the 2nd dose of Moderna (1/24) I started having a headache followed by fever, chills,  arm soreness, and fatigue. Monday, 1/25, I no longer had headache but fever, chills, arm soreness, and fatigue was still present.  I felt so cold I had on long sleeves and multiple blankets. I took tylenol for my symptoms. This latest until Tuesday morning  (1/26) when I awoke when all of my symptoms were gone other than my arm in discomfort. When I looked into the mirror I saw  a red welty rash on my arm. I  continued to take tylenol and iced my arm. I called my primary care doctor. I later received a message from her office to take tylenol and ice arm and come in to be seen if my arm did not improve. Later on in the evening the size of the rash continued to grow and get angry red. I felt great pain. I ended up going to the ER to get it looked it. I was given a rx for keflex to treat my arm for potential cellulitis of the arm but also noted that what I was experiencing was likely a localized reaction to the injection itself per the discharge summary. That evening I circled the rash so I could keep track of its growth. It did slightly grow the next day (1/27).  I followed up with my primary care doctor today (1/28) as I was instructed by my ER discharge summary to follow up in 3 days and she only had availability 2 days later.  The rash appears to finally have stopped growing but it still present. It does appear to have faded some. I was advised to take Claritin or Allegra and use calamine lotion.

                                                In day one I felt a little off and weak after the injection. This was a few minutes later and lasted about 2 hours. I took a Tylenol PM to sleep, but didn?t sleep well at all. On the second day, in the morning when I woke up the arm where the injection was administered was extremely sore and I couldn?t lift it. It felt almost numb, but I was in pain. I took Advil late morning and felt better but still couldn?t lift my arm above my chest. Around 4-5pm that evening, I was feeling tightness in my chest. Felt like something heavy was sitting on top of me and I developed a headache at this point. I felt super tired so I took an Advil PM to comfortably take a nap. When I woke up I still had a headache and chest tightness. At this point my body started to feel sore. The next day, 1/31/21, I am still feeling fatigued. Headache did not go away or subside. My body still feels sore especially my back, top area (I would say around shoulder blades). I still have chest tightness and had a fever of 101 today. I have taken an Advil for headache and body soreness - after an hour of taking Advil, still feeling the same.

                                                Severe muscle tension in cramping in right arm two hours after injection. In less than 24 hours the muscle cramping had extended up my neck into my face, specifically the masseter muscle of my jaw.  I also experienced some numbness on the right side of my face (unfortunately the locked masseter muscle was very noticeable). I was not able to sleep or eat when the pain built; hot and cold temperatures were highly reactive when trying to consume anything.   I saw my dentist for an emergency medical appointment on Monday 1/25/2021 with the dentist. I saw Dr. who prescribed a muscle relaxer and assisted me in identifying the masseter muscle as the source of pain and tension as well as exercises that could be done to treat the reaction. While there is no definitive evidence that the muscle cramping is directly related to the COVID vaccine, it is reasonable to suspect that it may have impacted the muscle tension and resulting locked masseter muscle that required clinical intervention. The muscle relaxer was somewhat helpful, however for my body and biochemistry, taking 400mg of ibruprofen every 6-8 hours was much more successful in treating the symptoms.

I took 800mg (4 200mg tablets) ibuprofen, which helped immensely. 2 hours later at midnight I went to bed and was very hot and sweating all night. Symptoms continued, alternating between chills and sweats about every 2-4 hours during the day on Feb 4.  Went to bed about 11pm, was comfortable all night and slept almost 12 hours. Currently minor aches in my back are my only symptom.

Within a few hours, almost 24 hours from the second shot I started  having body aches, shortly after the chills started.  Sleep most of the day so far with body aches and chills alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen. Checked the injection site and have a golf ball size lump that is red and hot to the touch.

                                                I initially had a sore arm which was anticipated but a few days later I noticed pain from a swollen lymph node(s) in the same armpit (about 3-4 days later) which lasted several days. Over the next few days I experienced diarrhea, weakness, fatigue, extreme neck pain (on the same side as the injection), swelling and redness of my arm at the injection site (9 days after), a few hives on my face. It is currently 2 weeks after I&#39;ve received the vaccine and I feel extreme muscle aches, slight headache, and pain in my upper abdomen and back. I was in very good shape prior to receiving this vaccine but now when I go to the gym I cannot lift as much as I could before, nor do I have energy like I did prior to the vaccine.

                                                Several hours after vaccine administration, I began to get a headache. That headache intensified over the next 24-36 hours. A severe headache resulted with a painful, stiff neck, occasional fever, occasional diarrhea, confusion, vision changes, and increased imbalance. These symptoms lasted for about 1 week before I sought medical treatment at a virtual urgent care appointment on 1/5/21. They referred me to an in-person urgent care facility that day. At that facility, they said my symptoms were very concerning and said I needed to seek immediate medical assistance at the ED and offered to call me an ambulance. My husband drove me to the ED from the urgent care facility. At the ED, they treated me with a migraine work-up but eventually discharged me with instructions to follow-up as I was &#34;diagnostically unclear&#34; at discharge. After a week, my symptoms had not improved at all and so my previous ED physician suggested that I return to the ED (after being unable to get care in a timely manner in an outpatient setting). At the ED on 1/12/21, they again treated me with a migraine workup but also conducted a CT scan and a COVID test. When both tests came back negative, they conducted a lumbar puncture procedure. Those results came back positive for viral meningitis. As I had no other illness or known exposure to any other virus at that time - and given the timeframe of the vaccine administration - my care team concluded that this was a rare reaction to the COVID vaccine. I was discharged with instructions to follow up with my PCP and a neurologist. My follow-up neurology consult is scheduled for 2/19/21.

I had severe headaches and vertigo by the next morning, nausea, and debilitating joint pain. By day 3, I continued experiencing headaches and spontaneous vertigo. I have been extremely tired and can sleep for hours.  Day 4, I was feeling much better. I went out that night, and after only 2 drinks, the vertigo came back so badly, I wasn&#39;t able to drive home. For the following days till today, I am still experiencing terrible headaches that will not even lessen with medication, spontaneous vertigo although they don&#39;t last too long any more, and I am extremely tired all the time.

Today (02/10/2021) she states that she feels better but that she has had some increased pain and insomnia; she estimates, though, that these symtoms that she mentioned today are due to recent medication changes.

                                                Shock-like pains in back and abdomen started on the day of first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Also had fatigue, headache, extreme right arm pain. Fatigue, headache, and arm pain subsided, but shock-like pains continued over several weeks and have traveled to other parts of the body. These pains have been felt in the back, abdomen, chest, legs, feet, ankles, toes, fingers, and wrist. They occur on and off throughout the day and in the last two weeks, tingling has also been noticed in legs and feet. Muscle spasms have also occurred in feet and legs in the last week. I have seen a cardiologist and a neurologist. I completed an echocardiogram, heart monitor, and MRI. Those results have returned normal, but neurologist believes this is neuropathy that was triggered by the vaccine.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine on December 31, 2020. That day (Thursday) and Friday, I had expected side effects such as fatigue, headache, and extreme pain on the injection-site arm. I also experienced sharp, shooting pains though in my back, chest, and abdomen. The expected side effects subsided, but the sharp pains continued and still do. I saw my cardiologist because I have a congenital heart defect. They completed an ECG, Echocardiogram, and heart monitor study. All came back normal. After a week of the first vaccine, the shooting pains were mainly in my back and I experienced back pain. Shortly after that, I started experiencing shock-like and burning pains in my feet, ankles, legs, toes, right hand fingers, and right hand wrist. These pains continue to happen on and off and I also continue to have pains in my back and abdomen on and off. I saw a neurologist who ordered an MRI. The MRI came back normal, but the pains persist. Within the last two weeks, I have also experienced tingling in my legs and feet and muscle spasms in my feet and calves. I saw my neurologist again today and she believes I am experiencing neuropathy which was likely induced by the vaccine. She recommended holding off on getting the second dose until we know more about how this might progress. She also reported that she has seen some others in her clinic now with the same symptoms following the COVID-19 vaccine. She is unsure if this will resolve or not and we are planning to monitor the condition.

                                                There were no immediate adverse affects after the vaccine. Arm tenderness near the injection site became very noticeable the morning after the shot. About a day after the vaccine, I developed flu-like symptoms: joint tenderness, body aches, chills, and a low-grade fever of 99 - 100.1 degrees. These symptoms were completely gone within 48 hrs. I experienced moderate to severe arm tenderness for 3-4 days. I also had slight periods of itchiness near the site of injection, but again, this dissipated completely after 3-4 days.

                                                Five days after the initial dose, I noticed swollen lymph nodes near the armpit of my left arm.  I received the injection in my left arm.  The lymph nodes were tender and I experienced pain in the armpit area.  Seven days after the initial dose, I woke up in the middle of night feeling like my body was on fire with pain on my left side.  I took my temperature and it was 99.3.   Upon waking up in the morning one week after the initial dose, the swelling was gone in lymph nodes.  However, a red  rash appeared near the injection site on my left arm.  The rash was tender and warm to the touch.  My left arm was tight and painful.  As of day nine after the injection, the rash is itchy and has moved slightly down my arm.  Pain has diminished but there is still tightness in my upper left arm.

And additional 30-45 minutes after that I began having throat swelling/tightness and chest tightness. I went to the ER and was found to have and elevated heart rate and blood pressure. I had taken Benadryl prior to going to the ER and was given IV prednisone and Pepcid there. After a 2 hour observation my symptoms had subsided and I was released. The next morning I began having chest tightness again. My PCP called in a script for prednisone and advised me to also take Benadryl and Motrin as needed.  I am still have intermittent facial/neck numbness, anterior and posterior neck pain; as well as intermittent headaches and axillary pain.

Woke up with chills, severe body aches and bone pain, severe left arm pain, headache, nausea at 11pm. Felt worst I had ever felt in my life. Couldn?t get out of bed due to severe pain. Temp max 101. Lasted until 1pm next day and then resolved however felt tired for several days after and had episodes of tachycardia and pSVT for 2days after (h/o POTS and pSVT and think dehydration from episode with nausea and fever probably caused that)

                                                On Thursday (2/18/21) I got a low fever, chills, and was exhausted. The next day I felt very tired but went to work. On Saturday I felt better but started to get right ear pain. I went to urgent care on Monday and was diagnosed with an ear infection and was given antibiotics (Amoxicillin). The ear pain did not improve and I went to another doctor on Friday who confirmed that I had an ear infection and he prescribed me with Amoxicillin-CLAV. He said if my symptoms didn&#39;t improve to see a specialist. Yesterday (3/1/21) I started having vertigo and am having difficulty with balancing, especially if I turn my head too quickly. Since Saturday Feb. 20, I have been experiencing tinnitus, ear pain, jaw pain, a feeling of pressure/fullness in the ear, and can&#39;t hear properly. I am also experiencing jaw tightness and pain.

Fever, chills, sweats, body aches, could barely move my left arm, pain in my bones and joints, pain in my pelvis, couldn&#39;t sleep because my body hurt so badly.

                                                Around 10:00-11:00 pm on 03/02/2021, I woke up with extreme soreness on left arm bicep (where injection was received and all over bicep). I kept waking up about every hour will chills and sweats as well as muscle and joint aches. From this time until approximately 7am, I used the restroom and urinated approximately 5 times. On an average night, I may use the restroom/urinate once at the most around 5-6AM.  This is usually only because the dog wakes me up to let her out at that time. At approximately 4am I took 40 mg (two 20mg pills) of DextroAmp-Amphet.  At 7am I attempted to shower for work. During my shower I couldn?t barely lift my arm to wash with out severe soreness. I also became very dizzy and nauseous. I had to get out and sit in front of the toilet because I thought I would vomit. Fortunately I did not. I then proceeded to crawl back into bed and call in to work (notifying them I was too sick to come in). I had extreme chills, muscle aches, and joint pain. I began to cry from hurting so bad. At approximately 7:45 I took 400mg of ibuprofen to help relieve symptoms. My body felt feverish (hot/clammy).  Around 8am I mustered up the strength to get dressed due to extreme chills. I then proceeded to eat a banana, peach yogurt, and a blueberry Benvita breakfast bar package with 4 wafers.  I then took a nap and have been laying in bed ever since until approximately 4:30 PM (with the exception of getup twice to urinate). My body hurt so bad, I barely moved. At approximately 4:30PM I got up to get orange juice and take 600 mg of ibuprofen.

A couple weeks after my second dose of the vaccine, I found out I was pregnant - 2/24/2021. Based on ovulation tests, I likely conceived on 2/9/2021, which was prior to my second dose, but after my first dose. This may be unrelated, but I had a miscarriage at 6 weeks pregnancy this Sunday, 3/7/2021.

I was taken to the ER, later that day was admitted to the hospital. I spent 5 days there getting tested. I was released with 0 use of my left arm or hand, and my left leg was weak. It?s been 3 months and I still can?t use my left arm. I am seeing multiple different doctors to try &amp; help me.

                                                1/23/2021 - The first Moderna vaccine. I had flu like symptoms, which included fatigue, muscles aches, muscle spasms, joint aches, chills, and shortness of breath for 2-3 days afterward.  2/20/2021 - The second Moderna vaccine. The side effects were much worse, including muscle aches, abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, chills,  fatigue, and shortness of breath. I also found myself limping. 2/21, 2/22, 2/23 - I rested and stayed home from work. Most of my symptoms had improved by the evening of the 23rd, and I felt like the shortness of breath was also improving if I took it easy.  2/24 - I went to work where the shortness of breath became much worse after working for a couple of hours. I began to get dizzy, and my hands and feet were cold and tingling. The school nurse checked my temperature (which was normal) and oxygen levels (99%). I was sent home and told to take another day or two off.  I was fine if I was sitting still and doing nothing, but talking caused me to become winded. Walking and exertion of any kind caused me to become winded. Once winded, it would take 15 minutes of sitting still to get my breathing back under control. Then I would be hit by a wave of fatigue. Also, when my breathing was bad, I walked with a limp. 2/25 - I went to  the shortness of breath was still bad. They were concerned. They took a chest x-ray (which came back clear), did blood work (which was normal), and gave me a Rapid Covid test (which was negative). My oxygen levels were at 99%. They prescribed a 6 day pack of MethylPREDNISolon. If I was not better by Saturday, they wanted me to return. They also did a PCR test (this came back negative on 2/28).  2/26 - The steroid did not help, and by the evening, I was worse.  I went to the ER . The doctors there were concerned about a pulmonary embolism. They did blood work (which was normal), a chest x-ray (which came back clear), and an EKG (which was normal). My vitals were good, though my blood pressure was high for me (113/64). The doctor told me to continue the steroid pack and prescribed an albuterol inhaler. I was directed to contact a pulmonary specialist on 3/1 if symptoms did not improve. The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/5. 3/1 - The shortness of breath did not improve. I almost passed out while driving after I picked up my two small children from school. I could not catch my breath in the car and started to get lightheaded. When I parked, I stayed in the car huffing and puffing for several minutes. I was seeing spot, was dizzy, and my hands and feet were tingling. When I climbed out of the car, my legs buckled beneath me. I was able to grab onto the car and not fall. I had some really bad breathing episodes between 3/1-and 3/3. At these times, the breathing was so rough, that I couldn?t even talk. It would take 30 minutes or more of sitting still for me to be able to bring my breathing under control. 3/3 - Appointment with Pulmonary Specialist. I had an appointment  He ruled out asthma, as the inhaler and steroid were both ineffective. He considered anxiety, but the problem was clearly not a panic or anxiety attack. (I have experienced those before and know the difference.) He ruled that out. He ran a pulmonary function test (which was normal) and a CT scan with contrast (which was normal). The doctor wrote a note for me to work from home through 3/10.  3/4 and on - My breathing was better some days than others. The less energy I exerted, the better I did. If I did too much one day, my breathing would be worse the next day.  3/7 - Ajovy injection. I was past due for this monthly injection. Once injected, I had an allergic reaction to it for the first time ever (this was the 7th time I used it). A few minutes after the injection, the injection area had a rash and was itching like crazy. I put ice on it and took benadryl. It was fine by the next morning.  3/9 - Appointment #2 with Pulmonary Specialist. The specialist was not sure what the problem was with my breathing. I was the first patient with these vaccine side effects that he had seen. He scheduled more tests and said he wanted to read more literature. He wrote a note for me to work from home through 4/6.

Injection site became itchy and hot and swollen and hard and raised. The next day the are covered grew. I used ice and Tylenol to mitigate symptoms but the injection site was not really affected. It remained raise, hot red etc.  Ibuprofen seems to have been more effective I  took it last night and this morning and the are was less hot and smaller. I went to my regular doctor he did not know about this condition but suggested I have ?covid arm.? He suggested I take Zyrtec and Benedryl to help everything calm down.

                                                On 3/24/2021 I woke up with pain in my lower right leg, that progressed to pain and pins and needles in all of my limbs, especially my hands and feet. The pins and needles progressed to loss of sensation and weakness. By 2/29/21 I woke up feeling weak in my limbs with difficulty walking and with balance. MRI of neck and head reveal not issues. Lumbar puncture showed no signs of infection or autoimmune markers but white blood cells and lymphocytes were elevated in spinal fluid. I began to experience increased fatigue and debilitating headaches 3/30/21 for about 1 week. I was prescribed 50mg Predsidone for aseptic meningitis. My symptoms subsided while on medication but have since returned. I experience pain, and pins and needles in my limbs and back, particularly in my hands, feet, and buttock when any amount of pressure is applied for an extended period of time.

                                                I received the vaccine on December 29th, 2020. The vaccinated arm didn&#39;t really hurt until the next morning when I woke up I could barely move my arm.  Around 10:00am  I started getting chills and having sweats. Over the next hour I became severely fatigued even with taking my adderall that morning. My body started tingling, I felt dissociated, had a headache, and a little light headed. Almost a little drunk feeling. I went home from work and slept most of the day.  When I woke up in the evening around 9pm I was sweaty, and my muscles and joints hurt. I took my temperature and it was  100.6.  The next morning on December 31st I no longer had a fever. My temperature was 98. something. The next several days and even now I continue to feel severely fatigued, and slightly dissociated. However, each day I seem to feel the side effects a little less.

                                                My arm started out sore with redness at the injection site, it decreased after a few days. Then the redness came back bigger in size than it was previously. My axilla started having pain, that pain is consistent and doesn?t subside with any intervention.  The pain seems to be increasing by the day. I have not sought evaluation on this, hoping it will go away soon.

                                                I developed a moderately severe headache, body aches, fatigue and nausea within a few hours of the vaccine. These symptoms persisted into the next day, but had decreased in severity after about 24 hours. I still had a mild headache and body aches (specifically back, neck, and R shoulder pain) the next two days. Three days after, I started feeling worse. The headache again became moderately severe, as well as the neck and back pain,  fatigue and nausea.  This has continued through today (day 8 post-vaccine).  I still have a moderately severe constant headache (dull with throbbing with exertion or movement in neck), back and neck pain and stiffness, mild nausea, and fatigue.

The reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% , 7 days after receiving the covid vaccine. I started to feel pain to left jaw but figured it was due to dental work. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek was very painful and hard. The pain to face was about 8/10. I iced it, took pain pill and fell asleep. When I woke up my left arm was hot itchy swollen and the arm and jaw were still very painful.    the reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% I started to feel pain to left jaw injection area. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek is painful and hard. By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. I&#39;m tearting it with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1%to deltoid  2-3 times a day.  By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s now 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. My left cheek jaw area is tender but I&#39;ll assume it&#39;s from the dental work. I&#39;m treating left arm  with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1% to deltoid  2-3 times a day. No changes at this time. It&#39;s starting to worry me because it feels like a hard mass that is painful and hot. (left deltoid).

                                                After receiving the vaccine on 12/30 the only side effect at that time was arm soreness at the injection site. A day later some chills and fatigue but no other side effects after. I noticed starting on 1/4 pain started on injection arm from shoulder down lower to extremities on left arm. Pain very excruciating but comes and goes. Joint pain and muscular pain throughout entire arm and even in right arm. After couple days of this,  contacted family physician regarding this.  Was seen by physician on 1/6. Discuss concerned and he ordered X-rays on both arms and ultrasound droplet on entire left arm (injection site- from shoulder in down). MD also I formed me to take Advil/Aleve twice a day as needed for pain/soreness along with heat/cool compressions as needed as well as shoulder exercises. Today is 1/9 and pain isn?t as bad. Can still feel discomfort here and there but not as excruciating. Numbness from time to time also. Is this normal after receiving the Moderna vaccine? Is it normal to experience this a week after receiving the vaccine?

                                                Arm was bruised and tender to the touch approximately 3-4 hours following vaccine. Started feeling dizzy around 8pm on 1/7/21.  Took PM meds and went to bed. Awoke around 3am with a temp of 103, joint aches, muscle aches, chills, congestion, eyes very dry and itchy,  severe headache/migraine with photosensitivity, fatigue on 1/8/21. Left arm was swollen, hot to the touch and very tender to move it. Took Tylenol and Benadryl to help relieve symptoms. Put a heating pad on injection site. Felt about the same all day so I rested. Went to bed around 10pm on 1/8/21. Woke up around 4am on 1/9/21 and my temp was 99.7 prior to taking any meds and after about 20 minutes of being out of bed. On 1/9/21 I still have arm tenderness and bruising, fatigue, headache, left eye redness to upper eyelid with swelling, temp has been running at 99.7 and it?s currently 4pm EST.

                                                5 days after my vaccination I woke up in the middle of the night to pain in my arm pit of the arm the vaccine was administered. My lymph nodes in my groin, neck, clavicle, and arm pit are visibly inflamed. The left side of my face and neck are swollen as well. I am having tingling and numbness down my left arm and in my fingers. I am feeling very light headed and short of breath.

                                                Vaccine administered around 5:30pm Thursday, January 7th. Severe site pain within the first few hours of receiving vaccine, lasting about 48 straight hours. Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine, my entire body began to ache and by the next morning I could hardly get out of bed due to the pain in my muscles. They felt like they had tightened or seized up. I could not take a step without wincing. Body chills came next, though I was unable to get out of bed to get my  thermometer from the bathroom. By Saturday morning, I had more range of motion in my extremities, but it was not until Sunday evening that I could lift my left arm (the one the received the inoculation) over my head. There was a red, circular non-irritating rash surrounding the site of injection for 5 days following injection. I have no allergies to any medications, but did test positive for the Covid virus on March 18th, 2020. I realize my body&#39;s reaction was a normal physiologic response to the antibodies my body created within the last 9 months, however I am an otherwise healthy 34 year old female and wanted to report my experience because I could not find evidence that anyone else has had the same experience following the first dose of the covid vaccine.

                                                I received my vaccination at approximately 7pm on Friday January 15th. Upon receiving my vaccinations I felt light headed, but after fifteen minutes I was okay to stand up and leave the facility. At around 12:05am  I began coughing and body aches and it continued throughout the night. By morning my cough had subsided, and I felt okay. By 11:30 am on 16th my body and skin began to tingle all over and I felt a burning sensation under my skin. My head began pound and a feeling of nausea came over me. I started feeling very warm about 10 minutes later and decided to take off my sweater and found that I had a large red rash across my chest. My temperature began to rise and my tongue and face began to swell and a feeling of shortness of breath came over me. By 4:00 my fever hit 104.2 and my body began to stiffen up  and my jaw began to clench involuntarily In small bursts for a total of what my family believes to have been 5-10 minutes. After taking 1000 mg of Tylenol my fever dropped to 103 for the next two hours and I began to shake uncontrollably, then it began to spike a again reaching 103.6. My spouse put cold towels on me and opened the windows to our bedroom to cool me down. Slowly my temperature started dropping and it finally reached 101 by 11pm. The next morning, Sunday, I woke with blisters on my mouth and severe body aches.

                                                Initially, I had severe arm and back pain that lasted 3-4 days.  On day 1-2, I was extremely exhausted, so exhausted that I actually wet the bed and I have NEVER wet the bed as an adult, which was extremely embarrassing.  The worst part is, since the shot, day 1, my eye has been twitching. I have been reporting it .  I do not think it is just a coincidence anymore like I originally thought.  I have had eye twitches in the past but they have never lasted this long!  It has been 3 weeks and there is no end in sight.  The time between twitches is sometimes less, but the severity of the twitching is getting more intense, sometimes causing my eye to blink (although usually its a lateral upper eyelid twitch) and I have had 1-2 instances of my upper lip twitching along with it (within the last couple of days).  The eye is driving me crazy.  I can&#39;t fall asleep at night because it keeps me awake and it twitches when I&#39;m trying to fall asleep.  There has been nothing that has changed in terms of increased stress, increased caffeine consumption, decreased sleep, etc. to have explained this persistent eye twitching.  I did have my annual eye exam on 1/15/2021 and talked to him about it and he said we will continue to watch it.  It was just annoying at first but it will not go away and like I said, the intensity and pulsating of the twitch is getting progressively worse.

                                                Extreme pain in shoulder socket. Cannot move arm without pain. Frozen shoulder in some areas.  Pain in constant and does not subside with any Advil or cold compress.  My doctor prescribed a pain patch which is not helping at all, as well as  ibprofein 800 which is also not working. Made an appointment with  an orthopedic surgeon since pain is not going away and is getting worse.

                                                Chills started first at 3am. No fever at that time. By 6a I was dizzy and had a fever of 101F. I was nauseated, weak, tired, and had muscles aches and a horrible headache. I had taken ibuprofen at 4a with no relief. At 7a I took Tylenol and did get some relief from all but the headache until the Tylenol wore off about 12p. At 1p I took more Tylenol and this time the relief wasn?t as much. I wound up bed with chills, fatigue, body aches, nausea, and headache for the next 8 hours. I took more Tylenol (1000mg), ibuprofen (400mg), and a Benadryl (25mg) at 9p in hopes of getting some sleep. At 10p I woke up overly hot from the 3 blankets on me. My temp was 101.5 at that time. I was able to go back to sleep and woke up with only some weakness and muscle aches in the morning.

Itchiness began about 24 hours post vaccine, and a horizontal welt became raised around the same time itchiness commenced.  Itchiness went downward to my elbow area. By about 36 hours post vaccine, symptoms, except for arm itchiness/pain, muscle and joint ache, had subsided. Muscles and joint ache subsided about 72 hours post vaccine. Itchiness and pain on injection site subsided about 120 hours post vaccine administration. No medical results or outcomes experienced in ?Item 21?  as of time of this submission.

It grew overnight and was the size of a tennis ball the next day. It was hard and hot to the touch. Over the course of the weekend it grew to the size of a softball and was tender, hard, red and hot to the touch. It is currently still red and itches. It is not as hard and it is still big. I did take Benadryl every night to try and calm it down. I also iced my shoulder.

However, speaking to my co workers, their painful arm went away after 2 or 3 days.  Mine still hurts over a week afterwards.  I got my vaccine on a Saturday. Wednesday night, I started feeling pain in my armpit.  It has continued and not stopped.  Feeling around, it feels like my lymph nodes are swollen under my armpit.   Saturday night (a week now after the vaccine), the vaccination site on my arm started itching unbelievably. Nothing would help it. It subsided by Sunday morning but now I noticed the skin around my vaccination site is pink/red.  Not infected looking, just like the coloring of the skin is different, almost like  a sunburn.  Again, still have painful, swollen lymph nodes under my arm and my armpit hurts when I move my arm.

                                                I was experiencing what I understand to be one of the more common side effects: pain at injection site. This pain kind of traveled to other parts of my arm and eventually my arm pit. I noticed the pain travelling around the date of 1/2/2021, and by 1/6/2021 it getting more intense. As I was trying to massage out the soreness, I noticed a palpable, painful lump in my right breast. I did not immediately recognize it as a swollen lymph node at that time, but after several Dr exams, and the lump and pain decreasing, I believe that is what was happening. I do still have the lump, and it is tender, so I am currently monitoring it.

                                                About 45 minutes after the vaccine, I experienced tingling in my hands and feet, as well as heaviness in both legs.  The heaviness seemed to subside but was still present.  By day 6, Tuesday 1/5, the heaviness was pronounced and it felt as though I was walking through mud.  The next day it improves slightly but continued for over a week.  On 1/12 I noticed numbness to L thigh as well.   I saw my primary care NP Re following Wednesday 1/13 who had me see neurology 1/14.  The heaviness improved but then pain started in my lower back.  On 1/22, L thumb partial numbness also began.

Also reported neck pain, chest/throat tightness, slightly itchy throat, clogged ears, and a cold feeling. I took her BP and it was elevated at 156/94. I monitored patient over the next 30-35 minutes and she asked for water and crackers. She was not having any difficulty breathing, did not complain of throat closing so epi pen was NOT administered. She slowly improved over those 30-35 minutes. She declined me calling 911. She left with her boyfriend approx 45 minutes after onset of symptoms. I called her at approx 7pm the same night and she reported feeling &#34;fine&#34;.

Then 4th finger on right hand that has pins in it started to swell and become painful in the 8th two days later the ring finger on other hand started to swell and become painful, then pinky swelling on both hands a day after that. Then pain and swelling started to subside around the 22nd then gone by the 24th. I am supposed to get my second vaccine tomorrow and I am wondering if this is still advised or will lead to a much more severe response. I reported weeks ago and never heard back from anyone.

                                                I had a vasovagal response- vasodilation. I felt hot, flushed, nauseous, then it developed into feeling dizzy and feeling like I might be sick. I was brought outside and asked to lay flat on the ground and I felt much better. The doctor came out to check on me and said that I looked pale, and that my blood pressure had dropped and asked if this has happened before and if I exercise regularly. After laying down for a little bit, I was guided to sit up slowly as I felt ready. Later that evening within 3 hours or so from the injection, I felt joint pain, and nerve &#34;pinches&#34; throughout my body. This continued through the night and into the next day 2/3/2021. These nerve pinches were mostly on my hands, left wrist, feet, legs, and jumped around a bit throughout my body-shoulder, back etc. I&#39;ve experiences sciatica and other nerve pain before so know what nerve pain &#34;pinches&#34; feel like,

Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 10:25AM on 2/2/21. By about 6PM that evening, I was running a low grade fever of 100.8F, had a headache, and my neck was abnormally stiff and painful on the left side. Throughout the night, my fever increased to 101.6F, my body aches and headache intensified, and my neck pain became so intense that I could no turn my head fully to the left. My throat was also very sore to the point where I could no longer speak normally. On 2/3/21, I was so ill that I missed work and slept most of the day, taking Tylenol and drinking water to ease my symptoms. Later in the afternoon of 2/3/21, I developed a productive cough with very thick, dark colored mucus discharge. By the morning of 2/4/21, I felt mostly better. The cough is still present along with the mucus, but the fever, body aches, headache, neck pain, and sore throat have stopped. The extreme fatigue I was feeling on 2/3/21 has also subsided.

Two previous pregnancies with healthy, live births (5/2015 and 2/2018). Received vaccination Tuesday 1/26 at 4 pm. Feeling tired by 9 pm. Had difficulty sleeping over night and bizarre dreams when I did fall asleep. Wednesday had moderate symptoms all day - fatigue, dizziness, body aches, joint pain, chills and hot flashes (no fever), nausea, and headache. Thursday morning (1/28), symptoms were more mild, but noticed urine was dark. By early afternoon, urine had gotten much more dark and looked to be blood in urine. Went to OB provider who confirmed blood in urine and urine sent out for culture, no infection found. Unknown cause of blood in urine. Headache has continued since 1/27, worse in the morning.

This symptom lasted for about 48 hours.  After that symptom cleared, a bulding slightly painful soft mass protuded from the left armpit near vaccination, and remained for 5-6 days. Swelling of all lymphnodes.

                                                The day of the injection I had a very sore arm, just like my first dose. Then around quarter after midnight, I got up to use the bathroom. I recall extremely vivid dreams, and a little bit of disorientation. On my way back to bed I thought I?d take another ibuprofen to help me sleep because my arm was so sore. I remember feeling very dizzy, I did take my pill, and then I woke up on the floor. I was extremely disoriented and there was a shrill ringing in my left ear. As I came to, I recall really finding relief in the cold tile, and being concerned that I may have hit my head. I did a mental scan of my body and nothing felt painful, though stiff and sore, as I had the flu. I got back in bed and looked at the time, about 20 minutes had elapsed. The rest of the night I tossed turned, and felt quite feverish. I attempted to find radial and carotid pulses, which were extremely weak. That night, I  never did get a temperature, because I was quite disoriented. This morning I?ve been quite stiff and low energy. I feel discomfort in my kidneys, and have taken care to stay hydrated. I have reduced appetite, and some achiness in my body. My temperature right now is 100 even. It?s almost 3 o?clock, so about 28 hours has elapsed. I did not seek further medical care, as I live alone and transportation i would be a hurdle. I also not super concerned, mostly I just want you all to document that I painted, as I have not found that to be listed as a common side effect for the Moderna vaccine. I did call up a friend who is a paramedic, and feel reassured by her two cents.

Light headed I guess you could say. After about 10 mins of that I felt a little sensation in my legs. It did not last long. I thought maybe just nerves. After about 15-20 minutes I walked outside to maybe leave. I started feeling a little Soreness (none painful or severe) in my throat. I looked in the mirror and saw two small red patches in the very back of the throat. I looked at my phone to text who followed me and looked back in the mirror to see they had no connected that quickly. With in 10 seconds. I walked back in and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl. I could still breath and had a good air way. My throat a little tight. I remember feeling this euphoric feeling in my head. After about 15 mins of the Benadryl I was getting bettter. I hung around for a little while and left. I know it was a allergy but honestly considered going back for the second dose of that is how it could be handled again. I felt some small dull none painful sharp pains if that makes sense in my sides and stomach that didn?t not linger. Over all it wasn?t so bad. This is my first day however and if more arises I?ll be sure to let you know. I did experience a very sore arm tonight. To even lift it hurt. Worse than other vaccines. I have never had any reactions to other vaccines.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on 01/27/2021 in my left arm. Within thirty minutes of the vaccine, I experienced tingling and slight numbing  on the left side of my face, specifically my cheek. After a few hours I experienced severe arm pain for 48 hours accompanied by body aches and joint pain.

                                                At approximately 15:00 on day of 2nd Moderna Vaccination Shot (given in LEFT UPPER ARM), I developed posterior mid-thoracic level back pain (atypical for me) which was extremely tender to palpation and &#39;dull, achy pain&#39; at around the T7-T9 region and mainly located within T7-T8 and T8-T9 intervertebral joint region.   At approximately 23:00, the evening of the 2nd Moderna Vaccine Shot (evening of 1/27/21), I developed a fever of 101.0 F. At around 01:00 AM on 1/28/21, my fever spiked to over 102.2 F and I was vigorously shaking with 3 layers of sweatpants, 3 layers of sweatshirts and 3 heavy blankets over me. I also developed RIGHT sided lower &#39;tooth/jaw&#39; discomfort, as if I had an abscess in my lower posterior teeth on the RIGHT side.   The fever broke to around 100.0 F at around 9 AM the morning after my 2nd Moderna Vaccine. But, again, at ~15:00 on day post-2nd shot (1/28/21), I developed a 101.0 F fever and was exhausted. By 9:00 AM on 1/29/21, I felt 100% better and remained asymptomatic.  I have never, in my life, experienced anything like what I experienced the night of and the early morning of the day after my 2nd Moderna vaccine. I have been sick before, hospitalized with high fever, and I have never felt the way I felt during the post-vaccine period. I also believe I was somewhat &#39;delusional&#39; as I remember waking up at around ~3:00 AM on 1/28/21 and I was screaming, for no reason what so ever, which was quite worrisome.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; 7 hours post vaccine- onset severe heachache, runny nose/congestion, nausea, severe muscle aches, fever 103 F, chills/sweating, pain/heat at injection site for 48 hours duration post vaccination. Symptoms mildly improved with acetominophen 1000mg PO q6h, but persistent. After my first vaccine (5 weeks prior), I had pain at injection site and mild cold-like symptoms, but otherwise minimal effects.

Pain increased over the course of the next 1.5 days until I found it was necessary to go to the hospital.  Trouble taking deep breaths and moving around was painful. Wheezing and crackling in lungs would occur if exposed to cold. Increased temp  occurred on day 4 (99.8). Currently am on day 8 and am mostly back to normal with occasionally chest pains/wheezing. I believe pleurisy was the final diagnosis.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

Both effects lasted until about 2:00 a.m. 2/27/21. A headache started about 6:00 a.m. on 2/27/21 and got worse in the evening and following morning. I have also felt fatigue and a little off balance for the duration of all these symptoms.

Day 1 - Within 2 hours of the vaccine, I started feeling nausea, headache, extreme fatigue, soreness of the right arm injection site. Chills and temperature developed later in the evening. Contacted employee health to understand the next steps. I was advised to contact again within 48 hours if symptoms persisted for a COVID-test.  Day 2 - Nausea, extreme fatigue, muscle aches, fever (100F), stomach pain, back pain, chills. Later the evening fever continued reaching (104 F). Contacted ER department, spoke with nurse supervisor about my high fever. Recommended alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen. Advised that current protocol and restated to wait 48 hours.  Day 3 -  Extreme body aches, chills, fever (100-102F), arm soreness, nausea, fatigue.  Day 4 - 6 - Symptoms persisted, headache, fogginess, extreme fatigue, nausea, and low-grade fever.   I contact Employee Health again on Tuesday 2/16/21 and was scheduled for an Employee COVID-19 Test on 2/17/21 at 11:30 am. No additional instructions provided besides getting tested and need to follow-up with the provider if symptoms persist.  Day 7 - COVID-19 Test Results are Negative. However, my symptoms still continued with a low-grade fever (99-100) for an additional 4 to 5 days.

The day after that, symptoms began to slowly subside, lasting through 2/16.  Mild but tolerable symptoms popped up and went away through 2/26. On 2/27 an intense headache came on before bed. 2/28 I was so sick, I slept through the day. Fever, exhaustion, chills, loss of appetite, dizziness, muscle weakness, complete loss of appetite (no nausea). These symptoms have been persistent since. My energy level is up enough that I&#39;m awake for more of the day, but still in bed.

                                                Within the first five minutes after receiving the injection, my right arm felt extremely weak.  I was convinced this was a psychosomatic reaction, and the sensation faded entirely after 15 minutes.  The evening of the injection and into the next day, the site was painful to the touch and my muscles felt clenched around it.  Now, a week and a half later, I woke up with a mild reddened rash at the injection site  and muscles surrounding the area that once again feel rock hard.  There is a visible raised area around the site of the injection, and when I run a finger over it I can feel a raised bump.  It&#39;s only mildly itchy and not particularly irritating, but when I do scratch the area there&#39;s a sense of mild numbness at the skin.  All reported symptoms are mild and easily manageable, but unlike any reaction I can recall having previously to a vaccine.

The adverse effect happened when I was taking a shower 45 hours after my second vaccine. I was starting to feel better at this point. I started to feel like I was going to pass out. I quickly turned off my shower and sat down. I would have passed out had I not focused to not. I felt nauseous, lost my hearing and started to lose my sight. After I was ok, my lips were blue/Gray. I don&#39;t pass out. I&#39;ve passed out twice in my life when I was much younger. That&#39;s how I knew what was happening. I&#39;m scared this will happen again and I don&#39;t know what this means.

There was also a knot and heat around the injection site. Pain is only now starting to subside but still uncomfortable. No other symptoms prior.

I woke up with neck pain, headache, tension and pain behind left ear. Pain got worse as the day passed. Following day the pain was unbearable and I went to the hospital. They provided medication for pain and antibiotics in case of infection. Medication was not working and pain progressively got worse. A day after going to the hospital the numbing in my mouth got worse and progressed to the entire left side of my head. By the evening , the left side of my face started dropping, at which time I went to the hospital again. The physician at the hospital advised I had Bell?s palsy and gave me pain medication, which did not work. The following day I saw my personal physician and he provided me with prescription medication for pain and relief of Bell?s palsy.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

When I sat down, my blood pressure dropped and the room started spinning and I could feel that I was going to lose consciousness. My husband came to help and watched as I passed out cold on the toilet for over a minute. 15 hours after receiving the shot, I passed out again on the toilet with the same symptoms before losing consciousness. I was unable to get up without passing out for over 16 hours after receiving the shot. I had continued dizziness and muscle weakness for over 24 hours, along with flu-like symptoms as expected.

I&#39;m prone to anxiety - so on Friday night I was extremely anxious and didn&#39;t sleep until 3am. On Saturday, the armpit pain became worse especially at night.  Again didn&#39;t sleep until 4am. There is swelling and pain still on Sunday morning.  I&#39;ve iced and put a warm compress on them which is helping slightly but the swelling and pain is still there.

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

                                                I had the standard side effects starting about 20 hours after my 2nd dose on 3/26/2021 of Moderna (low grade fever, chills, sweats, nausea, body aches, stiff neck on the left side, sore arm (left side), but I also had very swollen lypmh nodes in my armpit area on the left side and a bad rash. I reported to my doctor who told me to do cold compresses and hydrocortisone a few times a day and after 3-4 days that went away.  Since the 1st dose on 2/25/2021, I have had random muscle aches in my legs, stiff/sore neck on the left side, and my arm is sore maybe every 2-3 days at the injection site (the arm soreness happened moreso after the 2nd dose though). I also have a stiff toe on my right foot (2nd toe in next to my pinky toe) when I walk on it; when I grab my toe to feel for an injury or check for bruising, there is nothing and it feels normal. It&#39;s only when I walk on it does it randomly hurt throughout the day. I am not certain if this is coincidental or related but wanted to also include this since it started 2-3 days after my 2nd dose.

                                                around 2 hours after the shot I developed a headache. I suffer from chronic migraines but this way way more intense than my normal ones. the pain was all over my head, I had vision changes being very blurry and cloudy. the pain shot all the way down my neck. i had to go to urgent care expecting to get a toradol shot and go home. instead was sent via ambulance to the ER in fear i may have had a bleed. i ended up in the ER on saturday 4/24/21. they never gave me a CAT scan i was sent over there for. instead made me sit there for 2 hours in room before being seen. then came in said here&#39;s some meds and made me wait another 2 hours. i was discharged faster than it took them to take my copay for the visit! so for having a blinding headache for 2 days they didnt take it very seriously. on top of the headache i had sever muscle and joint pain to the point i couldnt move. i couldnt keep food down either.

Went to ER on 04/26 at approx 12pm, rash suggested to be eczema  allergy with cellulitis.  Given topical steroid cream, keflex. Rash got worse and went to doctor for rash. I suggested then that it could be the covid shot because this was the only new thing. PA I saw said possibly but suggested allergy. Gave me oral steroids, pepcid, and Claritin.  Rash still grew, achy joints..severe itch. At this point I developed open blisters on my toes. Pain &amp; itchy. Went to ER again and was told it could be from my covid shot but they couldn?t confirm. Took blood, tested for lymes..full body rash that resembled measles..took me off of keflex and Claritin, gave me doxycycline and benedryl. Lymes negative. Again covid shot mentioned. No confirmation..just a lot of ?well it?s possible...? really sleepy, elevated BP. Rash fading, but still very visible as of 5/06. Not as itchy, but still full body

On 1/2/21, my right foot and leg were fine and pain has not returned since then. My left foot, ankle, and shin hurt pain level 2 of 10 on and off all day. Same on 1/3/21. On 1/4/21 the left leg, ankle, and foot hurt 7 of 10. Same on 15/2021. The pain seems to be moving upwards, almost to my knee at times. The pain is usually an ache all over the left food, ankle, shin. Sometimes I get sharp jabs of pain while sitting or walking. Aleve sometimes helps. Heat pad made it worse. Cold pad made it a little better.

Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

                                                12 days following the vaccine administration I noticed redness on my arm around the injection site. This redness was hot to the touch and rather large, exceeding the deltoid muscle and going down into my bicep. I also felt radiating soreness into my armpit and left breast.  The following day the rash had grown in size and felt hot to the touch on my entire upper arm with swelling and edema that affected the movement of my arm and hand. Continued soreness and pain in my armpit, left breast and down my arm into my fingers and up into my neck.  I proceeded to go to the urgent care as directed by Clinic employee health and my PCP. There was I was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescriped Keflex for 7 days, 3x a day.  It has been recommended that I seek further medical care due to my reaction, but this has yet to be scheduled.

                                                At 8:35 AM on 1/6/2021, I noticed redness and swelling on my upper left arm as I removed my long-sleeve shirt.   I also noticed that my upper left arm was slightly warm after touching it.  This is the first time I have experienced redness, swelling and warmth on the injection site.  After I got my first dose of the COVID19 (Moderna) vaccine, I experienced mild pain, soreness and muscular/body aches for several days.  I longer experienced these particular symptoms on 1/5/2021.  To treat the redness and swelling, I took one 25 mg tablet of Diphenhydramine HCl at approximately 10:00 AM.  I went to bed 50 minutes later.   I woke up at approximately 6:50 PM.  I checked my upper left arm and saw that the redness and swelling went down.  However, my upper left arm still feels slightly warm.  I will continue to monitor my current symptoms for the next few days.

                                                Immediately following shot, I had soreness in my arm that gradually worsened throughout the day. Around 8 pm the pain radiated up my shoulder across the top of my back. Around 10 pm I was suddenly hit with a wave of fatigue where my husband was unable to wake me from the couch to go to bed.  I woke up around 8:30 am on 1/7/21 with a debilitating headache, tingling in my fingertips,  and unsteadiness while walking. I was advised to go to the ED who gave no treatment other than recommending OTC pain meds, benedryl and rest. I returned home and took all the recommendations. At 4:41 pm, there has been no change with symptoms.

Never did I develop a temperature. This continued until 12/26/2020 when the symptoms dissipated. 1/5/2021 @ 0600: I woke up to my right arm feeling sore and area where I had received the vaccine was warm and a thin red circular outline could be seen. Also note that a few months ago I had injections in my legs due to vein insufficiency. Interestingly enough, during the same time frames, when my arm would become red and painful, so would my right knee.

                                                After receiving the shot,  I experienced a sharp pain in my shoulder and neck on the left side (same side as the shot was received).  This only lasted a couple of minutes and then I felt normal.  That evening the area where I received the shot was sore and hard to lift.  This is when I started to notice stiffness in my left elbow joint and muscle aches throughout my body.  Upon waking the following morning,  the stiffness in my elbow joint had increase and it made it difficult to bend my elbow.  At this point,  I had assumed that maybe I had pulled something or slept on it wrong.  I figured it would work itself out in a day or two.  This has not been the case.  It is now day 8,  my elbow joint is stiff with soreness and pain in the surrounding area.  I am not able to lift items as I normally would or squeeze/hold items in my  left hand without experiencing pain in that elbow or the surround muscles.  It had been uncomfortable and painful to move and bend that arm and even the simple act of straightening the elbow is difficult to accomplish.  All pain and discomfort is limited to the elbow joint and surrounding area.

My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

The aches were so intense that standing on my own was almost impossible for 24hours.  At the 24 hour mark, my symptoms reduced significantly.  Day 2 after the injection was mainly mild body ache and moderate arm pain at the injection site.

                                                A little over 2 days after the vaccine, I had a horrible headache. Thought nothing of it, took Excederin migraine and went to bed. Woke up Thursday feeling fine, then by 5 pm, was very run down, had a mild headache, and had an intense sinus pressure under my eyes. My neck hurt and was sore to the touch in the front. When I bent over, it felt like my head was going to explode from pressure. No other symptoms or anything to be alert about. Took a Mucinex before bed, hoping that it would move anything that might be clogging my sinuses, went to sleep. Woke up Friday feeling okay, with just a tiny remnant of a headache. Around 1 pm, intense sinus pressure returned, worse than the previous day. Decided to go to local healthcare clinic around 3:30 pm. PA looked at ears, throat, all looked okay. Only symptom was swollen lymph nodes in neck, same side as the vaccine was administered. Covid tested (subsequent results were negative). Saturday, had less pressure, and spent the day laying around. By Sunday, was feeling back to normal. Peak of incident was definitely Friday.

I&#39;ve been having this pain/ache in my ribs and upper torso of it is crushing inward. My ribs feel like they are being squeezed too hard like a person hugging so tight that you are having difficultly breathing. And the upper torso under my ribs feels like when you have not ate anything in days of hunger pain (but I am not at all hungry) and it start to hurt soo bad that you can only hunch over and hope it goes away.   These issues have been on and off yesterday and today with the dull feel that has not gone away of a 3 or 4 to in a moments notice 8. Currently it is a 3 with a dull squeeze to ribs and barrable hunger pain (I am not hungry).

                                                Day of shot had pretty extreme pain in the arm a few hours later into the night. Was pretty extreme next day - couldn?t move arm above head, hard to change in and out of clothes, etc. Following day still pain but maybe 10%better. Over weekend slowly got better. This Monday and Tuesday woke up with very slight pain but nothing that I had to adjust my everyday routine for like a I had the first few days so I thought I was in the clear. Then last night extreme pain back again. Can?t move arm/shoulder without pain. Can?t engage muscle without a lot of pain.

She then also said her throat was sore and that it had been for last 15 minutes and she was trying to wait it out. Asked if she should just go home and take benadryl. I advised that I could not make that determination and would prefer she get checked out. Walked her to the emergency room.  She was in no distress and was checked into the ED.

In the AM of the 6th day after the vaccine I woke with swollen, sore, tender lymph nodes of my right armpit. (Shot was received in right shoulder.) It is currently the evening of the 7th day after receiving the vaccine, and my right armpit lymph nodes are still sore, swollen, and tender.

It was that way for a few days then went away completely.   I felt great Monday-Thursday this past week.  01/15/2021 In the evening I developed a slight headache and sore throat 01/16/2021 I woke up feeling sick. I am fatigued, having some muscle aches,  a sore throat, headache, nasal congestion and slight cough. At about 6 p.m. I noticed that my left arm suddenly had the same red, inflamed raised area again and is slightly itchy.  I called a telemedicine general physician as I work in Covid testing and wasn&#39;t sure if I was experiencing a primary infection or if this is a result of the vaccination. He advised that I reach out to report a possible adverse reaction.

Over the subsequent 2-4  hours, I developed fever to 102.5 with shaking chills with ongoing myalgias and arthralgias (knees, hips).  I took some acetaminophen and fever eventually broke.  Still feeling weak, achy and fatigued but better.

I couldn&#39;t swallow, couldn&#39;t feel my lips. I went back to where I received the vaccine and was given Benadryl. I waited 30 min and my throat closed again. I was given more Benadryl and I had to wait again. I eventually went home and slept the rest of the day. I woke up feeling like  I was hit by a bus. I was sweating with chills for two days.  I slowly got better. The muscle ache took longer to go away and I was eventually able to return to work on Monday. I was having problems with my throat. The allergy specialist had me doing breathing exercises and it eventually got better.

I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and then I had to take 1000 mg Tylenol and was sent home from work and Tylenol kicked in and I dosed every 8 hours and did that for a few days to be safe. The 31st wasn&#39;t bad - mostly felt fatigued and was getting on and off headaches. 1st - Feeling some fatigue still is all and then SI joint has still not resolved.

I had a bad rush where I felt like I was about to throw up, I had a migraine and very flush. I started vomiting. My arms started to hurt. I got hives again and they gave me two more Benadryl. They monitored me for another 30 minutes. They said I got super pale. They tried to give me ginger ale and crackers, but my stomach wouldn&#39;t allow it. They monitored me for a while longer and I felt better. I went home and woke up the next morning feeling terrible. Vomiting, swelling, muscle aches. I was in bed the whole time and I missed 4 days of work. I went back Tues 19th.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

This lasted for approximately 24 hours and was then followed by a severe headache that lasted approximately 24 hours

                                                Woke up Sunday morning around 0700 1-24-2021 after had receiving my 2nd dose of the vaccine the day prior and was feeling all the normal muscle aches, pain and fatigue. At that time I was also experiencing a severe headache at the base of the back of neck, my neck was very stiff and one of my lymph nodes at the base of the front of my neck had swelled to the approximant size of a half dollar and raised up about 1 to 1 and 1/2. inches. The site where the swelling was located was very sensitive to the slightest touch, also on the same arm I received the injection. About 2 hours after waking, I started experiencing dizziness and nausea very suddenly to the point where I had to sit myself down in the hall way for a few minutes. I thought at one point I needed to call an ambulance as I made my way to lay down on my couch because I felt so sick. With in about 15 minutes after laying still on the couch the overwhelming need to vomit came over me. Which I did do for a good 5 minutes. There was quite a bit of relief from the nausea and dizziness shortly after but remained present the entire day. However the severe head ache continued until the morning of 1-27 and the lymph node still is slightly swollen with sensitivity to the touch.

I experienced muscle stiffness and soreness from the top of my head, down the left side of my neck, down my arm to the elbow on my left side. This continued for about 3 days.

Within the first minute I could also taste the vaccine (kind of like how when saline is flushed in an IV it can be tasted) and that lasted a few hours. Ten mins after taking the vaccine I took a Zyrtec and ten minutes later the rash got better and I started feeling better. The nose and throat got better abt 1.5 hrs after reaction. I felt extremely tired and beat up until the next day In the following days I was better. I still had drainage from my nose and my throat was bothering (itchy) , but not like the first day.

                                                I began having mild, localized left axilla pain and anterior shoulder joint pain at 24 hours post injection.   Over the next 24 hours (ie 48 hours post injection) the symptoms progressed to severe sharp, stabbing pain radiating to the left lateral neck along the jaw line, left anterior shoulder, left chest wall and along the left ribcage approximately T2/3 down to T9/10.  Also experienced gnawing-type stomach pain with some nausea at this time.  At the height of symptoms (approx 36 hours post injection), pain level was 9/10 and described as knifelike, sharp, and stabbing.  It was exacerbated by movement, particularly cough, sneeze, and hiccup.  Relieving factors included heat to the ice, but mild relief.  Pain levels began to diminish between hours 48 and 72 post-injection. By 72 hours post injection the jaw and left neck pain had resolved.  The left anterior shoulder/axilla and chest wall pain persisted, but severity had reduced from 9/10 to 4-5/10.  At 96 hours post injection severity had diminished to 2/10 with pain only at the left chest wall approximately T4/5 down to T9/10.  I am now 3.5 days out from injection and have pain level of 1/10 to the left chest wall with hiccup, sneeze, cough, and deep breath.

Couldn?t call for help I was pumping (as I am a breastfeeding mom).  I did pass out at that time came back to with the pump bottles laying on my lap and the pump time read 12minutes and 48 seconds.  Loss of consciousness was probably about 10minutes.  Did not feel well all day the next day with extreme muscle pain, dizziness and chest pain/discomfort.  Still had dizzy episodes the next day and today.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No concomitant medication use was reported.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unspecified date in Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s white blood cell count decreased which was considered severe leukopenia. Additionally, she experienced a fever for five days that would not decrease with paracetamol or ibuprofen, had muscle pain, and could not walk.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient had a severe arm rash the size of a baseball welt. Treatment for the arm rash included diphenhydramine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome for the events, severe leukopenia, had a fever for five days, muscle pain, could not walk, and severe arm rash the size of a baseball welt, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 35-years-old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of leukopenia, a non-serious unexpected event of gait disturbance, rash and non-serious expected event of myalgia, and pyrexia. The event of rash occurred on day 4 after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown. Remaining events occurred on an unspecified date after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown.  Laboratory tests revealed severe leukopenia (details not provided). Treatment included Tylenol, Ibuprofen and Benadryl. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the event a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Head ache for 1 week.  8 days after injection the injection site swelled up like a bad bug bite and a red, hot, itchy, swollen rash spread down upper left arm almost down to the elbow.  Took over two weeks to go away.  **5 weeks post-vaccine, I woke up with leg pain the spread for one week down to my foot and up to my groin area (just in the leg and foot).  My leg developed red marks up the inner thigh and inside of calf.  My calf and ankle have now been severely swollen for 3 days and they are still swollen.  The pain was so severe that it hurt to touch lightly and even worse with deeper touch and it hurt to walk.  The pain has decreased but is still there 1 week after the reaction with my leg.  My doctor diagnosed me vasculitis.  I had autoimmune issues in high school (Graves&#39; Disease) so my Dr. wonders if I had some sort of autoimmune response to the vaccine.  She said it could have been life threatening if I got the 2nd injection, which I should have gotten a couple weeks ago.  I did not get the second shot.

The area was hot and red, and had a raised welt. In the morning there was also a smaller circular rash  forming on my left collarbone consisting of small red bumps.  My armpit was starting to ache, which I realized was due to some enlarged lymph nodes that I could easily feel with my hand. All symptoms had worsened by the evening, so I took one benadryl before bed. 2/17/2020 All symptoms persisted (and are currently persisting). Collarbone rash of bumps has merged together into one large hive, bigger than a 50-cent coin.

Enlarged lymph node didn&#39;t start until around 38 hrs later and although it has reduced significantly it is still a bit enlarged.

I was unable to lay down, sit, walk, or stand without being in extreme pain. I had difficulty breathing and was gasping for air. My asthma pump was not effective. Drinking water made it feel worst. Using the bathroom had no benefit. I called 911.  The Fire Department arrived first and administered oxygen, which was ineffective and the pain was increasing.  I was taken via ambulance to Hospital. When I arrived to the hospital; I submitted to a urine sample. I was given Saline in an IV in my right arm.  I was given 3 Tylenol tablets of 975mg. I did a series of blood work, Covid-19 testing, had an X-Ray of my chest, Ultrasound of my abdomen; CT scan of my chest, abdomen, and pelvis w/contrast, and an EKG was performed.  The outcome was a 3mm right middle lobe subpleural pulmonary nodule and negative for Covid-19.  The hospital gave me a pamphlet for shortness of breath and told me to follow up with my primary doctor.

                                                After 10-15min of receiving the second booster I experienced numbness, tingling and muscle weakness in my hands, fingers and arms.  This lasted about an hour then subsided.  The very next morning I woke up with a bad migraine and a headache that lasted consistently for 10 days.  I had intense chills and shaking for three days that started within 24 hours of receiving it.  I also experienced muscle aches and pains, fatigue, nausea and tummy aches lasting about 10 days.

After the second dose, 23 hours in, I had fever, chills, cold sweats, L sided neck pain and stiffness, Left sided headache, brain fogginess, insomnia, muscle aches in my legs, exhaustion.  I was unable to get out of bed for 24 hours.  After 24 hours of this, my headache lingered for 2 days as well as my neck stiffness and malaise.  I would likely not get a 2nd dose ever again because the symptoms were so awful.  I am a Registered Nurse.

She reported that symptoms persisted for 4 days afterwards. She took time off work to stay home during that time. She did not take any medication for the nausea. She also reported feeling &#34;achy joints&#34;. She took ibuprofen for the achy joints and those symptoms went away after 2 days.  She had not had any changes in her diet prior to vaccination. Patient called on 3/8/21 to talk to me (the pharmacist) about her symptoms. She informed me that she sent a message to her primary care doctor to inform them of her symptoms. I suggested that she go to an urgent care since her symptoms had not gone away and that she should schedule an appointment with her primary care doctor. I called the patient on 3/9/21 to follow up, but she did not answer her phone.

After the second shot, I began having extreme fatigue, continuing joint pain, which has progressed to a burning pain in my rib cage.  I am also having numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. This has caused extreme anxiety and difficulty working. I have gone from exercising very vigorously 6 days a week to light walking with extreme fatigue.

It feels like a really stiff neck. Starting 4 days after my vaccine, I began having pain in my right armpit. I think my lymph nodes in my armpit are swollen; it is uncomfortable and painful.

For 7 days following the vaccine, intermittent severe headache (again occipital, baseball bat feeling), whole body weakness, sense that legs would give out when walking (I am physically active and fit so this was very far from my baseline), muscles would burn and fatigue after short period of usage, sensation that legs from the knees down were sitting in ice water (felt cold, slightly numb, very weak). Symptoms were present for 7 days and would wax and wane in intensity.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving my vaccine and feeling fine until that point, I became suddenly dizzy, nauseated, pale and clammy, and felt pressure in my head, my vision became tunnel-like, and I nearly fainted in the span of 1 minute. My spouse prevented my fall, helped me sit down and got me water. After about half an hour later I had recovered from almost fainting, but experienced moderate headache, nausea, muscle aches and fatigue for the following 48 hours.

                                                On day 5 post vaccination I had some axilla pain in my right arm. I couldn&#39;t see anything - no redness, nothing swollen, just some pain. It did not warrant medication to be treated. Then on post vaccination day 6, I woke up in the middle of the night to an inflamed area at my vaccination site and by morning the area had spread. As of now it is measuring at 4 cm and is raised, swollen, red, and mildly itchy. From 1/7 to 1/8 it has not changed and may be mildly improved. As a pharmacist, I wanted to report since it seemed to happen beyond the 72 hrs described in the common adverse events reported. As of 1/8, I can still sense the axilla pain but it is not as bad.

                                                Upon vaccination, I had mild soreness in my right arm muscle on day 1 and day 2 (I have been reporting to the VSafe app). There were NO other symptoms or side effects including NO redness, lump/swelling, itching, etc.  I felt fine. I woke up Wednesday, January 6th at 8am  to some itching on my injection site. When lifting my shirt to look at it, I found a quarter sized, red swollen lump that was a little sore and hot to touch.  I contacted my hospital employee COVID phone hotline and spoke with a nurse who transferred me to a doctor (11am) I sent a photo and described my arm. Dr. stated that it was unlikely an allergic reaction due to it being 1 week later. She diagnosed me with cellulitis and started me on Bactrim antibiotic. I took my first dose at 8pm on 1/6 and at 2:30am I woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea. I woke up again on 1/7 with an elevated temperature at 99 and feeling nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, slight body aches and a large, red hot touch spot on my left ankle (I had a spider bite on my left ankle in Sept 2020 that was treated with Bactrim it healed no issues but this flare up occurred same spot). I continued to take the Bactrim (3 pills total since receiving the rx) and still felt sick. I spoke again with a new COVID hotline doctor on the phone APRN CNP who stated she believes I in fact do not have cellutitis but rather an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine and therefore I should cease taking the Bactrim and start Benadryl. I did that at 7pm 1/7 went to bed woke up and my ankle was better as was my arm although you can still see the circle. I followed up on 1/8 with APRN CNP via secure messaging with photos and she stated again I likely am allergic and to monitor.

                                                At 4:30pm on Saturday January 9, 2021 I experience a slight fever with chills and back and neck pain. Nothing alarming. I was still able to carry out my normal day activities that included cleaning, tidying, cooking. I did not check my temperature because there was no need, as I said, I could carry on with my day. My arm hurt a lot that day and there was a rectangular red rash around the injection site. That was about the weirdest part at 5:15pm today (Jan 10th, 2021). I noticed this gnarly rash on my chest and back and both shoulders. Red and a little itchy, warm to the touch. It is now 11:50pm same day and the relish has spread to under both of my breasts and down to the bottom of my back. I have pictures of the rash. No fever today. Also, I am both the patient and a member of the vaccination team at my company. My coworker and I are in charge of all admin associated with the vaccine. We are currently vaccinating all our staff. I was the first to get vaccinated in our company. And here it looks like I have an allergic reaction! I have never had an allergic reaction in the past to an injection. I just took some BENADRYL. I&#39;ll show a nurse at my clinic tomorrow. Hoping it doesn&#39;t spread anymore.

Night of Day 4 and ongoing have been having feverish, sweating, and chills several times per night, which continue. Woke up on Day 7 (1/8/2021) with pain in L axilla, which continues. On Day 9, I had red, slightly itchy, rash at site of injection approx 6x5cm. Had neg rapid COVID test on Day 9 and PCR, which was negative as well. Saw my provider on Day 10 and requested labs to be checked (cbc, iron also checked as needed to follow up those incidentally). Requested an esr but provider did not think it was necessary but did encourage me to report to Health Department or Moderna but found this website instead. Please let me know if I need to notify anyone else.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

It lasted for about 30 minutes. The symptoms subsided while sitting back in a chair and drinking 2.5 bottles of water. I was able to walk out and proceed with grocery shopping slowly. Have taken it easy the rest of the day but able to be upright. Now just fatigue, muscle aches, feeling cold, abnormal teeth and tongue sensation x 2 hrs). The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

Woke back up to pain (chills, joint and muscle pain, headache) at 6am. Uncomfortable throughout today (1/14/21).  Not so bad as to go to hospital, but wanted to share side effects give them the limited data on this new vaccine.

Able to do normal activities throughout the day. 01/03/2021: Woke up with left arm still feeling weird and pain in the left armpit. If I put my fingertips in the middle of my armpit it hurt, sharp pain. I could not feel any lumps. I felt 2 lymph nodes swollen: above left clavicle and bottom of left neck. The lymph node above the left clavicle hurt with pressure.  Pain in both areas subsided by 01/06/2021 evening. Lymph node swelling has gone down but I can still feel them.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

                                                Approximately around 8:00 pm the same day as my injection I started to be in a fair amount of pain at the injection site (right shoulder) I took a bath still was in pain took Tylenol hoping it would take the edge off around 11:30 the pain started to increase so I put a heating pad on my arm . As the night progressed my shoulder pain intensified and then  I started to feel pain all over my by body mainly in the joints. It was very severe joint pain all over and especially in my right shoulder that I took another bath.  I couldn?t lay down or sleep I could barely walk around my bedroom but even that hurt so bad in my hips and knees. This feeling was very similar as if I were to having an lupus episode in my joints. Around 4 am on January 14th I finally took ibuprofen and eventually I was able to fall asleep. I later woke up around 9 am and thankfully pain free other than a mild shoulder pain where I got my vaccine.

                                                Beginning the night of the vaccine, I had most of the expected reactions. Redness, swelling, pain at the injection site, stiff arm, slightly elevated temperature (no true fever), aches, and fatigue. Most resolved within 2-3 days.  I was vaccinated 9 days ago, and the following symptoms persist: redness and itching at the vaccination site and a hard lump at the vaccination site. Despite being expected reactions, The concern is their persistence so long after the 1st vaccination. I have not yet received a 2nd dose.

It was hot , itchy, and there was some pain off and on. This reaction lasted about 4 days. There was also a headache and achy neck during this time. The headache was worse in the mornings and became better when sitting up throughout the day. All symptoms finally subsided about five days after the reaction began.

MOUTH BECAME DRY, THROAT WAS SORE. BY THE NEXT DAY, 1-11-21, MY FACE BECAME SO SWOLLEN THAT I DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE SWELLING WAS GOING TO STOP BECAUSE MY FACE HAD JUST GOTTEN SO BIG. MY FACE LOOKED LIKE I WAS A 300LB WOMAN AND I AM ONLY 137LBS. I WENT TO THE ER. DR. GAVE ME A STEROID INJECTION AND PRESCRIBED ME AUGMENTIN AMOXICILLIN. HE DID A STREP THROAT TEST, MONO TEST AND COVID TEST. ALL CAME BACK NEGATIVE BY THE END OF THAT DAY, THE SWELLING WENT DOWN. OVER THE NEXT FIVE DAYS, THE SWELLING WENT DOWN AND WAS COMPLETELY GONE BY THE SIXTH DAY.

Bilateral eye twitching and freezing mid-twitch has worsened to every few mins with a peak 6 days post-vaccine. 7th day post-vaccine intermittent eye twitching throughout the day with less frequency, however continued migraines without relief.  14 hrs post-vaccine awoke from sleep with excruciating 10/10 pain in my already bothersome hips. Felt like I was in labor, awoke crying in my sleep and screaming out in pain. Hip pain returned to baseline the following day with no return of increased pain.

                                                The morning after the vaccination, I woke up and felt slightly nauseous. When I got out of bed, and went to the bathroom, everything went white and I fell. I was able to get up on my own but had to lay back down. I thought I would be unable to go to work but after resting for about 15 minutes, I was able to get up, finish getting ready for work but continued to get lightheaded if I stood in one spot for too long. I was very tired and out of it the rest of the day, and having chills throughout the day. All of this in addition to my arm being very sore and my back hurt from my fall. I also had a very bad headache, and later in the day, around 430pm, my temp was 100.2.  I took tylenol and went to bed around 630.

                                                7 days after first moderna dose I developed a warm, itchy sensation in my left deltoid - this was in the middle of the night and I kept waking up uncomfortable. When I woke up Saturday morning my deltoid was red and swollen, the muscle was still hot and now starting to ache instead of itch. Throughout Saturday the aching intensified to about a 6/10. Then it radiated into my left armpit and feeling of pain like a hard small ball in my armpit. I went to urgent care, the doctor was not sure if it was delayed allergic reaction or cellulitis so he started me on Bactrim. I have now taken one day of Bactrim - seems to be improving but still have sensation in my armpit/lymphnode.

                                                I felt a pain shoot through my arm to my hand as I was being given the shot, then my arm and shoulder were very sore. I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

                                                Around 6PM the evening after receiving the vaccine my arm became noticeably sore and I began to feel achy all over.  I became noticeably more tired than usual around 8PM and went to bed about 8:30.  At around midnight I woke up hurting all over, joints and muscle aches.  I felt suddenly very nauseated and got up to go to the bathroom toilet.  Once crouched down over the toilet I became very lightheaded and dizzy. My vision went white and starry and remained this way for my guess is around 5 minutes.  My husband says I was showing seizure like activity, moaning and &#34;clenching up.&#34;  Once my vision cleared up I still felt awful,  lightheaded, weak, dizzy.  I sat up with a cold cloth on my head.  My husband  during the coarse of this was terrified and called an ambulance.  The EMT&#39;s arrived and informed me the episode had occurred because I was hyperventilating.   My chest was uncomfortable at this time and my fingers were tingling.  They calmed me down and check my vitals which were stable.  I went back to bed and slept after that.  I had another feeling of dizziness and nausea about 7AM the next day which resolved.  I felt very tired, weak, and achy all day the next day.

The next day (morning after) I developed low grade fever, chills, back pain, general malaise, weakness, and a lot of pain on the arm I recieved the injection . I also had tender axillary lymph nodes, first on the same side I recieved the vaccine, a day later on both sides. Symptoms were the worst during the 24 hours after recieving the vaccine. After this, the only remaining symptoms were tender axillary lymph nodes and pain in the injection site. I used Acetaminophen for symptoms.

In the weekend I was getting fatigued and really bad chills and sweats on the second. The 3rd of January, I could barely walk to the bathroom because I was so fatigued. Low fever on the 4th - 99.4. Couldn&#39;t have a full visit to dr on the 4th.Tested for COVID on 4th; Negative result. Couldn&#39;t go back to work until the 7th. I was completely exhausted, no appetite; muscles aches; had a bit of a headache, too, but the fatigue was so overwhelming that I just slept for those three days 5th, 6th, 7th. I went back to work on the 7th - it was rough but over the weekend I started doing better and the following week was better for me.

Swelling caused moderate pain and mild difficulty swallowing with mild breathing obstruction/discomfort. Onset of symptoms was roughly 10-12 hours post Moderna injection #1. Symptoms abated somewhat with Benadryl and NSAIDs. Raspy voice, pain in neck/chin jaw from swelling, visible swelling of lymph nodes and discomfort (somewhat positional) when breathing, swallowing, speaking. Night #1 was severe. I may have gone to the ER if I was not so immunocompromised. Day 2 was uncomfortable/painful but better with NSAID use. Night 2 had increased swelling and pain that improved after taking Benadryl and Singulair and nightly dose of Celebrex. Day 3, I am a bit uncomfortable with mild pain and visible swelling, but improved from Day 2.

Approximately 1 hour after the shot on Thursday, January 28th, the left side of my face was mildly numb from the eyebrow down to the jawline. On Friday, I felt the numbness behind my left ear and left jaw. On Saturday, I felt the numbness around my left ear and jaw. Monday, I went to an urgent care facility. The doctor recommended that I take Advil and apply a warm compress but the diagnosis was NOT Bell&#39;s palsy. He hypothesized my trigeminal nerve was triggered by something, not explicitly attributing it to the vaccine injection. Tuesday, I had soreness on the left side of my neck. Wednesday, my lymph node in my left armpit is sore. Thursday (2/4/21), I had soreness on the left side of my neck.  Friday, I still have soreness on the left side of my neck and left upper chest area.

I was also feeling a bit nauseous but I thought it was stress but I did took an ibuprofen.  Later I starter to feel very tired do I went to sleep like about 7pm and I took a Tylenol before doing so.   I kept on waking up in the middle of the night still feeling pressure pain in my head and like a tightness sensation with a slight pain on my chest.   I woke up at 5am to get ready to work and I was still not feeling well. I got out of the house and stoped at a gas station and when I got out of the car, I started to feel extremely dizzy while walking. Got to my work place and took my temperature and it was 99.1.

                                                I received my vaccine last Friday at the Health Department Facility. Six days later, I noticed that my neck was hurting and my lymphnode on my left side that the injection was given was swollen.  I didn&#39;t worry too much about it.  I figured the vaccine was doing what it was supposed to do.  On day 7 after the shot, my arm was swollen like a baseball, red rash and hot to the touch.  I called my general doctor who told me to go the ER as he didn&#39;t feel this was a normal reaction.  I ended up going to Urgent Care on February 5 at 6pm.  There, the nurse practitioner said she had been reading about people who have been given the moderna shot getting a reaction a week after getting it.  She said that she would give me a steroid if it didn&#39;t get better, but for now to take ib prophin and benedryl.  On day 8 after injection (today) the rash has gotten bigger.

At about 11 pm which was 10-11 hrs after receiving the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine I started with chills, body aches, and fever which gradually increased to 101. I took Tylenol again at 5:45am on 2/3 and then again every 6 hrs after. Chills and muscle/joint aches continued until my fever broke around 10:30am and was completely gone by 11am.  I continued with mild joint/muscle aches, significant fatigue, significant right arm pain at the injection site, and a headache the rest of the day. On 2/4 I was less fatigued but continued with a headache and there was a red sore and itchy blotch around the injection site that lasted another day. Redness is gone 2/6 but itch and mild soreness continue.

                                                I got my 2nd shot around 10am.  My arm started to feel sore within 1-2 hours.  At 7pm I started to feel pain in upper left back area with breathing. At 9pm I was in bed and started to have chest tightness and pain with breathing. Both arms and hands started to go numb and tingling. I got to ER around midnight and all testing was negative.  I was hooked up to IV fluids which seemed to calm the chest pain and numbness. I got home around 3am and went to sleep.  By 7am I was having sore muscles and body aches. I was fatigued and having chills.  I was also running a low grade fever.   I continue on like this for 24 hours.  The next 24 hours I was fatigued.  By day 3 I felt like I was getting back to normal.

I happened to look in the mirror and I had a red mark where I received the vaccine. It is about an inch in diameter with the center not red. It does not feel warm to the touch and I don&#39;t have a fever.

From the first vaccine had a sore arm, but one noticeable small lymph node in clavicle,. no pain.   She then had this area react again, had swollen lymph nodes in clavicle and the entire area lit up in the neck and cheek area.  She then went and did a CT scan and showed multiple lymph nodes.  There was pulling of the face and neck.  The swelling has caused the muscles to contract due to the pain.  She does not have any droopiness, but it&#39;s hard for her to smile.  They have taken her off of work, put her on muscle relaxants and to have more blood work done on Friday, tomorrow and return to the doctor on Tuesday.

                                                2/6 I had the 2nd Moderna vaccine. On 2/7-2/8 I had body aches, chills, and 99.4F temp. On 2/9 those symptoms subsided, but I started to get right-sided flank pain with pain on inhalation. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital. I was admitted to a different hospital on 2/12 and continue to antibiotic s and a heparin drip

It was about 1inch by 4inches. I called my doctor thinking it may have been a blood clot, but she said it will likely go away in a couple days. It did, but, wanted to report it.  After the second dose I had the same red rash, but it showed up within the first 12 hours of the vaccine. I was rotating ibuprofen and and Tylenol every 3 hours, so I didn&#39;t have a fever, but, I had muscle pain and night sweats for about 5-7 days, with the second night being the worst.

                                                3 hours post vaccine, extreme arm pain. Couldn?t lift my arm to get my sweater off. By 10pm I had extreme chills (shaking so hard my jaw locked from being so tense). Sharp shooting pain in my right leg started (still sore today). I then had extreme muscle aches, I could hardly walk to the bathroom. Finally at 12:15 am I took Tylenol.  Was able to sleep until 4 am and woke up with all the same symptoms... still extreme. Kidney pain started around 6am.  I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep until 10am. Woke up feeling just as bad- couldn?t eat. Went back to sleep. Woke up at noon with a headache on top of the rest and had to take ibuprofen (I didn?t want to exceed the allowed amount of acetaminophen in 24 hrs). Kidney pain continued, muscle aches as well. Chills went away around 4pm.  Woke up today feeling pretty good except the headache and kidney pain. Headache subsided around noon. Noticed a giant, raised, hot spot about an inch below vaccine sore tonight... assuming it?s ?Covid arm? . Super strange! Thankful for the vaccine, but dang- I?ve never had any kind of reaction from any vaccine, ever. I get my flu shot yearly.

Arm pain started subsiding but &#34;covid arm&#34; happened. An area of about 4 inches around the injection site appeared and has not gone away. There&#39;s tingling down my left arm (shot arm) down into my hand. It&#39;s not severe, but noticeable and the redness in my arm is prominent.  I have no idea how long it will last but wanted to make you aware of the reaction.

I took my medicine and went to sleep and felt ok for a little this morning and now the pain is back - this time with heartburn. I?ve been sick to my stomach on and off since the vaccine, weird taste and feeling in the back of my throat, place where they gave me the shot swelled up half the size of a baseball within an hour of the vax - it?s still a bit bigger than my other side. Could it be allergic reaction to this?

                                                Significant shoulder pain - woke me through the first two nights - unable to raise arm - significantly reduced range of motion - after two days it was no longer painful but still residual for a week. Beyond a week, any extra use of that arm would trigger discomfort in the shoulder that I haven&#39;t had before. This seems to have resolved as of 6 weeks post-vaccination.

The lymph nodes became swollen from the first dose and had been getting smaller, but they became larger within 24 hours of the second dose.  I first took Tylenol for the pain and felt no relief.  At 7:00 am on the 3/16 I took Ibuprofen and felt relief from pain and fever within a couple of hours.  I took two more doses of Ibuprofen that day.  All symptoms but swollen lymph nodes have resolved on 3/17.

                                                About six hours after receiving the vaccine I felt fatigued. Two days after receiving the shot I began having symptoms in addition to extreme fatigue, including nausea, low fever, headache, and muscle aches. Now it is 11 full days after the vaccine and symptoms have not abated at all. The doctor ordered a Covid test and blood work. They also prescribed zofran and meclazine which have not helped. It has been difficult trying to advocate for myself without coming across as an anti-vaxxer or conspiracy theorist. I wish doctors would believe me when I say this is caused by the vaccine. I am not an anti-vaxxer and was enthusiastic about getting the vaccine, but now I am frightened by my body&#39;s reaction to it.

                                                On the evening of 3/4/21 after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna at 3:30 pm that same day, I experienced fatigue, body aches, chills, loss of appetite and fever over 101 degrees F lasting for approximately 36 hours. I also had 9/10 soreness and large well-defined area of redness at the injection site that started 12 hours after injection and lasted for 5 days. Today is 2 weeks after this injection and I continue to have dull, throbbing pain in my left deltoid that runs up the left side of my neck, it is worse when my arm/shoulder is unsupported and it tends to be worse in the evening.

Today marks 1 week and a day since i first felt it. I still have some swelling but not much pain anymore. I had a little pain over the weekend though. And its on the the same arm of vaccination.

                                                Hello- 24 hours after receiving my first COVID vax, I had arm soreness and mild flu symptoms, which were totally expected and resolved in a day. However, almost two weeks after getting the shot, I began experiencing arm pain directly where the vaccination site was, and running down part of my arm. It&#39;s very strange, as the pain is constant. It has not gone away since it began. I have been taking 800mg of Advil around the clock, and it&#39;s very apparent when the medication begins to wear off, as it&#39;s extremely uncomfortable. I have never experienced any health issues like this before and do not engage in any activities that would cause muscle pain. Additionally, I have a very high pain tolerance and am rarely bothered by aches or pains (and certainly never had an issue that required me to take Advil so regularly to control the pain). I wanted to report this, as I do not believe it&#39;s likely coincidental that this issue began in the exact spot on the same arm as the shot was administered. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or if you need additional info. Thank you so much!

Within about 30 minutes of working on my computer, I began feeling nausea, the sweats/chills were more prevalent, and my arm still hurt.  I went and laid down in bed and fell asleep around 7:15 a.m. I woke up at 10 a.m. I still had a mild fever with sweats/chills, a headache, body aches (back and neck), and my arm was still sore Around 10:30 a.m. I took 3 Advil and ate, and felt a little better. As of 12:45 p.m. I just went on a sneezing binge and have a runny nose, my neck is still aching, arm is still throbbing, I still have a headache and my eyes feel heavy, and I still am getting chills/sweats.  I do not feel great.

                                                After the first vaccine I had soreness and redness in my arm for two days. Eight days after the Vaccine I had numbness in my lips and muscle weakness on the right side of my face. My eyebrow, eyelids and my lips were falling down. I could not wear my contact lens because of this. I was prescribed Steroids and Antiinfection. I visited the doctor. I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. I was treated for seven days with slow improvement in my symptoms. The Bells Palsy got suddenly better within three weeks.   I still got the second dose of the vaccine.

The next day, I had some headaches, moderate fatigue, joint pain, and continued arm pain. By the next day, my arm was starting to feel better, and the headaches were gone, but I was still fatigued. The next day after that, I woke up feeling normal again.

Sunday the pain went from the left side of my neck down to the base of my ribs and then progressed to include the back and chest almost constantly instead of just on inhalation.  I went to the ER on Sunday evening, assuming very bad costochondritis; however, was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the left lung, areas of possible infarction, and pleurisy.  I had a CT scan at a Medical Center prior to receiving the Moderna vaccine for a suspected PE and it was negative.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at about 2:15pm. I had a sore left arm after shot which awoke me at 2am. I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/29.  12 hours after the vaccine I had numbness and tingling in my feet.  The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to ER and they ruled out Guillain Barre Syndrome (did complete neuro exam) and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction. No treatment prescribed.

I went to bed and slept much longer than normal and woke up the next morning without chills or body aches. My arm still hurt quite a bit and I started to have elbow joint and hip pain. The following day I started to have sciatica from my hip to my foot on my injection side, the left side. My elbow joint was sore for about 3-4 days after the injection. I also had some numbness right at the injection site the night of the vaccine.

                                                &#34;I received the Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/29.  12 hours after the vaccine I had numbness and tingling in my feet.  The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to Emory ER and they ruled out GBS and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction&#34;.

I didnt think it was related to the vaccine.  I just thought it was a muscle strain but now i have  lump under my arm pit.  I believe this is lymphadenopathy.

I have also had severe chills, nausea, vomited twice, generalized weakness and shakiness.  It is currently 12:10pm on 1/8/21 and these symptoms continue.  Two of my other co-workers were at this same facility at the same time on 1/7 and have had very similar symptoms as well as severe headache which prevented them to work today.  We are all physical therapists, healthy young individuals, no co-comorbidities and were very surprised by these negative reactions and concerned.

                                                Patient is an employee at Health Center. She was given the vaccine approx 3:30 pm on 1/28/2021 in the left deltoid. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine without incident. The following is a written statement from patient describing events: &#34;About 30 minutes after vaccine, I felt like I had hit my elbow on something. Discomfort radiated from left elbow to wrist- I did have pain around injection site. About 8:30pm on 1/8/21, area around injection site became more painful. Gradually pain increased radiating down to finger tips and up to left side of neck, stopped right below ear. Neck and shoulder muscles felt really tight- uncomfortable ache. Also got extremely tired- left side of face felt numb- left eye slightly blurry- I fell asleep about 10pm. Woke up a few hours later drenched in sweat. Face numbness gone, eyesight normal.? Patient reports the following day 1/9/2021 @ 2pm: ?All of a sudden I started to sweat all over. I didn?t feel hot, only last about 30 minutes.? Patient reports on Sunday 1/10/2021: ?Woke up feeling okay. Left arm and neck still ached but not as bad. Got fatigued around 10am. I got a headache that became really bad. Dizzy, nauseous- no relief from OTC meds. Headache went away after a few hours.? Patient reports today 1/11/2021: ?Today I am still very tired. My left arm, fingertips, shoulders and neck still ache. Face is flushed.? Patient does state previous reactions to prior vaccines: ?TdaP about 7 years ago made me have joint pain for months. Last flu shot received was about 9 years ago, had flu like symptoms x12 hours.? Patient did not seek any medical care for the reaction described above. Patient?s PCP has been also been made aware of her reaction.

                                                Starting within the hour of my shot my left arm was very stiff and throbbing in pain. By 5pm I could not wiggle my fingers or even the slightest movement in my arm. At 7pm I started with a headache, complete body shakes, and a fever of 100. In the night it spiked to 102.6 All day Friday my fever stayed at 101-102.8. I had a bad headache and could not get any relief in my arm. My body ached and still had shakes from time to time. I took ibuprofen a couple of times to help with the pain and fever. By Saturday around 10am I had zero symptoms. Since then I have felt great.

Tues Jan 12 midday while at work began experiencing increased post nasal drip and stiffness in my left lateral neck extending up towards basilar skull. Started taking Claritin after shift to help with congestion.  Thur Jan 14 Congestion is manageable with Claritin. Stiff neck is worse upon waking up around 8am and has spread to right side; left side remains most painful. Range of motion turning head leftward is limited and painful; turning head rightward is uncomfortable but range of motion not limited.  Sat Jan 16 Congestion is manageable with Claritin. Neck stiffness decreased somewhat throughout the workday and feels more sore than painful. Noted discomfort at left deltoid late into shift around 10pm. Noted mild redness and edema over left lateral deltoid where vaccine was administered approximately 7cm wide and 9cm long. Area feels more firm to touch and feels tight when moving left arm.

Side affects started the following morning after my vaccine with arm pain and stiffness. After about 24 hours I had fatigue and chills with body aches. I slept for about 14 hours that evening then woke up the next morning without chills, body aches, and less arm pain. I then developed joint pain in my elbow and hip, as well as sciatica down my whole leg, that lasted for 2 more days. I also had numbness at the injection site for about 1 day.

I did not immediately notify anyone as I was not aware a fast heartbeat was considered an allergic reaction.  The fast heartbeat resolved, but my heartbeat continued to be elevated about 10-20bpm from my usual baselines for 2 days post vaccine.  I also developed the following side effects; headache, fatigue, muscle/joint pain, chills, swelling of lymph nodes on right arm, pain on right arm/joints, and mild tingling/numbness of right arm; all side effects resolved by day 3 post vaccine.

The next day, she had left rib pain that lasted for 3 days. Then she experienced increased congestion, a funny taste, and chills.  The right side of her throat swelled. Fatigue was experienced during the entire ordeal. Approximately 1 week after the injection, she began to experience left deltoid weakness that limited the mobility of her shoulder.

                                                Within minutes of receiving the injection, I developed a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt a bit light-headed and woozy. I informed the staff at the site that I felt this way and they asked me to remain for additional monitoring. Over the next 15 minutes, my tongue began to swell. 15 minutes later my jaw began to stiffen and I had difficulty swallowing. After another 15 minutes the staff asked the EMS personnel to screen me and check my vitals. All were normal. After another 30 minutes of monitoring by EMS the symptoms began to subside and I went home.   At home, I began to feel weak and went to bed. My body began to ache and I took ibuprofen to ease the pain. Within 15 hours of receiving the dose, I had a 100.9-degree fever and chills. The fever lasted the next day. I could not get out of bed for the next day. When I tried to sit up and watch TV I had back pain so severe it left me in tears.  I went back to bed and stayed there until the following morning. All told, I could not get out of bed for 36 hours.

                                                I noticed swelling and redness on the site of the vaccine on Monday, January 19th. Exactly a week after vaccine administration. Today, Tuesday. Janaury 20th the swelling was larger and it included itchiness and overall weakness on my arm. I decided to go to the urgent care since my primary care doctor had no availability until February.   The doctor that examined me did not have a clear diagnosis. He prescribed Prednisone 20MG tablet, Augmentin 875 Mg-125 Mg Tablet and over the counter antihistamine.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

                                                Two hours after the injection I experienced increasing soreness in my left shoulder up through the left side of my neck and down through the forearm. I became slightly nauseous through that evening. The pain and tightness got to the point I could not perform regular functions with the left arm. It felt as if my muscles were tearing and prevented me from sleeping. I took ibuprofen in addition to alternating ice and heat to no avail. It hurt to lift my arm, grip to pull or push even a blanket. This continued for 48 hours before there was slight relief. Full range of motion returned four days after the injection. For brief periods throughout the days following, I also experienced occasional slight heart palpitations.

                                                Two hours after the injection, my shoulder began to get sore. Eight hours after the injection, my shoulder was so sore that the pain was making me nauseous. Twelve hours after the injection, my temperature began to rise to 100.00. I had body aches, chills, and the overall feeling of being unwell.  24 hours after the injection, my arm was still sore but the pain was more manageable. 32 hours after the injection, the fever, chills, and body aches had resolved. 48 hours after the injection, the shoulder soreness was nearly resolved.

Also very vivid dreams, headache and intermittent nausea, but no vomiting. R upper arm at injection site is very tender, but no redness or warmth.  Ibuprofen helped with the aches and chills.   Unsure of exact temp, as thermometer just reads ?low? (think the battery needs to be replaced).   Pt rested, increased fluids, and used anti-pyretics as needed to recover. Symptoms subsided after 24 hours.

The injection site turned red, was swollen and warm and has spread in size for a couple of days. I had a headache for a few days prior to my reaction on Wednesdays and my left underarm hurt. Additionally, swallowing after eating or drinking hurt for a couple of days. My body was weak and I felt feverish despite not having any fever. I am currently being treated by my physician as if I have Cellulitis and was prescribed antibiotics as well as instructed to take an antihistamine with the antibiotic. Today is my first day on the medication so I do not know the outcome yet.

                                                One week after vaccination the injection site became extremely red, itchy, swollen, hard, and warm to the touch, expanding to roughly 4 inches in diameter. There was bubbling under the skin at injection site.  Pain radiated to the underarm and lymph node of left arm. Hydrocortisone cream did not help. Mupirocin ointment, Benadryl cream, and oral antihistamines (Benadryl and Zyrtec) for the following 3 days helped clear much of the redness, itch, and warmth, Some redness, swelling, and minor bubbling are still present.

I concurrently experienced a low-grade fever and tachycardia. In addition, I had severe pain at the injection in my right deltoid that significantly limited my ability to lift my arm. The pain extended all the way from my shoulder through my right wrist. Most symptoms, except for fatigue and pain limited to the injection site, resolved after 24 hours.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA I received the Covid 19 vaccine on December 22nd. On December 23rd in the evening I noticed that my injection site was warm to the touch, slightly erythematous and indurated. I was running a low grade fever of 99.9 that night. Start to get body aches, fatigue, headache, congestion and sore throat. The fatigue, body ache, congestion, sore throat and headache progressed/got worse into the 24th and 25th. By the 26th the symptoms had went away. The evening of December 29th, I noticed an intense itching in my left deltoid (which was my injection site). When I went to itch the area I could feel how hard the area was through my clothing. I looked at the area and it was indurated, erythematous and warm to the touch. It was approximately 5x3cm area. The itching continue to intensify going down my arm and up my neck. Over the next several days, I started to develop congestion, sore throat, body aches, fatigue, joint pain, headaches and the symptoms intensified. Friday January 8th, I was in severe pain and unable to walk that well. I went to rheumatology where I was given both oral and IM steroid to try to calm down the reaction and was told that was thrown into a full blown lupus flare. Restarted on methotrexate. Friday and Saturday improved slightly. Monday was difficulty to was due to pain and fatigue, not able to walk that well. Tues/Wednesday. Pain and fatigue manageable but noticeably above baseline and can definitely tell flare is no where under control. Thursday woke up at 5 am could not sleep due to pain. Pain intensified throughout the day and was un able to walk by 5pm due to severe joint pain. Rheumatologist and allergist confirmed that I am unable to get second dose of Covid vaccine. This maybe too much information but I figure you could used what you needed.

This consisted of fever (102), chills, sweats, muscle aches, fatigue, tenderness at the injection site, and headache. The fever (reduced 100ish), muscle aches, tenderness at the injection site, sudden waves of heat flashes, and headache persisted into 1/23. I also had an onset of nausea that evening. On 1/24 I continued to experience a headache, tenderness at the injection site, and sudden waves of heat flashes. However, around 5 pm I noticed my arm (localized to below the injection site) was very red, inflamed, and radiating significant heat. It may have been that way since 1/22, but I didn&#39;t notice. Those same symptoms persisted into 1/25 and I contacted my PCP. I went in for a visit, it was assessed, with no infection noted, and recommendations to watch and belief it would subside. On 1/26 it continues to maintain some redness and radiates heat.

I put Benadryl cream on it and the itching immediately stopped but swelling and redness took about one day to reside. I noticed left pec chest, armpit, and deltoid pain for about 2 weeks after shot also.

After first dose, I had a lard red, indurated but painless bump on my arm for a week. I became pregnant about two weeks after first dose and this, the second dose, was given at four weeks pregnant (due date oct 1 2021). Side effects included fever, chills, muscle aches, very sore arm, light-headedness, tachcardia.

Systemically experienced chills, muscle aches/soreness, and fatigue. Of note, the vaccine administrator said they were going to hold the injection in place for 10 seconds following the injection per instructions to do this this way, which I had never had occur before. I have also never had a vaccine reaction before. Unsure if the local site reaction could have been worse due to this practice.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

I started to think maybe the nurse gave me a shot to close to my shoulder bone. But that was not the case. By the following hours I could bearly move my left arm. I could not raise my arm above my chest with out sharp pain on left shoulder.. I left work early to work from home and it was hard to drive with the pain. By 7:00pm 1/27/2021 The pain was unbearable I had to take 2 ibuprofen 800 mg and a muscle relaxer.  I could not sleep all night the next day I called out from work. I woke up with still sharp arm pain and muscle soreness all over my body, tight muscles on both back shoulders and my back.  felt body aches.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the vaccine I started feeling chills and body aches. I then went to bed. I was awoke shaking from being in such significant chills my body hurt all over through the bones something I have an experienced in a long time. I continue to try to sleep and rest the best I could but I stood up in the morning I felt tunnel vision and thought I was going to pass out I laid on the ground at a safety and collected myself over the course of five minutes. When I stood up I am mediately thought I was going to vomit Splash cold water on my face I force myself to eat and drink and take Tylenol and symptoms lessened but remained over the entire course of the following day another 24 hours. I?m about to go to bed and I will not know how I feel in the morning but this is definitely something I did not expect. My entire doctors office received vaccination on the same day out of a group of 15 people two of us had severe reaction similar to what I described and the other female that felt sick like me had worse symptoms and high fevers with the stores as well she has remained out of work as a result of her symptoms. We are both nurse practitioners so it?s not easy to cancel our schedule. I ended up tapping out today despite my leftover post vaccine side effects.

                                                Night of vaccination (1/26): muscle aches and headache, severe left arm pain at injection site 2:30 am (Wednesday 1/27) - woke from severe muscle aches especially in joints, injection site pain had spread to include underarm (armpit) of left arm with radiating/nerve like pain going down left side of body/ribcage to hip.  No fever.  Took Excedrin migraine and ibuprofen (no tylenol alone on hand). Suddenly had hot followed by cold flash and severe nausea. Then neurological panic attack (i have had this ONCE before approx. 10 years ago during a severe Migraine that was treated at ER). The anxiety attack did not affect breathing, but instead nausea and all over flashes of heat followed by BOTH arms from elbow to pinky and ring finger (ONLY) going numb. Called my primary care office and spoke to on call dr. While on phone with Dr. numbness and nausea resolved - less than 10 mins total. Agreed that was anxiety attack and all symptoms were within expected for vaccination. Returned to be to try and sleep.  Wednesday - 8 am to 10pm - severe body aches, slight elevated temp. 99.8, headache, and around 5pm started experiencing vertigo. Took maximum daily ibuprofen for body aches  and had some relief. No work or any productive activities were able to be completed.   Thursday (1/28): woke up less fatigued and less body aches. significant vertigo is still present. Headache is still present. No fever. Left arm pit still sore - no swollen lymph nodes that I can feel.

Used hydrocortisone cream and ice for relief but discovered heat helped more. Itchiness did not last long but redness and heat lasted a few days and spread around the injection site. Felt totally fine otherwise, no fever etc. It went away in its own in a couple of days.

                                                The HCW noted w/i 1 hr of vaccination a constellation of symptoms including dizziness, disorientation, and fatigue; and by 4 hrs she developed swelling LUE with pain and some swelling extending to the L neck.  Over the next several days she reported marked swelling and tenderness over the triceps upper arm area; persistent swelling and pain in the neck that required cold packs for a couple days.  The reaction appeared to be more pronounced and extensive akin to the Humira local reaction she would ordinarily get; the last dose of that was 4 months prior.  By history, it sounds like extensive angioedema.  At no point was there any pruritus, erythema, or hive or rash on any other part of the body; no respiratory compromise, stridor or wheeze; and no fever.  Symptoms subsided over several days and she was well on day of her presenting for her second vaccination.  The vaccinator (who is a pediatrician), an on-call allergist; and this reporter (a medical oncologist) all consulted on best approach.  The allergist recommends skin testing; Humira may have a polysorbate component; and we collectively thought a contraindication to proceeding.  Given the deliberation the HCW actually elected also not to proceed.  We informed her that early data suggests one dose of the Moderna vaccine may confer an approximate 80% protection.  She will present to EHS for further evaluation.

I slept for one hour and woke up with intense chills, muscle aches, and pins and needles all throughout my body. I developed a headache and became short of breath an hour later, and was unable to walk more than a few feet without becoming extremely fatigued. 15 hours later I&#39;m still experiencing the same symptoms.

I was advised to take benadryl, but I&#39;ve had a bad response to benadryl in the past so I didn&#39;t want to take it. 2 hours later, a swollen rash the size of an inch began to develop. I felt very tired and went to bed early. By the next morning the rash was still swollen and painful and doubled in size. Today, day 3, the hot and swollen rash is 4 inches in size. I also have chills, diarrhea and fatigue. My arm feels weak and sore in the bone (if that makes sense). I&#39;m not sure if this is the worse of it. I consulted a telemedicine dr and was advised to wait it out. I have documented with photos.

                                                I woke up in extreme pain in my right shoulder. I couldn&#39;t lift my arm without the help of my other arm.  Raising it and lowering were extremely painful.  I couldn&#39;t raise it above my waist. This lasted for about 8 hours. I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and I could finally move my arm to chest level but it still ached, even when just laying at my side so I had to hold it to my chest. After 4 days, it felt better but there was still pain when raising my arm over my head. It felt like I had ripped something in my shoulder at the rotator cuff. 4 days later, the pain came back and I had to once again hold my arm at chest level for 2 days. Yesterday, January 28th, I went to my doctor and received a steroid injection in my shoulder and they also put in MRI orders.

On day 7 my left arm was sore. My left hand and fingers started tingling. No pain.  Area of injection site was warm with a small red splotch around the area (maybe 1x1&#34;). Day 8- worsening splotchy area. Day 9 (right now as I&#39;m typing) the area is about 3x5&#34;. It&#39;s still warm. No tingling sensation but my left had is weak and feels numb.

                                                At approximately 11:45 pm the same day I received my second Moderna injection for Covid, I woke up from sleep shivering uncontrollably. I felt like I was chilled to the bone and was shivering so hard my muscles all felt contracted. I did not have a fever at this time. I got extra blankets and tuned heat up and over next 45 minutes managed to decrease shivering. Around this time, I rechecked my temperature and had a fever of 101.7. I used tylenol and later motrin as the fever kept rising. I was in and out of sleep with severe body aches, arm pain at site of injection, and increasing fever even after taking ibuprofen an hour later. My temp eventually reached a max of 104.5 at which point I uncovered myself and got ice packs for my head and neck. I managed to get my fever down to about 102.6 and it stayed in that range until about 445am the next morning. I was finally able to get a little rest. When I woke at 815am, my fever was 100.5. From there, the more notable issues were the intense body and joint pains and skin sensitivity along with increasing arm pain at site of injection. My fever managed to stay low grade around 99.5 throughout the day but then started increasing again in the evening. At about 500pm, it was at 100.8. I took more medication to reduce it and was unable to sleep until about 2am still from the pain. I then slept for approx 6 hours into Sunday morning,  today, and have had no fever. I am improving with pains, but have noticed red blotchy areas near my injection site which still hurts immensely but is tolerable.

                                                Was warned but for tracking purposes did want to report flu like symptoms after the vaccination. Fever of 101, chills, aches, some nausea, and feeling like my body was on fire at times. I did have to leave early from work due to Advil and Tylenol not improving symptoms. I am however feeling a little better now over 48 hours post vaccine but still have some aches in legs and joints.

Also had a slight metallic taste in my mouth that subsided within 10 minutes. My upper lip began to swelling along the edge only. The tingling and swelling subsided after 3 hours. On day 4 after the vaccine, my left arm felt &#34;cool and heavy&#34; for 3 hours, and returned on day 5 (02/01/21).

                                                Immediately when I got this dose the arm itched and then my body felt a cold rush, a minute or so after my knees down and elbows down felt cold and numb and I felt pins and needles in my hands and feet. I went home and two or three hours later I felt the peripheral neuropathy had faded and I experienced headache and fatigue and muscle soreness Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday night the hands and feet felt numb and tingly again and it has not subsided yet, the hands and feet and part of my forearm has been tingling and feeling numb all day today consistently. I have motor skills I just have very cold hands with pins and needles yet it is not in pain.  All other symptoms have resolved . I am hoping to get some advice or information on this side effect.

                                                Started with pain at the sight of injection within hours of receiving injection. Progressed to sore left side of neck, then headache and sinus pain with nausea. Woke up around 11pm feeling achy all over with chills. Temperature was 100.8F. Through the night and the next day, the fever fluctuated with the highest temp recorded being 102.7F. Other symptoms experienced overnight and continuing to present include headache, body aches, sinus pain, nausea, ear pain, slight sore throat, pain at the injection site.

                                                Approximately 10 mins after dose I experienced lightheadedness, diaphoresis, racing heart, chest pressure, nausea and vomiting. I was taken to the ED and given Benadryl, IV fluids and had continued nausea, lightheadedness and developed a headache. After Benadryl the symptom resolved except for lightheadedness and headache. Today I have symptoms very similar to flu headache, lightheadedness, nausea, muscle aches, joint aches and overall fatigue.

Symptoms lasted 6 days post injection diminishing on day 5 to include only moderate fatigue. On day 7 post injection, the first phyical activity (skiing) immediatly resulted in heart pain (angina) and inability to take a deep breath. Assessment at the ER for a heart attack showed higher than normal range of troponin (.031)but a clear x-ray and EKG. Tests were repeated 4 hours after initial tests and troponin was within normal limits (.020). I was discharged with a 2/100 risk of heart attack in the next 30 days and a follow up stress test. I believe this was a direct result of the Covid-19 Maderna shot. I believe is reduced my hearts ability to work at a normal capacity and respond to physical activity.

Throughout thr day fever just kept getting higher, up to 103. Along with by 4 pm walking felt like a chore and the pain was so bad could barely walk without crying. Kept on taking ibuprofen. By Saturday morning fever finally broke woke up sweating at 3 am then again at 9 am. Now just feeling really exhausted, headache and a little sore. A lot better.

Thursday and Friday I felt a little achy and cold but Saturday I woke up with pain under my right clavicle (almost like post surgery gas pain). It has not gone away and is not relieved with ibuprofen.  I also have weakness/numbness in my right arm and it feels crampy and uncomfortable. Today is day 8 since my shot.

                                                4 days after injection soreness developed in my left armpit and soreness in left and right side of neck - where lymph nodes are.  5 days after soreness in lymph nodes in neck were gone. Tender and soreness in armpit continued. 6 days after noticed for the first time redness and skin slightly raised at injection site. No itching or burning which is why I didn&#39;t notice until I saw my arm in the mirror. Soreness and tenderness still in armpit.    My conclusion is that my lymph nodes are swollen and tender. There is no additional pain or discomfort.  Treatment - Massaging lymph nodes with hopes to helping them drain.

I experienced muscle and joint pain, which was to be expected.  Approximately 2 days afterwards, I started to experience dizziness, low blood pressure, and pressure in the middle of the back of my head.  The pressure became worse and worse, while continuing to experience the above side effects.  Since that time, I have been to the emergency room for pain all over, pressure in the back of the head, memory issues, blood in the stool, and extremely cold hands and feet without explanation.

                                                16 week and 6 days pregnant. Due date is 8/8/2021.  I received my 1st dose of Moderna COVID vaccine around 5/45pm on Thursday 2/25 by a woman at the High School.  The shot felt fine at the time but I did notice she went a bit higher up on my shoulder.  However, the morning after, I was experiencing extreme shoulder pain with limited range of motion as the day progressed on 2/26. By night time of 2/26, I couldn?t remove my bra and had to ask my husband for assistance. I?m scared and terrified that I won?t be able to hold my newborn baby when he?s born. This is all I can think about. I don?t even care that I?m in severe pain. All I can think about is how this is going to ruin my experience caring for my child without full range in one of my arms. It?s 2:37am where I am and I can?t sleep because of the shoulder pain.

                                                I got the normal fever, aches, chills, headache 2 hours after I got the shot and it lasted 2 days. By the third day I began feeling short of breath while talking.  The shortness of breath (SOB) lasted 3 days and was present for about half a day each. Then it all went away. On tuesday, Feb 16th, I began to feel SOB again but this time under my L breast I had pain. I tried to see if it was muscle (I am a PT) but could not tell. The next day the pain moved near where my sternum meets my ribs and then I worked on that and it has been there ever since. It feel heavy and I get chest discomfort on inhalation. I have seen primary care, they said to wait a few weeks and let them know if it is still there. I decided to report my symptoms now because I thought it would go away but it still has not and it does not seem normal to me. I did notice if I take an aleve it feels better but today that has not helped either. I hear that this vaccine can cause inflammation and so I am just wondering is this normal for what I am feeling?

                                                Inner ear pain (outer ear does not hurt) in my right ear. I started feeling this pain about 2 weeks after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (I received the second dose in my right arm). It presents itself about 3 times a day, nothing ignites or lessens the pain, it feels like a sharp stabbing pain, intensity 4/10 and lasts less than a second. Also presenting itchiness inside the ear canal.  Additionally, swollen and painful to the touch axillary lymph nodes. I noticed them about 2 weeks after receiving the first and second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. They appeared on the same side of the vaccinated arm (i.e., left arm vaccinated, left axillary lymph nodes). They&#39;re sensitive to the touch, intensity 5/10. Did not take NSAIDs to reduce the pain (was afraid it might have been a breast lump, but ultrasound ruled it out and confirmed it was a swollen lymph node).

Then, the following Saturday, (7 days after  the shot) my arm started to hurt again.  It&#39;s now Tuesday and it still hurts and feels stiff.

Later in day, developed pain and weakness going down the entire right arm into the hand and wrist. My right forearm and first 3 fingers were twitching/shaky for 3 days. My neuropathy also flared up (freezing/burning sensation in both hands and feet). Still having some weakness in right wrist 1 week later, and cold/burning in hands and feet but seems to be slowly improving.

                                                I was eating lunch with friends around 1pm when I suddenly began having a tingling feeling all over my body. I became hot, flush, sweaty, and dizzy. I proceeded to the bathroom where I appeared pale. I took my pulse which was extremely slow (20-40bpm). I realized I may die or pass out. I reached for the door and I don&#39;t remember anything until waking up on the bathroom floor. I was able to get up on my own. I was able to compose myself and walk to my car. I got a ride home. I remained dizzy and having heart palpitations for about 1 hour. I did not seek medical care. I continued to having hot flashing and tingling feelings throughout the evening. Today, 3/5, I have joint pain and fatigue and occasional dizziness.

I reached out to my doctor and saw her on 2/18/21 and the spots had cleared up.  My second dose was given on 2/20/21. I have felt similar pains in my earlier affected joints. The pain is not as bad, yet and there are no red spots.

I also had nightly episodes of hot flashes that lasted 5 days 4 weeks after my 1st dose.  I have never experienced a hot flash before in my life.  After my second dose, I began my period 6 days later which was 10 days earlier than expected.  It has also been much heavier than normal with unusual cramping in both my lower abdomen and lower back, much like my contractions I had with my first child during childbirth.

                                                1 week after Moderna vaccine, my left deltoid started itching. Skin colored raised bumps appeared, 1 at first, then quickly spread to a 2x3 inch area. I took Benadryl orally and applied Benadryl cream. The next day, a 2x3 inch red, slightly raised mark was there. Itchy, painful like a burn, and deep muscle soreness that was there immediately after the shot and had gone away, returned. The red spot was under the vaccine injection site, not around it. Almost like where gravity brought the vaccine fluid after the injection. It lasted 3 days and then went away.

The next day, I experienced muscle soreness / achiness, a mild headache, and fatigue for the majority of the day.  I did not have chills, but had difficulty feeling / getting warm for a period of several hours. Minor body aches have persisted 2-3 days after the vaccination.  Noticed more pain/discomfort in the armpit area of arm where injection was given on day 3.

This worsened throughout the night and caused me to be awake in pain most of the evening. The pain in the injection site arm continued for 2 days.  I experienced a stiff neck the day of the shot. This went away by the 2nd day. Then, 5 days after receiving the shot I began to experience pain in my underarm, like I had been bruised inside my armpit, of the same arm that received the shot. This pain in my armpit lasted for 4 days.

                                                Approximately six hours after receiving my second dose of the vaccine on 2/11/2021, I had chills, nausea, joint pain, a feeling of heaviness like I couldn&#39;t move or walk, a migraine. Most of those symptoms lasted for 36 hours, however the headache and the chills remained. The following Tuesday (2/16) I starting having severe difficulty breathing and was gasping often. I tried my inhaler and that did nothing. This persisted. On 3pm Thurs (2/18) I started feeling dizzy and by 4:30pm I could not stand. Went to the doctor on Friday (2/19) with a fever of about 100, inability to walk without assistance. I&#39;ve also been having memory problems. I went to a balance center EMT on 3/10 for a repositioning procedure and I still Additional information for Item 18: feel dizzy, so there were no results to date.

                                                About 12 hours exactly after getting the 2nd dose I got extreme POTS flare up and a mild occular migraine.  I had a fever that kept going from the mid 99s to the 101s for 36 hrs.  Was freezing and burning and had lots of joint and body pain.  Most people I know had all of that, but the reason I?m reporting is the tachycardia.  My tachy has been fairly well controlled with meds and after my second dose it was so bad any time I sat up, I couldn?t breath, my tachy got so bad, my heart rate would jump from up to 70bpms, just sitting up.  My resting heart rate on meds has been 60-80, and for those 36 hours was 80-110.  Anytime I did anything my heart rate would jump to 130-150 and I could NOT BREATH.  My SpO2 was fine, so I know that the issue was my POTS flaring up and that it was the tachy.  I just want to report that it could cause issues with people with dysautonomia, so they don?t freak out if it happens.  My heart rate is still elevated, but is slowly going back down.

                                                A medical provider and myself already reported an allergic reaction that started about 24-30 hours post vaccination (rash on chest, high blood pressure, feeling unwell, chest tightness). On 3/23 in the afternoon, my right knee started suddenly swelling and became painful. I went to the ER to rule out a blood clot- which was not indicated. It was determined the lymph node in the back of my knee (same side as my shot arm) was swelling due to moderna. I was given naproxen to treat it for one week.

                                                Minutes after receiving the shot on Monday, 3/22/2021 at approximately 11:15am, I (F/37yo) felt a very small, but acute tightness/pressure in my upper right chest area. I didn&#39;t initially report it as it was not one of the listed reactions I had read about in the information given to me -- I assumed I was very anxious, maybe breathing nervously, and that it would go away. The next day I felt very fatigued, light-headed, had extreme muscle and joint pain throughout my body, slight nausea, and the injection site (my left arm) was very sore. I took Tylenol and slept.  I felt weak and &#34;off&#34; the whole day. The acute chest pain I felt after the shot had now become less &#34;acute&#34; and turned into a wider and duller general pressure. The next day, Tuesday, I also began feeling intermittent flashes of hot or cold-like patches in my head, which I also consider a part of a general inflammation my body might be having. It is now Thursday, 3/25/2021 and the chest pressure has increased even more, having now spread from the upper right side to include the center of my chest. My headache is still lingering, I still don&#39;t feel like my normal self and feel &#34;off&#34; somehow, and the chest pressure is worrying me because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on internally. I reported the chest pain to my doctor and was told that my exact reactions don&#39;t make any sense in relation to the known adverse reactions to the Moderna COVID vaccine. I was advised to report this here and to also go to an urgent care clinic or emergency room if my symptoms worsen.

Third day was was much better, arm mildly sore but no chills or body aches.  No fever on any day.

                                                Itching started 2 hours after injection. Chest, then back. Got worse in the middle of the night- groin and ankles very itchy.  1 week later (today) itchiness periodically continues - ankles, wrists, chest, scalp, groin. 24 hours after injection I had the most severe headache I?ve ever experienced, that strangely was worse when lying down. 2 Advil and propping myself in a sitting position to sleep helped it go away, and it hasn?t returned. It was so sudden (woke me up) and so severe that I had considered going to the ER since I already had experienced one adverse reaction to the vaccination. The headache was bilateral and felt like swelling at the top of my cervical spine and bottom of my occipital bone. Standing and moving my head temporarily decreased the pain and nausea, but I think Advil really helped the most.

                                                A sore left underarm (armpit) - noticeably larger than the right (inflamed). Could feel and see the lymph node. Also, on the left side - the lymph node on the base of my neck - between neck and collarbone was significantly large and inflamed. Nothing on right side (all on the left side.) That subsided in about a week and a half - the armpit one. The one in the neck lasted about 2 weeks. The other thing I noticed was sciatica pain  (both sides) (within a week of the vaccine)- I&#39;ve never had this before. And I noticed hip pain/tightness of the right side  (I noticed this pain after the second vaccine)- if I sit with my legs crossed,  or sit with one leg underneath, I can only do that a minute or two without  it being really uncomfortable. I had a doctor visit for the swollen lymph node on January 19th. She just did an exam and asked me if I had my vaccine and told me it was a side affect of vaccine.  Have not recovered from the hip pain and sciatica pain yet and that is intermittent. Have recovered from the lymph nodes swollen.

The vertigo symptoms subsided after 2-3 days and treatment in the emergency room however the tinnitus has become permanent in my left ear for over 3 weeks now. It is loud enough to disrupt my sleeping and my ability to hear from my left ear. I still have slight dizziness spells intermittently. Additionally, I have begun to experience extreme arthritis and muscular pain throughout my body, which begun 2 weeks after the 2nd dose. I have begun to lose function intermittently of my feet, fingers, and arms at different times throughout the day.

The pain around my ankle was more severe than ever right after getting out of my car and walking to the office. I got the 24 hours body aches. It is almost 5 days later and my ankle hasn?t gotten any better after the shot. I know I have tendonitis and a fused ankle and I?ve always get the pain. But normally it?s after 3/4 hours of work. It just doesn?t feel like the casual pain I?ve been having since I fused my ankle. This one feels more severe. Am I the only one?

Pain progressed as did stiffness within an hour to the point that I can barely move my neck without significant pain to neck and down into shoulder. It has been like this for almost 5 hours now and has not improved.   Prior to this - the day and night i got vaccinated I felt fine. the following day I had a pretty bad headache. And then this morning this new thing happened. I am not worried about the headache as that is normal. I am worried about this severe pain and stiffness that is localized in one part of my body and is not going away.

                                                1/2/2021: In the evening, I  started experiencing swelling (felt like a hard knot under the skin), itching, redness, and heat at the injection site. Earlier in the day I noticed a little pain discomfort in my right arm pit. As the day wore on, I noticed swelling in my lymph nodes and the level of discomfort increased to the point that it disturbed my sleep. 1/3/2021: The pain and swelling at the injection site and armpit continued to be the same. I took ibuprofen to try and alleviate the level of discomfort. That evening before bed also took Benadryl to see if it would help with the injection site reaction. I also started experiencing a dull shooting pain and tingling from my armpit down to my wrist on my right arm. 1/4/2021: The injection site improved, no more knot, heat, or itching. It still remained a little swollen. Lymph nodes were still swollen throughout the day, but manageable with ibuprofen. Shooting pain and tingling still occurring sporadically throughout the day. 1/5/2021: Still a little discomfort in the armpit, but seems to be improving.

Around 0700am I developed weakness, dizziness and nausea with the other symptoms throughout the rest of the day. Took Tylenol and rested but woke up feeling the same at 4pm. Took my temperature at 5pm which was 100.00. Attempted to call vaccine information line but they closed at 5pm and left voicemail message with VAERS.

                                                I got the shot at 7 am. Nausea started at 8 am the day of the shot. That night my arm was sore and i got a headache/tiredness. Nausea, tiredness and headaches are still going on a week later. On Monday the 11th i noticed that it felt like i had a cyst under my arm but im later told it could be my lymphoid that could be swollen. I&#39;ve also have had muscle weakness and fatigue since a few days after the shot.

I took a Benedryl or Claritin and Advil.  Eight  hours after the 1st vaccine, I experienced severe aches and pain, fatigue lasting almost 72hrs. Even the joints of fingers aches but the pain in my lymph node in my left armpit felt like someone hit me with a baseball bat (injection was in left arm).

Since administration of the vaccine, one week ago, I have had a lump at the injection site. Yesterday, I noticed pain in my axillary region and noted a very enlarged (approximately the size of a cherry) and tender lymph node along with other smaller, nontender, lymph nodes. I have other enlarged, mildly tender,  lymph nodes in the area of my clavicle as well. These lymph nodes are ipsilateral to the injection site.

Symptoms lasted approx 36 hours.  About 24 hours after administration, started with weakness, near syncope, and nausea with dry heaving.  This lasted an additional 24 hours.  There is persistent weakness in left arm compared to right when moving arm overhead.  This weakness has persisted more than 3 weeks after injection.

                                                Moderate redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site for the first 2-3 days that resolved (along with mild fever and myalgias).  Then 1 week later, on 1/15 I woke up with a very large red, hot, itchy patch on my left biceps around my injection site.  It is not as bright now, but still very large (larger than my palm) and intermittently itchy.  It will be 2 weeks from my injection tomorrow.  I am concerned about whether or not to get the second dose as I am afraid this was some sort of allergic reaction and I read that many people experience more significant adverse reactions to the second dose.  I did check in with a health care provider at my clinic and she only suggested ice and Tylenol, which provided relief of itchiness, but no improvement.  I also notified Moderna.  No one seems to know for sure if I should receive the second dose.

On 12/30/2020 at 4pm, patient noticed left upper arm reddened &amp; itching at the injection site. It first appeared as a red oval, then over the next few days turned more blotchy &amp; scattered over the left upper arm. She took Motrin &amp; Tylenol every 6 hours for 2 days. On Saturday, 01/02/21 patient awoke with stiffness in her neck &amp; pronounced pain in the joints of both hands. She had done nothing out of the ordinary the previous day. Pain felt dull &amp; constant but it worsened when she tried to open/close her hands. She took Aleve on 01/02/21 &amp; 01/03/21 for the symptoms. By 01/04/21 joint pain &amp; redness/itching at the injection site had eased off.

                                                Left arm pain began on Thurs. 1/7/21, approximately 30 minutes after vaccine.  Severe headache and pain radiating to left side of neck began approximately 22 hours after vaccine (around 2pm on 1/8/21) and left arm pain worsened.  On 1/9/21, unable to get out of bed-felt like I had been drugged- severe HA, fatigue, and left side of neck soreness.  Felt slightly better on 1/10/21 and 1/11/21, however stil unable to get out of bed due to severe HA and fatigue.  On morning of 1/12/21, fatigue relieved and severe HA relieved around 1pm.  Since 1/12/21, Severe HA, left arm tightness and left neck soreness has continued intermittently.  This is a HA I have never experienced before.  Yesterday, on 1/21/21, I had a severe HA all day at work and when I went home, I had to lie down the rest of the day/evening d/t severe HA, fatigue and left neck tightness.  I was unable to do daily chores and help my children with their homework.  I also woke up this morning with the same severe HA and left neck soreness/tightness.  I do feel this HA is from the vaccine as I have never experienced this type of HA prior to receiving the vaccine and I am not someone who gets HA&#39;s often.    I know the vaccine was given too high, as I give vaccines often for my career, and I am wondering if that has anything to do with my neck pain.  I did bleed a lot with the injection (do not think it went into my muscle) and am wondering if that has anything to do with my adverse reaction.  I am fearful these severe HA&#39;s will continue and I am extremely hesitant to receive my second dose!

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was dizzy. I sat down where they had us wait and the dizziness wouldn&#39;t go away. Became difficult to swallow - felt like a lump in my throat. More difficult to breathe then normal. Vitals taken. BP taken. Feeling like I had an epidural. Legs had a sensation like they were going numb and then they went numb. Benadryl injection given. Legs felt like they fell asleep. Waited and within second 30 min timeframe I was feeling a lot better so I left. 2:30 in the morning, my legs were asleep again and the lump came back in my throat and took Benadryl and it went away and I felt fine. I went to work the next day. At 7:00 that evening felt chilled and it came and went. I came up and took more Benadryl and rested.I went to work the next day and I sent a message to my Primary Care DR. - but leg was fine and the lump in throat wasn&#39;t there. On Saturday morning - after 10 days - had a headache that would not go away  (Very severe headache)- took Tylenol 1000 mg it didn&#39;t work. It was very bad Saturday night I took another Tylenol 1000 and Sunday morning it - headache still wasn&#39;t gone. Leg was numb again. This time the leg  numbness was worse than ever had felt. Left axilla - there was a lump/nodule and it was painful. Tried TeleHealth Med and they recommended I go to ER but I didn&#39;t feel good enough to do it. Dr.  I reached out to her and she took the history and she prescribed Prednisone; but wanted me to do a COVID test and Urine sample to see how I was doing before I took the medication so I did it next the day. Urine sample was clean. Prednisone 60 for four days 40 for four days and 20 for four days - On day Prednisone my legs feel fine, but the headache just lingers. On day two of Prednisone she told me to stop the Benadryl. Three days after Prednisone the lump under axilla resolved. I am taking coffee. Headache is still there but not as severe.

                                                Numbness and tingling in toes about an hour after the injection. Chills, all over body aches, joint pain and fever started a little over 12 hours after the time of the injection. Fever went as high as 102.2. I took Motrin to break fever and then fever would come back again a few hours later. Symptoms lasted about 44 hours before symptoms started to subside and I was feeling better.

The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

                                                On the day of the vaccine I had usual arm soreness. For about 1 hour in the evening I had chills and felt nauseous. I felt fine after that. One week later I woke up and my entire arm was very sore. I thought I slept on it wrong. The pain radiated down my entire arm. Later in the morning, my wrist was incredibly sore and throbbing with pain.  Later that evening I started to rub my arm at the injection site and felt a large, hard bump. I looked at my arm and noticed a red rash in the area as well. I called the Health Dept (who gave the vaccine) and they said to ice it and take advil, which I did. The next day the swelling went down a little bit, but the rash area is much bigger &amp; is not hot to the touch. Today is day 3 of this &amp; the rash &amp; heat are the same. It is less painful than the first day of this reaction.  I googled this and I am seeing people call this &#34;COVID arm.&#34; It does not itch though.

Saturday morning - fever down to 99.9; joint pain and body aches still there. Yesterday (the31st) I had low grade fever in the morning - 99.3 and some body aches and I took Tylenol (started taking this yesterday, 31st). Today, Feb 1, 2021, I have swelling and redness in my arm. Not right on the vaccine site - it&#39;s a bit lower and it&#39;s warm at touch. It hurts where the redness where it feels hot (not at the vaccine site). I am still using the arm but it does hurt to try to lift it.  The body aches and joint pain have gone and I haven&#39;t felt like I have a fever today.

                                                About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started feeling really hot especially in head and face. From there, I had fever and it started going up. Body aches; joint pain; headache; and this went on all throughout that night (Jan 2 and morning of the 3rd). The 3rd, my fever wasn&#39;t as high but I still had fever and felt really really tired and body aches/joint pain. On the 4th, when I woke up I noticed that I didn&#39;t have any taste and smell and so I went in and got tested for COVID 19 (the 4th) - positive for COVID-19.  I went to a clinic that could do a Rapid test. Doctor there gave me Azithromyocin - 2 the first day and one every day after; Dexamethasone once  a day for 10 days.  I could  Tylenol and Motrin (alternating because my fever wouldn&#39;t go down). The highest my fever got was that Saturday night got up to 103 degrees. The last day I had fever was the 5th of January and that was 99.8. Jan 7, 8, and 9th -  I continued to have other symptoms like really severe headache; no appetite; felt super tired and could hardly get out of bed. Those symptoms resolved about the 10th of Jan -  headache almost went away and fatigue was still there and it is still there. I got out of quarantine on the 15th and I went back to work on the 18th - I had no fever. I just felt tired. I couldn&#39;t sleep - throughout. I finally started being able to sleep just a couple of days ago. I had the second dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 30th - I had fever again; body aches; joint pain.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

                                                Nine days after I received the vaccine, around 3pm my injection site started itching.  I did not scratch it.  Around 6pm, the injection site was red and warm to the touch, and I could feel small bumps under the skin.  I took a Benadryl and a 500mg Tylenol but did not notice a difference.  Upon waking at 5am the next day, the injection site was swollen, bright red, hot to the touch, and the small bumps had joined together and become a singular very hard lump.  The site was itching and burning, and my arm felt heavy and tired when I tried to do anything, such as holding a phone.  This continued for about 48 hours.  After that time, the symptoms began to slowly recede.  As of 2/3, I still have a faint brown oval discoloration at the injection site, but no other symptoms remain.

                                                Severe arm pain within 30 minutes of administration. Pain radiates down entire left arm to fingertips and up to left side of neck. Range of motion is limited. With the first dose of Moderna my left arm was sore for 3 days after the injection, range of motion was limited by pain, however, I was still able to actively move my arm through all planes. With this 2nd dose active range of motion is limited due to pain, unable to achieve full range of motion without physically assisting with right arm. When actively assisting, the left arm is still limited due to pain. I did call Walgreens the same day that the dose was given at 3:13 PM to inquire about this reaction. I was told to take OTC for the pain.

                                                Swollen axillary lymph node on the same side of injection site (left arm), which was observed 5 days after the vaccination was given and accompanied by moderate pain upon contact.  PCP was seen 12 days after receiving the vaccine as the size of the axillary bump was not decreasing.  Continued monitoring and warm wet compresses were recommended to rule out possible cyst.  The axillary bump increased in size again about 15 days out from vaccination before noticeably getting smaller 3 days later.  It was determined to be a swollen lymph node the next day at the follow-up appointment and continues to decrease in size.  Other symptoms that were experienced were hot flashes within 45 minutes of vaccination that lasted for a couple of hours and nausea the following morning.

They went away pretty much after the first day.  But on day 7 in the afternoon I started to feel the injection site itchy and a  hard  bump  the size of a quarter dollar was formed. I went to bed with pain in the arm as well. The next day(  8), I woke up with a much bigger induration. The redness and itchiness had spread more . I also had pain in the arm. Today day  9 I feel better and the induration is less.

                                                Moderna shot #2: About 6-8 hours in, I got the expected serious joint aches, chills, headache, and fever (101F). This lasted for about 2 days, managed well by alternating Motrin and Tylenol. A mild rash occurred a few days after shot #2.   Thought I was done since most of my colleagues bounced back after 2-3 days. Then 48 hours in, I developed a racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools. No position or relaxation method would resolve these symptoms. All I could do was lie down perfectly still with an ice pack on my forehead and hope this was short-lived and would pass. I could not sleep. I had no appetite. Over the 8 days this has been occurring, I lost 3 pounds.  I could not find any literature of anyone else having any cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. It scared me. I have no prior cardiac history and no history of anxiety. I went to the ER. Labwork showed an elevated D-dimer (luckily the CT scan showed NO blood clots), elevated WBC/neutrophils, and low potassium. Thyroid labs (which I had tested a few days later) were normal. The ER assumed the abnormal labs were due to the immune response to the vaccine and referred me to a cardiologist.   I did a virtual visit with the cardiologist the next day. He suggested a heart monitor and scheduling an echo. The heart monitor was mailed to me. I started wearing it on 2/4/21 (3 days ago). I am supposed to wear it for 7 days and then mail it back. My echo is scheduled for 3/4/21. Again, I have had no previous cardiac history. I am an active, healthy 38 y/o F.   These symptoms (racing heart (HR in the 110-120s), sweating palms/soles, tingling/numbness in the feet/arms, warm flushes over my chest, nausea, and a few loose stools) have continued to last for another 8 days and are debilitating. I have not been able to work.   On day 7 of these symptoms, I called my PCP?s emergency line. They suggested calling the cardiologist to see if they would consider prescribing a beta blocker for symptomatic relief. I called the cardiologist last night. They prescribed Metoprolol. I haven?t taken it yet. It?s officially day 8. I thought I was in the clear and had not had symptoms since last night, but then just now another episode of these cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms have occurred but less intense than previously.   At this point, I have had had 10 days of symptoms post Moderna vaccine #2 but 8 of those days are specifally the cardiac/dysautonomia symptoms. Although a little better, these symptoms have NOT resolved and continue.  I realize I am probably an outlier in terms of how I have reacted to this vaccine. I would love a call back to know if other people have had a similar experience, so I can understand if this is ?normal.? I understand 7% of patients in the Moderna vaccine trial had ?symptoms? lasting longer than 7 days. Were they symptoms similar to mine? Will this go away completely? Any help is appreciated.   Of note, I did develop a nice rash below my injection site on Moderna shot #1. Does that mean I?m more ?reactogenic? and would potentially have a harder time with shot #2? Does size matter in how you will react? Moderna is 100 mcg (instead of Pfizer?s 30 mcg) I am petite (5?2? and am now 106 lbs since I?ve lost weight).

The red areas were swollen, hot to touch, and each were a hard lump a little larger than a marble.  These two spots were about 3 inches below the injection site and an inch closer to the body midline.  These red spots worsened and joined together.  1/28/21 I was still experiencing the red raised area that had grown in size, still hot to the touch and now red and rashy around the outer edge.  Redness diminished over the weekend and resolved by 2/3/21.  Arm and shoulder still are achy and sore.

Next day, it was like full blown Covid all over again - joint aches; fever - 101.6; sweats; body aches; rash around the injection site; headache; redness and warmness around injection site, too. I had extreme fatigue.I had a terrible cough. I didn&#39;t have a sore throat. I had a lot of shortness of breath. My shortness of breath and my cough was still lingering (from when I had COVID before the vaccine). Went to URGENT Care on Friday, 8th; They Took chest x-ray - COVID pneumonia -was what DR called - antibiotics  - took one course but didn&#39;t finish the second and prednisone - did finish the course of the asteroids. Next day they said the radiologist said it wasn&#39;t pneumonia.  I still felt pretty crappy the following week and then I was fine. I didn&#39;t work 11th or 12th but as the week went on I started feeling better. Symptoms have resolved. I had the second vaccine on February 2nd, 2021. It went better then first - but I had joint aches; fatigue; headache;chills on the day after and then they slowly tapered off the next two days and then I felt fine.

Symptoms began almost immediately following ingestion of lamotrigine and lasted approximately 5-7 min. Other symptoms include-fever (100.4), extreme body chills, swelling in left knee, extreme fatigue, painful muscles at site of injection. Symptoms began approximately 12 hours following injection. High fever and extreme body chills lasted approximately 3 hours, low grade fever and fatigue lasted ~24 hours after injection, swelling in left knee lasted ~ 4-5 days following injection.

                                                On 2/12/21,&#34;almost two weeks after the vaccine was received, I started having sever muscle spasms. They were shooting through the right side of my neck and shoulder. Any sudden movement or wrong movement triggered the spasms.  Even taking too deep of a breath triggered the spasms.  Using my left arm to lift something triggered the spasms. My pain level that day was at a 10&#43;. On Saturday the spasms had subsided, but I  still had very limited ROM in my neck. It felt like my neck muscles had been over worked and my neck felt weak. Pain continued and I went my doctor on Monday 2/15/21. After me explaining to him the course of events and letting him know I did not do anything at all that could have caused an injury,  he felt this was a reaction to the Covid vaccine I had gotten on 2/1/21. He advised me to take my muscle relaxer that he had already prescribed to me and to use a heating pad.  He gave me some exercises to do with my neck and prescribed me Hydrocodone 5-325 mg to take as needed every 8 hours for pain. He told me if it got worse or did not get better to follow-up with him.

The next day, I had chills and a mild fever, along with swollen and sore arm. Through the weekend, I developed redness in splotches that were similar to hives in appearance. My arm has been intensely itchy. On Saturday, 2.20.21, the lymph node under my left arm became very swollen and painful. I am currently still experiencing a mildly sore arm (pain has lessened since yesterday), arm is still very hot to the touch, still have red rash/hives and my lymph node is still very painful.

Entire right arm feels weak and aches, similar to growing pains.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:25 pm on Saturday Feb 13th. I woke up early Sunday unable to sleep due to all over body aches and joint pain. I did not have a fever at any point. I had chills off and on, but mostly horrible body aches everywhere. My left arm was also extremely sore. I knew this was all normal so I was not at all worried. Then Sunday evening my right knee started aching more than the rest of my body and started swelling. I took ibuprofen and went to bed. When I woke up Monday morning it was severely swollen and bright red and heat was radiating  from it.  I had to take a day off of work because I stand at work and it was making it much worse. So I iced it and elevated it and took ibuprofen, but it remained swollen and red and very painful. I was unable to bend the knee and couldn&#39;t crouch down or bend the knee to sit.  On Wednesday morning I went to my doctor at the clinic on the advice or a friend that is a nurse and a friend that is a pharmacist. See below (item 19) for what was prescribed. This took away the severe swelling within about a day and a half, but it&#39;s still painful and achy and hurts to bend. There is also still a bump on the top of my knee.  The all over body aches and joint pain lasted until about Friday the 19th . I have photos of my knee if you would like them.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

That same night, I started feeling soreness in the right shoulder, where I received the injection. The next afternoon, Saturday February 27, about 24 hours after I received the vaccine, I felt fatigued, but felt better after a 30-minute nap. On both of those days, I needed to put a cold ice pack on my sore shoulder. On Sunday morning, February 28, I noticed some redness on my right upper arm. The morning of March 1, I noticed that the area of redness was larger, measuring 4 inches wide by 6 inches long. On March 2, the redness was even larger, measuring 7 inches by 5-1/2 inches.

EE stated that she is visiting her NP next week for an assessment of left shoulder.

The second day, I also had  body aches.  It&#39;s been about 3  weeks and I have some pain on my back and chest. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s related. l seemed to have it after the vaccine.  I also feel out of breath often.  I am now fearful of getting the second vaccine,  since the first one was so bad for me.

He checked with the patient and she said she was ok.  A few minutes later noticed the patient was even more flushed.  At that time went and evaluated the patient - her BP was elevated 150/94 HR of 112 ad Pulse ox of 96%.  The patient reported feeling different than how she felt after her previous injection.  Clinic team offered for patient to be transferred to ER for further evaluation if she would like which the patient accepted.  She was transferred to ER via wheelchair in less than 5 minutes in stable condition with mild nausea.  She was cared for in ER by Dr.  Patient reported feeling tired and &#39;heavy&#39; in the ER.  Dr evaluation found a generally healthy patient with a non-toxic appearance  Lungs were clear and no obvious signs of swelling or other signs of an immediate allergic reaction.  Patient was given oral diphenhydramine and observed until she felt comfortable going home.  Discharged from ER at 1733

Approximately 4.5 hours later on January 6, 2021, I went outside in the cold temperatures. Upon returning inside to warmer air, the bilateral fingertips of both hands were pale white, numb, and painful. The time was 06:30 pm on January 6, 2021. At 06:47 pm, I felt a different feeling in the bilateral tips of my fingertips, and could see the color changing from pale white to a mixture of purple/black.  January 6, 2021 at 06:32 pm was the first time I have ever had my hands respond in this manner to cold temperatures. I have felt one fingertip go numb and turn white for a split second, only one time in my life but it was not a repeat occurrence, and it only lasted for about a second when it occurred. This experience and reaction I currently have lasts from 15-30 minutes of bilateral fingertip numbness and discoloration with pain. The bilateral fingertips of both hands now respond in this manner every time they are exposed to cold temperatures. I signed up for V-Safe and did state that I was having this symptom through the Vaccine reporting system on V-Safe under other&#39;&#39; multiple times. Treatment I received from a health provider are as follows; I had a telemedicine visit on January 14, 2021 at 12:51 pm to address my concern of ?reaction to Covid vaccine, fingertips were numb, lasting 30 mins?. On 1/14/2021, I received a primary diagnosis of Raynaud&#39;s Syndrome by my Primary Care Provider.  On 1/28/2021, I was seen in person by my Primary Care Provider for a Well Visit to complete a physical with my primary care provider. I was provided with a referral to a Rheumatologist for further advice about receiving the additional second Covid vaccination in the series. I also was ordered to do lab work. On 2/2/2021, I was seen by a Rheumatologist for new diagnosis of Raynaud?s Syndrome, and advised that risk outweighed the benefits in regards to receiving the second vaccination in the Moderna Covid-19 series. On 2/3/2021 at approximately 1:45 pm, I received the second Moderna Covid-19 vaccination.  On 2//10/2021, small red, itchy bumps started to appear on both sides of my neck. On 2/15/2021, a bump appeared above my right eyebrow with what felt like a pimple. On 2/21/2021, the pimple had spread towards my inner eye and above my right eyebrow making my right eyelid swell. I received telemedicine care via an e-visit over telehealth with an urgent care and was provided an antibiotic for facial cellulitis. On 2/22/2021, I had one episode of emesis, and went in person to an urgent care. I received a different prescription of an antibiotic, and was provided with instructions of signs and symptoms of what to look for when to report to the emergency room. On 2/25/2021, my right eye started tearing up and the pain began to intensify. I was seen in an outpatient Ophthalmology Clinic and diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus and postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia. I was placed on a leave of absence from work as of 2/26/2021. 3/1/2021, I was seen in-person appointment with my primary care provider hoping to provide a work note, further assessment of shingles that have spread over neck and back of neck. Primary Care Provider noted diminished bilateral lower extremity muscle weakness and absent deep tendon reflexes.  Primary Care Provider referred me to the Emergency room ASAP to rule out Guillain Barre and herpes zoster meningitis.  Evaluated by the Neurology Consult team in the Emergency Room. Discharged with diagnosis of disseminated shingles and muscle weakness. Appointment made to Neurologist follow up on March 16, 2021 and for EMG/NCS.  On 3/5/2021, seen in-person by Primary Care Provider for hospital follow up. I was feeling diminished sensation increasing in feet, muscle weakness and pain radiating up my back along my spine at times, and near my shoulder/neck. Primary Care Provider was unable to do anything for me.  3/5/2021, followed up with Neurology in person. An order placed for MRI with IV Contrast of Brain and Spine. 3/9/2021, MRI of brain and Spine with IV Contrast completed. 3/9/2021, a re-eruption of shingles started to appear on bilateral areas of my chin and middle of my forehead close to my eye where the nearly resolved shingles were on my eye. 3/10/2021- Order placed for lesions to be swabbed for HSV and VSV and Dermatology Consult placed for 3/15/2021.

About 8 hours after, started to feel febrile and chilled, which continued through the night.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I am experiencing intense itching and rash on torso, legs, neck, and scalp. The rash is maculopapular, but sometimes becomes inflamed and looks similar to hives. It is hot to the touch and very itchy--both of these symptoms are more intense at night. I have also observed chilblains are appearing on my fingers.  I regularly experienced chilblains from 2004-2010, but have had none since until now.  I also experienced chills, night sweats, and swollen lymph nodes. I attempted to treat the rash with triamcinolone acetone 0.1%, which was prescribed for a similar condition in the past, and OTC antihistamines, both oral and topical.  I saw my dermatologist on 3/16, who advised me to continue triamcinolone and also gave me a 40mg steroid injection. She believes the rash may be a response to my vaccine. I unfortunately have not experienced much relief yet, and the rash and intense itching continue.  The chilblains, however, are clearing.

It seemed to be going away but the next night I was woken up in the middle of the night with extreme throbbing pain in my right knee. It was swollen but no injury had occurred. I couldn?t put any weight on it. I went to health. They diagnosed it as patellar bursitis with unknown cause. They checked my blood and ruled out gout and or trauma as a cause. My blood showed signs of an immune reaction (possible infection) but it was 2 days after vaccination. To be safe they put me on a 10 day course of antibiotics because of the rapid onset they were afraid it might be a localized infection that could spread (but couldn?t determine a cause as there was no injury or broken skin in the area).  I couldn?t put any weight on my knee and dr advised 3 days off work to elevate, compress, and ice. I am still using a knee brace at work and it is still mildly swollen. No known cause or signs of trauma.

                                                Armpit pain (lymph nodes?): Armpit very painful and tender on the left side (vaccine was injected in left arm).  Pain was only in that associated armpit.  Pain lasted from 5/1/21 to 5/4/21  about the same time of day (noon).  Only other symptoms were hot flashes in the 2 days after receiving the vaccine.  Felt fine for a day then the armpit pain started.  It seems to be mostly gone by the one week mark.  Only a faint hint of soreness remains at this time.  I am a 38 year old female, not using hormonal birth control, reproductive organs are still functional/intact, no abnormal menstrual cycles prior to vaccine.  No issues with cycle to report at this time.

                                                I took the &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34; on December 31, 2020. I had pain/soreness at the injection site for 3 days, but I still have other side effects since getting the vaccine. The side effects started out with mild muscle pain and joint pain on the 31st, then in the night and for every day since the vaccine I have had headaches which I am taking ibuprofen for. I also feel quite fatigued since getting the injection. In the last few days I also had cold sweats, and chills yesterday. Today, I still have headache and fatigue.

                                                My upper arm where the injection was administered, started to radiate pain up to my neck. I noticed at that time a painful lump at the front base of neck, right side. The pain started to increase throughout the day. The following morning, the injection site was red and inflamed. The pain persisted throughout the day, radiating  to my hand, all the way up to my neck. The injection site was swollen and red. On a scale of 1 - 10, my pain was at 8. The following day, the pain reached a 10, the swelling and inflammation had increased and I noted decreased muscle strength in my hand. This persisted throughout the night. It&#39;s now Monday morning, and with flexril, constant application of a heating pad, a topical Diclofenac gel, and twice daily dose of 800 mg of Motrin and 2 tyelnol over the course of the last 2 days, my pain is at a 7. The swelling has reduced at the injection site some, but the the redness has increased and so has the hardness of the site.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

The spot was hot to the touch and slightly swollen.  My arm ached and felt heavy.   The next day (1/14/21) the red hive-type spot had doubled in size.  The spot is still hot to the touch and my arm is still achy.  I spoke with a nurse at the health department and she recommended I report the symptoms here and follow up with my doctor.  I left a message for my doctor but have not heard back.  The day of my injection (1/6/21) the only side effect I had was a sore arm.  No other symptoms until 1/13/21.

                                                Feeling fatigued, unable to move my left arm or side without pain.  There&#39;s a bulge in my left armpit that&#39;s very painful; I also have pain in my shoulder blade and left upper side ribs. Not sure if it&#39;s just severe body aches or my ribs hurting. Yesterday, my tongue and throat started to hurt; I had a refill on the magic mouth wash prescribed; back when I had strep throat, so I&#39;ve been using that and taking Tylenol and using muscle rub, but nothing is helping.

                                                Got my 1st covid vaccine around 9:30 am 1-18-21. Shot was administered with no issue, waited my 15 minutes and went home. Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

                                                Patient had been having some unusual medical symptoms, personally, that she had never experienced before. They started last week. Namely, tremendous pain and discomfort in hips and shoulders. It very much mimics polymyalgia rheumatica. The only change in her life within the last three weeks was that I received the Covid vaccine.

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

She was advised to pre-treat with Benadryl 50mg and  famotidine 40mg before the vaccination. Pt. had no immediate reactions and continued to be symptom free for 3&#43; hours after vaccination. At onset, she experiencing soreness in her mouth that then extended to a &#34;full&#34; feeling in her face and difficulty swallowing due to a sensation of swelling in her throat. She called a colleague who advised to take  more Benadryl  and ready and Epi-Pen. She kept Epi-Pen on standby but never administered it, she did take another 25mg of Benadryl which made her feel better after another 20-30 minutes. She monitored through the evening at her home, slept overnight and is back at work this morning with no more symptoms and only a sore arm near the injection site.

She went to the hospital and had a negative Typhoid test, negative Malaria screen, normal urinalysis, a Hemoglobin of 9g/dl, and a WBC of 17,000. Today she reported that she did not have a good night. Her fever was better but she still had a severe headache and chills.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

                                                After the first dose, I experienced body aches and fatigue the next day, which stopped after 24 hours. However, I continued (and still have today) to experience aches in my legs and knees. If I sit too long, cross my ankles, cross my legs, kneel down, or try to stand from any prone position, I experience pain and stiffness in both legs, which takes several minutes to subside. I would say the worst is in my knees, though I tend to feel it all throughout my legs.

                                                In anticipation of side effects from the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I began alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen.  The expected arm soreness set in after a few hours.  I also noticed that I had developed a headache and  low back pain that I could not associate with anything else.  I felt very stiff and my legs and feet were uncomfortable to the point that I had difficulty finding a good sleeping position.  This morning I had mild waves of nausea but was able to avoid throwing up.  The headache has persisted, as well as general body aches and fatigue.  As the day has progressed, the symptoms have lessened.

                                                A few seconds of the injection I experienced moderate light headedness which resolved quickly.  The following morning I began experiencing moderate aches and pains, generalized malaise which resolved quickly with Tylenol.  As the progressed, the achiness and increased and did not resolve quickly with Tylenol.  By 2:30 pm that day, I experienced chills that did not stop, and pain in the bones of my legs that felt like flashes of extreme heat, especially on the femur.  I began experiencing nausea. That night I was unable to sleep more than 3 hours.  Around 1 am of January 27th I began feeling chills, and pain once again.  I took Tylenol, and after a short while I began sweating.  Generally, the pain, chills, and burning sensation stopped that morning, however the nausea continued through the day, especially after trying to eat.

Pain at the injection site (slight) when my arm is not in motion and when my arm is in motion. 9:45 am the swelling was continuing and I felt strange all over, head felt cloudy, so I took Benadryl. 10:27 am hand swelling is reduced, but head and body still feel strange. Some acid-reflux type feeling happening Generally feeling off today.

If I eat my stomach cramps and eventually have diarrhea. I had aching and stomach cramping yesterday still 10 days post vaccine. I?m unclear if this is vaccine related.

                                                The next two days I had a sore arm. But a week later, the following Monday and Tuesday, I had fatigue and headaches. I put the date as Wednesday because that is when the concerning possible reactions began. I woke with clogged ears feeling very sick. I took Advil Cold and Sinus and arranged to miss work. It felt like a possible ear infection in my left ear. Also my forearms were painfully sore. I had lifted a heavy box up the stairs the afternoon before but the pain in my arms was immeasurably more than ever expected. My ankles were also very tender as I had done a little jogging the day before and I normally walk. As the day progressed I was barely able to get out of bed. Sleeping and just laying there. My highest temperature was 101.25 at 2:45 pm. I had severe chills on and off. I reported these afflictions and was mailed a covid test by Thursday. The test came back negative by Friday evening. Wednesday night my whole body was tender and I had no appetite. I took tons of vitamins and drank tonic tea and took advil and nasal allergy medication. I am still using all of those. Thursday I woke drenched in sweat. My head was mostly cleared just a wet ear and I had a low grade fever on and off through the day. Just touching my body against a surface was painful. Or putting my hand on my hip. My forearms and ankles were no longer worse than the rest. I received my covid kit and taking it to be mailed was the only time I left my house. I was surprised to find extreme difficulty walking down the stairs with muscle strain and pain in my joints. I was not nauseous but had no appetite. Friday I woke up hungry and felt better. No fever. Fatigue and body tenderness but it was better. Saturday my body is only sore on my glands and jaw and back of head. And my muscle is sore in my left arm. The oddness of that being where my shot was given is what makes me wonder if it was an extreme reaction to the vaccine. Maybe it is a flu. I have never had the body pains I try to describe before.

                                                In the evening of receiving the vaccine, I started to feel brief sharp pains in my chest/ back.  Overnight, I was awoken by continued shooting  pains all over my body, and also fine shaking.  Around 2AM a headache started and progressed to be the worst headache of my life.  It was received in the morning by tylenol.  In the morning, I experienced extreme exhaustion and dizziness after climbing stairs I almost passed out, had to rest on the floor.  Later in the day I experienced hours of chills, a temp to 103, which came down with tylenol. By the evening I was feeling well but tired.  Today, 2 days after vaccination, I have neck soreness and am a little tired but well.

                                                2 weeks after I received injection, I started experiencing a weakness in the left arm. This began Jan 26, 2021. The same evening I experienced an uncontrollable shake in the left thumb. The feeling of weakness/tiredness in my left arm has persisted and has gotten progressively worse. I am currently experiencing feelings of muscle abnormality, reduced strength, and diminished coordination of the left fingers. I have a doctor appointment for this issue scheduled for Feb8, 2021.

Over the next 3 weeks, my headache increased in nature, and accompanied with stiff neck, stiff hips and I could only lay on my back to sleep. The headache was mainly on my right side behind my eye.  I tried a high dose of naproxen, as well as massage, chiropractic and got no relief.  Finally on  February 2nd,  I went to the urgent care associated with my primary care provider because my primary care provider was not available.

Upon sitting down, sudden onset of extreme chills, to the point of shaking so terribly that my muscles hurt.  I sat with 4 or 5 blankets on me and tried to rest until the shaking subsided.  I asked a family member to sit and monitor me, as I was unable to do anything due to the shaking.  This lasted approximately 2.5 hours, then stopped, leaving my muscles feeling sore and overworked. It was exhausting.

                                                Woke up the following morning on Saturday with major back pain.  Was pretty miserable that day, i don&#39;t normally take pain meds but i took some that evening.  Sunday I was still pretty miserable and went to the chiropractor on Monday morning for an adjustment in case it wasn&#39;t just the shot that created the pain. I was feeling much better by monday though.  however i had shot 2 and the same thing happened again. as i assumed it was related to the shot and not the actual back i didn&#39;t see the chiropractor after that shot and the accompanying pain.

                                                Around 5PM - arm hurting at site of injection - swelling red and itchy. Was getting fatigue, chills and fevers. I was talking in my sleep a lot which is something that I never do. The next morning severe migraine, nausea, my spine hurt, extreme fatigue, only spine was sore but it felt very hard to move my body - like I was moving in slow motion. I was back to having trouble forming sentences and finding correct words. These symptoms were far more severe than my actual COVID symptoms when I was sick with that. I had no appetite. That lasted all day. Tylenol - took that and did go to work to see two patients but should have stayed home. When I woke up the next morning (third day after the vaccine) I felt fine except for lingering fatigue. The fatigue was gone by the afternoon on Friday (the 29th).

Lasted through the night several times an hour into the next morning.  Around midnight dizziness,, faint and muscle weakness set in with feeling of extreme pressure on neck, especially right side where shot administered. Arms became tingly, tongue became tingly, hard to keep awake.  After 12 hrs of extreme diarrhea, passed out for 12hrs straight. Awoke dehydrated, extreme muscle weakness unable to walk or stand, light headed, nauseous, dizzy, unable to grip or exert force. Felt like head was detached from body due to extreme pressure on neck. Rapid resting heart rate in 90s (usual testing HR in 50s).   Constant rolling waves of abdominal cramps brought dizziness with each cramp, acid reflux, bloating and gas.

By 5:30 pm, my arm felt like I was carrying a 15 pound dumbell in it.  I could barely move my arm.   3/9/21 - immediately noticed the whole upper arm was swollen with a lump.  I felt very fatigued throughout my whole body and my legs felt very heavy (could not go to work) 3/10/21 - very fatigued and my legs continued to feel heavy and lethargic.  I went to work but could not dance and sing like I typically do in class with my students.  I also noticed I could not lift up my left arm.  I also felt like my brain was very foggy.  I felt that I could have fallen asleep while driving to work and while driving home from work.  That evening I fell asleep at 7:00 pm standing up, leaning on a counter while waiting for my son to brush his teeth.  I have NEVER fallen asleep standing up in my life.  I had to go to bed at 7:30 pm due to extreme exhaustion. 3/11/21 - very fatigued and extreme leg pain.  My calves feel like there are knots twisting inside of them and as if they might explode from the inside out.  Still could not lift my arm high for more than a few seconds.  Could not sleep that night due to the severity of the leg pain. 3/12/21 - very fatigued and extreme leg pain continued and pain in both arms down into my forearms.   My calves feel like there are knots twisting inside of them and as if they might explode from the inside out.  Still could not lift my arm high for more than a few seconds.  I went to bed at 6:30 pm (not normal for me) due to extreme exhaustion and pain throughout my body.    I laid in bed for hours crying in pain until I got up to take Advil PM and finally fell asleep sometime after 11:00 pm. 3/13/21 - had to cancel my weekly class at the gym due to continued fatigue, pain throughout both arms and legs.  Unable to lift my arm long enough to brush hair and do a ponytail for my daughter.  My forearms had so much pain at night.   3/14/21 - could not go to the gym due to continued fatigue and pain throughout my muscles.  I can&#39;t lift my left arm to use a hair dryer.  My left arm has severe pain if I try to even hold my macbook in my left arm. This is horrific.  I am miserable and cannot yet function normally.

Around 5PM I started having chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting. My arm was so sore i could not lift it al all. At some point around 9PM I passed out on my bathroom floor. My 6 year old found me and thought I had died and called her father crying hysterically. I think I was passed out for a few hours before I came too, as my child had the phone on speaker and her and my husband were both yelling at me to wake up. I crawled back to bed and went to sleep.  The next morning 2/4/21, I could hardly move to get my daughter ready for school, I had to call out of work. I was still having  chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting, headache, and I could hardly move my left arm.  on 2/5/21 I was still very tired, still had nausea, and a headache. 2/6/21 - 2/7/21 I still had a slight headache.  on 2/8/21 I felt better and went to work.

Arm hurt for a couple days after, like a normal shot, then went away. 1 week to the day I leaned on my arm and felt intense pain, looked down and it was very swollen with a red center. It?s hot to the touch, looks filled with fluid but also firm. Hurts to do anything with that arm and I am completely drained of energy. I?m about to fall asleep typing this.
