Unable to lift arm above shoulder without significant pain at about 12 hours post injection. About 13-14 hours post vaccine, began having myalgias, chills. Took ibuprofen with some improvement of symptoms, but unable to sleep due to the combination of arm pain, chills and aches. Body aches and chills were gone by the morning but the arm pain lingered, less than the night before and improving each day, still there today, but much more tolerable.

                                                On Friday, January 8th, I started to feel pain/tenderness in my left armpit. It also felt firmer than my right armpit. I still feel pain/tenderness today, Saturday, January 9th. The pain is mild/moderate. I am still able to do my day-to-day activities.   (I did not think it was vaccine related, so I did not make note of this during my v-safe daily check in.)

                                                At the time of vaccination, a burning sensation was felt immediately upon injection. The person who injected the vaccine proceeded to flick the plastic tubing of the syringe while it was still in my arm, escalating the burning sensation. I let the tech know about the burning and he claimed it could be a side effect of the medication and that I would be fine. I did not suffer any medication related side effects. Left arm stiffness began about two hours after vaccination and after nearly 3 hours, I was completely unable to move my arm. Loss of shoulder posture, complete arm/hand weakness and extreme arm soreness were reported for nearly 5 days. Numbness from the injection site down to the elbow is intermittent currently. Tingling down from the shoulder joint to the fingers is constant when arm is laterally raised or when overused. The left arm is still having trouble externally/internally rotating/raising above my head, and while lifting heavy objects. I&#39;m in the process of starting physical therapy/occupational therapy to regain normal strength and functioning without the tingling or pain. An audible clicking noise is noted that was not there previously to the injection. I am unable to exercise normally and have been functioning at a decreased work and paperwork pace at my job as a nuclear stress technician. I have also been losing days of time at work due to various doctor&#39;s appointments and diagnostic tests needed to identify the problem.

Nurse administering vaccine noted injection was &#34;difficult to push.&#34; Five hours post vaccine began to feel severe pain in left arm. Pain worsened overnight. 36 hours later unable to use arm due to pain and numbness noted in fingertips of left hand.  Went to emergency room, both nurse and doctor assessed area and could see injection site and noted it was inappropriate - not into the deltoid rather into my shoulder joint. Discharged with pain medication. This AM (1/14) left shoulder pain still significant.

Muscle ache only in the location of the injection site.

                                                I had slight dizziness for 20 minutes a half hour after the injection. But that&#39;s not the issue. When the lady gave me the injection, it felt like she wiggled it around in my arm. The injection itself was surprisingly painful. My arm hurt at first like I was punched in the arm on the first day (much like a flu vaccine). But then it got SIGNIFICANTLY worse the next day. I was in excruciating pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine. I had limited arm mobility and any movement caused agony. I couldn&#39;t sleep from the pain. I wasn&#39;t able to do my normal activities. The pain started to subside after 4 days, but had since started to get worse again. I&#39;m in a constant state of pain. It&#39;s now impacting my mental health. I can move my arm, but not without a lot of pain.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received my first dose of the vaccine on Friday, January 15th. My arm was a little sore that day and the next, but it really wasn&#39;t that bad. Late on Saturday, January 16th I noticed a rash around my neckline/collar bone area that was on both sides, but more prominent on the right. The rash was red with many bumps that were not raised and were not fluid filled or blistering. The next day, Sunday (17th) the rash seemed to worsen but stay localized to that area. Monday morning (18th) I woke up with a tender right armpit indicating to me that I have a swollen lymph node. I noticed later that morning that the rash had spread bilaterally to my biceps and chest. Today is Wednesday the 20th, and while the rash looks slightly better around my neckline, the rash has now spread all over my breasts, abdomen, and a little bit to my hips. The right arm pit continues to be tender today.  I took Benadryl (25 mg) Sunday night (17th) and applied hydrocortisone cream to the rash when it was just along my neckline.

                                                I am not sure if the event that happened Sunday was directly related to the vaccine at all since it happened two days later, or if it was just a coincidence, or if the vaccine was just a physical stimulus trigger. I just wanted to let you know just in case! But out of nowhere, I had an episode (never had it before) where I can only describe it as what it might feel like to be drugged. I was delirious, confused, disoriented, dizzy. I wasn&#39;t able to leave bed without the room spinning. I had chest tightness and headache. When I would close my eyes, I would feel such head pressure that it felt like my body was on a boat during a tsunami. I would feel shaking and spinning inside my head. I never felt anything like it before. I was struggling to stay conscious. In the moment, I remember wondering if it was a brain aneurysm or if I was dying. I was scared, felt like I needed to call for help, but I was unable to. I allowed myself to fall asleep/lose consciousness (not sure which), and when I woke up an hour or so later, I felt a little better. I was still a bit confused on what happened and felt physically weak, but the episode had resolved. Hours later, I called the on-call service at my doctor&#39;s office because I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something wasn&#39;t right. She instructed me to go to the emergency room. By the time I got to the emergency room and got seen, this was a good 8-9 hours or so after the episode occurred. The PA-C at the ER ran bloodwork and a uranalysis (I do not know what he tested for since I was not given the results), as well as had me hooked up to a heart monitor. He said everything looked normal and that he would not run a CT scan since he did not think I had an aneurysm or anything indicating the need to expose me to radiation to perform a CT. I asked for an EEG and he said they do not do that at the emergency room. He discharged me to follow up with my PCP. While in the ER, I would have episodes of staring blankly into space at random, uncontrollably, and for an undetermined amount of time. I told the doctor, and he wasn&#39;t concerned. Yesterday (01/25/2021) I met with my PCP via telehealth and explained everything. He thinks it could have been my previously-diagnosed conversion disorder; however, I have not had that manifestation of it in the past. I expressed to him that I am very scared to get the second dose of the vaccine since I do not know if this event is related or not, and I do not want to die. I have two cats who need me! He did not think it was related to the vaccine, since it happened two days after the injection. But conversion disorder comes on with physical/mental/emotional trauma/stimuli. For the most part, I was feeling okay mentally. The vaccine was the only change to my normal routine. My previous conversion disorder effect was the loss/difficulty of the ability to swallow. I have not had an episode of that in years. The symptoms I experienced seem to be possible manifestations of the disorder when I did some research, but it does not fully explain what I experienced. I asked for a referral to neurology, just to be safe, and I have the appointment tomorrow (01/27/2021). I still feel residually weak, slight chest tightness, and overall feeling off/weird. Again, I do not know if this is directly related to the vaccine, but I wanted to make you aware just in case!

The next morning, swelling was extreme and extremely painful to touch. It was difficult to eat from left side and to laugh and talk. Also, had chills and felt weak.  I scheduled an online appointment with Dr.  he mentioned the condition is called acute pericoronitis and he suggested that vaccine might have increased the immune response to any infection that might have happened underneath the left wisdom teeth which hasn&#39;t come out yet. [Note: Same response had happened when I got my MMR vaccine on Feb. 1, 2021]. He prescribed Amoxicillin 500mg for a week.  As of Feb 22. 11 pm, after taking Amoxicillin and ibuprofen, the swelling has bit reduced but the pain persists.

Once I went home I went to sleep around 10:30 and work up at 2:30 AM with vomiting and 8/10 epigastric pain that radiated to my back. I went to the hospital. They gave me morphine and Zofran but within 5 minutes of the first dose of morphine, my pain returned even more intense and I still vomited 20 minutes after the Zofran. So they pushed another Morphine and Zofran. Zofran helped at this point but the Morphine did not. At this point they gave my three different oral liquids to help calm down my epigastric region, including mylanta, lidocaine and a third medication. I went home and slept the rest of the day but Wednesday night I got diarrhea and spike a fever of 102.7 around 8PM. Now it&#39;s thursday morning and I still have a 2/10 epigastric pain, physically exhausted and had a fever this morning as well.

                                                1/25/21 - numbness and tingling, feeling of nerve tension began in right arm  and hand with no clear peripheral nerve pattern; next day in both arms with twitching of R middle finger; third day afternoon began in R foot and spread up into calf as well as L foot; went to the ER on 1/27/21; clear ECG, chest XR, brain and cervical CT, and bloodwork; referred to neurologist with concerns of MS or transverse myelitis;  saw neurologist on 2/3/21 - he found mildly hyperactive reflexes and a (&#43;) hoffman&#39;s reflex; ordered MRI of brain and cervical spine with and without contrast and more bloodwork; MRIs performed apx 1 1/2 weeks later and bloodwork done same day (2/3); bloodwork revealed elevated C-reactive protein of ~14 and ESR of 14 (higher than previous baseline of &lt;2) but all else clear; MRIs came back clear 2/8/21 - 9 days after second dose woke up with throbbing headache, body aches, and overall feeling of being ill; on the third day of this went to go get tested for COVID and flu to be safe; both rapid and PCR came back negative; sx resolved by the weekend;  2/15/21 - began getting frequent headaches, inability to take a deep breath and sharp retrosternal chest pain up into the back of my throat when I would try; difficulty breathing with a mask on; significantly elevated heart rate; SOB at work esp with mask on; symptoms worse with mask and then eased on weekends without mask; then became able to take deep breath but with chest pain then began to need to cough with a deep breath then more frequent coughing esp after long days of mask wearing; several occasions of waking up at night unable to breath esp when lying on either side with racing heart; symptoms vary in intensity but on days when they would act up, heart rate is consistently elevated (normal resting heart rate ~55, would be up at 90 while lying down, 120 while standing making coffee) 3/9/21 - went to ER in the evening due to symptom increase of chest pain, SOB, and elevated heart rate; ER ran bloodwork and found elevated D-dimer of 0.6, WBC of 27,000, high neutrophils, and low lymphocytes; CT angiogram to r/o PE came back negative; (-) chest XR other than minor atelectasis; abnormal ECG with incomplete RBBB and prolonged QT interval; tachycardia; admitted to hospital; blood cultures, urine cultures, and respiratory pathogen panel including COVID test negative; started on albuterol breathing treatments and 40 mg of steroids 2x/day which normalized WBC count and eased sx significantly; consult with pulmonology and cardiology; 2nd chest x-ray (-) and transthoracic ECHO (-); started on beta blockers 12.5 mg 2x/day which helped heart rate some; second ECG found no RBBB and normal QT interval but unable to rule out anterior MI or inferior ischemia. D/c on steroid dose pack, beta blockers, cough suppressant. Follow up with cardio and pulm. Now seeing immunologist as well who started me on corticosteroid inhaler, monteleukast. Running more blood work soon. PCP gave albuterol inhaler, did round of antibiotics, orders to use incentive spirometer for breathing capacity. Waiting on pulmonology follow up and 30 day holter monitor, stress ecg, and other cardiac tests.

                                                It started on 12/30/20 around 10 pm with just a headache, then it progressed to hot flashes and nausea. I ended up throwing up around 4 am on Thursday 12/31/20 at work. Then over the weekend I  felt very lethargic, had body aches, and the hot flashes continued. My left arm hurt as expected, but the soreness went up into the left side of my neck as well. Today (1/3/21) is the first day since I got the vaccine where I no longer have a headache and feel basically back to baseline.

                                                I received my vaccine in my right arm around 3:20 pm on 1/5/21. My right arm started getting sore later that evening. The following day, 1/6/21, my arm was very sore and the injection site was tender to touch. I felt feverish and had chills. I also had a headache and felt very fatigued. I took some Advil that morning. I evaluated my arm in the evening and noticed a large red rash streaking down my right arm from the injection site. It measured approximately 3.5 in X 1.5 in. The rash was red, raised, painful, and firmer than my surrounding skin. I took 500 mg of Tylenol before bed. The next morning, 1/7/21, the rash had grown larger. The border of the rash was marked and I took an antihistamine around 7:00 am. At 1:00 pm the rash had grown larger, now measuring approximately 4.25 in X 2.25 in. My lymph nodes in my right armpit were also beginning to get sore. I visited the nurse practitioner at my hospital?s employee health clinic around 1:40 pm and we agreed to monitor my signs and symptoms at that time. The following morning, 1/8/21, the rash was bigger, but my skin was softer and more of a pink color than red. My arm did not hurt as much, though my right armpit was slightly more sore. Today, 1/9/21, my symptoms are much better. I have only slight soreness in my right arm and armpit. My rash has nearly resolved, though it is slightly itchy where the rash was.

                                                12/29/2020- Received the Moderna Vaccine - no pain or problems until 01/04/2021 01/04/2021- Before bedtime my injection site from the Moderna Vaccine became itchy.  01/05/2020- Woke up to a swollen arm (about 3 times the size of my right arm) and the start of a rash (the size of a softball) Was in significant pain and unable to lift my arm. I called the nurse hotline where I received the vaccine. I was told to go to the ER immediately. The ER doctor informed me that they had been seeing this and that their personal vaccine location swelled up as well but went away a few days later. ER doctor gave me Benadryl cream (I can not ingest Benadryl due to an opposite reaction, I become extremely anxious.) The ER doctor informed me that the Benadryl cream wouldn&#39;t cause the same reaction. I was sent home with the cream and a wrap. Upon arriving home my rash grew exponentially over the following days. The site became hot (even after icing it) It remained itchy and painful.  01/11/2021- Went to primary care doctor. The rash and swelling had decreased although you could still see the ring of the rash. At this point, my hand was becoming numb after doing daily activities including typing. My palm and thumb area started to turn purplish/blueish when I would type for less than 20 seconds. The doctor told me they would start to reach out to other providers and figure out how to best move forward. In the meantime, there wasn&#39;t much to do besides wait and see what happens.  01/13/2021- Woke up throughout the night due to continued pain at the injection site. Called the primary care doctor who wasn&#39;t in the office, waited for a call back from their nurse but due delayed call back and  increased pain and numbness went to urgent care (which is under the same practice as primary care). The urgent care doctor performed tests regarding pinched nerve shoulder (as they believed I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder) and ordered an x-ray. The x-ray showed tissue damage but nothing else. I was not experiencing shoulder pain, although during one of the shoulder tests I found more discomfort in my left should (injection arm) than my right arm. Therefore, the primary care doctor thought I was experiencing a pinched nerve in my shoulder.  01/14/2021 - Primary care doctor called and informed me they had spoken with the infectious disease doctor in the area who informed them that they have been seeing a similar reaction amongst other people. (7 days after inject, swelling and rash) The infectious disease doctor reported they hadn&#39;t seen numbness. The primary care doctor advised me to wait 2 weeks to see how symptoms change before performing additional tests. The primary care doctor also advised me after speaking with the infectious disease doctor to not take the second shot.  01/16/2021- still experiencing issues with daily functioning. Still experiencing numbness in hand and arm. Still experiencing redness around the injection site (although much better still flairs up at moments)   Side note: 01/03/2021 - Went cross country skiing, did fall backwards but did NOT fall on arm.  Also confusion remains if  I was supposed to report this or if the primary care doctor/ER doctor reported this, therefore, urgent care doctor told me to report this reaction.

                                                I am still not certain whether or not this is related to the vaccine, but it is very coincidental so I wanted to reach out just in case. I plan on seeing a physician this week if possible, but I am new to the area and do not have a PCP here so trying to get in to see someone is not very easy, and I do not feel that this is an emergency yet. Since Sunday night when I had the vaccine I am getting soreness in the muscles all over my body and have joint stiffness and pain, mostly legs, arms, and lower back. It is worse when I rest (sitting or laying) for extended periods of time. It relieves somewhat with NSAIDs but on some days it is so painful, stiff, and sore that I have difficulty going up and down stairs, and even walking or rolling over in bed sometimes. The last three days or so I have developed red and purple macules that first began on both of my legs and are now starting on both of my arms as well. Other than feeling fatigued and what I have described already, these are my symptoms. Like I said, I am not sure if it is related to the vaccine or not yet, but it did start the same day with the soreness. It has progressively gotten worse throughout the week and that is why I am now trying to seek help from a PCP. I may also try to reach out to my allergist on Monday when they reopen.

                                                Around 10pm on Tuesday I started to have severe neck pain, headache, fatigue. I ended up going to the emergency room after my shift but due to the physicians recommendations I deferred the lumbar puncture while there. Later Thursday night, the neck pain continued, and I started having fevers with a max of 102.1 so I returned to the ER the following day for the lumbar puncture. I was admitted to the hospital for aseptic meningitis.

The next morning I woke up and couldn&#39;t move my head or neck from debilitating pain. I was not able to sit or stand on my own, and I could not walk more than a few steps without needing to sit down and rest. Severe upper back, neck and head pain for 3 days. Some intermittent irregular heartbeat, chest tightness as well. I lost 8 pounds (123lbs to 115lbs) in two days.

                                                Starting the evening of the day I took the vaccine, I developed arthritic pains in my knees and hips. This pain has since became fairly severe - making it hard to go up and down stairs and even roll over in bed - involving knees, ankles, hips, wrists, and shoulders now. The only thing that helps the arthralgias is ibuprofen - it makes my symptoms resolve probably 75% of the way but they return as soon as the 8hrs is up on the ibuprofen. Three days after the vaccine (the 13th), I developed an erythematous macular rash on bilateral thighs. It has since moved to my lower legs and there are a few spots on my forearms. The older macules on my thighs are now a purple-ish hue, but the lower leg ones are very much erythematous and warm. I have also been have intermittent lower extremity edema for the last week. Tylenol, benadryl, and zyrtec did not help any symptoms.

By about 2pm I had body aches and a small fever. The second day, I was headachy with a sore arm.   the third day, Sunday, my arm was no longer sore, but my armpit hurt to move. At first it felt like a bra poke, but it would not go away. Monday and Tuesday, the irritant was high, but not painful. I believe this to be from a swollen lymph node. It currently feels like someone left a marble under my armpit.

I began feeling pain while breathing and was very weak when standing. My fever reached 102.9 while taking Tylenol. The body aches and Migraine were a 10/10. I went to hospital where they treated my migraine and the benedryl seemed to ease much of my pain and dizziness related to the vaccine. I was told I was having a vaccine reaction.

The morning following her vaccine she developed fever, chills, generalized malaise, myalgias, and fatigue lasting about 48 hours. The following morning, she was awoken from sleep by a crushing substernal chest pain with associated typical anginal symptoms. Her initial troponin-I was elevated at 7.47 ng/mL and peaked at 19.19 ng/mL. An ECG demonstrated minimal ST elevations followed by an echocardiogram demonstrated preserved systolic function and an ejection fraction of 60-65%. Due to her elevation in cardiac enzymes and persistent angina, coronary angiography was performed revealing no obstructive coronary artery disease. She was diagnosed with suspected myocarditis and treated successfully with anti-inflammatory medication. In follow-up, she had an uncomplicated treatment course with complete resolution of anginal systems and improvement in troponin and inflammatory markers.

Though the red area is not exactly a circle, the diameter of the red area has steadily increased over the past few days. The area is not itchy. My arm is most painful when I move it (attempting to abduct at the shoulder feels impossible) and I cannot apply pressure (leaning or laying on that arm is also tremendously painful, as is the weight of a blanket touching the arm).    My arm soreness after the first dose I received resolved after 5-6 days. My arm was firm and warm around the injection site for that dose, but did not have this red area surrounding the injection site.

I remember waking up laying down on the floor, I screamed at my husband I couldn?t get up. And my husband got me up from the floor  when I fainted again in his Arms. He states I was unconscious for 10-15 seconds. After I wake up my headache and nauseous went always. I was fine the whole day.

Then about 3 hours after I received the vaccine I started having nausea and some hand tingling on and odd. The biggest limiting symptom was the excruciating shoulder pain on the left arm, no relief with ibuprofen, Tylenol, ice, changing position nothing. Worse pain I had in my life. I could not move my arm on its own at all and it was excruciating pain. Went to the ER and they gave me IV fluids and tramadol. The pain was better after that but I still could not move the arm and the pain was still present. They made me follow up with my PCP. I saw my PCP on a Tuesday after being on and off the phone with them on a Mondays.  Symptoms have improved but not back to normal.

On 1/3/2021 my armpit became very swollen and painful, on 1/4/2021 the Right arm where I received the injection became severely painful, dull throbbing ache from shoulder down to my fingers. On 1/5/2021 my Right arm was now swollen, hot to the touch and a small red circle was forming on my bicep and pain continued to worsen. Today 1/6/2021 I saw my primary care physician that confirmed there is swollen lymph nodes in the arm pit and swelling at the site. The redness of the spot increased in size from the size of a dime to now the size of a half dollar.

The soreness around the injection started and never went away. Then I could not go to sleep that night, the soreness feeling got more intense. I won?t at 5 trying to get ready but the more I moved my arm the soreness got worse and it started to burn.

After a couple hours, the pain became unbearable, and she had an ED physician look at her arm. She had limited use of her arm on Monday 1/11 and Tuesday 1/12. Wednesday 1/13 her arm started to feel better and she could lift it. She went to her PCP and he said the injection site looked higher than it should have been. Today 1/14 she still has sharp pain with movement and limited range of motion.

                                                I received the vaccine around 10:40 am on January 8th, 2021. My arm was a little sore that night, but nothing too bad. I took some ibuprofen before I went to bed (400mg, I think). I felt fine the morning of January 9th; I went and bought some groceries and then took a walk in the neighborhood. I did get pretty chilled while walking since it was so cold. When I got back to my apartment around 2:00 I took a nap, then took a very hot shower trying to get warm again. Around 3:00 pm my arm started to become noticeably more sore so I took ibuprofen (600mg). Between 3:15 pm and 3:30 pm I suddenly started to feel warm and nauseous. I felt light-headed and while I was upright (standing or moving around) I would get some black spots in my vision. I went and lay down around 4:00 pm. I stayed in bed that whole evening with a fever (at its highest, 102), I was pretty nauseous, my arm hurt to the point where I couldn&#39;t move it and my wrist and hand felt very weak. I took some more ibuprofen (maybe another 600mg?) sometime after 8:00pm. The next day, Sunday January 10th, I mostly stayed in bed and ran a light fever (99.9) and was very fatigued. Arm was very sore and I had limited use of it until the latter part of the day. Monday, January 11th, I felt mostly fine, I could use my arm with no issue, but I stayed home from work due to the fatigue. By Tuesday I was fairly normal, just tired.

The next day I felt moderate pain, swelling and firmness at the injection site. I was also lethargic and mentally depressed; however, the pain in my left wrist ceased. The third day I had no pain in my wrist or arm, but the muscle around the injection site felt firm and swollen. This is the 7th day and I still have firmness/ swelling at the injection site and experience itchiness.

                                                I had fever around 100.1F, nausea, chills, sweats, a really bad headache and the worst part was neck pain/ back pain/ pain between my shoulder blades, it kept hurting so bad that I was shaking. I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen, and it took me 3 hours until I could have some relief and feel asleep. Chills fever and body aches I had for 3 days and it reached 100.7 on Christmas day. By Saturday no more fever but the pains were still there. Sunday I was fatigued and all those days I had pretty bad night sweats (about 5 nights). My nausea was so bad that one of the doctors I work with prescribed me some Phenergan that I took Christmas eve and day to help me be able to hold something in my stomach.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant product use included acetylsalicylic acid.  On 31 Dec 2020, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  During the morning hours of 01 Jan 2021, the patient passed out, felt dizzy, lightheaded, fatigued, had a headache, and chills. The patient reported that walking across a room took the breath out of her.    On 02 Jan 2021 the patient experienced diarrhea in the evening.   On 03 Jan 2021 the patient presented to the emergency room but was not admitted. Her monocyte count was high, but other lab results were normal.  Her headache was treated with anti-migraine medication intravenously.  She stated she was still experiencing dizziness and her neck was still achy and stiff.  No additional treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, passed out, lightheaded, fatigue, walking across a room takes breath out, headache, chills, diarrhea, and monocyte was high, was unknown.  The events, dizziness and stiff and achy neck, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 29-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 0371C20A), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Syncope, the non-serious listed events of diarrhea, chills, headache, and fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of Dizziness, Monocyte count increased, Musculoskeletal stiffness, Dizziness (lightheadedness), Neck pain, and Dyspnoea.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events on the day after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The events may be explained by an undiagnosed viral illness based on the constellation of symptoms and elevated monocyte count.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine on 01/06/2021. Normal pain at the injection site occured with little concern. Pain in armpit began 01/08/2021. I did not think anything of it, believing the pain to be from an ingrown hair caused by shaving or just something with the vaccine. I ignored it to spend time with family. On 01/12/2021 I noticed the pain had not subsided and deepened into the armpit causing pain to radiate from the area when lifting or moving heavy items.  I palpated the area and felt a pea sized lump. It moved freely. I could not locate it again. I continued to palpate into the top of my shoulder and discovered a large lump in the clavicle area. It is painful to apply pressure. I knew these areas to be part of the lymphatic system. I also did research on side effects of the Moderna vaccine but observed most people to have lymph node symptoms for only 24-48 hours within three days of receiving the vaccine then they subside.  I made an appointment that same day, 01/12/2021, with Dr. at clinic to be examined. At first, Dr was dismissive of my symptoms. Dr did physically examine my areas of complaint and scheduled an ultrasound for 01/15/2021 at  Hospital. On 01/13/2021 I noticed the injection site began to ache again. On 01/14/2021 I awoke from a nap at 6pm. I began showering for work when I felt a burning, itchy sensation on my inner left bicep. I observed two red spots on my inner left bicep close to my armpit with a red rash below the two red spots. I palpated the red spots to find a large and slightly smaller lump under the skin corresponding with the red spots. The rash itches. As of 01/15/2021, the ultrasound had to be rescheduled by the hospital as their ultrasound technician cannot make it into work because of a blizzard. I now have two lumps in the clavicle area that alternate swelling and reducing in size. I&#39;ve been taking tylenol every four hours when I&#39;m awake to control the pain. The ones in my clavicle now cause tension in the left side of my neck. I&#39;ve also applied warm compresses on the affected sites. It helps lessen the swelling for a bit but does come back.

No rotation. It started a few hours after receiving the vaccine. By 5pm it was at it&#39;s sorest and locked in position . Not warm to touch. Just painful.  This lasted a total of 3 days until all soreness and full normal movements without discomfort could resume.

Upon awaking this morning, prior to the morning dose of benadryl, her heart rate was a little elevated. She was also told she could alternate Tylenol or ibuprofen prn and use OTC cold remedies but hasn&#39;t needed any. The doctor said she is not a candidate for the next the second vaccine dose.

The weekend after vaccination: She started having bilateral hand, shoulder, and wrist joint pain and it has persisted until today. It has continued to worsen. She has taken Motrin, Tylenol, and Glucosamine. The Glucosamine worked the best in treating the joint pain for a week or so, but the pains have since come back and are worse. It is not only in her joints, but also muscular pain now. The Motrin and Tylenol help make it less painful, but do not relieve the pain.

I did not experience any injection site skin reactions prior to this, just muscle pain in that shoulder for a couple days after the dose. The redness faded away within 24 hours.

The pain feels tender and constant. It helps to take tylenol to decrease the pain.   My left armpit feels tender and sore. It looks a bit swollen. I know I slept on my left arm, so it may be sore from that, but it does not feel like arm strain. It is just on my armpit area I feel the pain and discomfort. I do not feel pain on my injection site.  It is now day two that I am experiencing this pain. I do not feel pain on my right arm or armpit.

                                                I received the vaccine on 1/19/2021 at my place of employment. Upon getting the vaccine approx 30 minutes after receiving i became very itcy, and my lips were burning/tingling. The itching continued to get worse, forming red rash on my chest. I called my MD at this point. I was told to take benadryl and to go to er if it became worse. I took benadryl. the itching continued for 2 days. i also experienced pain at injection site, headache, nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, muscle soreness. on 2nd day after vaccine i woke up and my muscles continued to be very sore. like i had just completed a marathon. I also have this sensation that started with the increased muscle pain. The only way i can explain it is that it feels like how a TENS unit feels, but its coming from the inside. especially in my back and thighs. this continues. i feel like i could just start shaking at any time. i cannot sleep but i am so tired. i was seen at dr today and i was told to report this to you guys. this sensation has not went away and has actually cause my muscles to spasming. MD said the vaccine effected my muscles and possibly neurologically as well.

When I got to work, I looked at my arm and it was very swollen, red, warm, firm, and itchy. By Sunday 1/17, I started to see progress with the swelling, warmth and redness.  It is still mildly itchy. Please note, when I got the vaccine on 1/06/21, I had the normal side effects of arm soreness, fatigue, mild muscle aches and a mild headache; all of these symptoms were gone by Friday 1/08/21. I saw [vaccine administrator] and she instructed me to use ice and hydrocortisone cream.  I iced it for 4 days and there was no change until day 4 (Sunday). I also used Aleve during this time as well. I saw my PCP on Monday 1/18 and she told me to continue the current treatment of ice and Alieve and to update her on Wednesday 1/20.&#34;

                                                Around 5:30 PM I began experiencing normal symptoms like headache and muscle ache. At 8:15 PM I began to feel light headed, nauseous, and short of breath. Around 8:20 I needed to lay on the floor to prevent myself from fainting. My eyes were rolling back because I was borderline unconscious. I felt like I had no control of my body and had to go to the bathroom. For around 15 minutes I was on the floor convulsing, shaking as if I had chills and my muscles were involuntarily tensing. My pulse was extremely low. After the convulsions stopped I remained on the floor an additional 15 minutes.  Around 8:45 PM I was able to return into my bed with assistance. My nauseous remained and I began experiencing chills. I slept on an off the entire night. At about 1 AM what I suspect was a fever began to break and I was extremely sweaty. For the following day I experienced exhaustion and muscle soreness. I am still experiencing exhaustion. I recognize a bulk of my symptoms were normal but the convulsions, losing consciousness, and inability to control my body seemed worth reporting.

                                                12/31 8:30am noticed maculopapular erythematous rash mostly on torso (few lesions on extremities), itchy scalp, and mild edema/erythema at RT corner of bottom lip. Also had mild pain on ball of RT foot, thought I had stepped on something. 1:30pm woke up with severe edema of bottom lip, rash also on scalp next to ears 3pm seen at urgent care, received and filled prednisone prescription  4pm lip edema started improving, so did not end up taking the prednisone 8pm lip edema gone, erythema and mild edema to DIP joint and tips of fingers, all fingers of LT hand and RT pinky. All hand joints and wrists sore. Soreness to toes and heels while walking but not at rest. Applied ice to fingers, then turned up heat. 1/1 3-4am finger edema/erythema totally resolved 8am foot pain starts resolving 5pm still with mild wrist pain, mild foot pain. Rash evolving -- most lesions improved but some have coalesced, new lesions on neck  Never any fever, checked x2, Tmax 99.0F. Did not end up taking any medications since my symptoms seemed to be resolving. Only other possible recent exposures were a new lotion tried 12/27 (but only applied to face, was careful to keep it away from my lips, and I did not have any rash on my face except the swollen lip) and a new dress that I did not pre-wash (but I had few lesions on my arms which would have also been exposed).

                                                A week after receiving the COVD19 vaccine, red patches of skin started appearing around the injection site.  Patches were not itchy.  Armpit area (lymph nodes) was painful, as well as general pain in left arm.  The next day the rash had gotten larger and left arm started tingling.  Arm pain persisted.  On the third day the rash was larger still, with prolonged arm tingling and left chest area pain.  I went to the ER as no one could answer why these problems were arising  a week after the vaccine.  ER advised taking Benadryl and watching out for shortness of breath.  Arm is currently tingling and eyesight seems fuzzy.

Next day noticed a firm lump 2&#34; from injection site, tricep area with redness and swelling, tenderness and pain all at inj. site. Marked for size and by 12/26 the lump, redness, swelling had increased in size.  Tylenol with no relief, applied heat to lump made it worse. Took Benadryl x 3 doses and symptoms are much improved.  Headache on 12/25-12/26, Fatigue x 3 days, muscle pain in shoulders/neck.

                                                At the time of the injection I had some tingling in my arm. I had arm neck and shoulder soreness as well which continued for a few days. A couple of hours after the injection I began itching all over. I deduced that it could be an allergic reaction so I took an antihistamine and relaxed.I did not check for hives as I don&#39;t know much about allergic reactions. the Itching went away. On day 8 I had the itching again accompanied by hives.  Once again I took an antihistamine and improved. On day 11 I had itching again and took an antihistamine. The antihistamine did not work as well this time. It is day 12 as I write this.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in my left deltoid, my mouth felt prickly and tasted metallic, my lips and tongue turned red and slightly swollen, along with swelling in my throat. After about 30 minutes the oral sensations improved, but my throat tightness increased. With some difficulty I swallowed a 25 mg capsule of diphenhydramine. Fifteen minutes after ingesting the capsule, the esophageal swelling improved slightly. Over the next 18 hours I continued taking 50 mg diphenhydramine every 4-6 hours. On 12/31/20 I no longer experienced any oral/esophageal swelling or abnormal sensations. However on 12/31/20 I developed severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, lasting through 1/3/21. I felt well January 4-6. However, on the evening of 1/6/21 I again developed  severe pain and swelling at the injection site, extending to the left shoulder, head and neck, along with profound fatigue and full body myalgias and arthralgias, persisting until 1/9/21. On 1/8/21 I additionally experienced pruritis and erythema on my left deltoid, this resolved spontaneously on 1/10/21.

A general feeling of lethargy became progressively worse throughout the day. from morning to noon i felt off but thought i was just psyching myself out. My noon I realized i was experiencing side effects. Around 2pm i began to experience mild chills. While cooking dinner at around 5pm I felt like my muscle aches in my back were on the threshold of feeling likes spasms. around 8-9pm before going to bed the symptoms were at there worst and comparable to a moderate illness. By the next morning I felt about 80% better but got headaches between my eyes whenever i stood up or moved too fast. As of today I feel about 95% better but still somewhat lethargic.

By late afternoon I started feeling extreme muscle weakness in my whole body and had the chills. I took a hot bath to try to ease the pain and chill. After the bath I crawled into bed and experienced extreme fever, chills, and weakness through the night.   The next day I continued to suffer from extreme fatigue. Now it is evening of the day after the vaccine and I only feel a little weak.

Then about 5 minutes after leaving, I felt weak as if I was about to faint. Once I got to Peds, I felt even more weak. I could barely sit up. Nurse advised me to go back. Once I got there I was still feeling weak. I was sent home. The rest of the evening I was still feeling weak and as if I was about to get a headache, The next day (1/8), I felt muscle aches and tiredness. It hurt to even walk. As well my arm where I received the vaccine was sore and hurt to move.

                                                Moderate pain at the injection site lasted ~36 hours after shot. Six days after vaccine was given, I experienced an enlarged lymph node on the left side base of my neck. The lymph node was about the size of a dime, firm, and tender to the touch. Minimal armpit pain was experienced (similar to an ingrown hair), except there wasn&#39;t an ingrown hair. On the 7th day, about  15 hours after noticing the enlarged lymph node, swelling and tenderness has reduced, but has not disappeared completely.

At 9 hours post vaccination, also developed nausea, muscle/joint aches, fever, chills, and severe headache. Tmax was 102 F, but averaged at 100 F for at least 24 hours (11 PM 1/20/21 - 11 PM 1/21/21); cannot gauge what occurred after 11 PM on 11/21/21 due to sleep. However, right arm nerve pain continues now on to day 3 (1/22/21) with also the development of small wart-like bumps on left ring finger. Tmax today is 99.8 F accompanied by mild chills, nausea and abdominal pain.

                                                Pt had typical first 48 hour side effects. Day 8 post injection pt began to have latent side effects including; itchiness at injection site and beyond, redness with heat, swelling at injection site with spreading for 36 hours, headache with no relief after PO OTC&#39;s, fatigue, muscle ache not relieved with OTC anti- inflammatory.  Pt reports to staff started on day eight with itchiness and redness in one area, a couple of hours later noticed a second reddened area then lumps by the end of the day. Documentation reported by pt to have swelling at site and near site to be more than a golf ball size below injection site (vs at injection site). Pt reported having latent side effects begin on day eight and continue past day 13 (the time of this report). Pt reports not being able to keep up with housework, children, job duties and school work due to side effects. Pt relied on older daughter (under age 13), and parents to assist so that pt did not miss work.

Next day it was on/off pain, with very intense pain when it came on to the point that I was unable to lift or do things. On Sunday (next day), pain seemed to radiate from the shoulder up through my left neck to the cranium area. Monday (today) this evening - pain so intense that I was screaming and sobbing. Husband (also MD) had to medicate me as I was laying on bed screaming unable to move or roll over. He had to manually lift me. Significant pain in left neck (trapezius) area on inhales, near injection site. Pain has been getting worse each night.

It hurt really bad - couldn&#39;t left it or move it. I took Tylenol once or twice that day with six hours in between. I was a little bit drowsy and headache and a little bit nauseous.  So I slept that day. I felt like my arm got hit by truck. 10th - I felt better that day. By Monday, the 11th, I was totally fine. Pregnancy: I&#39;m due May 29, 2021; I have had a miscarriage before so it&#39;s my second pregnancy. So far everything has been normal.

I felt better on the 6th day (Sunday), the injection site looked like it was healing and going back to normal on my shoulder. Then on 7th day (Monday) my injection spot started to itch and break out in a huge hive and little hives around it.  It turned into a bright red circle around the injection spot.  It was hot to touch and very swollen. On 8th to current day (11th) my arm keeps getting worse with the swelling, hotness, itching, &amp; redness, and spreading down my arm.

                                                the morning following the second dose of the vaccine I awoke with a terrible headache, felt nauseated all day (didn&#39;t vomit), and felt exhausted. I had to take the day off work and slept most of the day.  I also had terrible muscular pain at the sight of the injection (L deltoid).  Tylenol helped with the arm pain. I had absolutely no side effects with the first dose.

                                                first 3 days, my arm was sore; On the 9th - I developed upper gastric pain that was radiating through my back up to my upper right shoulder. I was concerned since I&#39;m pregnant that it might have to do with the pregnancy. By 2:00 pain had progressively worsened and I didn&#39;t have much of a appetite that day. Around 3:30, I started developing intense nausea - and vomited 3:45 pretty violently. I contacted the OB - and she thought I should come in to be monitored. Hospital is where I went and I got there and they monitored to see how baby was doing; did a urine test - found protein and ketones in there. Drew labs - lipase was significantly elevated - 324. 156 were where my Triglycerides were at- a bit out of range. They dx&#39;d me with Pancreatitis - idopathic since they couldn&#39;t determine cause. They admitted me to Hospital from 9th - 16th. While I was in the hospital they did further lab work. I was showing malnourished - after a clear liquids only for two days. I asked to be discharged by 16th. On the 29th, the day I took the vaccine - I had a glucose tolerance test after the vaccine (about 08:30 AM is when I started the glucose monitoring test) - they diagnosed me with gestational diabetes with that two days after vaccine on December 31st. Expected due date - April 20, 2021; low PAP A hormone; 1st pregnancy

                                                I had hives despite having taken my daily dose of Claritin that seemed to get worse as the day continued. I reached out to my Healthcare clinic and they were unsure if there was a simple treatment and almost required me to go the emergency room for this. I conducted a telehealth consultation with a doc who was not my primary care physician and was unfamiliar with my preexisting exercise urticaria condition that occasionally results in light hives but never anaphylaxis for me without Claritin. I declined going to the emergency room since this did not seem that serious and instead took another Claritin to try to get the somewhat worsening hives with no apparent cause to stop without an unnecessarily escalated situation. My throat was slightly itchy but I never became anaphylactic likely due to taking an additional Claritin and not doing anything requiring physical effort for the day beyond telecons from home because I left the office to telework mid morning after I started getting continually slightly worse hives. By evening I was ok and the next day just had a slightly sore throat but was able to work and just started the day with 2 Claritin without any further instance of hives appearing. The day after that I returned to my standard 1 Claritin dose with no ill effects. From this event, it seems clear that a 72 hour downing period from dose 1 is insufficient and should be upped to 96 hours. Prior to this more severe event, I had, on days 2 and 3, a sore left arm at injection site that prevented me from even reasonably lifting my arm to a height sufficient to grab my cell phone off it&#39;s charger while lying in bed without serious discomfort. That level of arm discomfort prevented me from working out or would have prevented me from anything other than light office work involving my vaccine arm. My level of tiredness for the couple days following this dose also required that I take an hour long nap days 1 and 2, and no nap at all is usually the norm for me.

                                                Immediate experience of hot flushes and chills with severe nausea.  Chest felt tight, upper stomach in extreme discomfort,  Hard to see, lights hurting eyes, seeing spots in the air.  Sound became amplified and began to experience a migraine.  &#34;People talking low to me felt like they were screaming into my ear drums.&#34; Extreme fatigue so could barely keep eyes open.  Standing was difficult; moved to wheelchair. Most symptoms lasted 2 to 3 days.  Fever of 102 on first day only.  Fatigue for one week.  Right upper arm, not at the injection site, had a &#34;hive&#34; about the size of a nickel that has not gone away (as of 2/23/21).   New migraines with light sensitivity that affect ability to work also have not gone away (as of 2/23/21).

Stiffness in the joint started progressing to the point of patient having trouble taking off her socks and walking. Patient was walking with a painful limp. At 12:30 AM on 2-1-21 patient awoke with pain radiating down left leg and could not bend leg or move in bed. The pain lessened a Medrol pack relieved pain for two days. On 2-4-21, patient awoke with such pain that she went to the emergency room. Sciatica was the diagnosis which patient has never had. Patient awoke with severe pain again on 2-7-21 and had another trip to the emergency room. Sciatica was determined the problem again and a CT was ordered that showed no back or disc issues. Pain and difficulty walking has continued to persist even with medication and physical therapy. Patient is using a walker with continued decreased strength and pain in the left leg and hip.

The area around the injection site was swollen, red, and painful to touch. I fell over on my way to the toilet due to extreme dizziness. I had three hours of diarrhea, and then took pepto bismal and bennydryl. Those remedies worked and my symptoms subsided and I was able to fall back asleep by 4am. In the morning I felt normal, besides some remaining pain and redness surrounding the injection site.

                                                Around 11pm, a pain began in my left arm around the injection site that extended down to my elbow. The pain steadily increased throughout the night until I was no longer able to move my arm above the elbow joint. The pain stopped increasing by morning but has been holding steady for all of today (the day after the injection) and I am still mostly unable to move my arm. A fever of 100.0 - 100.5 developed around 10:00am on 1/5/21 and still remains.

                                                Around bedtime on the day of injection, developed a fever of 99.8 and a terrible headache. My left arm was very painful, even when not touching it or moving it. When I woke up in the morning, fever was higher (100.7) and I was so weak I could barely walk to the bathroom. I felt very dizzy and tired. I drank water and took ibuprofen for the pain. Stayed on the couch all day and took ibuprofen PM to sleep last night. Woke up very early today with a fever of 99.4 and still a bad headache and weak. Walking to the bathroom makes me feel like I need a nap.

                                                Presumed right arm muscle injury.  Several hours after the injection my arm was extremely sore and painful. The joint was painful as well. No redness or swelling. It was tender to touch. I was having difficulty reaching my arm up or moving it upward. Ex: it hurt to lift my hand to touch my face.  I also couldn?t let it fall. If I got my arm above my head I would have to assist it down. I couldn?t sleep that night because of the pain. I was having trouble with pushing movements in that arm. And also letting it hang dependently (like letting my arm hang when I hinged forward). I started taking Motrin 24 hours after the injection. Motrin helped, so I took it Friday and Saturday. Sunday, my arm felt 99% back to normal.  Monday and Tuesday I didn?t notice anything.   Wednesday  morning I woke up with the same pain again and difficulty moving my arm. Wednesday night, I couldn?t sleep again because of the pain/couldn?t get my arm in a comfortable position. I?m taking Motrin, with not as much relief as before. I?ve applied heat and I?ve tried to stretch it as well.   The only way i really know how to describe it? is that it feels as if my deltoid was injured. And my other muscles are fine. It?s hindering my movement in that arm. It is again, tender to touch my deltoid area. The tightness has extended in to my shoulder and neck. It has now been 8 days since my vaccination.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the first dose of moderna vaccine on my right arm, my arm felt numb and tingly.  My heart rate increased and I felt like I was having a panic attack and difficulty breathing even though I was very calm before and during the injection.  I felt lightheaded and had to elevate my legs while I waited in the observation area for 15 minutes. I never experienced this before with any vaccine or injection. That night and the next day, I had extreme fatigue and muscle weakness that I was not able to go to work for one day. On the second day, I felt joint pain in both knees.  By the fourth day, I felt better.

The day after the vaccine I felt feverish, had severe fatigue, muscle aches and headache.  Those symptoms lasted approx 10-12 hours and I have no longer experienced them.  I noticed the pain in my arm pit and swelling the following day and it has continued.

Slight shoulder pain right of the day, with a headache starting after 30 min. Later that night around 10-11pm i woke up with a splitting headache, chills, cold sweat and had a fever of 100.7. Took tylenol, woke up feeling better.  Mild headache lasted 3 days, when headache stopped heaviness/pain started in my left armpit - huge swollen lymph node (injection side). Was painful for 1.5 wks, this past week the lymph node is still swollen but not painful. I tried to go for a run 3 days after injection, I was short of breath and legs felt heavy (usually walk 2 miles daily with dogs, run 3-4 miles 3-4x/wk) figured that went along with swollen lymph node. Today is the first day I was able to run without difficulty catching my breath and my legs don&#39;t feel as heavy (2 miles, slow jog vs run).

Significant soreness in left axilla. Rash increased in size over the course of 36 hours to approximately 4 inches in diameter. Redness, swelling, and stiffness have decreased as diameter of rash has increased. Soreness in axilla has decreased significantly. No other symptoms.

This happened during the observation period and then I was sent to the ED.  About a week later, on the left arm, looked like I had hives, it was swollen and warm to the touch, pain went down into my wrist. I went to Urgent Care.

                                                12 hours after injection (1/8/2021) I began running a low grade fever (99.8), experiencing a debilitating headache, had injection site tenderness as well as swelling the size of a baseball. I iced the injection site and put compression on, in case it was a hematoma from the injection. From 1/8/2021 -1/10/2021 I continued to run a low grade fever, never reaching above 100 degrees. I had full body aches and was exhausted as if a bus ran me over. The injection site swelling slowly reduced with continued ice and compression. From 1/10/2021 - 1/13/2021 I did not have a fever, however I continued to experience intermittent headaches that were as painful as several days prior. I felt chronically exhausted as well. On 1/14/2021 I began to run a low grade fever again (99.8). At this point the injection side swelling was a 6.5cm x 5cm ring of what I believe to be induration. Headache and exhaustion persisted. Friday 1/15/2021 I did not have a fever, but I began to notice that simple tasks such as walking to the kitchen were increasingly difficult. When checked, my oxygen saturation was 98 percent, but my heart rate was 115 while sitting. Saturday 1/16/2021 I began running a fever again, this time reaching 100 degrees. I developed a full body rash, red spots never raised. Again, I continued to have extreme exhaustion and headaches and tachycardia. I took some benadryl to help with the rash. Sunday 1/17/2021 the rash and fever returned, headaches and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia continued. Monday 1/18/2021 I began having a sore throat, fever and rash developed again. Headache and extreme exhaustion and tachycardia as well. Tuesday 1/19/2021 my fever elevated to 100.5, headache, exhaustion, sore throat, tachycardia. However, by Tuesday there was no longer red visible spots. My entire body still itched and felt as if there was a burning sensation, however I could not find any visible red spots to correlate with the itching and burning. Today Wednesday 01/20/2021 I have never felt worse. My entire body feels like it has been repeatedly ran over by a semi truck. My throat hurts. My head hurts. My body burns as if it&#39;s on fire. I am so incredibly tired I feel like it&#39;s an extreme sport just to get out of bed and walk to the bathroom. My fever today 01/20/2021 reached a new 101.4, I&#39;m still tachycardic. Oxygen saturation is within normal limits. However, the induration around the injection site seems to have almost completely resolve.

                                                The vaccine itself was well tolerated with just some injection site pain and minor body aches the next day. Then, last night I took miralax and had an allergic reaction to it. I have taken miralax in the past and I have tolerated it well. This is my first time taking miralax since the Covid vaccine and I suspect it is related since there is polyethylene glycol in the vaccine. About 10 minutes after taking the miralax (in water) I had chest and throat tightness, rash on my chest and face, severe facial flushing, and itching. After that began to resolve I had chills, rigors, and aches in every joint. I had not eaten or consumed anything else and had no exposure to any other potential allergens.

Results did not show any reason to have electrical shocks so  pt was told to take ibuprofen and keep back iced. On 1/19 pt is still having electrical shocks and stated she feels like her nerves are going haywire.  Pt said her skin feels like bugs are crawling on her.  Pt is in a lot of pain and was told to get a referral to see a neurologist in a week if not any better.

Pain, swelling, redness, and toughness began to dissipate around Day 5 and was markedly improved by Day 8 when I completely returned to normal activities.  Additionally, the first day after the vaccination, I experienced muscle aches/pains and severe generalized fatigue that almost made me call out from work. This fatigue and muscle pain was very strong for ~72 hours after the vaccination. However, I was still able to go to work, though my productivity was not the same given the amount of fatigue I experienced and the inability to utilize my right arm to the same degree I would during a normal work day.

Shoulder pain continued through to the day after vaccination (day 1) - had to take tylenol around the clock. By day 2 it was normal. On Day 0, around 8-10 hours post vaccination, I had rigors which lasted a few mins, chills, fevers, myalgias. Took tylenol. On day 1, about 17 hours from vaccination, I woke up with lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea. Felt like I was going to pass out. Laid down, and it passed. Continued with myalgias, fevers, chills, fatigue on day 1. By day 2, I felt normal. I took tylenol day 0 and day 1.

The rash has since been diagnosed by a physician as herpes zoster (shingles) reactivation. I had VZV and HSV as a child (&gt;20 years ago). Of note, the covid-19 vaccine made me sick (chills, myalgia, fever).

I drank 1.5 L of water and put some topical Benadryl cream on the hives, these symptoms resolved. At 8pm I began to get a temperature (temp max 101.2 around 11:17pm), a very sore swollen arm, massive headache, and myalgia/arthralgia in knees bilaterally. On 1/5 temperature has subsided to low grade (99.2F) but I still don?t feel well and have no sense of smell with a runny nose.

There was gradual resolution of pain/tenderness, lymphadenopathy, and rash by approximately 1/1/21.

At got better and was normal by day 3.  Today, 7 days from day of injection, I woke up with my left arm (injection side) sore and inflamed, arm was warm to touch and hurt when I pushed. There&#39;s a mass of dense/sore area, sort of feels like a dense lump.  Area around on skin is itchy - has been this way all day. Tonight the swollenness and itchiness is traveling into left armpit as well.

On 1/6 I was nauseous on and off throughout the day had to take Zofran. 1/7 the swelling on my arm worsened with redness and warm, axillary pain continued, and had some nausea with diarrhea as well.  Today, 1/8 injection site is less red but still swollen with axillary pain, and I can palpate and enlarged axillary lymph node.

The next few days, I had no issues or reactions. 8 days after my vaccination my right deltoid began to itch and when I looked at it there was a patch of redness, which was swollen and  warm to touch. The redness went half way around my deltoid, but did not include the injection site.   I applied ice, took aleve. Over the following 30 hrs, the symptoms dissipated.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had soreness and mild fatigue. The soreness and stiffness was greatest in the arm of injection, and was less intense but present in my upper back and neck. This soreness and stiffness lasted the whole day after the vaccine but was becoming milder, until day 2 after the vaccine when it had completely resolved. No medications were required.  Day 1 after vaccine I also had a bright red, flat, rash that appeared as very close small circles near the injection site (where the bandage was placed) but not on the actual vaccine site. No itching, spreading of rash, or other symptoms. This resolved day 2. I have no known allergies to bandages at this time. No medications were required.

Left arm stop hurting after 1 day but the lump is still there.  On 1/12/21,  I start noticing my underarm starting to hurt.  I thought I pulled a muscle or maybe a swollen lymph node. Did a self examination no swollen lymph so I thought it was a pull muscle. Been taking Advil twice a day but now it is the 1/14/21 underarm still hurt and the lump on the left arm is still there and slightly swollen now. Still taking Advil twice a day due to left underarm pain.

Continued though out night. Sunday - same symptoms but less painful (rate it around a 9/10) - went to store to get groceries with husband around 8:30pm and almost passed out, super weak and felt like puking - not sure if it was just the mask making it hard to breathe.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  SHORTNESS OF BREATH (CHEST PAIN, sob , BACK PAIN STARTING TODAY AT 0900, STATES ADVIL AT 1000, SSENCOND COVID VACCINE YESTERDAY AT 1500) 32-year-old female with past medical history of anxiety, asthma, Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis, psoriasis who presents the emergency department with chief complaint of body aches and shortness of breath.  Patient is a nurse.  She received her 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID-19 the day prior to arriving in the emergency department.  This morning she did feel some mild body aches but otherwise was feeling fine.  Starting later today after her shift at work she developed severe body aches bilateral upper shoulders and down her spine, she also reports some shortness of breath, dizziness.  She felt unsafe to drive home feeling like this.  She had taken some Advil earlier in the day around 10:00.  She denies any fever, nausea or vomiting.  No history of severe vaccine reaction or anaphylaxis.  She has had anaphylactic reaction to Enbrel prior.  She denies any throat swelling, muffled voice, difficulty swallowing, abdominal pain.    patient is mildly tachycardic and hypertensive.  Likely due to pain.  Patient is experiencing adverse reaction to the 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I discussed with her she is having an immune response to the vaccine.  She does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis which could contribute to the elevated immune response as well.  The patient is given 30 mg of IM Toradol for body aches here in the emergency department.  She is instructed to call PCP for close follow-up, rest, drink plenty of fluids.  She has no signs or symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis at this point.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any symptoms other than a sore arm for the first day or two.  On Monday, my left arm started to hurt in a different way.  When I push on it, it is not sore anymore.  Now, when I try to lift my left arm, even a little bit, I have quite a bit of pain internally, in  my upper arm/ shoulder. I feel as though this is not from the actual vaccination, but possibly from how it was administered into my shoulder.  I do realize this is only day 3, but it has gotten worse from yesterday to today.

                                                Started feeling a lump forming under my right armpit. At first it wasn&#39;t hurting that much I just felt it was normal of the swelling and soreness, but then I started feeling more pain at night time when I tried to sleep. On Monday the 25th woke up feeling more pain bigger then a pea on my right armpit had a fever of 100.1 in the morning. I went to the doc around the same day in the afternoon. The doc said it was an infection and inflamed from the vaccine I recently got on Friday.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

After about 20 minutes, I couldn&#39;t feel the left side of my face and the left side of my body was like with you go to the dentist and have lidocaine.  The next day I felt like I had been hit by a mack truck. I felt like that until about January 6, 2021. I also had SOB, joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue and body aches, sore arm and redness at the injection site.

It felt like my arm was on fire for a few minutes but eventually went away. my arm became sore about an hour after the injection but it wasn&#39;t bad. a few hours passed and I started noticing my right arm that I received the vaccine in started really hurting and tingling was shooting down my arm and into my fingers. on January 5, 2021 I could not lift my arm with out crying because the pain was so intense. The sight of where the vaccine was administered was red and very swollen. there is a noticeable lifted knot on my arm the size of a gold ball. the sight around the area of administration is red, and sore and warm to touch. the tingling feeling also was present when waking up on Jan 5, 2021.  around 230 pm, my arm still very sore and the knot on my arm is still visible and sore to touch. the tingling feeling slowly starting to subside.

                                                Within a 5-8 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy and lightheaded.  The nurse had me lay down and took my blood pressure.  It was up to 145/94, unusual for me. I am normally under 120/80.  I rested and had some water and orange juice.  I felt weak but did not lose consiousness. After 30 minutes, my blood pressure was down to 131/87 and she thought it was okay for me to go home. On my drive home, the left side of my face/cheek was tingling. I still felt very weak but the dizziness had subsided.  My fingers were also very cold. I laid down at home and around 6:45 PM, my cheek was still tingling, so I went back to the clinic. They sent me over to the ER. Everything came back normal, except my blood pressure was still elevated in the 140s/90s and the doctor stated I&#39;d had a mild adverse reaction. When I got home, I went to bed. While I was in bed, I noticed my mouth area felt slightly numb.  I went to bed and felt tired, but normal, in the morning. On 12/31/2020 and 1/1/2020 I experienced very bad arm pain that kept me up at night. I experienced a heaviness and throbbing sensation. It was very hard for me to move from side to side while laying down at night. During the day, the pain felt moderate, but at night was very severe. Over-the-counter pain medication helped some. The pain subsided after 2-3 days. One week after the vaccine, on 1/6/2021, I noticed pain at the injection sight again. On the night of 1/6/2021, the pain was severe again. I couldn&#39;t rotate from side to side without extreme pain and heaviness, and also felt the heaviness in my chest plate (not heart, but the bone of my chest). It kept me up most of the night. In the morning, the pain subsided to a mild pain. I applied heat and took ibuprofen the night of 1/7/2021 and noticed an improvement of pain.

These symptoms resolved after a day, but I have had a poorly delineated area of erythema, warmth, edema and pruritus at the injection site that began on day two post-vaccine and has been increasing in size until today (day 5 post-vaccination). Started as a small (2 cmx2cm) wheal, now  appears as painful/itching and warm blanching urticaria that takes up the entire width of my upper arm and half the length of the upper arm.

I could not stop shaking, it was more than just the ?chills? I thought my teeth were going to break they were so tough. It made me hyperventilate because I was so worked up , almost like I couldn?t catch my breath from body being so tense from shaking.  This lasted all night, around 8 am, the ?shakes? became less severe and I then felt like it was a 100 degrees, sweating ALOT.  This lasted all day.  Saturday my body hurt so badly, my muscles and joints hurt so much it hurt to move my toes, I cried and cried and I am a very tough person but this was not normal by any means.  By Sunday I was feeling somewhat better but I wouldn?t and won?t go through this again , my arm still feels like an elephant was sitting on it.  I understand your body makes reactions to vaccines because it recognizes it and is preparing it for antibodies to be made but this was not a normal situation , so much I am almost positive I will not take the second dose, nobody knows how I felt and I will say honestly , this was a horrible and scary thing.

                                                Immediately following the injection there was injection pain at the site and the muscle function was immediately impacted.  For around 36 hours afterward I was unable to raise my left arm above my shoulder.  After that I was able to do so first with pain, pain subsided after around 48 hours.  Beginning 1/8/2021 I had muscle spasms in my lower left abdomen directly to the right of my left hip bone.  The spasms were not painful, but we?re intrusive and constant.  After around 24 hours they subsided and that region became very sore due to the muscles being overworked by the spasms.  On this day I also developed a headache and low grade fever.  The headache is at its worst when I stand up.  6 days after the vaccination I still have a constant minor headache and get pangs and jolts of pain in the top of my head when I stand up and am nearly constantly fatigued.

                                                About 30 minutes after the shot I developed bumps on the back of my tongue. It felt like something was stuck in the back of my throat like a popcorn kernel.  When I arrived home I took Benadryl. I also felt some leg pains and took some tylenol before bed. When I woke up the bumps on my tongue were gone, however I now felt dizzy and &#34;off&#34;. I ended up going into work where I was given a negitve Covid test. Around 9:00am I started getting head to toe body aches and a headache. I felt exhausted and I didnt feel right. I ended up going home at 11:45. From 11:45-5:30pm, the muscle aches, headache, back/side/stomach cramps, and fatigue got worse. My temp ranged from 99.3-100.1 with Aleve and Ibuprofen in me.  I ended up going to sleep around 10pm where I had night sweats, and weird dreams. I woke up in the morning today 1/14 feeling like I had a slight headache, but for the most part I felt back to normal. I currently do not have any symptoms at 11:36am.

                                                at around 2am I woke up shaking and extremely cold. Got up and felt severe body aches and rigors. Throughout the day I had persistent fever of up to 101.8F which improved with alternating IBU 800mg and Tylenol 1g, but did not resolve. The severe body pains and headache also lasted all day. Improved but not resolved with medication. My right arm was also severely painful. Could not raise it.  All symptoms resolved by the next morning except for  the arm pain which is much milder, like a 1/10 dull pain but still persistent.

No pain on palpation and no fever. I also experienced pain under my left arm pit. The next day (1/20/2021) the swelling has gotten larger with same symptoms.

I began to feel severe flu-like symptoms (hot/cold chills, sensitive skin, headache, dry/scratchy throat, fever dreams) which persisted for several hours during the night. The next day (1/16), the fatigue, headache, and chills persisted (although the chills decreased). I took Dayquil before noon and that seemed to help with the symptoms, and Nyquil at night so I was able to sleep. By the following morning, I still had a mild headache and fatigue but continued to improve. I felt normal again on 1/18.   I also had stiffness, swelling, and soreness at the injection site for 3-4 days.

                                                1 week after my injection I developed a approximate baseball size circle at my injection sight with mild warmth and tenderness and swelling. I had axillary lymph node swelling, neck muscle soreness, fatigue, and frontal and temporal headache. I still have a red circular area at my injection sight but it is gradually improving (4 days out from redness occurring). The symptoms seemed worse than the initial reaction the first few days after my injection. I am a health care provider and have taken photos daily but have not gone for an office visit at this time.

                                                On 1/19/21 I received my SECOND dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. 1/20/21 at around 0300, started with restless leg feeling and headache, nausea (dry heaved). At this time I took two Tylenol &amp; two Advil with a Ketorolac. The restless leg continued into full body aches, head to toe. Headache to migraine (this varied from on the top of my head to my left temple). These symptoms were consistent throughout the day, with severe fatigue. 1000 of 1/20/21 I was feeling chills and again nausea (again dry heaves). I drank ginger ale for the nausea, but I had no appetite till 1400. 1100 I took four more Tylenol. The aches subsided towards evening, however the headache in my left temple remained for the rest of the night. At 0500 on 1/21/21 I took more Tylenol and woke up later without the headache and body aches. However fatigue did linger with some back pain throughout the day. On the morning of 1/21/21 I did notice a lump and redness at injection site, as well as being painful to the touch.

                                                Body aches and chills the following morning after receiving the vaccination.  I was very sluggish and remained in bed for the majority of the day.    I also had a lot of pain at the injection site and couldn&#39;t lift my arm.  Tylenol resolved the issues for the most part but it was only effective for about three hours prompting me to wait an additional 2-3 hours with the symptoms.   This lasted 24 hours and I felt good as new the following day with minor pain at the injection site.

                                                There were no immediate adverse affects after the vaccine. Arm tenderness near the injection site became very noticeable the morning after the shot. About a day after the vaccine, I developed flu-like symptoms: joint tenderness, body aches, chills, and a low-grade fever of 99 - 100.1 degrees. These symptoms were completely gone within 48 hrs. I experienced moderate to severe arm tenderness for 3-4 days. I also had slight periods of itchiness near the site of injection, but again, this dissipated completely after 3-4 days.

                                                I received the vaccine on December 29th, 2020. The vaccinated arm didn&#39;t really hurt until the next morning when I woke up I could barely move my arm.  Around 10:00am  I started getting chills and having sweats. Over the next hour I became severely fatigued even with taking my adderall that morning. My body started tingling, I felt dissociated, had a headache, and a little light headed. Almost a little drunk feeling. I went home from work and slept most of the day.  When I woke up in the evening around 9pm I was sweaty, and my muscles and joints hurt. I took my temperature and it was  100.6.  The next morning on December 31st I no longer had a fever. My temperature was 98. something. The next several days and even now I continue to feel severely fatigued, and slightly dissociated. However, each day I seem to feel the side effects a little less.

Then the redness came back bigger in size than it was previously. My axilla started having pain, that pain is consistent and doesn?t subside with any intervention.  The pain seems to be increasing by the day. I have not sought evaluation on this, hoping it will go away soon.

                                                She has had intermittent fatigue since receiving the vaccine, which is slowly improving. She had significant pain after receiving the vaccine which resolved in a day or two. She was unable to move the arm the evening after receiving the vaccine (feeling completely asleep), but has gained full strength. She continues to have paresthesias (like the arm feeling asleep or bugs crawling) to the forearm and her entire hand. She did take diphenhdyramine and isn&#39;t certain if it improved the paresthesias, but it did make her fall asleep. Two to three days ago (about 6 days after receiving the vaccine), she developed a cellulitis about 5 cm distal to the vaccine site without systemic symptoms for clinically apparent abscess.

                                                I developed a moderately severe headache, body aches, fatigue and nausea within a few hours of the vaccine. These symptoms persisted into the next day, but had decreased in severity after about 24 hours. I still had a mild headache and body aches (specifically back, neck, and R shoulder pain) the next two days. Three days after, I started feeling worse. The headache again became moderately severe, as well as the neck and back pain,  fatigue and nausea.  This has continued through today (day 8 post-vaccine).  I still have a moderately severe constant headache (dull with throbbing with exertion or movement in neck), back and neck pain and stiffness, mild nausea, and fatigue.

The reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% , 7 days after receiving the covid vaccine. I started to feel pain to left jaw but figured it was due to dental work. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek was very painful and hard. The pain to face was about 8/10. I iced it, took pain pill and fell asleep. When I woke up my left arm was hot itchy swollen and the arm and jaw were still very painful.    the reaction happened at a trip to dentist after I was injected with lidocaine 2% and septocaine 4% I started to feel pain to left jaw injection area. By the time I got home I realized my left deltoid, where I received the covid vaccine was hot, red, swollen and with a itchy rash. Also it&#39;s very hard and stiff. Also my left cheek is painful and hard. By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. I&#39;m tearting it with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1%to deltoid  2-3 times a day.  By the day I had my dental work done, I had no more pain to left deltoid, but after the dental work it was obvious that I was having an adverse reaction. I&#39;ve had lidocaine and septicane injections before with no issues ever. It&#39;s now 24 hours and the covid injection site (left deltoid) is still hard, painful red and with a rash. My left cheek jaw area is tender but I&#39;ll assume it&#39;s from the dental work. I&#39;m treating left arm  with benadryl 25mg and hydrocortisone cream 1% to deltoid  2-3 times a day. No changes at this time. It&#39;s starting to worry me because it feels like a hard mass that is painful and hot. (left deltoid).

                                                After receiving the vaccine on 12/30 the only side effect at that time was arm soreness at the injection site. A day later some chills and fatigue but no other side effects after. I noticed starting on 1/4 pain started on injection arm from shoulder down lower to extremities on left arm. Pain very excruciating but comes and goes. Joint pain and muscular pain throughout entire arm and even in right arm. After couple days of this,  contacted family physician regarding this.  Was seen by physician on 1/6. Discuss concerned and he ordered X-rays on both arms and ultrasound droplet on entire left arm (injection site- from shoulder in down). MD also I formed me to take Advil/Aleve twice a day as needed for pain/soreness along with heat/cool compressions as needed as well as shoulder exercises. Today is 1/9 and pain isn?t as bad. Can still feel discomfort here and there but not as excruciating. Numbness from time to time also. Is this normal after receiving the Moderna vaccine? Is it normal to experience this a week after receiving the vaccine?

                                                Approximately 5 minutes post injection, I felt a burning sensation move from my left deltoid, up my shoulder, and across my chest. I experienced burning in my chest for about 10 mins, and then it subsided. About 8 mins after that, I experienced moderate to severe cramping in my lower back and thigh muscles; which completely subsided after 10-15 mins. Two days after the initial injection, the injection site began burning/aching again, with movement up to my shoulder joint. It was to a point where I was tearful and unable to sleep. The following morning it had subsided, and just remains slightly sore.

Went to bed around 10pm on 1/8/21. Woke up around 4am on 1/9/21 and my temp was 99.7 prior to taking any meds and after about 20 minutes of being out of bed.

                                                Vaccine administered around 5:30pm Thursday, January 7th. Severe site pain within the first few hours of receiving vaccine, lasting about 48 straight hours. Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine, my entire body began to ache and by the next morning I could hardly get out of bed due to the pain in my muscles. They felt like they had tightened or seized up. I could not take a step without wincing. Body chills came next, though I was unable to get out of bed to get my  thermometer from the bathroom. By Saturday morning, I had more range of motion in my extremities, but it was not until Sunday evening that I could lift my left arm (the one the received the inoculation) over my head. There was a red, circular non-irritating rash surrounding the site of injection for 5 days following injection. I have no allergies to any medications, but did test positive for the Covid virus on March 18th, 2020. I realize my body&#39;s reaction was a normal physiologic response to the antibodies my body created within the last 9 months, however I am an otherwise healthy 34 year old female and wanted to report my experience because I could not find evidence that anyone else has had the same experience following the first dose of the covid vaccine.

Pain in constant and does not subside with any Advil or cold compress.  My doctor prescribed a pain patch which is not helping at all, as well as  ibprofein 800 which is also not working. Made an appointment with  an orthopedic surgeon since pain is not going away and is getting worse.

It grew overnight and was the size of a tennis ball the next day. It was hard and hot to the touch. Over the course of the weekend it grew to the size of a softball and was tender, hard, red and hot to the touch. It is currently still red and itches. It is not as hard and it is still big. I did take Benadryl every night to try and calm it down. I also iced my shoulder.

                                                I was experiencing what I understand to be one of the more common side effects: pain at injection site. This pain kind of traveled to other parts of my arm and eventually my arm pit. I noticed the pain travelling around the date of 1/2/2021, and by 1/6/2021 it getting more intense. As I was trying to massage out the soreness, I noticed a palpable, painful lump in my right breast. I did not immediately recognize it as a swollen lymph node at that time, but after several Dr exams, and the lump and pain decreasing, I believe that is what was happening. I do still have the lump, and it is tender, so I am currently monitoring it.

                                                Tiredness, body aches within first 12 hours. By almost 48 hours, I had numbness down the whole left side of the body. This was in the evening, I was not laying on that side of the body in bed but I could barely move that side. Afterwards, I had a slot of pain at the injection site and needed to use a cold compress to settle the swelling and pain.

                                                After the fever of 40C, chills, tiredness, nausea, headache. Started to feel pain on the left side of my face. Next day the pain has spread to my neck and ear. On day number three they felt numb, day number four lots of pain on my jaw. Day number 5 I couldn&#39;t even swallow and had difficulty breathing. When I looked in the mirror the left side of my face was very swollen like a ball and my face looked like it was paralyzed. I went to the ER where I was seen, but it remains the same days afterwards. My cheek doesn&#39;t look the same, looks bigger and the eye is droopy, my neck and ear hurts, it is difficult to swallow. My left arm is numb and swollen.

                                                The Moderna vaccine injection was placed in the acromion process above the deltoid. The placement was just below the joint of my left arm. Immediate burning/tingling sensation began. I was observed for 15 minutes and sent home anyway.  I could not move my arm for 4 days. The pain level was a 9 out of 10. If I had to move or turn, I involuntarily would cry out in pain. There was no redness, rash or swelling at the injection site. Just intense pain that shot down the left arm to my middle and ring fingers, top of the hand, with pain in my left shoulder blade and mild pain in the left side of my neck. Fatigue and chills started the evening of day 1 and lasted 7 days. The fatigue intensified in day 2 and dissipated on days 5 and 6. No fever was present at any time. On day 2, the nausea started and I vomited twice- the night of day 4 and morning of day 5. Intense headaches with light sensitivity were present from the night of day 3 through day 6. These felt like extreme migraines. These, combined with nausea and arm pain, prevented/interrupted my sleep. I also had loose stools on days 2 and 4.

On 1/2/21, my right foot and leg were fine and pain has not returned since then. My left foot, ankle, and shin hurt pain level 2 of 10 on and off all day. Same on 1/3/21. On 1/4/21 the left leg, ankle, and foot hurt 7 of 10. Same on 15/2021. The pain seems to be moving upwards, almost to my knee at times. The pain is usually an ache all over the left food, ankle, shin. Sometimes I get sharp jabs of pain while sitting or walking. Aleve sometimes helps. Heat pad made it worse. Cold pad made it a little better.

Muscle aches, fatigue, just felt off.  Then arm was very sore.  Sunday night my arm pit really started hurting.  Hurst over my shoulder, clavicle, and down into the lateral side of my breast.  Bothered enough in the night that I didn&#39;t sleep well.  This morning 1-5-21 I have a red rash over the injection site, arm is swollen over deltoid and hot.  Arm pit and down into breast is still hurting significantly.  I took Ibuprofen yesterday and helped some with pain in arm pit.  Off an on SOB and chest feels tight.  No cough

                                                12 days following the vaccine administration I noticed redness on my arm around the injection site. This redness was hot to the touch and rather large, exceeding the deltoid muscle and going down into my bicep. I also felt radiating soreness into my armpit and left breast.  The following day the rash had grown in size and felt hot to the touch on my entire upper arm with swelling and edema that affected the movement of my arm and hand. Continued soreness and pain in my armpit, left breast and down my arm into my fingers and up into my neck.  I proceeded to go to the urgent care as directed by Clinic employee health and my PCP. There was I was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescriped Keflex for 7 days, 3x a day.  It has been recommended that I seek further medical care due to my reaction, but this has yet to be scheduled.

                                                At 8:35 AM on 1/6/2021, I noticed redness and swelling on my upper left arm as I removed my long-sleeve shirt.   I also noticed that my upper left arm was slightly warm after touching it.  This is the first time I have experienced redness, swelling and warmth on the injection site.  After I got my first dose of the COVID19 (Moderna) vaccine, I experienced mild pain, soreness and muscular/body aches for several days.  I longer experienced these particular symptoms on 1/5/2021.  To treat the redness and swelling, I took one 25 mg tablet of Diphenhydramine HCl at approximately 10:00 AM.  I went to bed 50 minutes later.   I woke up at approximately 6:50 PM.  I checked my upper left arm and saw that the redness and swelling went down.  However, my upper left arm still feels slightly warm.  I will continue to monitor my current symptoms for the next few days.

Around 8 pm the pain radiated up my shoulder across the top of my back. Around 10 pm I was suddenly hit with a wave of fatigue where my husband was unable to wake me from the couch to go to bed.  I woke up around 8:30 am on 1/7/21 with a debilitating headache, tingling in my fingertips,  and unsteadiness while walking. I was advised to go to the ED who gave no treatment other than recommending OTC pain meds, benedryl and rest. I returned home and took all the recommendations. At 4:41 pm, there has been no change with symptoms.

Never did I develop a temperature. This continued until 12/26/2020 when the symptoms dissipated. 1/5/2021 @ 0600: I woke up to my right arm feeling sore and area where I had received the vaccine was warm and a thin red circular outline could be seen. Also note that a few months ago I had injections in my legs due to vein insufficiency. Interestingly enough, during the same time frames, when my arm would become red and painful, so would my right knee.

                                                After receiving the shot,  I experienced a sharp pain in my shoulder and neck on the left side (same side as the shot was received).  This only lasted a couple of minutes and then I felt normal.  That evening the area where I received the shot was sore and hard to lift.  This is when I started to notice stiffness in my left elbow joint and muscle aches throughout my body.  Upon waking the following morning,  the stiffness in my elbow joint had increase and it made it difficult to bend my elbow.  At this point,  I had assumed that maybe I had pulled something or slept on it wrong.  I figured it would work itself out in a day or two.  This has not been the case.  It is now day 8,  my elbow joint is stiff with soreness and pain in the surrounding area.  I am not able to lift items as I normally would or squeeze/hold items in my  left hand without experiencing pain in that elbow or the surround muscles.  It had been uncomfortable and painful to move and bend that arm and even the simple act of straightening the elbow is difficult to accomplish.  All pain and discomfort is limited to the elbow joint and surrounding area.

                                                Roughly 4-5 minutes following my vaccination I felt a rush of lightheadedness, tension in my neck, difficulty obtaining a deep breath, flushed and sweating. My vitals were obtained by on on-site medic HR/BP were elevated and SO2 had dropped. I was under direct supervision of a medic for roughly 45 mins, vitals were taken again half way through and had normalized but were still high in comparison to my usual. The light headed feeling and flushed feeling did not subside and I was unable to drive myself home, I had to leave my vehicle and arrange a ride from my husband. Since returning home I have battled sweats, chills, increased pain in my left shoulder, increased headache, body aches, tension in my neck and shoulders, and diarrhea. It has been 24 hours and an intense headache/neck ache still remains, some fluctuating warm/cold body temps, and diarrhea are still persisting.

The aches were so intense that standing on my own was almost impossible for 24hours.  At the 24 hour mark, my symptoms reduced significantly.  Day 2 after the injection was mainly mild body ache and moderate arm pain at the injection site.

                                                A little over 2 days after the vaccine, I had a horrible headache. Thought nothing of it, took Excederin migraine and went to bed. Woke up Thursday feeling fine, then by 5 pm, was very run down, had a mild headache, and had an intense sinus pressure under my eyes. My neck hurt and was sore to the touch in the front. When I bent over, it felt like my head was going to explode from pressure. No other symptoms or anything to be alert about. Took a Mucinex before bed, hoping that it would move anything that might be clogging my sinuses, went to sleep. Woke up Friday feeling okay, with just a tiny remnant of a headache. Around 1 pm, intense sinus pressure returned, worse than the previous day. Decided to go to local healthcare clinic around 3:30 pm. PA looked at ears, throat, all looked okay. Only symptom was swollen lymph nodes in neck, same side as the vaccine was administered. Covid tested (subsequent results were negative). Saturday, had less pressure, and spent the day laying around. By Sunday, was feeling back to normal. Peak of incident was definitely Friday.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   I received the vaccine yesterday 1/11/21 at 1135.  About 2 hours later I started feeling symptoms :   Headache dull still.  I&#39;ve been having this pain/ache in my ribs and upper torso of it is crushing inward. My ribs feel like they are being squeezed too hard like a person hugging so tight that you are having difficultly breathing. And the upper torso under my ribs feels like when you have not ate anything in days of hunger pain (but I am not at all hungry) and it start to hurt soo bad that you can only hunch over and hope it goes away.   These issues have been on and off yesterday and today with the dull feel that has not gone away of a 3 or 4 to in a moments notice 8. Currently it is a 3 with a dull squeeze to ribs and barrable hunger pain (I am not hungry).

                                                Approximately 14 hours after first covid vaccine I was nauseous, muscle cramps in whole right arm (the side I was given the shot), migraine, dizzy, trouble lifting arm, redness swelling and pain at injection site.  Felt ok the next day.  6 days after receiving vaccine it felt like I had swallowed razor blades and was hard to breathe.  I went to local emergency room where they tested me for strep and was negative and they said they had never seen a swab come back so bloody.  They also did a covid test and I got the results back today showing invalid.  Yesterday I had a low grade fever and today at the injection site my arm is red, swollen, has a knot and sore to the touch.

Was pretty extreme next day - couldn?t move arm above head, hard to change in and out of clothes, etc. Following day still pain but maybe 10%better. Over weekend slowly got better. This Monday and Tuesday woke up with very slight pain but nothing that I had to adjust my everyday routine for like a I had the first few days so I thought I was in the clear. Then last night extreme pain back again. Can?t move arm/shoulder without pain. Can?t engage muscle without a lot of pain.

It was that way for a few days then went away completely.   I felt great Monday-Thursday this past week.  01/15/2021 In the evening I developed a slight headache and sore throat 01/16/2021 I woke up feeling sick. I am fatigued, having some muscle aches,  a sore throat, headache, nasal congestion and slight cough. At about 6 p.m. I noticed that my left arm suddenly had the same red, inflamed raised area again and is slightly itchy.  I called a telemedicine general physician as I work in Covid testing and wasn&#39;t sure if I was experiencing a primary infection or if this is a result of the vaccination. He advised that I reach out to report a possible adverse reaction.

It was a huge, super hot, golf ball size welt on my arm. It spent two days growing bigger. The fourth day it began to feel better. I also had muscle stiffness, body and body aches lasting about 2-3 days.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after vaccination, I developed generalized malaise with significant pain in right arm (injection site), neck and back.  Over the subsequent 2-4  hours, I developed fever to 102.5 with shaking chills with ongoing myalgias and arthralgias (knees, hips).  I took some acetaminophen and fever eventually broke.  Still feeling weak, achy and fatigued but better.

                                                As the injection day wore on, my arm increased in soreness. By 9:00 pm on day of injection, I was unable to lift or move my arm, due to the pain. For 2 days after the injection, I was unable to perform many activities becuase I could not lift or move my arm. By 11:30 pm on Saturday 1/16, I started to be able to lift and move my arm, a tiny bit. On Sunday the 17th, I was able to lift my arm to shoulder height, but still had a great deal of pain. The pain started to lessen throughout the day on Sunday. When I woke up Monday morning, I was able to use my arm, but it felt &#34;dead&#34; (like when you sleep on a limb wrong). This feeling continued through Tuesday, and Tuesday evening. Tuesday evening, into Wednesday the 20th, it feels like there is a tennis ball in my arm pit - when my arm is in normal position. When my axillary lymph nodes were felt, there is no swelling, but a greater amount of pain.

The twitch became more pronounced and involving the entire left arm and within twenty minutes her fingers had become hyper-flexed and erect (looked like swan neck deformity).  She tried pressing down and stretching the fingers to no avail. 12:40 she was asked to accompany this writer to another observation area for closer monitoring. When she stood up from the chair, she was frozen and unable to move her left leg on command and needed physical assistance from this writer to ambulate.  She became weak and needed the assistance of another nurse to  be laid on the stretcher.  VS were taken 98/64,117,22.  (VS prior to administration of the vaccine  124/89,130,18.     At this time we offered to send her to ED for further evaluation but staff declined stating, &#34;this has happened before, it will go away&#34;.   It was agreed upon that if symptoms worsened or showed no improvement in 5 minutes EMS would be activated.  12:50 VS 130/83,89 , tremors dissipating, fingers back in normal position , she was able to move her left leg on command and stand unassisted.   She continued to be monitored and all symptoms gone by 1:10  when she was able to leave the facility on her own.

OB office was contacted about reaction and they will continue to monitor during my pregnancy but as of now no signs of harm.  Adverse reaction started with minor muscle aches  then about 12hr after I started with a fever/ chills that got very severe during the night. Finally around 1am/2am the fever started to break.  I took Tyenol 500mg every 4 to 6 hours x 5 doses in the 24hr period.

                                                The day of my 2nd vaccination, I felt a heavy pressure being forced down on myself. It started as a weakness that begun in my left arm. I felt I had unequal strength and my arm felt numb. This begun minutes after my injection. Soon after the sensation went to my whole body. I had difficulty moving from the chair to a wheelchair. I was moved to a treatment bed and layer down in the supine position. I felt extremely weak and hot. After an hour I was released home. The evening of my injection, I started to become extremely tired. My appetite disappeared and all I wanted to do was go to bed. While sleeping I was awoken due to an heating issue inside the home.  I woke up, tried to eat something, but had no desire to. I went back to bed, after taking some Tylenol. My body was starting to ache. While in bed, I begun to experience severe muscle spasms, cramps, etc. These caused me to cry. I began experience extreme changes in temperature. I went from hot to cold quickly. My mouth became very dry, and the weakness persisted. I began to experience severe pain at the injection site that radiated down into my armpit and left breast and my left shoulder blade. I could barely lift my arm. It feels as though the muscle is very ridge, hard and I have point tenderness. I continued to experience severe fatigue and after waking up this morning around 10am or so, I felt extremely hot. My temperature is reading 100.1 Tympanic. I&#39;ve taken Motrin this time as I have been alternating between the two pain relievers.

                                                approximately 45- an hour after the injection I had some rapid heart rate and shortness of breath. Around lunch I had a hard time swallowing  with more shortness of breath and rapid heart beat .  My arm became increasingly  sore throughout the day with a swollen lump protruding from my sleeve. That afternoon around 5 pm when I got home from work I decided to take off my shirt to look , a red rash had begun to form up my arm into my left  shoulder.  I applied ice and took Ibuprofen 800 mg . The next morning I awoke to a very swollen arm with a large knot at the injection site. I hurt from the injection site all the way up to my neck. The Rash and pain continued for a couple more days into the weekend. I consult my physician and was told to continue Benadryl and Zyrtec.  One week after receiving the vaccination I did not feel well and was sent to the CRNP for employee health. I had muscle aches, body aches, low grade temp, sinus pressure, tired, sore throat. I was given a covid, flu A&amp;B test which all came back negative. Over the next  two weeks I have experienced extreme fatigue, random low grade temps, muscle aches , sore throat, and neck soreness.

Chills, muscle aches, headache and fatigue began about 14 hrs after injection and continued for about 24 hrs. Headache  and fatigue continued on for 48hrs. Diarrhea probably started about 18 hrs after injection and was very mild throughout the next day. Enlarged lymph node didn&#39;t start until around 38 hrs later and although it has reduced significantly it is still a bit enlarged.

When I got up the next morning at 6am, I realized I had mastitis on my right breast ( I got the vaccine in my left arm.) The mastitis consisted of redness around the areola, pain, swelling, and my lymph node in my right armpit felt slightly enlarged and painful. My fever was 100.9

It was a raised area that was red and hot in a circular shape that was 4 inches across. Remained this was until 1/5/2021. It was painful to move the arm (2/10). I used Tylenol for discomfort and ice to the site. Helped some.

I felt like my heart rate has been rapid all day and my rate of breathing has been slightly increased. The pain in my left arm, where I was given the injection is very sore to the point where it is difficult to lift or to touch. I was too weak to attempt to go to follow up with medical professionals today and opted to wait to see if symptoms resolved.

                                                On day 5 post vaccination I had some axilla pain in my right arm. I couldn&#39;t see anything - no redness, nothing swollen, just some pain. It did not warrant medication to be treated. Then on post vaccination day 6, I woke up in the middle of the night to an inflamed area at my vaccination site and by morning the area had spread. As of now it is measuring at 4 cm and is raised, swollen, red, and mildly itchy. From 1/7 to 1/8 it has not changed and may be mildly improved. As a pharmacist, I wanted to report since it seemed to happen beyond the 72 hrs described in the common adverse events reported. As of 1/8, I can still sense the axilla pain but it is not as bad.

Rash has began lighten some and swelling and warmth has resolved still itching.

                                                Upon vaccination, I had mild soreness in my right arm muscle on day 1 and day 2 (I have been reporting to the VSafe app). There were NO other symptoms or side effects including NO redness, lump/swelling, itching, etc.  I felt fine. I woke up Wednesday, January 6th at 8am  to some itching on my injection site. When lifting my shirt to look at it, I found a quarter sized, red swollen lump that was a little sore and hot to touch.  I contacted my hospital employee COVID phone hotline and spoke with a nurse who transferred me to a doctor (11am) I sent a photo and described my arm. Dr. stated that it was unlikely an allergic reaction due to it being 1 week later. She diagnosed me with cellulitis and started me on Bactrim antibiotic. I took my first dose at 8pm on 1/6 and at 2:30am I woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea. I woke up again on 1/7 with an elevated temperature at 99 and feeling nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, slight body aches and a large, red hot touch spot on my left ankle (I had a spider bite on my left ankle in Sept 2020 that was treated with Bactrim it healed no issues but this flare up occurred same spot). I continued to take the Bactrim (3 pills total since receiving the rx) and still felt sick. I spoke again with a new COVID hotline doctor on the phone APRN CNP who stated she believes I in fact do not have cellutitis but rather an allergic reaction to the Moderna vaccine and therefore I should cease taking the Bactrim and start Benadryl. I did that at 7pm 1/7 went to bed woke up and my ankle was better as was my arm although you can still see the circle. I followed up on 1/8 with APRN CNP via secure messaging with photos and she stated again I likely am allergic and to monitor.

                                                At 4:30pm on Saturday January 9, 2021 I experience a slight fever with chills and back and neck pain. Nothing alarming. I was still able to carry out my normal day activities that included cleaning, tidying, cooking. I did not check my temperature because there was no need, as I said, I could carry on with my day. My arm hurt a lot that day and there was a rectangular red rash around the injection site. That was about the weirdest part at 5:15pm today (Jan 10th, 2021). I noticed this gnarly rash on my chest and back and both shoulders. Red and a little itchy, warm to the touch. It is now 11:50pm same day and the relish has spread to under both of my breasts and down to the bottom of my back. I have pictures of the rash. No fever today. Also, I am both the patient and a member of the vaccination team at my company. My coworker and I are in charge of all admin associated with the vaccine. We are currently vaccinating all our staff. I was the first to get vaccinated in our company. And here it looks like I have an allergic reaction! I have never had an allergic reaction in the past to an injection. I just took some BENADRYL. I&#39;ll show a nurse at my clinic tomorrow. Hoping it doesn&#39;t spread anymore.

On Day 9, I had red, slightly itchy, rash at site of injection approx 6x5cm. Had neg rapid COVID test on Day 9 and PCR, which was negative as well. Saw my provider on Day 10 and requested labs to be checked (cbc, iron also checked as needed to follow up those incidentally). Requested an esr but provider did not think it was necessary but did encourage me to report to Health Department or Moderna but found this website instead. Please let me know if I need to notify anyone else.

                                                Immediately became very dizzy, and my heart started racing. I started to feel discomfort in my throat. and tongue felt lazy in my mouth. I also felt my arms and legs very heavy and a wave like sensation going up and down my body.  These symptoms were strongest 2-3 minutes after the shot for about 15 minutes. Then they seemed to fade away, and come back for the next hour. They eventually resolved on their own, and were not severe enough for me to need medical help or treatment, although I did stay in the emergency room in case the throat and tongue discomfort became worse, by the time they got to me, the symptoms had resolved themselves.  I woke up the next day with a sore arm,  and it remained sore for the next three days. And I also woke up for the next three days with extreme nausea.   I would also like to add that I am currently breastfeeding a 5 month old, in case that is important.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination, I was sitting in the observation area looking down at my phone when I felt a strange tingle in my throat. When I picked my head up, it went away quickly and did not happen again so I did not think it was a big deal. The RN monitoring the group approached me a few moments later and asked if I was OK because my chest was a little flushed. My complexion is very fair and I get red pretty easily just by clothing rubbing against my skin so I thought nothing of it but asked her to keep an eye on me. She came back around a couple more times and said it looked better. Thinking about my anxiety to get the vaccine, I assumed that was what it was and that everything was OK. I sat a bit longer, about 20 or so minutes after getting the vaccine and I seemed OK. Before leaving I had a brief conversation with a colleague while standing and I still felt OK. I left the facility and while driving home, my face started to feel hot and it was red. I was fairly close to my mother&#39;s house who is an RN so I called her and headed towards her house. She gave me 1 Benadryl and checked around my body for other blotchy red spots which seemed to be around my chest, torso, arms and face. She also noted my face was swollen, red and hot to the touch. I was able to eat dinner and drink 2 seltzers without issue then headed home about 6:30p. I took 1 Zyrtec at about 7:00-7:30p. Additionally, when I woke up on 1/7/2021, I felt tired, a mild sore throat and mild stuffy nose. My right arm was sore and heavy below the injection site. My face has been warm, slightly puffy and on and off red throughout the day. I had a headache in the morning when I first woke up and I have been parched all day. I took 2 - Ibuprofen when I woke up. Also throughout the day, at times I feel my chest get a little heavy.

Have taken it easy the rest of the day but able to be upright. Now just fatigue, muscle aches, feeling cold, abnormal teeth and tongue sensation x 2 hrs). The rest of the symptoms just described continue this evening which i attribute to the covid vaccine.

If I put my fingertips in the middle of my armpit it hurt, sharp pain. I could not feel any lumps. I felt 2 lymph nodes swollen: above left clavicle and bottom of left neck. The lymph node above the left clavicle hurt with pressure.  Pain in both areas subsided by 01/06/2021 evening. Lymph node swelling has gone down but I can still feel them.

                                                Two days after my vaccine I noticed some pain in my low back and in my left hand and left foot. I also had one night where I woke up and had soaked through my blankets with sweat. Otherwise, felt fine. On January 7th I noticed that the injection site was suddenly very red and swollen and a dull ache had returned. On the 8th the redness was more filled in and less bright, still swollen and painful. I tried to go paddle boarding and all of my muscles were very weak and I got dizzy and nauseated. I felt like my body was full of lactic acid and that my muscles would not work properly. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and 50mg of Benadryl and got in bed and slept. On the 9th, the redness was almost gone, swelling still visible and muscles very weak, along with a strange tight feeling in my neck and head. My left toes went totally numb. I mainly stayed in bed and slept until the 12th when a precautionary COVID test was negative and I was able to get lab work drawn. I tried biking 2 blocks and felt that my muscles were a little stronger, however my joints felt very fragile and I was short of breath. On the 13th I got some tingling in my left foot and toes went completely numb on 2 occasions. Today, (14th) I do not have the lactic acid feel, however I am very tired and continue to have the head and neck tightness.

                                                Approximately around 8:00 pm the same day as my injection I started to be in a fair amount of pain at the injection site (right shoulder) I took a bath still was in pain took Tylenol hoping it would take the edge off around 11:30 the pain started to increase so I put a heating pad on my arm . As the night progressed my shoulder pain intensified and then  I started to feel pain all over my by body mainly in the joints. It was very severe joint pain all over and especially in my right shoulder that I took another bath.  I couldn?t lay down or sleep I could barely walk around my bedroom but even that hurt so bad in my hips and knees. This feeling was very similar as if I were to having an lupus episode in my joints. Around 4 am on January 14th I finally took ibuprofen and eventually I was able to fall asleep. I later woke up around 9 am and thankfully pain free other than a mild shoulder pain where I got my vaccine.

Redness, swelling, pain at the injection site, stiff arm, slightly elevated temperature (no true fever), aches, and fatigue. Most resolved within 2-3 days.  I was vaccinated 9 days ago, and the following symptoms persist: redness and itching at the vaccination site and a hard lump at the vaccination site. Despite being expected reactions, The concern is their persistence so long after the 1st vaccination. I have not yet received a 2nd dose.

My cough got really bad and I had to start on an albuterol nebulizer because of my cough/wheezing.

I pulled into my school with 5 mins and started taking a rubbing alcohol/saline taste in my mouth and smelling it. I was dizzy, feeling ?floaty? out of body,  chills, extremely tired, unable to stand, high blood pressure and loss of color to face and hands. This  all happened within 35 minutes to one hour after removing the actual injection. I was being monitored. I was unable to drive and had to be picked up.  Within 6 hours after injection, the dizziness subsided and the body shaking.  9 hours after the injection I still have throbbing headache, extreme exhaustion, weakness in standing and alcohol taste in mouth.  Rheumatologist was contacted and left message for her.

                                                7 days after first moderna dose I developed a warm, itchy sensation in my left deltoid - this was in the middle of the night and I kept waking up uncomfortable. When I woke up Saturday morning my deltoid was red and swollen, the muscle was still hot and now starting to ache instead of itch. Throughout Saturday the aching intensified to about a 6/10. Then it radiated into my left armpit and feeling of pain like a hard small ball in my armpit. I went to urgent care, the doctor was not sure if it was delayed allergic reaction or cellulitis so he started me on Bactrim. I have now taken one day of Bactrim - seems to be improving but still have sensation in my armpit/lymphnode.

It was the size of a quarter with a lump under the skin about the size of a half dollar. Within 24 hours, both the welt and the lump doubled in size.  Side Effects: Within 2 hours of the vaccine a headache developed.  Within 4 hours of the vaccine fatigue set-in.  24 hours after receiving the vaccine, fatigue continued.  34 hours after receiving the vaccine, in addition to the continued fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnea upon exertion started a long with mild throat soreness, nausea, muscle/body aches and joint pain.  50 hours after receiving the vaccine all side effects subsided except for soreness at the site of the injection and shortness of breath/dyspnea.  72 hours after receiving the vaccine there is still soreness at the site of the injection as well as shortness of breath.

I was unable to tolerate sleeping on my left side that night and I had a bad headache. My arm is still sore now but I can tolerate pressure on it better. Yesterday around 1:00 pm, the day after the shot, I began having some itching along the back of my neck near my hair line. By around 7:00 that night my neck continued to itch, I was not scratching however, but also my upper posterior neck into my hair line became red, hot, swollen, and painful. It spread equally across my posterior cervical spine from the base of my head to about C7 level (pics taken). My headache worsened and pain spread all the way down my spine to my lumbosacral region. I still have these symptoms now but to a lesser degree. I feel nauseated today as well and had to stay home from work and contact my doctor because of these symptoms.

Tongue and mouth not moving how I want. Bit tongue. Feel like I have a slight lisp  1/26/21 Occupational Health at hospital said it&#39;s not related to vaccine so they will not treat me or be involved unless my dr identifies problem as related to the vaccine. 1/26/21 1000--Had virtual Dr appt. Possibly the beginnings of Bells Palsy. Prescribed Prednisone and Valacyclovir. Suggested high doses of Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc.  1/26/21 2200--Drooling from Right side of mouth, Right eye watering. Still right sided tingling/burning sensation.  1/28/21 --Slight improvement in drooling and eye watering. Less burning sensation.

The next day (morning after) I developed low grade fever, chills, back pain, general malaise, weakness, and a lot of pain on the arm I recieved the injection . I also had tender axillary lymph nodes, first on the same side I recieved the vaccine, a day later on both sides. Symptoms were the worst during the 24 hours after recieving the vaccine. After this, the only remaining symptoms were tender axillary lymph nodes and pain in the injection site. I used Acetaminophen for symptoms.

                                                Beginning the night of the 27th, I had a headache and a low-grade fever. I woke up in the middle of the night with a 102.7 fever, severe migraine, severe body aches, leg cramps, sore throat/swelling, and chills. I alternated taking ibuprofen and tylenol to try to control the pain, to no avail. I used bengay and cool washcloths for pain and to cool off. These did not help either. I made sure to keep drinking water and pedialyte. I took benadryl to try to sleep and help with my throat swelling up, it did not help.  All of this was non-stop until the morning of the 30th. That morning when I woke up my fever was going down and I no longer had the chills. I still had the severe headache, body pains, cramping, swollen/sore throat, and now diarrhea. Today is 2/1 and I am still experiencing severe body aches, severe headache, leg cramps, &#34;nerve pain&#34; type feeling in my arms, GI issues, and a sore/swollen throat.

                                                In the afternoon, I got headache and felt tired. Didn?t think much of it. Then by 6 pm I realized it wasn?t just a headache, it was a migraine, so I took my prescription Rizatriptan (5 mg disintegrating tab).  By 6:30 pm migraine pain severe (worse than I?ve ever experienced in the decade of history of migraines). It went from a migraine to so insanely miserable in minutes that my husband even commented at the rapid speed it came on. Could not lie down as the pressure in my head would get worse (never had that response to a migraine). Stomach extremely upset, started vomiting around 7 pm. It was an MSG type of vomit - where I rapidly vomit 5-7 times in a matter of a seconds; however I didn?t feel better like I do after MSG vomiting. I vomited 3 different occasions between 7 pm and maybe 11 pm. I felt cold and had chills - took temperature at it was 95 degrees. Tub bath increased temp to 96. I was extremely fatigued, walking to bathroom was difficult. Had to use wall for support. Since I couldn?t lie down, I sat in a chair and between 10 pm and 1 am I would dose. Several times I woke up in a hot flash and panicked that I couldn?t breathe. My chest didn?t feel tight or anything, so thinking it was just a panic attack from the severe head pain. Around 1 am the pain in my head lessened, so I went to bed. I slept until 4 am. Around 5 am I noticed my chills subsided. The whole ordeal lasted around 12 hours. No additional symptoms throughout the day, just extremely tired from not sleeping the night before. I took my temp when I got up at 8 am at it was 98 degrees F.

                                                About six hours after receiving the vaccine I felt fatigued. Two days after receiving the shot I began having symptoms in addition to extreme fatigue, including nausea, low fever, headache, and muscle aches. Now it is 11 full days after the vaccine and symptoms have not abated at all. The doctor ordered a Covid test and blood work. They also prescribed zofran and meclazine which have not helped. It has been difficult trying to advocate for myself without coming across as an anti-vaxxer or conspiracy theorist. I wish doctors would believe me when I say this is caused by the vaccine. I am not an anti-vaxxer and was enthusiastic about getting the vaccine, but now I am frightened by my body&#39;s reaction to it.

                                                Right arm became very tender, then by the morning I had muscle/joint pain in my upper body. I felt very tired, but my blood pressure was 97/46  about three hours after the injection and this could have been related more to my iron anemia which gets treated with transfusions. The pain in my upper body lasted about 24 hours.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at about 2:15pm. I had a sore left arm after shot which awoke me at 2am. I also work up due to fever (temp 100.1 ), chills, and myalgia. I had a lot of trouble sleeping that night and got very little rest as unable to get comfortable. The next day I still had fever, chills, myalgia, nausea, joint pain, low back pain, fatigue and headache (felt similar to prior bad flu symptoms). I was sent home from work early as symptoms continued throughout the day with a little relief from a 500mg of acetaminophen. The following day 12/31 symptoms were gone except for the left sore arm which was improving and now completely done on 1/3.

                                                I received the Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/29.  12 hours after the vaccine I had numbness and tingling in my feet.  The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to ER and they ruled out Guillain Barre Syndrome (did complete neuro exam) and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction. No treatment prescribed.

                                                The morning after my vaccine I woke up with a very sore upper arm. By 4pm that evening I had fatigue, chills, and body aches. I went to bed and slept much longer than normal and woke up the next morning without chills or body aches. My arm still hurt quite a bit and I started to have elbow joint and hip pain. The following day I started to have sciatica from my hip to my foot on my injection side, the left side. My elbow joint was sore for about 3-4 days after the injection. I also had some numbness right at the injection site the night of the vaccine.

The following morning (24 hours post vaccine) I still was having numbness and tingling in my feet and my legs from knees down felt weak and jelly like. I still was able to walk fine, but it was uncomfortable, not able to work out etc.  12/31 (48 hours post) I worked for 10 hours this day and symptoms were the same, that evening I continued to have same symptoms and my knees and ankles ached intermittently. 1/1- Same symptoms as previous days. 1/2- Same symptoms and started having tingling down back of upper leg from butt to back of knee, still tingling in feet.  1/2- Went to ER waited 8 hours and left. 1/3- Went to Emory ER and they ruled out GBS and said they have not seen this particular reaction to the vaccine but due to presentation they believe it is a vaccine reaction&#34;.

I didnt think it was related to the vaccine.  I just thought it was a muscle strain but now i have  lump under my arm pit.  I believe this is lymphadenopathy.

                                                4 days after injection: Soreness in arm, swollen and painful lymph node in armpit until evening  of 1/6/21.  1/5/21 (1 week after injection), 5pm: swelling,  redness, burning, hardened tissue around injection site on left shoulder. 1/6/21: Worsened swelling, redness, hardened tissue which continued to cover upper arm. Turned into hives (first time ever having that kind of allergic reaction).  Took a Benedryl before bed. 1/7/21: symptoms improved by at least 50%. Much less pain in armpit. Redness and some tenderness still present in left shoulder. Another Benedryl taken this morning.

Around noon I started to feel hot with chills (I took a Tylenol). Around 3:30 pm I started to feel hot again, I took my temperature and I was at 100 F. I then took ibuprofen. I started to feel some fatigue, chills, and lower back pain  around 4:30 pm and went home from work. I went home and fell asleep until 7 pm. The nausea was constant throughout the whole day.  After 7 pm most of my symptoms subsided except the back pain. The back pain and arm pain improved next morning Thursday 01/07/2021.

I have also had severe chills, nausea, vomited twice, generalized weakness and shakiness.  It is currently 12:10pm on 1/8/21 and these symptoms continue.  Two of my other co-workers were at this same facility at the same time on 1/7 and have had very similar symptoms as well as severe headache which prevented them to work today.  We are all physical therapists, healthy young individuals, no co-comorbidities and were very surprised by these negative reactions and concerned.

Later that night I started to have a headache and the next morning I felt so tired and groggy it was hard to get up. I continued to feel exhausted and have difficulty focusing due to the headache and tiredness the entire day. I woke up feeling better the next morning.

The pain has become so severe that I cannot use my left arm.  The pain is intolerable.  I take four Advil every six hours, ice my arm regularly, and keep my arm in a sling.  The pain has gotten significantly worse with time (not better).  I?ve never experienced pain like this from a vaccine in my life.  No history of bursitis or shoulder injury.  Again, the pain gets worse with time.  I?m almost 48 hours post injection

                                                Patient is an employee at Health Center. She was given the vaccine approx 3:30 pm on 1/28/2021 in the left deltoid. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine without incident. The following is a written statement from patient describing events: &#34;About 30 minutes after vaccine, I felt like I had hit my elbow on something. Discomfort radiated from left elbow to wrist- I did have pain around injection site. About 8:30pm on 1/8/21, area around injection site became more painful. Gradually pain increased radiating down to finger tips and up to left side of neck, stopped right below ear. Neck and shoulder muscles felt really tight- uncomfortable ache. Also got extremely tired- left side of face felt numb- left eye slightly blurry- I fell asleep about 10pm. Woke up a few hours later drenched in sweat. Face numbness gone, eyesight normal.? Patient reports the following day 1/9/2021 @ 2pm: ?All of a sudden I started to sweat all over. I didn?t feel hot, only last about 30 minutes.? Patient reports on Sunday 1/10/2021: ?Woke up feeling okay. Left arm and neck still ached but not as bad. Got fatigued around 10am. I got a headache that became really bad. Dizzy, nauseous- no relief from OTC meds. Headache went away after a few hours.? Patient reports today 1/11/2021: ?Today I am still very tired. My left arm, fingertips, shoulders and neck still ache. Face is flushed.? Patient does state previous reactions to prior vaccines: ?TdaP about 7 years ago made me have joint pain for months. Last flu shot received was about 9 years ago, had flu like symptoms x12 hours.? Patient did not seek any medical care for the reaction described above. Patient?s PCP has been also been made aware of her reaction.

                                                Starting within the hour of my shot my left arm was very stiff and throbbing in pain. By 5pm I could not wiggle my fingers or even the slightest movement in my arm. At 7pm I started with a headache, complete body shakes, and a fever of 100. In the night it spiked to 102.6 All day Friday my fever stayed at 101-102.8. I had a bad headache and could not get any relief in my arm. My body ached and still had shakes from time to time. I took ibuprofen a couple of times to help with the pain and fever. By Saturday around 10am I had zero symptoms. Since then I have felt great.

Patient came up to staff at 1400 and stated she had a headache. She also felt like her joints were also tight. She then also mentioned that her throat was sore and that had been occurring for about 15 minutes but she was trying to wait and see. Asked if she should just take benadryl. Advised that I could not advise that and would recommend seeing a physician. Walked her to the emergency department at 14:01.

Tues Jan 12 midday while at work began experiencing increased post nasal drip and stiffness in my left lateral neck extending up towards basilar skull. Started taking Claritin after shift to help with congestion.  Thur Jan 14 Congestion is manageable with Claritin. Stiff neck is worse upon waking up around 8am and has spread to right side; left side remains most painful. Range of motion turning head leftward is limited and painful; turning head rightward is uncomfortable but range of motion not limited.  Sat Jan 16 Congestion is manageable with Claritin. Neck stiffness decreased somewhat throughout the workday and feels more sore than painful. Noted discomfort at left deltoid late into shift around 10pm. Noted mild redness and edema over left lateral deltoid where vaccine was administered approximately 7cm wide and 9cm long. Area feels more firm to touch and feels tight when moving left arm.

                                                Patient called this nurse stating she had an allergic reaction to COVID vaccination given on Friday 1/15/21. States she felt fine for the 15 minutes post immunization, was on her way home and started feeling dizzy, short of breath, chest heavy, throat felt full &#34;like a ball in it&#34;. She came back to clinic which was closed but sat in the parking lot for a while. While in parking lot trying to figure out what to do, her symptoms lessened. She got home safely but started to feel jittery/shaky and her BP was very high (couldnt remember exact number). She then went to urgent care where they told her she was having an allergic reaction and given a pill of something and steroid for 6 days. Went home from urgent care and BP still high but got better at bedtime. Saturday she had a &#34;really bad headache and just layed around all day. I was not able to function at all.&#34;  Sunday she still had a headache and added muscle aches. Monday she started feeling &#34;a lot better&#34; until 8 PM when she was walking around doing her nightly routine and started to feel a wave of dizziness, throat felt funny so she sat down and took her BP with result of 207/131. Says this reaction felt worse than Friday&#39;s reaction so she went to ER where she was again told she was having an allergic reaction and the steroid given to her at Urgent Care was not helping and to stop taking them. Given Benadryl in the waiting room, had labs and EKG which came back &#34;normal&#34;, and given a different med Vistaril to take with any future symptoms. Was also told to NOT take the second dose of COVID vaccination. Says she has not had to take the Vistaril yet and has not had any sign of reaction today so far. Said she did report the initial headache on the V-safe app.

I started feeling dizzy, a buzzing in my ears and broke into a sweat. I tried to stand up and walk over to my bed, but lost my balance and collapsed for about 5 seconds. Once I regained consciousness I stopped sweating, rested for a bit and then was able to resume normal function (drinking water, coffee, something sugary).

The injection site turned red, was swollen and warm and has spread in size for a couple of days. I had a headache for a few days prior to my reaction on Wednesdays and my left underarm hurt. Additionally, swallowing after eating or drinking hurt for a couple of days. My body was weak and I felt feverish despite not having any fever. I am currently being treated by my physician as if I have Cellulitis and was prescribed antibiotics as well as instructed to take an antihistamine with the antibiotic. Today is my first day on the medication so I do not know the outcome yet.

                                                Around 7 pm on Feb 22 I started feeling very fatigued and I had some body aches. I decided to go to bed early to try to sleep it off. About 5 am on Feb 23 I was woken up by a splitting headache. I also felt feverish and had the chills. My head hurt so bad, worse than any migraine I had ever had. I got out of bed to take some ibuprofen and could hardly even walk my body hurt so bad. I took the ibuprofen and went back to bed until about 8 am. When I woke up at 8 I felt okay other than a slight headache that lasted until about 7 pm when I took another dose of ibuprofen.

                                                I had listed side effects start on 1/22 (the date the injection was administered), starting around 5 pm. This consisted of fever (102), chills, sweats, muscle aches, fatigue, tenderness at the injection site, and headache. The fever (reduced 100ish), muscle aches, tenderness at the injection site, sudden waves of heat flashes, and headache persisted into 1/23. I also had an onset of nausea that evening. On 1/24 I continued to experience a headache, tenderness at the injection site, and sudden waves of heat flashes. However, around 5 pm I noticed my arm (localized to below the injection site) was very red, inflamed, and radiating significant heat. It may have been that way since 1/22, but I didn&#39;t notice. Those same symptoms persisted into 1/25 and I contacted my PCP. I went in for a visit, it was assessed, with no infection noted, and recommendations to watch and belief it would subside. On 1/26 it continues to maintain some redness and radiates heat.

Side effects included fever, chills, muscle aches, very sore arm, light-headedness, tachcardia.

Systemically experienced chills, muscle aches/soreness, and fatigue. Of note, the vaccine administrator said they were going to hold the injection in place for 10 seconds following the injection per instructions to do this this way, which I had never had occur before. I have also never had a vaccine reaction before. Unsure if the local site reaction could have been worse due to this practice.

                                                Within 4.5 hours my arm was beginning to become sore. hour 5-6 I felt nauseous and foggy and body aches slowly started. I felt like I didn&#39;t get any rest that night, between the tossing and turning due to body aches and very sore arm. when I woke up I did take some Midol, it was all I had on me at that moment.  From there I still came to work, because I knew we wouldn&#39;t have the staff to cover our department . I had a cycle of symptoms. starting with the major body and joint pains, red injection site with heat. Then I started profusely sweating. Like I had just finished a 90 cardio session. That lasted about an hour-two. and then It started over. I had the same symptoms about 3-4 cycles worth. as soon as one would start to subside another one started. When I finally got home I took Some Excedrin and within 3 hours after that my body aches were very dull and my I could move my arm without throbbing pain anymore. I have now it the 48 hour mark. At hour 45 I started sweating again and my arm is still tender, but hours 4-34 were the worst. I just want to point out I Know the shot is injected high into the muscle, But my injection site was at the very top of my arm/shoulder.

I slept for one hour and woke up with intense chills, muscle aches, and pins and needles all throughout my body. I developed a headache and became short of breath an hour later, and was unable to walk more than a few feet without becoming extremely fatigued. 15 hours later I&#39;m still experiencing the same symptoms.

                                                I woke up in extreme pain in my right shoulder. I couldn&#39;t lift my arm without the help of my other arm.  Raising it and lowering were extremely painful.  I couldn&#39;t raise it above my waist. This lasted for about 8 hours. I took 800 mg Ibuprofen and I could finally move my arm to chest level but it still ached, even when just laying at my side so I had to hold it to my chest. After 4 days, it felt better but there was still pain when raising my arm over my head. It felt like I had ripped something in my shoulder at the rotator cuff. 4 days later, the pain came back and I had to once again hold my arm at chest level for 2 days. Yesterday, January 28th, I went to my doctor and received a steroid injection in my shoulder and they also put in MRI orders.

Pain progressed as did stiffness within an hour to the point that I can barely move my neck without significant pain to neck and down into shoulder. It has been like this for almost 5 hours now and has not improved.   Prior to this - the day and night i got vaccinated I felt fine. the following day I had a pretty bad headache. And then this morning this new thing happened. I am not worried about the headache as that is normal. I am worried about this severe pain and stiffness that is localized in one part of my body and is not going away.

                                                1/2/2021: In the evening, I  started experiencing swelling (felt like a hard knot under the skin), itching, redness, and heat at the injection site. Earlier in the day I noticed a little pain discomfort in my right arm pit. As the day wore on, I noticed swelling in my lymph nodes and the level of discomfort increased to the point that it disturbed my sleep. 1/3/2021: The pain and swelling at the injection site and armpit continued to be the same. I took ibuprofen to try and alleviate the level of discomfort. That evening before bed also took Benadryl to see if it would help with the injection site reaction. I also started experiencing a dull shooting pain and tingling from my armpit down to my wrist on my right arm. 1/4/2021: The injection site improved, no more knot, heat, or itching. It still remained a little swollen. Lymph nodes were still swollen throughout the day, but manageable with ibuprofen. Shooting pain and tingling still occurring sporadically throughout the day. 1/5/2021: Still a little discomfort in the armpit, but seems to be improving.

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

                                                I  got it at 2pm Friday.  About 2 hours later my arm started feeling sore but not too bad. I did some light yoga and walked on the treadmill for 40 minutes.  Otherwise took it easy that day. Satu I woke up with a slight headache which isn&#39;t unusual for me.  I still had mild soreness in my arm. I did a more difficult yoga workout and then walked 5 miles outside.  Took a shower after and relaxed for a bit. Then had dinner around 5 and within the hour started having diarrhea.  This lasted a few hours during which my arm started gradually hurting more, it was pretty bad. Could barely move it and hurt to the touch even. Shivering started soon after.  I never had a fever or fatigue during all of this. Highest temp was 98.4 with forehead thermometer. I talked to a doctor to put my mind at ease and he said I was having a big immune response to the vaccine, apparently younger adults between 20 to 40 are having bigger immune responses. The second dose is stronger so most are  having these symptoms after that one, but some are having it after the first as well. He also told me I should have taken it easy these past 2 days and that I likely overdid it. He advised that I take motrin or Tylenol, get under blankets to stay warm, and rest. That&#39;s exactly what I did and a little over an hour later I was feeling much better.   I&#39;m a bit freaked out by what the second dose is going to do to me since it is supposed to be worse. Is it safe for me to get second dose?

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced extreme breast tenderness in both breasts. They felt sore to the touch all over, had the sensation of being full and heavy, and had to be supported in a bra in order to be tolerable. I liken it to postpartum pain associated with breast feeding and milk engorgement. I would list the symptoms the first night as moderate to severe. It limited my ability to do certain tasks because of the pain and discomfort. The breast tenderness has decreased in severity since then but it is now 1/11/2021 and both breasts are still tender. The severity is now mild. It&#39;s uncomfortable but does not limit my daily activity. Of note, I have had a tubal ligation and ablation and am not pregnant but I cannot track the timing of my cycle to know if the vaccine affected my cycle or caused hormonal changes that could explain the breast sensitivity.   I had arm soreness at the injection site for the first 48 hours but that has gone away. No other symptoms to report.

                                                Vaccine given at 2pm. By 9pm that same night I could not move my arm without crying from the pain.  I woke upbat 5am and the pain was still just as bad. Any little movement was excruciating. I could not change my clothes, brush my hair, wash my face. The only reason I waa still able to work is because I am a teacher and we are remote so I was able to sign on from home and sit at my desk with my arm in an imaginary swing because that was the only time it did not hurt. Later that night I could begin to move my arm a little before pain started but still needed help getting dressed, etc. The next two days I was able to move it little more before pain started.  It is now 5 days later and I can lift my arm up. I still feel pain but it ia tolerable.

Then 1 week later, on 1/15 I woke up with a very large red, hot, itchy patch on my left biceps around my injection site.  It is not as bright now, but still very large (larger than my palm) and intermittently itchy.  It will be 2 weeks from my injection tomorrow.  I am concerned about whether or not to get the second dose as I am afraid this was some sort of allergic reaction and I read that many people experience more significant adverse reactions to the second dose.  I did check in with a health care provider at my clinic and she only suggested ice and Tylenol, which provided relief of itchiness, but no improvement.  I also notified Moderna.  No one seems to know for sure if I should receive the second dose.

Notified nursed overseeing the monitoring.  Nurses began hooking my up to monitoring equipment. Heart rate came down to 120.  Nurses noticed flushing in face and blotchiness on arms. After an additional 15 minutes of monitoring, flushing was still present as well as throat tingling (just tingling, no swelling), so nurses sent me to the ER for further monitoring.  Upon arrival to ER temperature was 100.2 F. (Temperature before vaccine was 97 F, no fevers recorded after ER visit).  In ER fluids and zofran were given and was released after two hours of monitoring.  In the evening I experienced moderate pain in the left arm (very painful to lift arm above shoulder level) that lasted about 24 hours.  I also had a mild to moderate headache that lasted about 24 hours, beginning the evening of the vaccine.   I also experienced mild to moderate nausea that began the day of the vaccine (Saturday, 12/26) and was on and off through Wednesday, 12/30.

At about 4:15PM I began to feel very shaky, heart was racing/rapid heart beat and very dizzy.  From here the details are somewhat blurry till after the ambulance arrived and I received the EPI ? PEN. I walked over to a volunteer, I held her arm, I felt like I was too dizzy to stand so I asked to sit down.  She walked me back to my car where I sat down and a wheelchair came. Some one arrived and took my blood pressure. My throat and tongue became swollen and it was very difficult to swallow.  The volunteer kept asking me questions and then the ambulance arrived.  Once in the ambulance, they gave me an EPI-PEN, steroids, Benadryl and IV.  They took me to the ER where I was monitored for several hours.

                                                Left arm pain began on Thurs. 1/7/21, approximately 30 minutes after vaccine.  Severe headache and pain radiating to left side of neck began approximately 22 hours after vaccine (around 2pm on 1/8/21) and left arm pain worsened.  On 1/9/21, unable to get out of bed-felt like I had been drugged- severe HA, fatigue, and left side of neck soreness.  Felt slightly better on 1/10/21 and 1/11/21, however stil unable to get out of bed due to severe HA and fatigue.  On morning of 1/12/21, fatigue relieved and severe HA relieved around 1pm.  Since 1/12/21, Severe HA, left arm tightness and left neck soreness has continued intermittently.  This is a HA I have never experienced before.  Yesterday, on 1/21/21, I had a severe HA all day at work and when I went home, I had to lie down the rest of the day/evening d/t severe HA, fatigue and left neck tightness.  I was unable to do daily chores and help my children with their homework.  I also woke up this morning with the same severe HA and left neck soreness/tightness.  I do feel this HA is from the vaccine as I have never experienced this type of HA prior to receiving the vaccine and I am not someone who gets HA&#39;s often.    I know the vaccine was given too high, as I give vaccines often for my career, and I am wondering if that has anything to do with my neck pain.  I did bleed a lot with the injection (do not think it went into my muscle) and am wondering if that has anything to do with my adverse reaction.  I am fearful these severe HA&#39;s will continue and I am extremely hesitant to receive my second dose!

The day following also was tired achy and felt off/headache. On Thursday symptoms went away other than the arm and a slight headache. On Saturday the redness and I ring was gone, but I started having pain in my armpit and when I moved my arm in different positions. Hand was tingling with certain positions suggesting nerve pain. Lasted 2 to 3 days and got worse before better. Was mostly gone by Tuesday. Wednesday 8 days after injections the redness, itching, and swelling in my arm returned. Same size as the day after my injection. Called the doctor to see if I need to be concerned that the redness, itchyness, and swelling returned after completely going away 4 days earlier. Also feeling tired for the past 3 to 4 days but otherwise good. Some minor discomfort/pain in collar bone around and lump node in neck but is not consistent. Comes and goes. Not sure if the nerve pain in arm was related to the vaccine, but since the redness returned it may all be related.

                                                My arm became quite sore about 8 hours after my initial vaccination.  It was sensitive to the touch to the point that I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body.  It also hurt to raise my arm any higher than shoulder height.  It went away on its own after about 36 hours.  One week later, on January 7th, my husband noticed that I had a large red patch on my arm where I had gotten the vaccination.  It was about 1.5-2&#34; across, raised, red and warm to the touch.  It was slightly itchy, but didn&#39;t hurt.  My husband noticed this in the evening, but I am not sure how long it had been that way since I had had long sleeves on all day.  By the morning, it had gone away.  I didn&#39;t treat it in any way.

After about an hour, my arm was swollen and very painful to move and touch. I put an ice pack on and took Tylenol but the pain and swelling didn?t completely subside. I went to bed with Tylenol PM to help me sleep and woke up several times from the pain. Throughout the day today (2nd day), the pain has steadily gotten worse. I can barely move my arm due to the immense pain. The swelling is still there. I have been icing it and taking Tylenol but the pain has only gotten worse. I feel achy in my neck and the pain is radiating down my arm to my forearm, wrist, and fingers.

The red areas were swollen, hot to touch, and each were a hard lump a little larger than a marble.  These two spots were about 3 inches below the injection site and an inch closer to the body midline.  These red spots worsened and joined together.  1/28/21 I was still experiencing the red raised area that had grown in size, still hot to the touch and now red and rashy around the outer edge.  Redness diminished over the weekend and resolved by 2/3/21.  Arm and shoulder still are achy and sore.

                                                7 days after receiving the vaccine, I developed intense, deep muscle pain and swelling. The arm where I received the vaccine was very hot to the touch. The next day, I had chills and a mild fever, along with swollen and sore arm. Through the weekend, I developed redness in splotches that were similar to hives in appearance. My arm has been intensely itchy. On Saturday, 2.20.21, the lymph node under my left arm became very swollen and painful. I am currently still experiencing a mildly sore arm (pain has lessened since yesterday), arm is still very hot to the touch, still have red rash/hives and my lymph node is still very painful.

                                                I received the Covid Vaccine on January 22, 2021.  I started developing a headache when I came home.  Later that night my mouth felt funny.  The next day I noticed that I had mouth sores.  I had those for about 2 days.  I felt fatigue and had some joint pain through out the next few days.  On January 27th I woke up with a numb arm in the arm I had the shot administered.  Right away I felt feverish and nausea.  I threw up immediately.  After that I was very disoriented.  I was able to fall back asleep a few hours later.  I woke up again with a numb arm and the same feverish and nausea and again I threw up immediately.  This time I dried heaved but at the same time I could not breath and was having a strong feeling of electricity running through my hands and arms.  I emailed my doctor and went back to sleep.  A little while later I woke up again with a numb arm and again feverish and nausea and I dried heaved and at the same time had difficulty breathing and same feeling of electricity runny through my hands and arms.  My doctor instructed me to go to the ER.  I went on January 28th.  All that day I had a headache and on I kept having the feverish and nausea but did not through up again.  The days of January 28th to February 6th I was experiencing a foggy brain, headache, and fatigue.  I was having difficulty figuring out how to do a task that I do everyday and is not hard for me normally and made my brain hurt.  On February 6th I woke up again but this time I had abdominal pain and again feverish and nausea and I dry heaved again with difficulty breathing and again the electricity running through my hands and arms.  On February 7th I was very tired and fatigue.  Monday February 8th, I started to have this back pain that than lead into this headache and feverish and nausea.  Then on February 9th I had this strange hip pain along with the same back pain and headache again this time was worse than the day before.  I continued to have this strange back pain along with this tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing.  On February 11th I woke up again but this time my heart was racing verry fast and I felt feverish and was having difficulty breathing so much so, I was using a paper bag to help.  I went to the ER again because it was my heart and it hurt, and my back hurt along with the tightness in my chest.  The days from February 12th to now I am still experiencing this strange back pain, headaches off and on fatigue, and I have been experiencing the foggy brain.  My second shot was supposed to be on February 16th but my doctor instructed me not to get it due to my experience with the first shot.  I am asking for help with paying for the ER visits and any other medical expenses related to this due to the reaction from my first vaccine.   I am still experiencing the strange back pain, that started on February 8th, foggy brain and headaches and fatigue that I am still receiving medical attention for.

                                                I took the &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34; on December 31, 2020. I had pain/soreness at the injection site for 3 days, but I still have other side effects since getting the vaccine. The side effects started out with mild muscle pain and joint pain on the 31st, then in the night and for every day since the vaccine I have had headaches which I am taking ibuprofen for. I also feel quite fatigued since getting the injection. In the last few days I also had cold sweats, and chills yesterday. Today, I still have headache and fatigue.

                                                My upper arm where the injection was administered, started to radiate pain up to my neck. I noticed at that time a painful lump at the front base of neck, right side. The pain started to increase throughout the day. The following morning, the injection site was red and inflamed. The pain persisted throughout the day, radiating  to my hand, all the way up to my neck. The injection site was swollen and red. On a scale of 1 - 10, my pain was at 8. The following day, the pain reached a 10, the swelling and inflammation had increased and I noted decreased muscle strength in my hand. This persisted throughout the night. It&#39;s now Monday morning, and with flexril, constant application of a heating pad, a topical Diclofenac gel, and twice daily dose of 800 mg of Motrin and 2 tyelnol over the course of the last 2 days, my pain is at a 7. The swelling has reduced at the injection site some, but the the redness has increased and so has the hardness of the site.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

                                                One week to the day of receiving vaccine(1/13/21) I woke up with a large red hive-type spot near injection site.  The spot was hot to the touch and slightly swollen.  My arm ached and felt heavy.   The next day (1/14/21) the red hive-type spot had doubled in size.  The spot is still hot to the touch and my arm is still achy.  I spoke with a nurse at the health department and she recommended I report the symptoms here and follow up with my doctor.  I left a message for my doctor but have not heard back.  The day of my injection (1/6/21) the only side effect I had was a sore arm.  No other symptoms until 1/13/21.

                                                Got my 1st covid vaccine around 9:30 am 1-18-21. Shot was administered with no issue, waited my 15 minutes and went home. Was feeling a little tired throughout the day and around 9 pm noticed I was starting to notice some mild flu skin, body aches and headache.  Went to bed around 10 and had slight shivering but figured it was maybe just a low grade fever and covered up with another blanket.  Within 20 minutes I had full blown rigors. My husband had me take a hot shower thinking it might help but it did not. I had uncontrollable shaking for a couple hours then finally fell asleep (I did wake myself up once from shaking). I woke up at 4 am no longer shaking but I had a terrible headache,  my whole body ached and I was wet with sweat. My muscles and joints were so sore I barely was able to walk to the bathroom then went back to sleep. Woke up around 6 (had to get kids up for achool) but I couldn&#39;t so had my husband get them ready. He brought me some acetaminophen and I slept until 11am. Got up and still had body aches and headache but not as bad as in the night. Slept on and off all through the day 1-19-21 taking acetaminophen 2 more times for headache and sore body. Went to bed around 10 pm and woke up back to normal 1-20-21

                                                Legs extremely weak and felt like muscles were not functioning well. Knees were buckling while standing. Started about 4 hours after vaccination. Resolved by morning but fatigue continued. It was the exact same sensation felt last March and led to me not being able to get off couch for three weeks. Couldn&#39;t get covid testing until weeks after symptoms started and tested negative in March.   Numbness in lips. Lower lip&gt;upper. Started 2 days later. Resolved after gradually improving after 10 days. Fyi had lip injection/filler within the last 2 years. Moderate burning in Rt leg that started the Friday after the vaccine. No redness or edema. Resolved after 10 days.   Severe brain fog and fatigue and buzzing sensation in head. Much worse than baseline. Buzzing sensation was new. Slept all weekend. Improved to baseline after 14 or so days. Had sharp stabbing pains in the back of my head 7 days after the vaccine. Resolved after 3 to 5 days. Never had these sensations before. No history of headaches.  Went to PCP regarding leg pain, worsening brain fog and fatigue from baseline and unequal pupils that had previously resolved about 2 years prior. Pupils were unequal sizes when I woke up on 1/2.  Pupils now back to frequently being different sizes. No diagnosis made with previous episodes that had resolved. Maybe it was reactivated?  Also had visual distortions in left eye that were new on 1/3 that lasted two minutes. No pain associated with this.  Resolved.   Feel close to baseline now but hesitant to get second dose for these reasons.

I had a rash around site that progressed up to the right side of my face and also right side of my lower back the following day. The rash was also accompanied by blotches and is still there only on the side of the injection. I had metallic taste for on and off the first 2-3 days. I am feeling a bit better, well enough to work today. Still very fatigued. On Thursday I also had a 102 fever that Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help me at all at night. I finally stopped sweating yesterday. The blotches are now improving . Only thing that remains is the fatigue.

At 36 hours I had nausea and at 48 hours I had severe nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramping, chills. I felt improved Thursday but then felt similar again Thursday night. If I eat my stomach cramps and eventually have diarrhea. I had aching and stomach cramping yesterday still 10 days post vaccine. I?m unclear if this is vaccine related.

                                                Hyperthyroid; muscle spasm; A spontaneous case report was received from a health care provider concerning a 39-year-old, female patient who received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced muscle spasm and hyperthyroidism.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included prenatal vitamins, Coenzyme 10 and multivitamins.   On 11FEB2021, the patient received her first of two doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient started experiencing muscle spasms the next day. Two weeks after she received the vaccine, the thyroid test was done again and her TSH went down and now has hyperthyroidism. The muscle spasm  had become more frequent.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  Outcome of the events of muscle spasm and hyperthyroidism were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.
