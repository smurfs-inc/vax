                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

Vomited at 9:00am the next day(Wednesday) and had a fever 101.3F, chills, muscle pain on entire body and a headache. Called into work and laid in bed all day. Heart rate was 120bpm (typically it is around 70bmp). Took Tylenol which brought the fever down at 5:00pm. Finally was able to eat something. Took more Tylenol before bed and was able to sleep. Woke up Thursday and still felt achy but functional with a headache and nausea. Same symptoms minus the nausea on Friday.

                                                For my first dose, I had quite mild symptoms. I woke up with a migraine the next morning and some soreness at the injection site. Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

With physical activity, these symptoms just got worse. I had extremely bad pain in my lower back and throughout my back muscles, sending my back into spasam.

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.  We attempted to find an open Urgent Care unsuccessfully and tried to go to an ER but they were full. Fever began to come down around 2230, so we returned home. Continued with ibuprofen every six hours and cooling measures.

                                                My arm became incredibly sore within an hour. I woke up in the middle of the night aching like I had the flu. The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

The next morning, there were itchy, hard bumps on my feet and right ring finger. The bumps on my feet have become swollen and warm and seem to be growing larger, especially today on February 14. Two small bumps have also developed on my hands. I am not sure whether this is related to the vaccine, but it has become painful to walk.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID 19 Moderna vaccine on Tuesday morning. By Tuesday night I started to have virtually every side effect that Moderna listed including; fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, and extreme fever. The next morning as I woke up in attempt tp get ready for work, I was not feeling any better and began to feel light headed, and felt the need to vomit. As I had the feeling of needing to vomit, I turned to do so and fainted. From accounts by my family, I was told I woke up, and quickly passed out a second time. As I was awoken, there was probably a minute before I fainted for a third time. All three times I was told I lost consciousness. I was awoken and by that point my family had contacted emergency responders. Paramedics arrived and took all necessary vitals. I did not pass out after that third time. As I expected all side effects Moderna listed, I did not expect to feel as bad as I did and I thought it was worth reporting what happened to be the next day. It caused a panic and I was scared and nervous as I was unsure why that was happening. I&#39;ve tried to look up articles and links between passing out and the vaccine and all I can find is people fainting as they get the vaccine (which is common for any shot) but nothing for fainting that long after the vaccine was administered. I just wanted to report my incident.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

I had fever and chills, muscle aches, joint pain,  headaches,  and nausea later that night as well. The next morning, my left eye was swollen, left side of tongue completely swollen, lips swollen, and left side of throat closed (anaphylaxis). I took prednisone, Benadryl, and Tylenol to relieve the symptoms, and the swelling around my left eye, tongue, throat, and lips went away. Throughout the day, more hives have developed around my body and face, including my right eye.  I am continuing to take Benadryl and Tylenol and finish doses of prednisone. The fever and chills, muscles aches, joint pains, hives, headache, and nausea are still present.

That passed and I started getting really dizzy and was unable to hear or see anything. I pulled over and my throat started to close up and I was having a hard time breathing. It passed in about 2 minutes and an hour later I felt fine but my brain felt tingly like I was on the verge of passing out but no other side effects.  My brain still feels tingly as well.

                                                My daughter started to experience headaches 2 days after her first dose. On May 13th the headache had become so bad that she would cry and then suddenly became unable to speak or grab. She could not formulate actual words and was unable to smile . This lasted 15 minutes. A trip to the nearest Emergency room was inconclusive and resulted in discharge. 24 hours later , we had the same incident only this time magnified times 10. Where she remained in a catatonic like state for 7 hours only to snap out of it independently without medical treatment. After multiple test she was diagnosed with viral encephalitis. All major causes of encephalittis were ruled out and we were told it was possible a side affect of her first Moderna Covid Vaccine dose. We are still seeing doctors and testing but she seems to have improved without medication which is even more alarming .

I have never before had a swollen lymph node in either axillary regions of my arm. It was very painful, I could barely put my arm down because of the pressure of it pressing against the side of my body at rest. It has gotten better, there isn?t as much pain but it is still uncomfortable. The lymph node was/is palpable, and hurt upon touch and rest. The pain was an 7/10, but has now gone down to a 2/10. My arm is also still sore from the injection site, but it is not bad.

                                                No rash on injection site. However rash on  both legs and one arm had rash on elbow. The rash became dark purple and very large. I was taking Benedryl, Hydrocortisone and Calamile lotion over the counter with no improvement. I went to the doctors, he prescribed a steroid, the rash lightened however  back pain started, accompanied with stomach aches. Now I have a heaviness on my chest that hurts. It feels like my rib cage or my bones hurt.

About 9 hours after getting the vaccine, I woke up in the middle of the night to chills and my whole body aching, as well as my left arm where I had the shot being super sore and heavy. So far this whole next day my arm is still very sore, my whole body aches, and I have had a headache all day.

She is due for her next  dose on Saturday, March 28 but decided to wait  a little bit longer before she gets her second dose.

                                                Around 11:00 in the morning I was starting to feel weak and hard of breathing with a sore arm where the injection site was. As the day went on it progressed to muscle aches and a low fever, I went to bed with chills, muscle pain, heavy breathing, and a 100.8 fever. I work up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and felt nauseous, I don?t remember much but I remember waking up on the floor in a cold sweat, so I assume I passed out from the nausea. I went back to bed and I woke up with a 101.8 fever and weakness and muscle pains. My mother told me to take Tylenol every 4 hours and be on top of things, my symptoms have been decreasing since this morning but as I am filling this out at 11:00 at night I?m slowly getting my fever back. I will add this is exactly how I felt when I got covid back in November of 2020.

I felt a little bit fatigued and my left arm was extremely sore to the point where I could barely move it. The next day, it was still sore but I was able to move it much more. I had muscle aches through my entire body. It is now 2 days after the day I got the vaccine and my arm is still sore and hurt when I extend my arm.

I could not sleep at night and developed the chills with a horrible headache. This was also after taking tylenol. I had the chills the following day and could not leave my bed. I slept the whole day and did not have an appetite. I was also constantly checking for a fever and did not have one, but I still had chills. My symptoms were almost gone by 9 pm of the next day. On the second day, I have neck pain on both sides of my neck. It is bearable but still there. I am otherwise healthy and have not been sick at all within the last year.

                                                After first vaccine: History: Moderna COVID vaccine on 3/11/2021. Arm soreness over the first day or two but nothing else that really struck her. A few days after she started to notice axillary pain that progressed up her right neck and down to her right hand. She saw a physician who thought she was having nerve pain brought on by the vaccine. Around the 18th she started to feel a snapping pain in her wrist. Went to ED on the 20th because she started to have arm shaking, she was given ativan, her arm shaking stopped and they discharged her home. That evening her fingers felt clenched. On the 21st she woke up in the morning, went to urinate and dropped to the floor because her legs felt like jello and felt like they kept giving out. They initially thought the ativan was just making her feel out of it. They waited until the evening but then needed to go to the ED. The concern was GBS and transverse myelitis. They ate dinner and decided to drive to ED, on the drive she was kind of falling asleep periodically. Then she suddenly couldn&#39;t lift her water bottle. She started to be completely out of it, Mom says she wasn&#39;t responding. Pt says that she felt like she knew what was going on, felt a little out of body and wasn&#39;t quite responding. Mom couldn&#39;t get her out of the car, she was carried into the ED and at that point she started to recover a little bit more. About 10 minutes later she started to feel better. She was admitted because she was still having trouble walking. In the hospital she had a normal CT head and video EEG but she didn&#39;t have any events while on the monitor. Discharged home the following day with the diagnosis of functional neurologic disorder and instructions to establish care with an adult PCP. They advised considering CBT as well.  Since discharge her legs feels tired, going up the stairs feels much harder than it should. She has not had any falls and no longer feels like she is going to fall.  She follows with a therapist, has had dissociative episodes and panic attacks in the past.   Assessment:  20 YOF with PMH of panic attack, POTS, IDA and benign heart murmur who developed weakness of b/l LE and altered consciousness approximately 10 days after her first dose of Moderna COVID vaccine. Also had an episode of unilateral arm shaking the day prior that resolved with ativan in the ED. At this point unclear if directly related to vaccination. Differential includes mild Guillain-Barre 2/2 previous infection or vaccination, stress reaction/anxiety, POTS complication, myasthenia gravis, tick bite, infection, heavy metal poisoning, B12 deficiency, seizure disorder, atypical migraine. Functional Neurologic Disorder diagnosed by neurology after overnight admission  for video EEG which captured no events. CT head  also WNL per neurology discharge summary. Neurologic exam today WNL.   After Second Vaccine: History: She had her 2nd vaccine on 4/15 (6 days ago). Had vaccine in right arm again, she did have some arm pain again. She had coffee without breakfast in the morning. Had finished her first virtual class, went to the restroom during her second class, felt strangely in the restroom, went back to her room. She then passed out. Her fall was unwitnessed. She called to her roommate when she came to but her roommate hadn&#39;t heard the fall. She thinks she was only out for a few seconds but cannot be sure. Called her Mom who advised her to eat something so she ate an orange sitting on the floor. She got up to make herself breakfast and she passed out again. Again unwitnessed but patient thinks it was very fast. She crawled over to the couch, sat on the couch for for 15 minutes then felt fine for the rest of the day. She did not feel nauseous at all. She denies palpitations, difficulty breathing and chest pain.  Today in office after orthostatics and blood draw she fainted again, only out for seconds. BP elevated immediately after the event but WNL minutes later.  These syncopal episodes reminded her of her syncopal episodes with IDA and POTS. They do not feel like the episode after the first vaccine when she lost feeling in her legs and was very out of it.  She feels like her arm pain from the first vaccine never fully resolved. After the arm pain worsened from the 2nd shot she tried a 3 day course of aleve to see if that helped things. At this point it is mostly just her right wrist that is painful. Overall feels more localized to wrist than prior. She has since stopped the aleve, last was last night. She has not noticed redness or swelling in wrist or arm.  LMP was 4/2-4/6. She went almost a year without menses so stopped her OCP, but her menses have returned recently and she has restarted OCP.  Assessment: Right arm pain persisted from the first vaccination but otherwise sx had resolved. She got 2nd vaccination on 4/15, only arm pain but yesterday had 2 brief syncopal events and one today in the office. Orthostatic BPs not completely convincing for orthostatic hypotension today.

Next morning awoke with same extreme pain and added severe body aches in lower back and legs along with a headache. Pain persists as of report

Was very tired, slept until 2 when my fever broke. Rest of the day was just tired, achy from the top of my neck to the base of my spine with an emphasis on my shoulders, very short of breath.

                                                The night after taking the vaccine, I had uncontrollable chills for several hours. The shivers continued even when I seemed to fall asleep, as my roommate stated. When I woke up, I had a high fever, extreme muscle aches, nausea, and was unable to move. The next day, I felt better. I did feel drowsy and almost like I could not think properly. After that, the symptoms went away.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 in July 2020. Concomitant products included ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE NOS for Birth control.   On 29-Apr-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 08-May-2021, the patient experienced EPILEPSY (Epileptic seizure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening). On 10-May-2021, the patient experienced EPILEPSY (epileptic seizures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening). On an unknown date, the patient experienced AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOPATHY (autoimmune encephalitis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), WEIGHT DECREASED (Lost 10 pounds), VOMITING (Vomiting) and NAUSEA (Nausea). The patient was hospitalized from 08-May-2021 to 09-May-2021 due to EPILEPSY, and then on 10-May-2021 due to EPILEPSY. At the time of the report, AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOPATHY (autoimmune encephalitis), EPILEPSY (Epileptic seizure) and EPILEPSY (epileptic seizures) outcome was unknown and WEIGHT DECREASED (Lost 10 pounds), VOMITING (Vomiting) and NAUSEA (Nausea) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In October 2020, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: positive (Positive) positive. On 09-May-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: unknown (Inconclusive) unknown.         Concomitant medication included unspecified thyroid medication. The patient recovered on  06 May2021.  Afterwards, a few days later the patient was hospitalized on  08 May2021 for what was described as an epileptic seizure.  They proceeded to leave the hospital on 09 May2021 needing an MRI within the next two weeks.  The patient was re-hospitalized at 9:00AM on 10May2021 for another epileptic seziure.  They are currently examining her for an autoimmune encephalitis.  The patient proceeded to recover and was tested for antibodies in October to which it was determined they did have antibodies.  On an unknown date, and electroencephalogram was performed (results not provided).  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the drug was not applicable as the patient received both planned doses.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                The night following the vaccine, I experienced a fever above 100 degrees, with moderate chills, body aches, and joint pain.  The injection site was swollen and red in addition to general muscle pain from the shot.  This continued until about 48 hours after the vaccination.

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

At around 4:00 pm, I felt mild joint pain in my right ankle which worsened to mild/moderate joint pain in my left elbow/wrist &#43; both ankles/knees, so I took an extra strength acetaminophen (500 mg) around 4:30 pm. My joint pain subsided, and I began to feel fatigued around 5:00 pm. Mild chills began around 9:30 pm, and joint pain at the same sites resumed around 10:00 pm. I went to bed around 12:00 am with moderate chills, mild joint pain, and mild pain at the injection site, but I awoke around 12:45 am with slightly worsened chills, joint pain, and pain at the injection site. I took another extra strength acetaminophen and was able to sleep for the rest of the night. I woke up at 9:00 am with no symptoms.

Vaccine administration proceeded without complication. Shortly after receiving vaccination, while the patient was in the waiting room during observation she stated that her chest was feeling tight and her heart was racing. Pharmacist brought her back into clinic room so she could breath freely without her mask and take a puff of her proair inhaler. After 5-10 minutes, she stated that her chest was still tight and her back hurt. Family members were called to take her home/to ER. She did not want to wait so a store employee drover her to patient&#39;s preferred emergency room for a breathing treatment.

I slept with my mom in fear of having episode again. Around 2:45 am, my mom woke to me shaking like I was having a seizure. it lasted about 30 secs. she called 911 and i was checked out by paramedics, who said my vitals were fine and I should flollow up with medical care. My mom and I agreed that perhaps I needed stress dosing of Cortef. I took stress dosage and have been taking stress dosage all day and so far no more episodes.  Now waiting for Doctor to call me back and advise.

                                                I had a bad headache begin a couple hours after receiving the vaccine, and muscle soreness. I woke up and could barely move my arm, and throughout the day I got progressively more fatigued. By the next night, I had a low-grade fever and had extreme all-over body soreness. It felt like I had the flu. By morning, I was feeling a bit better and got progressively better. The next day (2.5 days after the vaccine), I was feeling better other than some soreness in my injection site.

Upon calling the health center, they said that I may have eaten something bad. Around 6pm the same day, I started sweating but I was freezing, and had a headache and muscle pain. I had a 101 fever and that persisted until the next day (3/24/21). It is currently (3/24/21) and I have noticed sharp chest pains on the right side of my chest throughout the day, especially when exerting forces breathing (such as riding my bike or walking up stairs, or getting into and out of bed). I still have a slight fever and feel very cold, but I in fact, still have a slight fever of 100.4

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the event, I had throat swelling, chills, sweats, temperature of 102.5, headache, muscle soreness, dizziness, lightheadedness. Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

Within the next hour, my jaw began to lock and my throat began to burn/tighten. Within this timespan, my body, especially my back began to ache as well as my chest feeling tight.  After three hours, I went to the on-campus clinic and they gave me 50mg of Benadryl.

                                                First day I had immediate swelling at the injection site, red circle form around the site of injection following up with an itch that lasted for 3 days. Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

When we asked if she needed anything she stated she couldn&#39;t stand up or move her muscles. The ambulance was called and they arrived within 10 mins. She was brought to the ER and told that her blood pressure was low. She was treated with fluids and rest. I followed up with the patient this morning at 10am she stated she was feeling better.

I have aches in my legs, neck, arm, and lower back (I?m supposed to have my period soon, so it?s possible that the back pain is not vaccine related). I have a headache that has persisted since about 11:30 am. I have not taken any medication. I would say on a pain scale of 1-10, the pain is about a 4 (quite uncomfortable but bearable).

By 48 hours, soreness peaked and the lump remained with warmth and itching when the area was touched with slight pressure. Between the 2nd and 14th day, the lump was still present (still 1.5 inches in diameter) with mild itching. I began to develop a dry cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue, and muscle fatigue that lasted from day 5 to day 11 following the Moderna injection. I went to get a COVID test and the results came back negative. After the 14th day the lump went down but now there is a discoloration of the skin where the lump was located that is still present 23 days after the first injection.   I did not use any medications or treatments to heal the adverse event nor sickness symptoms following the injection.

Every single muscle and joint in my body hurt, it felt like I had been hit by a train. I could feel soreness down to the muscles in my hands. I could barely move, I couldn?t get comfortable. My head and neck hurt the worst, it was just so sore and painful and everytime I stood up, I would get a pounding sensation in my head. It went on like that for almost 12 hours. The next day I felt perfectly fine.

                                                Two days after receiving vaccine, began with bilateral knee pain and stiffness, shortly followed by rash over both legs. Over the next few hours, the rash became more prominent, and pain in knees, ankle and shins made walking difficult. Went to ER and was diagnosed with  Henoch-Schonlein purpura and told to take Ibuprofen for pain and to follow up with PCP. Rash continued to spread over the next two days to include both upper arms and elbows, with broken blood vessels. Also developed swelling in knees and more severely in ankles.  CBC with differential in ER was reported as normal. Visited PCP 5/23/21, who referred to dermatologist and completed urinalysis which was essentially normal with possible elevated white cells to be cultured.

It lasted two days and was worse when standing or moving.  It was less intense on the second day, but hives appeared on my left arm and my arm was more sore on the second day, and stayed sore for 5 days. The body aches started around 10:00 pm on the first day.  Then fatigue and joint pain.  Really awful.

                                                On 12/20/20 i had received the Moderna covid vaccination.  3 days after i had recieved the vaccination i had felt like i had a stiff neck on the same side of my body that i receive the vaccination on. I had just ignored it until i noticed a &#34;bump&#34; on the side of my neck. I felt it and felt a large swollen lymph node. Again I had decided to ignore the reaction as i figured my antibodies were at work. I had decided to not get the second dose 28 days later as the lymph node had not gone down yet. It is now 06.04.2021 and the lymph node is still there, at this point it is causing an uncomfortable pain in my neck as it is growing.  I would like a letter stating i am medically except from receiving the second vaccination in order to fly.  Thank You.

The tingling also went back up her arm to her neck causing muscle strain in the area and causing her to crack her neck.

Patient also reports she has gone to physical therapy as a result of this adverse event she associates with the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

On 12/31/2020 began to have a rash around the injection site that was increasing in size and limiting arm mobility. PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

My chest felt heavy and I was having labored breathing, My heart was racing at 160bpm and my blood pressure was 180/90, both of which are very high and abnormal for me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

                                                After extreme muscle soreness and fatigued for a week after vaccination. Nerve pain and numbness on extremities began. Each day is a different location for the nerve pain for example one day it&#39;ll be on my left side of my face; the next day will be my hands; the following day will be my left side of my body from underneath my clavicle down my arm and from the side of my leg to my knee, etc. The numbness is felt on the top of my feet occasionally the left side of my face.

Those symptoms subsidized after 2 days. A week after the vaccine (1/19/2021), a lump appeared on my shoulder where the injection was done. The area is red, itchy and warm. Those symptoms have been observed for 2 days now.

The stiffness turned into nerve problems and I felt hot and tingly on my neck, back and head for several days. 8 days later from the vaccination day i got a huge rash on my left arm. On top of that my armpit area was severely sore . Soreness and pain from the arm continued 2 weeks later.

At work (noon), suddenly became very lightheaded, cold, sweaty,  experienced blackout vision around periphery and felt faint and nauseous. Threw up. Went home and had extreme chills and could not get warm. Nausea subsided around 6:00pm 1/27. Headache and neck soreness continues still today (1/30). Headache feels like pressure inside my head, pushing and causing dull pain at the base of my skull and top of neck.

At that time, she experienced muscle pain for a day or two then it subsided. When she awoke today (2/2/21), she felt a lump at the injection site. Throughout the day, she said it grew larger and more painful. She said it is now swollen and red and larger than the morning. I advised her to call her doctor to get it checked out and to report and adverse events to the website (which I provided to her).

A concerning side effect was that my resting HR was consistently above 105BPM from about 4:30AM-4PM the day after receiving the second dose. It reached as high as 125BPM without doing much movement at all to account for the high HR.

However, 10 days later, I started experiencing mild sore throat and fever, headaches, and moderate aches and muscle weakness. Day 11 after the vaccine, I noticed a red, asymptomatic ring around the injection site. I have never had a reaction to any vaccine or shot before. In total, I experienced fever, sore throat, muscle weakness, fatigue for 4 days after the symptoms started.

Some mild nausea/loss of appetite. From the beginning of my symptoms to the end of them, my best estimate is about 36 hours. Taking an aspirin alleviated most of the symptoms to where I was more functional. I did call into work and skip a meeting the day after.

                                                Moderate headache, fever, myalgia. The latter two lasted 2 days after vaccine, the headache lasted about 2.5 days after vaccine. I was back to normal after the weekend (about 3 days later). Some mild fatigue and feeling ?off? occurred as well during that 2.5 day period. Took some ibuprofen and that helped a little bit, otherwise just took it easy and recovered pretty quickly (relatively).

This lump went away after some time on its own.   Today, 02/06/21, the itchiness and pain returned, and what looked like a ?ridge? shape under my skin appeared on my arm at the site where the shot was administered.  It?s just bothersome but doesn?t impair my regular functionality. I intend to take a Benadryl and stay hydrated. Noticed I?ve been excessively thirsty today, much more than usual.

Patient was monitored for 30 minutes and assessed before departure.

Symptoms would come and go throughout day, but were worse in the mornings. Wednesday (2/10) - Present (2/13) - same symptoms as Tuesday (2/9). Symptoms worse in the mornings and after physical exertion (going to school, walking stairs), and at night as well. Symptoms are not severe, but I am concerned that they have lasted a full week. I have been taking Day-Quil severe every 4 hours. I was also on my period, which just ended yesterday (2/12). I believe my period started the day of the vaccine.  I plan on going to a doctor&#39;s office, but have been too tired to move from my apartment.

If I move my legs or arms or any joints such as my wrist, sometimes it will make a joint popping/cracking sound and sting for a second then it feels normal. I used to never have any problems with joints and now I do. Before my second dose, this happened right after my first dose as well and I thought it was getting better than my second dose made it flare up again. I have no preexisting conditions and no problems with my joints beforehand. I am hoping within a few months the condition will resolve itself but it is concerning since this all started happening after the vaccine. Other than that, I feel perfectly fine.

                                                Woke up at 4AM on the day after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine with chills, intense muscle aches, intense headache, constipation, dizziness, brief nausea. Was unable to get myself out of bed until around 11AM after taking a nap. Used naproxen to bring the symptoms down to a manageable level, but despite taking 440 mg total (220 around 11am, 220 around 8pm), I was mostly bedridden throughout the day. I had very little energy, and moving too much caused dizziness. All symptoms lasted from 4AM on the day after the second dose until waking up the day after that.

Following day, arm soreness extremely painful with some shoulder joint pain and pain any time upper arm muscle used. Slightly sore by second day post-injection without much discomfort.  Soreness completely subsided by third day post-injection. First day post-injection developed heavy fatigue at the beginning of the day (~8AM) followed by chills and then a fever a few hours after waking up. Thermometer was not used to detect fever.  Had slightly more energy and minimal chills by evening (~7PM).  Fever was subsiding (didn&#39;t feel as warm) but was still sweating pretty easily.  All fatigue, chills, &amp; fever gone by following day (second day post-injection).

                                                Received shot at 10:00  Felt strange almost immediately. No specified symptoms just brain fog and difficulty  holding conversations. Noticed my chronic back pain (L5 fracture) was very bad, but didn?t initially connect it to the vaccine.   By 4:00 I was running a fever, fatigue, shivering, sweating, could not eat due to lack of appetite / nausea. Could not think straight.   The night of the 22nd (day I received 2nd dose of vaccine) I had difficulty sleeping, heart palpitations, and extremely strange dreams when I did sleep. The next morning (23rd)  I felt much better, even walked around for a bit, but by noon I was back to having sever symptoms. My fever spiked, my energy was drained, and my back pain was unbearable.   This progressed over the afternoon into unbearable tooth pain along with the back pain and other symptoms. Back pain did not recede with rest as it normally does. Ibuprofen did not seem to mitigate symptoms much.  Brain fog was intense and I could not focus on anything.   Managed to sleep last night and had more vivid dreams. Woke up feelings fine but symptoms seem to be slowly returning.

Patient had full body stiffness, eyes rolled back, urinated herself, and had a brief loss of consciousness. Seizure spontaneously resolved within 10 seconds and patient had a several minute post-ictal phase. I rolled patient onto her side and monitored her O2 sat in the post-ictal phase. Patient reported dizziness and nausea during this period.  EMS evaluated patient and recommended emergency evaluation, patient refused transport. Patient ambulated on her own out of the store after about 20 minutes.

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

                                                Two days after receiving the IM injection in her left arm, patient developed soreness at the injection site and painful left axillary lymphadenopathy. It was painful to lift her arm, and she felt a &#34;pulling&#34; on her chest. She was very distressed and sought evaluation by her PCP on 4/29/2021 who told her that she had lots of swollen lymph nodes. She was unable to work for four days because of the pain. The soreness in her arm has resolved, but the swelling and discomfort on moving her left arm persist, although they are improved. She did NOT have any fevers, chills or night sweats associated with the event.

                                                After about 10 hours after the vaccine was administered, I got a fever of 102, which then made its way up to 104.7. I knew the fever was a possible side effect, but it got very bad very quickly. I had to call off of work because I could not stay awake and was in so much pain. My fever has lowered 2 days after vaccination, but has not fully gone down.  Also, my neck on the side that my vaccine was administered (the left arm) is very swollen and very painful. I cannot lift my arm and there is a noticeable difference between my left and my right neck in regards to swelling.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking.

Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

Took 1 Aleve for the pain. Then on day 7 axillary pain went away and a rash started to form on arm where vaccine was given. Day 8 rash spread at was bright red. Around noon on day 8  hives popped up next to left eye. On day 8 did a virtual doctor appointment and the NP prescribed antibiotics because she said the &#34;rash&#34; is cellulitis.  At this time took zytec to help with the hives.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly. By 06:30 AM on 1/7/2020, the lump had mostly gone down in size significantly, the dull ache had subsided completely, the redness had gone away. By 1/8/2020, 10:00 PM, the lump and swelling are gone, no ache, no itch, still a slight discoloration where lump was.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

I have been taking photos and making the site.  The area inside the ring is warmer compared to my other deltoid on the right side. I am schedule for the next vaccine on the 1/26/21.  I just wanted to make sure I would still qualify to get the second dose/ safe? I can send pictures as well. I just wasn&#39;t able to attach an image.

Approaching midnight that day the soreness was improving and by mid next day it was limited to L deltoid upon palpation. After 2-3 days soreness resolved. No other adverse effects noted.   I have had very minor muscle soreness to a few vaccinations before, but not this bad. In those cases it has been limited to site of injection (deltoid) and less severe. Usually I don&#39;t notice anything after injections and I&#39;ve never had any other adverse effects.

At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                The day of the vaccine about 4 hours later, I started experiencing chest pain. It was not tightness or a heartburn feeling type of chest pain. I have asthma, and it is the type of chest pain I start feeling right before I get bronchitis, almost like breathing in mist and the irritation that comes from having a cough, but I had not had a cough that would have caused this sensation. The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection. Ibuprofen helps the headache slightly but makes the pressure in my head feel worse and makes the joints in my hands and forearms hurt and my fingers swell for some reason which has never happened before for me when taking ibuprofen.

At 10:30pm began to feel chills and body aches. 11:00pm  got very hot and sweaty, hands began to tingle, vision became fuzzy around the edges, felt like I was going to pass out. Experienced tachycardia, tachypnea, and headache. 12:20am- vomited. Restless sleep through the night, chills, fever (100.6-99.6 on Tylenol), body aches, joint pain, stomach ache, woke at 5:00am.  1/26- spent all day vomiting. At least once every hour. Continued tachycardia, tachypnea, stomach ache,  fever, headache, body aches,  and joint pain. At 7:00pm took Zofran and I stopped vomiting. Still nauseous. Could not eat all day.  1/27- woke up with headache and slight body aches but otherwise felt okay during the day. Was hungry and able to eat. Starting at 10:00pm my stomach began to hurt again. Experienced bloating, sharp stabbing pain and nausea. Felt like I needed to vomit or pass a bowel movement but could not do either. Took Zofran at 11:00pm, did not help in relieving my GI symptoms. Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

                                                Starting 3 days ago (approximately 10 days after vaccine) I started having muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was given in similar to the soreness right after the vaccine was given.  A few hours after the soreness was noticed I noticed red-raised hives in the injection site. Over all symptoms (soreness to touch same as the soreness right after vaccine was given, itching, redness, raised hives, and warm to touch in the area of redness). The next day the symptoms remained about the same but area of raised-red-hives now seems to be a more defined 4-5 inch long red oval in the area the vaccine was given. 3rd day redness seemed lighter in color but still a pretty defined oval with warmness to touch the soreness was a little better by the 3rd day. I started taking Amoxicillin 500 mg that I had at home on the 3rd day. Today, 4th day, overall seems to be getting better still some soreness, still a red oval but is getting lighter, still soreness but defiantly better than it was. My doctor had me start Keflex 500 mg Q 6 hours for 7 days I started taking that today.

Nausea, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat, low-grade fever (~99°F) and persistent headache, and took Theraflu nighttime before bed on day two (02/03/2021). Temperature of 99.7°F throughout day three (02/04/2021); also, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat with swollen lymph nodes and tonsils with white spots (did at-home test for strep-A, got a negative result), and persistent headache?this night I also took Theraflu nighttime. Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

I had severe pain at the injection site where I was unable to dress myself or do normal activities, severe muscle pain and soreness, severe chills, a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a mild headache, severe dehydration that remained throughout the day and night even though I drank almost 2 gallons of water, stomach pain and bloating, and nausea and vomiting that occurred in the middle of the night at 2am, and extreme fatigue. Even though I had fatigue, I was unable to sleep due to the pain. I finally took pain medicine at 8am on 2/07/21 to help myself go to sleep as well since I was awake for over 24 hours. I slept for 6 hours and woke up still having chills, muscle soreness, a slight fever, a mild headache, and pain at the injection site where I am still unable to lift my left arm and put clothes on.

                                                Joint pain and cracking at shoulder lasting a whole week now. After receiving my injection, I noticed that it was given very high up on my arm, just barely 1 finger width&#39;s away from my shoulder joint. As a healthcare provider myself, I know to be aware not to administer too high as this can result in shoulder injury. I unfortunately seem to have encountered this firsthand myself. I wanted to wait a week hoping the pain would go away, but it is still there even after a week. It was severe pain starting about 36 hours after receiving the shot, then for two more days, the pain was about 8/10. The pain has become less severe over time, but I am unable to use my left arm to the same capacity anymore due to this constant shoulder joint pain. Prior to this, I have never had any shoulder pain.

At 4 pm I took two Tylenol and continued with my evening. By 5:30 pm I had an entire body ache and stiffness. By 9  pm I was running a mild fever and had body mild body aches. The following morning (03/13/21) at 7 am I was experiencing extreme fatigue, body aches and a temperature. I again took two Tylenol and continued with my day. My activities that day were limited due to my symptoms. It continued throughout the day and by 6:30 pm I was running a high temperature, chills, all over body ache, and a intense headache. I continued with two Tylenol every 4-6 hours. Sunday morning (03/14/21) my fever was gone but I am still experiencing body ache and headache. Two Tylenol as needed throughout the day.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

Muscle pain was mainly in the shoulders (more on the side of the injection), lower back, and in the legs. Lasted through the night and took a Tylenol 500mg tablet that next morning (3/18). Symptoms improved slightly, but did not got away and got a little worse as the day progressed (but still improved from the morning). Took another Tylenol that evening, felt better by bedtime, and feel much better today (3/19). Still have some arm soreness when I lift the arm my injection was placed in, but not too bad.

                                                Fever, chills, all over aches, lower pelvic pain, lower back pain started all of a sudden. I went directly to my GYN, thinking a UTI. Doctor checked urinalysis, vaginal swab and hormonal bloodwork. All came back normal. Was sent to urgent care to have a covid test and flu test. Both came back negative.

                                                That evening I had slight chills, low fever and body aches, which went away by the next day. The next morning, I had a severe tightening of the left side of my neck and shoulder, along with arm soreness. I saw my Physical Therapist and was told that it was a result of the vaccine. I was fine until I got the vertigo Friday evening. It came on really quickly and I&#39;ve never experienced it before. I was okay the next morning with the exception of a headache, which lasted for about a month after that. My doctor offered shots for them, but I couldn&#39;t take them due to my current meds. I was told to come back if they continue.

                                                On Sunday, March 28th, I started experiencing intense nausea past noon. About twenty minutes later, I started to vomit, and couldn&#39;t stop. In less than an hour, I had vomited over 8 times. I couldn&#39;t drink water (let alone hold any liquid down) before the next vomiting episode. I started to see blood in my vomit after the 2nd time (the doctors say this was due to my stomach aggressively contracting and causing little tears in the muscles). Around 1:30 p.m., my mother took me to the ER to get fluids and anti-nausea medication (magnesium oxide, sodium chloride, lactated ringers, and zofran). After my puking episodes stopped, I was discharged from the hospital and was prescribed more ondanestron (which I&#39;ve used again at home after feeling nauseous again). Other than these symptoms, I have also experienced muscle aches, chills, and a very sore arm. I understand that nausea/vomiting is a reported side effect with Moderna for some people, but considering I&#39;ve never experienced this symptom in any other vaccine (and never vomited back to back so quickly in a short period of time) I figured I would report my symptoms.

                                                The night of my vaccine, I had a 100 degree fever, body aches, and chills.  That was resolved by the next day.  On 3/29, I woke up with itchiness behind my right ear.  around 4:30pm on the same day, I had broken out into hives on my face and arms.  By 5:30 they had become itchy and had spread to my neck and chest area.  I had also developed swelling around my eyes, above and below them.  I woke up at 1:30am on 3/30 with itching and burning and more swelling around my eyes.  At 7:30am on 3/30,  my eyes were almost swollen shut and I sought medical attention.  I had itching and burning on my entire body, swollen eyes, full body aches, and joint pain.  I was prescribed steroids and began that course around 1:30pm.  I was also prescribed two epi pens.  Around 6:30pm that night, I had a 100.7 degree fever.  It dropped without the use of a fever reducer within the next two hours. The swelling reduced around my face by 8pm.  This morning, I had almost no swelling, but still a full body rash.  I am treating it with benadryl, zyrtec and maximum strength pepcid, steroids, and calamine lotion.

                                                immediately following the vaccine I felt tired and feverish. I took ibuprofen and felt mostly fine. The symptoms went away 3 days after the vaccine. On Monday following the vaccine (4 days after the vaccine) I began feeling joint pain / stiffness at night. I thought it was from skiing  for 3 days after the vaccine but it did not go away. It got worse and I began feeling joint / muscle pain throughout my body, especially in the morning and night. When I wake up in the morning it still hurts to roll over. Once I am up and moving for the day and take ibuprofen I start to feel a bit better, but overall I feel very painful joint and muscle pain daily.

Left shoulder sore and uncomfortable to move through full range of movement from 4/1/21 afternoon until afternoon of 4/3/21. Soreness did noticeable die down as time passed.  Discomfort/muscle tightness starting around 3:00 pm 4/6/21 in the left axillary region. No swelling/redness/rash visible on surface. Discomfort most noticeable when stretching arm forwards/backwards or squeezing upper arm against side. Squeezing arm to side results in a feeling similar to if someone were trying to hold a marble in their armpit.   4/8/21 woke up still with arm pit discomfort and a return of the discomfort in the out shoulder muscle where the vaccine was administered.

                                                Within 30 seconds of the injection of my second dose of Moderna, I experienced extreme nausea unlike any that I have experienced before. Within 1 minute of the injection, my face, arms, chest, and neck flushed and I turned completely red. I felt hot and started to sweat. At the same time, I began having trouble breathing with the sensation that my throat was beginning to close. My eyes filled with tears and I was not able to talk to communicate what was happening. My mom, who was with me at the time of vaccination, asked the administering pharmacist if I could remove my mask because I was having trouble breathing. Throughout this reaction, the pharmacist froze and was visibly in shock of what was happening. Because of this, my mom began asking me questions to figure out what else I was experiencing. Once I was able to remove the mask and breathe deeply, the reaction subsided after two minutes. The pharmacist, after my reaction began to subside, stated that they had an epipen ready to administer if needed. I was never administered the epipen. The pharmacist asked me to wait 30 minutes instead of the general 15 minutes before leaving the site. Because the symptoms went away and did not return within the 30 minutes, I left the site. After the vaccination, I experienced a low-grade fever for 79 hours, chills, a headache, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue. After realizing my reaction was not considered ?normal,? I began to research and realized these symptoms align with anaphylaxis, even though they subsided quickly after experiencing them.

The following day, symptoms were significantly improved with some persistent body aches and intermittent chills.

Muscle stiffness - started an hour after vaccine and lasted about 48 hours, no pain medication or stretching helped, caused sleep issues due to not being able to get comfortable. Difficulty breathing - chest felt tight and felt like I wasn&#39;t getting enough oxygen in each breath so I had to pause to take deeper breaths.

                                                Onset of pretty severe neck and upper back pain that made it difficult to sleep because I was unable to find a position that didn&#39;t cause any pain about 12 hours after injection (inj: 12:45 pm on 4/16/21; onset: 12:30 am on 4/17/21). Saturday, 4/17/21, the pain lessened and I just felt a bit of fatigue and injection site pain. Sunday night (4/18/21) going into Monday morning (4/19/21) I was woken up from my sleep with very severe upper neck pain that radiated down the R-side of my back, on the muscle. I could not fall back asleep for 2 hours because any position I was in I experienced intense pain. Today, 4/19/21, during the day, the pain is definitely less severe. I took my meloxicam this morning as I usually do but it was still pretty bad pain so I rubbed CBD cream on it. Pain still feels dull but tense, with occasional flare-ups of sharp pain. Today it is more widespread, across my shoulders and in the bilateral upper back area. When I rubbed the CBD cream on it, it hurt to touch. I also take gabapentin at night, which is my standard for my fibromyalgia, and I&#39;m not sure if that is what is exacerbating this pain, seeing as it is so much worse at night. I have never woken up from pain before like I did last night, and I deal with pain daily with fibromyalgia. It was very intense.

                                                Several days after recieving my Moderna vaccine, I began to feel itchiness in my feet. Within a few hours, the itchiness spread to my hands (both the tops of my hands and my palms). The itchiness spread to my wrists as well. By the morning of April 17th, I had swollen, red hives on my hands, wrists and feet. The itching was coupled with a burning feeling. Benadryl and Calamine lotion did not help. As the day continued, the hives spread to my ankles, knees and elbows. In the morning on Monday, April 19th I felt stiff (didn&#39;t know this was part of my reaction until my doctor asked me if I felt like my joints were stiff--I was too itchy to feel concerned about it), the bottoms of my feet were painful, and I could barely touch anything with my hands without it hurting. As the day continued, I became so uncomfortable between the itchiness and burning I decided to see my doctor.

Felt chills. This lasted from the morning after the first dose, and has gotten better due to receiving medical attention in the emergency room, I needed two IV?s and Tylenol with codine. They did blood work and a CT scan on my head and chest, and I received Azithromycin to treat the chest pain. I am feeling slightly better, however there have been occasional pangs of pain on my head (right side), and a persistent dull chest pain that is on and off. I also had some break outs on my back, and my back still aches and my bones crack more often than usual. I am also dealing with drowsiness and some nausea. On 05/02/2021 they kept me in the emergency room until nearly 10pm.

However, I took Tylenol (650mg) preemptively because of my experience with the first dose. This may have affected onset time and severity. Side effects had set in by 9 PM that evening, with the worst being the headache. Ringing in my ears (tinnitus) came with the onset of other side effects, and the severity coincided with the severity of the headache. I took Tylenol, which helped reduce (but not eliminate) side effects, but ringing in ears persisted, if only less intensely.  I have continued to take Tylenol (and occasionally Ibuprofen--I tend to avoid because of stomach sensitivity), with all symptoms lessening over the week (5/3-5/10), except for ringing in ears and slight headache. The ringing does not seem to go away with OTC meds (Tylenol, Ibuprofen). It is worse in the left ear, which is the side I got the shot in.

                                                Obese female patient with history of diabetes and seizure came to our pharmacy for second Moderna  covid dose.  A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, she was feeling lightheaded and nausea. I asked the patient to come back in to the consultation room where she could sit or lay down on the floor. The patient was able to walk back into the room with a little assistance from her mother. She sat on the floor for a bit, still breathing fine, and said she wanted to throw up. I grabbed a trash can, napkins, and a pedialyte bottle for her. She did not throw up but started breathing a little heavier and said she was about to faint. I got the epi pen ready and told her please lay down if she has to. At this point she fell to her right side and slightly hit her head against the wall. It appeared that she stopped breathing for few seconds, but  I still felt a pulse on her wrist. It also appeared that she went into a seizure, her upper body stiffened up and her arms were slightly flailing. I immediately called 911  and about 1 minute later, both the mother and I could clearly see the patient breathing as indicative by the rising/lowering chest. I also felt a stronger pulse on her wrist. I did not inject the epi pen. Paramedics arrived shortly and after about 5-10 minutes of talking to her, the patient began to gain conscious but looked exhausted. They transported her to the hospital. Per the mother, patient was completely fine after the first dose of Moderna;  also just had a seizure a few days before the second Moderna dose. The whole incident was about 20 minutes from administering the vaccine to paramedics transporting her away.

                                                Severe headache lasting more than two weeks. After 3 days I went to the emergency room. I went due to a number of symptoms(fever, chills, nausea, severe body aches, neck stiffness, blurred vision) the headache was my chief complaint and thought to be the cause of the other issues. My heart rate upon arrival was 223 causing me to be hooked up to a cardiac monitor, and my blood pressure was 72/56. I was swabbed for the flu and Covid. Both resulted negative. All labs blood and urine were normal. X-ray or chest was done and showed all clear. CT scan was also done and to my knowledge was clear. I was told I needed to get a lumbar puncture to check for meningitis because it was the only other thing they could think of. Upon doing the lumbar puncture CSF gushed from the needle used to puncture and my headache was gone within minutes. I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri. Thought to be caused by my IUD. After going to see my OBGYN I was informed that my COVID vaccine had caused my IUD to release and unusual amount of hormones and that?s what caused the excess buildup of spinal fluid in my brain. I?m still, almost two months later experiencing headaches and back/neck pain. My IUD is still not working properly and is scheduled to be removed temporarily.

There was pain from my shoulder down to my finger tips and occasionally travel across the sides and back of my neck. My entire body ached. Ckuldnt eat for a day and a half. I felt extremely nauseous. I couldnt sleep due to the pain and could barely move. Even now my arm is in an unbarable amount of pain but not as much as when the pain started.y fingertips no longer have a burning pain and my elbow is no longer aching but i can barely move my shoulder around.

My arm hurts so much it feels like if I pick anything up (like my phone, or a blanket) with my left arm, I get this shooting, tearing pain all through my upper arm. All the joints in my left arm have sharp shooting pains along with just general stiffness. I also had tingling in my fingertips &amp; some major swelling all through my upper arm and shoulder.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine I felt fine. Around 7 pm that night I began having body aches that continually worsened throughout the night. At 2 am on Saturday I took my temperature and it was 101.6 F, at 3 am it was 102 F. The body aches, joint pain, fever, and headache continued through the next day until about 6 pm on Saturday. Also on Saturday around 12 pm I began experiencing severe nausea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. At one point it felt as if I was going to pass out. All the major symptoms finally subsided Saturday night around 6 pm. Saturday till Sunday I have felt fatigued and sore but otherwise fine.

Allergy recommended additional 15 minutes of monitoring. No improvement so the patient was transferred to ED for further evaluation.

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

In the morning the swelling and chills were gone, and I had a really stiff upper shoulder and up to my neck. I feel totally fine the next morning, but concerned about a worse reaction to the second shot.

My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

                                                Starting around 9AM I began noticing a high heart rate while inactive. My heart rate was at 140 bpm (measured manually and with Watch). Normal for me is between 80-100 bpm. My heart rate remained high (between 120-140 bpm) for about 6 hours. I did not notice it go down to 100bpm until the next day. The high heart rate was never provoked by any physical activity. I rested in bed or in a chair all day and drank lots of water. Throughout the day I had fluctuating periods of feeling very hot and very cold. I took 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 hours throughout the day.  I also experienced expected side effects (chills, joint aches, muscle aches, nausea, headache, fever (100F w/ Tylenol)).

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 3pm 1/13/21. I was fine for the 30 minutes after, not even sore at the injection site.  Around 6pm, my muscles started aching, but not painful enough to be concerned.  At 3am 1/14/21, I woke up in pain in every muscle. Enough to wake me, but not terrible.  At 7am, I noticed a pinpoint pain in my armpit, and my muscles still ached.  At 9:30am, I took ibuprofen to attempt to curb the pain a bit.  Around 10am, it got so painful I was limping, and having trouble bending down or reaching above shoulder height.  At 11:30am, I noticed the pinpoint pain in my armpit had gotten worse, and there is a hard, approximately quarter-sized round lump in this spot. Very painful.  At 2:30, I went to move my shirt sleeve and the pain at the injection site was so intense I screamed when I touched it.  This pain continued until 1/16/21 when I woke up feeling entirely normal.  Since 1/16/2021, my hands have been randomly stiffening, either completely stretched out and dropping anything in them, or closing tight enough to leave fingernail marks on my palms. I will also reach to grab things and my hands will sometimes bend into odd shapes, instead of what I intended for them to do. This began at 1-2 times a day, and is becoming more often. It is now up to 2-4 times daily.

                                                The first vaccine I only had mild arm pain which went away after a few days, exactly 7 days later I had a delayed localized reaction (extreme swelling size of a golf ball, redness, itching, hot to the touch). I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

Upon closer inspection, a lump slightly smaller in diameter than a baseball was visible in the area of soreness (underneath right armpit). The lump was noticeable by touch as well, but did not feel hard. It felt swollen but still fleshy. February 12: The soreness from the lump has subsided, but the lump is still present. The lump feels slightly smaller in size.

Also experienced lethargy and nausea on the day after the vaccine. I did have GI upset immediately after and for a few hours after getting injection but that subsided overnight and I experienced some neck stiffness within an hour of the vaccine but that seemed to wear off through the day.  As of writing this (10:20 pm) I am still experiencing joint pain but it has decreased as well as muscle soreness; went from a 9 at the worst and is now a 3/4 and better with analgesics

                                                Around 5 pm on 2/11 (day of vaccination) I began to notice a very sore arm and dry mouth/dehydration. Drank water and continued as normal. Around 2 am of 2/12 I woke up with chills and had been sleeping very restlessly.  I had body aches in my arm, legs and back. Around 3am my temperature was 100.2. I also felt very faint when standing and thought I may pass out.  3 times when standing, I had to quickly sit down to avoid it. I do suffer from vasovagal syncope so this may be unrelated to vaccination. I took Tylenol and drank more water. Temp rose to about 100.6 before beginning to drop at around 4 am. I continued to take Tylenol every 4 hours and it helped keep temp below 100 but towards the end of the 4 hours, it would start to rise again. I ate normally and drank extra water due to feeling dehydrated still. Around 1 PM 2/12 I started to feel nauseous and had an upset stomach. I was still have a general body aches and elevated temperature around 99.5. My normal temp is usually about 98.0. Nausea led to diarrhea 1 time. Symptoms continued until approximately 8 pm when very quickly the body aches, nausea, fever and soreness in injection arm all went away. None of these symptoms have returned and it is now 2/13 at 8 pm.   I did test positive for Covid-19 on December 28, 2020 but have been fully recovered with no symptoms since 1/8/2021.

Then later in the evening at around 4 pm began feeling muscle spasms in my chest and abdomen area which I had not experienced before, so around 7:30pm I went to the hospital for treatment and was given ibuprofen again and also a lidocaine cocktail which relieved my symptoms.

                                                I have had floaters in my eyes since the vaccine. I started to use  refreshing eye drops on Saturday March 13. I am not sure if the acne cream got in my eye the night before the vaccine. it is called Retin A cream 0.025%. I have also been feeling very weak. I got a B12 injection on my butt for energy(Friday, march 12). My legs feel like they are in pain and the hurt when I walk. I also had a lot of pelvic pain after the vitamin injection. I drank ibuprofen March 14 at night. I woke up feeling very weak. Before going to bed on March 15 I drank Tylenol. I still feel pain in my legs today and now I have lower back pain.

                                                No side effects from first dose of vaccine. Many side effects from second dose. Once second dose was administered, arm immediately became sore. This progressively got worse during the day, including a hard lump and was itchy. Approx. 6 hours later, I became fatigued and had body aches all over. At 30 hours post second vaccine, I started to run a temperature. It got up to 101.5 F, I took Tylenol and went to sleep. By the morning, it was gone. The next 2 days, I had a headache and very sore arm. On day 3 I developed a very sore armpit/under arm area on the same arm as I received the vaccine. As I&#39;m writing this (4 days later), my arm is still sore &amp; itchy and my underarm area is still sore, but no fatigue or fever.

                                                Mild muscle soreness in right arm (injection site) beginning within an hour post-injection, noticeable with movement. Took 400mg of ibuprofen before bed.  At 10.5 hours post-injection (middle of night), right arm soreness was moderate-to-severe at rest and severe, almost unbearable, with movement. Mild muscle soreness and joint pain were present throughout the body; joint pain (wrist, elbows, and knees) was an issue prior to injection and was exacerbated during the event.  I also experienced chills and sharp headache pains. Took 400mg of ibuprofen, 1000mg of acetaminophen, and secured right arm with a pillow, which allowed me to fall back asleep.   At 17.5 hours (following morning), muscle soreness was present in right arm alone and was mild at rest, moderate with movement. All other symptoms were gone. Experienced fatigue that afternoon (approx. 24 hours post-injection), treated effectively with a short nap and vitamin D (through sun exposure).  On the 2nd full day post-injection, right arm muscle soreness is minimal with movement.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine  Around 4 in the afternoon I started getting more intense pain in left arm.  By 5 PM I was starting to get mild nerve pain in the same arm, and the pain had spread from my left arm to include my neck and upper shoulder.  By 8 PM the nerve pain was getting worse and the muscular pain had spread to 2 inches bellow my shoulder blade (concentrated on the left side) and included the aforementioned areas. At 11 PM I noticed that my sense of touch was altered on the left side of my body, and the nerve pain was steadily getting worse.  I could feel pressure but not fine discriminative touch, and had little reaction to touch (I usually have a lot of hypersensitivity, and react very strongly to the slightest amount of touch). I tried going to bed around 12:30 AM but was not able to fall asleep until after 5:30 AM because the nerve pain was so sever at this point.  Positional changes and ice did not help, and I ended up taking Advil at 5:15 because I couldn&#39;t deal with the pain anymore.  This dampened the pain enough that I was able to go to sleep at 5:30 AM. The nerve pain was a 8/10 and went down my ulna to my 4 and 5th fingers.  This was some of the worst pain I have experienced in years. I have some lingering nerve pain in that arm (as well as dampened sensory sensation on the left side), but it is not as bad as it was the night of the vaccine.

I developed a sharp stiff pains in the left side of my neck which went over to the right side which remainded so about 2 days later I went to urgent care and was prescribed a muscle relaxer and pain reliever and within 5 or 6 days after the vaccine all symptoms finally subsided

Woke up the next morning feeling the same but also very feverish going between chills and sweating. Couldn?t really get out of bed (muscle aches and fatigue) and slept all day. Started to feel better around 4pm, but started to feel worse again around 9pm, very bad chills all night until about 4am where I woke up sweating unable to cool down, headache mild.

The second day after, the chills had stopped by I still felt achey. In the afternoon my stomach began to hurt, it got significantly worse over night and persisted at that level for 12 hours. My stomach currently still hurts but not as much as it did over night. I have not been able to identify any action/medication to alleviate the pain.

                                                The first adverse event I noticed was a red, inflamed and itchy rash at the site of the injection. It was slightly painful and warm to the touch. I spoke with a few others who experienced similar reactions.  I took over the counter antihistamines in an attempt to treat it for several days.   One or two days after the rash appeared I started to feel sharp intense pain in my groin and around the vaginal opening to the point that it interfered with me sleeping and sitting comfortably. I have had a history of muscle spasms and vaginal pain (vaginismus, muscle contraction pain) but it was more intense and unprovoked which is why I wanted to reach out honestly? It?s a bit alarming. If other women/people with vaginas are experiencing this it would bring me some relief to know the cause and treatment.

It was consistently achey, but would also get frequent waves of excruciating shooting pain. The entire event lasted about 14 hours.   I didn&#39;t even cry this much when I tore every ligament in my knee. The worst pain I have ever been in.

                                                Received vaccination around 10:15 AM and began experiencing soreness in left arm around 1 PM. Consumed regular diet and drank about 2 L of fluids until 6 PM. Laid in bed around 5 PM and got up at 6 PM to urinate. Felt fine, just a bit tired and sore arm.   While urinating, experienced slight nausea. When washing hands, experienced dizziness and lightheadedness. Attempted to stabilize self on doorway of bathroom and quickly after exiting bathroom, lost consciousness and fainted. Remained unconscious for a couple of minutes and returned with full clarity and processing, but weakness. Checked bp about 3 hrs later and was very low, with orthostatic numbers even lower. Fever measured at 100.5 F. Took 250 mg Tylenol and hydrated.   Days later, bp remains low -- Friday, one day after: standing - 81/57 with temperature of 101.4 F, remaining entire day, with fatigue, joint pain, muscle cramps.  on Monday: 86/64, with fatigue, no fever   Bp is usually on lower side of healthy range, but no history of clinically low blood pressure, nor orthostatic bp.

                                                That evening my arm swelled up and became very painful - not as much as the first vaccine. I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

                                                Fatigue and pain in the injection arm within a few hours of the vaccine. Extreme pain all over my body began around midnight the day after vaccination, and I could not sleep because of the pain. My entire body hurt, especially my back, hips, and the injection arm. I experienced chills and hot flashes on and off. I also experienced fatigue and weakness. These symptoms persisted throughout Friday (my vaccine was Thursday).  Ibuprofen helped ease the symptoms. I felt mostly normal on Saturday, with some lingering back pain and fatigue.

I felt cold and feverish though did not have a fever. Took 1 g of Tylenol which helped chills and muscle aches. This morning (next day) I am still having muscle soreness so I will probably take another 1 g of Tylenol.

I started to feel chills and back pain around 7 pm.  Throughout the night my arm was throbbing and I had a hard time sleeping. I woke up around 12 am to use the restroom. My body felt VERY heavy and weak. I woke up today (1 day after the shot) and felt better.  However, my arm still has severe pain and I experiencing fatigue. I also feel like the back pain goes in and out.

                                                I felt fine the rest of the day after I received the vaccine.  However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

                                                I walked in to received my first dose of the Moderna Covid19 vaccine at approx 12:20pm 1/7/21. The RN who was giving me my injection palpated the top of my shoulder and NOT my acromian process and administered the injection closer to the top of my shoulder, the vaccine did initially hurt more than a typical vaccine would when it was being administered but i thought that might have been normal. Approximately 1hr after receiving the vaccine my left shoulder joint started to have this pinching sensation in the anterior joint when I would raise my arm forward. The pain got progressively worse throughout the day with significantly decreased range of motion in that shoulder and significant pain in my shoulder joint. The pain was so bad it actually kept me from sleeping that night. I never had any muscular pain or any other symptoms beside the joint pain, which was alarming since it should have been administered into the muscle. I believe the vaccine my have been incorrectly injected into the shoulder joint or potentially a smaller muscle in the shoulder. The pain and decrease ROM is preventing me from doing most of my regular day to day activities. Today 1/9/21 has been a full 48hrs after receiving the vaccine and the joint pain has not gotten any better and my range of motion is still significantly decreased, which would prevent me from performing my tasks as an RN.

                                                Arm became incredibly sore about 4 hours after injection.  The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

                                                By 3:30pm I had a fever and experienced arm soreness to my right arm. By 11:30pm I could not move my arm and also could not pick my son up who  weighs 30 pounds. On the following day I continued with severe  body aches  and joint pain. I went to see a doctor about 10:00am who examined me and advised my to take Tylenol and Ibuprofen  for pain.  They did a Covid-19 swab which as negative.  My symptoms are improving and I can say that it took about 24 to 48 hours to recover from my right arm.

                                                After receiving the vaccine 1/9 in my left arm, I had normal side effects of chills, body aches, and fatigue. On 1/14, I noticed the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, no pain with palpitation. On 1/15 the underside of my left arm was itchy but no visible rash. On 1/16 the arm was still itchy and the lymph node was more enlarged. No neck or axillary nodes were enlarged. On 1/17 in the morning I woke up with a large red rash on my left deltoid. It was not itchy, but as the day went on was more red, raised, and warm. The node in my neck was causing some neck discomfort. I presented to Urgent Care and was treated for a local reaction. I was given a steroid cream to use on my arm and was told to take an OTC antihistamine. I have been using the cream for 2 days and so far the rash is resolving but is still visible. The node has not yet decreased in size.

                                                I first got symptoms on Jan 19th with extreme muscle soreness from my shoulders to my toes with hives on my thighs and what felt like a bug bite on my knuckle and a circular bite on my left forearm.  The muscle soreness was there for 3 days.  It was very hard to walk for a while cause of just the soreness.  I still feel a little in my ankles and toes still but fully recovered.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                At the time of the vaccination, I experienced a sore arm for about 48 hours, and muscle aches and chills for about 12 hours.   7 days after receiving the vaccination, I noticed a rash at the injection site. It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

                                                I experienced fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches and headache after 9 hours from receiving my second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The pain was so severe I almost went to the ED and had to take off work the following day. My temperature was as high as 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. I took acetaminophen but this did not help the pain. However, this only lasted less than 24 hours and I made a complete recovery. I have not experienced any issues since.

I was a little feverish: 99.9 to a little before 100F.  Then on Saturday I had a pain on my left side from my arm all the way up to my neck, and it was really hurtful. And I also had it on my right side not so strong as the left side.

Had shoulder soreness day 2 post vaccine and was taking Motrin and Tylenol with some relief. Pain continued to get better. On day 9 post vaccine, pain returned with intensity and was seen at urgent care on 1/9. Shoulder was swollen and red at the time, so urgent care NP diagnosed cellulitis and I was prescribed Keflex, along with instruction to continue taking Motrin, Tylenol. Called out of work on 1/11 d/t shoulder pain/decreased range of motion. Today (1/13) pain is much better but still having some pain/discomfort in the shoulder.

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was able to taste the vaccine,. Within 5 minutes I felt dizzy and within 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t feel my arm.  I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

                                                I received the second dose of the Moderna COVID Vaccine 3 FEB 21. Within 2-3 hours I was incredibly tired. I was hit with intense nausea and vomiting that has been persistent since the night of 3 FEB. I can?t keep much down. 4 Feb I had a fever of 102.3 starting around 4am, I brought it down with a 600 Mg dose of Ibuprofen but it came back off and on throughout the day alongside sweats and chills. All of my lymph nodes were swollen and my entire body hurt. I was unable to sleep last night 4feb/5feb due to muscle pain.  As of today I feel a little better and am without a fever, but I am still incredibly nauseous and have developed a sore throat.

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

                                                Mild chills and joint pain started in the middle of the night (about 12 hours after second dose). Treated with ibuprofen and resolved about 10 hours after onset. Swelling and lump the size of a quarter at injection site noticed about 10 hours after injection. The next morning size increased to about 4 inches in diameter, skin was hard, hot, and painful to touch. Left armpit is also swollen and mildly painful. Now, (3 days after injection) swelling still present. Still hot and hard to the touch and size remains the same. Pain and redness mostly resolved. Now starting to itch.

                                                Arm pain developed throughout the day starting 4 hours post vaccination administration. That pain then spread to my upper back alongside a mild headache. I was otherwise well until 12.5 hours post the vaccine where I developed fever and debilitating chills which went on for the remainder of the night. I had full body aches and immense pain in my arm, and kind of a stiffness all over my body accompanied by fatigue which may just be due to the lack of restful sleep I obtained. I also had a loss of appetite. I took 2 advil the next moring and felt better within 2 hours and regained my appetite. The sweating from what I presume to be fever still hadn&#39;t subsided nor had the chills. I would say within 36 hours all that remains is mild arm pain.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 21 Jan 2021, approximately two hours prior to the start of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 032L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Approximately two hours after receiving the vaccine at 12:30 pm, the patient experienced heavy feeling in her neck and face area that hurt really bad. Later, she noticed numbness in her hands and feet. Slurred speech was reported from a bystander. By 3:30pm, the patient was completely paralyzed on her right side. She was taken to the hospital, and a code stroke was initiated; however, all labs were normal.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient was still paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, had shooting pain feeling, and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly. The doctors planned to discharge her on the next day to a rehab center because she could not function alone.  Treatment for the event included pain medication and hospitalization.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly, unable to walk and shooting pain feelings were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 25-year-old, female, patient, who experienced heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly and shooting pain feelings. The events of heavy feeling in her neck and face area, numbness in her hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number 032L20A, expiration date unknown). The events of inability to walk, had shooting pain feeling and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly occurred the following day after the vaccine administration. Treatment included pain medication and outcome is unknown. Based on the information provided, which indicates a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine (onset latency of 2 hours), a causal association cannot be excluded.

Despite taking an ibuprofen 800 mg I experienced extreme muscle aches, joint pain, fever, chills, extreme migraine with loss of vision, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms did not cease until Friday morning. Friday still experiencing disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea.

I was feeling feverish and had chills. It took me about four days to feel better again. I have PCOS and noticed more ovarian pain and symptoms relating to it during those 4 days of recovery.

                                                Starting about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt feverish (no fever), lightheaded and dizzy. The doctor on site had me wait for an hour until I felt well enough to drive home. Over the next several hours, my lightheadedness became so bad I felt as though I would faint if I stool for longer than a few minutes. On Saturday, 2-13-21, I did pass out on the stairs and again in my livingroom. On Sunday, 2-14-21, I decided to go to urgent care in which I was told to &#34;wait it out&#34;. However, my symptoms had gotten worse over the last couple days to include body aches, headaches, muscle/joint pain, congested sinuses, slight cough, and feeling feverish (no fever) along with being dizzy. Therefore, I went to the ER later that morning 2-14-21, to see if I could get better treatment for my symptoms. I received IV fluids and they preformed blood work, a urinanalysis and an ECG. I was released from the ER around 8pm. My symptoms were better for the remainder of the evening, but have gone back to what I was feeling before for the last several days. My symptoms have been unresolved now for 1 week. I am getting tested for COVID-19 on Saturday 02-20-21.

Wednesday February 24 the lymph nodes in my right arm pit started to get sore and you could see lumps under my skin. Thursday February 25th I woke up with bad pinching pain in my right arm pit and the lymph nodes are about twice the size that they were yesterday and more painful. One feels bigger than pea sized.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face.

                                                Excruciating neck pain beginning at ~5:00am on 2/3. Turned into debilitating nerve pain down my left arm and eventually my right as well. Pain went down the back/side of both arms and into my hands (chilled hands, electric shock feeling, tingling and pain). Now on gabapentin 2x/day, nerve pain is still there (one month later) but much better than it was.

                                                My arm started hurting very bad after about 2-3 hours. At the 12 hour mark from my vaccine (11:30PM), I started to have chills, a fever, and feel nauseous. Around 1 AM I started to vomit and this occurred for about 15 minutes, and then repeated again about an hour later. By the morning of the day after I was no longer vomiting or had chills but still had a fever. The most prominent symptoms on the day after my vaccine were extreme body aches and horrible joint pain. My hands and feet felt swollen and stiff. I had terrible pains and aches in my whole entire body. I was also very tired and still had a low grade fever. On the second day after the vaccine I had bad chest and neck pain and started to have a mild cough. By the third day after the vaccine, the chest pain was gone but still had bad neck pain and a headache that radiated through my skull.

I also had severely painful swollen axillary lymph nodes on the same side that I received my injection. I was not able to work or do any of my daily activities for almost three days. Then on day 7 after receiving my first vaccine dose, I developed a itchy, painful, red rash and hives surrounding the injection site (about a two to three inch radius around the injection site. I also got hives and red itchy painful skin on my face. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed prednisone and a week of pepside and zyrtec. After a week I stopped taking the allergy meds and then the hives came back, so I kept taking the allergy meds until my second vaccine dose.

The sleep aid did not help as I only slept a few hours but could not stay asleep due to the pain. I woke up at 7 AM to feed my cat, then tried to lay back down, but was unable to. I went to the toilet feeling nauseous and wretched a few times but did not throw up. I did, however, experience diarrhea that morning and throughout the day. I laid down on the couch and fell in and out of sleep for a few hours. I felt the headache most of the morning, until about 11 AM,. I felt the chills throughout most of the day. I treated my pain with ibuprofen 200mg tablets (3 taken each time, 4-6 hours apart), Pepto-bismol for the nausea and had mostly liquids such as water and juice as well as bread and crackers. I felt much better by around 2 PM, except for the tenderness and swelling in my arm.

The morning after the vaccination, I also had fever, chills, headache, joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue. The fever was relieved somewhat by an ibuprofen, and went away entirely about 24 hours after the injection. Other symptoms subsided more slowly. The second day after the vaccination, I still had a mild headache and some joint and muscle discomfort, and my right arm was still painful, though somewhat improved by evening. The third day after the vaccine (Monday 3/15), I had no symptoms except occasional joint pain and a slight soreness of the vaccination site.

                                                Pt received 2nd COVID vaccination at 1024. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have dropped her water bottle and become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, she was noted to have moderate pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. Her head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. Pt noted to have some muscular rigidity and not verbally responsive. Another provider advised to call 911 due to unresponsiveness and seizure-like activity. 911 called @1027, meanwhile pt lifted and placed into a wheelchair and moved to treatment area where vitals were obtained, patient became verbally responsive @1034, responses/speech was clear but slow, pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Oxygen applied via facemask @4L. Pt provided staff with phone number to call her mother who was notified of daughter&#39;s condition @1032. FD Engine arrival @1033 report given and pt also became more responsive, eyes opened and stated clearly that she was feeling better. Pt color also improved. Pt denied any allergies, PMH or hx of seizure activity. Pt only reported a syncope many years ago. Ambulance arrival @1036, report provided to emergency staff and pt taken to ambulance for further evaluation @1039. Pt returned to vaccine clinic @1052, having declined ambulance transport. When asked about events, pt stated that upon sitting down she felt a sudden onset of moderate nausea and reached for her water bottle in her bookbag, pt states she could not recall or hear anything until she was moved to wheelchair, and did not recall how she came to be in the observation area (based on this information, suspected time unconscious was approx 6-12 seconds). Pt was educated regarding the many causes of syncope and the neccesity for further evaluation in the Emergency department. Pt discouraged from driving herself from the clinic and was able to obtain ride from her roommate. Pt urged again to obtain a ride to the hospital for further evaluation, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.

That pain lasted through the night. At 2pm or 3pm the next day, her pain backed away to a 5 or 6, which is not uncommon for her.

I was tired. I got a really bad headache that evening and I took Tylenol for it. When I went to sleep, I didn&#39;t have a temperature - at one point - it was 96. something. All night I felt hot and feverish internally. I had body aches, groggy, tired and my muscles hurt like I&#39;d worked out - for the next three days. I felt feverish randomly for the next couple of days as well. The facial numbness only lasted about an hour. Still am  experiencing irritation under my axilla from the first reaction to the vaccine.

                                                I felt arm pain in my left arm Around 4:00 pm, I started reaching for my face but I could not feel my face - it felt numb and tingly. That went on for two hours. There was no other droopiness juts facial numbness. My arm pain lasted for a good three weeks. It caused the lymph nodes under my armpit to swell. The pain went from my axilla Lymph nodes down to my left breast.  I got a pinkish, reddish, itchy rash at the spot on the injection about a week later. I don&#39;t recall the date for the doctor visits - one telehealth and one in person. They wanted me to use Primrose oil to massage the oil. They told me to keep an eye on it. I still continue to get the pain under my arm pit from time to time. I have still been seeing physician about that.

                                                These were symptoms after 2nd shot.  I started with a mild headache and sore arm. Then things got worse. At night on Wednesday, 24th, I got a severe headache that was at the back of my neck and could feel in the back of my head. Then I became so achy. My bones and joints hurt so much. It hurt to sit or lay down. All I could feel is the pain in my joints. I became so weak and so achy that I could barely get up and walk to the restroom. I could it stand for more than 2 minutes due to the pain. The subsided slightly on Thursday night, 25th, at 6pm. But then returned in another way. I became very nauseous and dizzy. My muscles instead of my bones began to hurt extremely. I could barely move. I broke down crying a couple of times due to the pain being so intense. Throughout this time, I did try to eat or snack and continue to drink water and Gatorade.  Then finally the pain just all of a sudden went away on Friday, 26th, at 1:00pm. I felt like a different person. The pain was gone. The only lingering effect was when I would get up from sitting down, I would be dizzy and my head would throb for a few seconds. That went away on Saturday night, 27th.  I will say if that type of pain had continued on much longer, I might have had my husband take me to the Emergency Room.

Her vision blurred; she felt dizzy; she had a hard time hearing herself, although she could hear me fine; and she felt faint.  We had her sit back down and got her some water, checking on her every 5 minutes or so.  She was still dizzy, but not as faint.  She also reported a cold sweat.  We got her some orange juice and continued checking on her.  She called her husband to come and get her.  She was able to get up and walk out of her own accord with her husband.  We will follow up with her tonight to see how she is doing.

                                                Injection site immediately grew a red spot after vaccination. This spot turned into hard red bump with a hight temperature that was painful to the touch. Over the course of the next 10 days, the bump increased in size until it was about 5 inches in diameter. On day 9, the swelling and hardness went away but the arm became numb. On day 10, arm feels heavy and sluggish, but the spot has begun fading away from red but is showing a purplish tint growing in it&#39;s spot.

My muscles were weak and it was hard to move. I then vomited twice. This lasted until I fell asleep on the floor, perhaps 45 minutes. When I awoke 2 hours later, the dizziness and weakness subsided.

                                                About three hours after my shot I developed severe muscle cramps in my lower back all the way up to my mid back, this pain lasted 24 hrs. Around 5pm the day after my shot I had a 101 degree fever, a headache and still the severe back pain. I took Tylenol when I noticed I had a fever and went to sleep. I felt much better on Saturday the 10th, two days after my covid shot, but I did notice redness around the injection sight and still had a slight headache and fatigued.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, the arm it was given to me in was basically dead - very weak, achy, hand couldn&#39;t really grip anything. About 3 minutes after, I was very dizzy and sweaty, and a bit nauseated. Felt like I might pass out.  Starting about 11 hours after the vaccine, and lasting almost 3 days, I had: Extreme body pain, much worse than usual (I have chronic illnesses and I&#39;m always in pain) and more widespread. Low fever. Tiredness.  The hand on the arm where I received dose one of the vaccine still doesn&#39;t have its strength back almost 4 weeks later - can&#39;t open bottles or spray hairspray.  Cannot consume things with bergamot anymore - 1 week following the vaccine I tried to drink a tea that I drink weekly that has bergamot in it. Became incredibly dizzy, there was nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating. Tried it again a week later and had the same reaction. Decided I&#39;d wait until a month after the SECOND dose before trying it again, so may still be sensitive.

The headache felt like a migraine, but went away with the Tylenol. I could not think straight all day.; 24 hours later (Day 2, mid day): threw up once, felt like I could not walk 10 feet without overdoing it. Motion made the nausea worse.; 30 hours later (Day 2, afternoon): took pepto bismol for the nausea. This helped reduce the nausea, but I was still queasy; 32 hours later (Day 2, evening): headache came back. Took 2 extra strength Tylenol to treat. Still very fatigued. I did not feel like I could get out of bed.; 44 hours later(Day3, morning): woke up with a headache, fatigue, and nausea. At this point, I could keep down water, pedialyte, and saltine crackers. Took 2 extra strength Tylenol to treat the headache. Still could not think straight; (Day3, mid-day): Tired, nausea going away (Day4): Neck pain, could not think straight, tired, appetite coming back (Day5): Tired but mostly back to normal The arm pain was bad days 1-2 but got better on day 3. This was way worse than any time I have ever had the flu or pneumonia. I have never been so fatigued that I felt like I could not walk anywhere. The nausea and fatigue were inhibiting to daily activities.

                                                I gave the patient her first moderna vaccine and she was a little anxious about needles but hadn&#39;t had any reactions to vaccines before. I gave her shot and she had a little blood in her band-aid so I went back into the pharmacy to get a different band-aid and cotton ball. I was only in there for 10-20 seconds but when I looked out the door the patient was sliding out of her chair onto the ground. It was only a minute or 2 after she received the vaccine. She came to pretty much right away and was a little shaken up and complained her neck hurt a little. One of the managers that came for the code white sat with her for 30 minutes until she felt ready to get up (patient was an associate that was on the clock).

                                                Woke up this morning (one week after first dose) with a  big red mark on my upper bicep that was warm to the touch. The area was swollen, as well as the under arm (lymph node?). Red mark has gotten larger over the course of the day, still swollen, tender, and hot to the touch. No other side effects, other than neck and hip pain the Monday after, but I am unsure it is related. The neck pain limited movement when trying to turn my chin over my right shoulder. The joint pain has gone away.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Pregnancy (Live full-term birth) on 20-Apr-2018. Concurrent medical conditions included Drug allergy.   On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 14-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on 13-Mar-2021 and the estimated date of delivery was 18-Dec-2021. On an unknown date, the patient experienced SHOCK (body shocks) (seriousness criterion medically significant), EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Vaccine exposure during pregnancy), REDUCED FACIAL EXPRESSION (face feels tight), FLUSHING (flushed), MYALGIA (body ache) and PYREXIA (fever of 103.0). The patient received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) beginning around the  fourth week of the pregnancy.  At the time of the report, SHOCK (body shocks), EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Vaccine exposure during pregnancy), REDUCED FACIAL EXPRESSION (face feels tight), FLUSHING (flushed), MYALGIA (body ache) and PYREXIA (fever of 103.0) outcome was unknown.            Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not Applicable.

Fever persisted for approximately 12 hours, despite taking an over the counter fever reducer.  After this, I developed nausea and was unable to eat much for approximately 4-5 days. Being worried that I had contracted COVID before the vaccine, I got a rapid test the day after symptoms began. The COVID test came back negative. On Friday I developed a red, stinging, itching rash on the injection arm. The rash lasted for several days. During this time I also developed joint pain and fatigue. An abnormal amount of fatigue lasted more than a week after the vaccine.

                                                Arm pain, arm swelling, bruising at the site of the injection, loss of grip strength in injection arm, all within 10 minutes of vaccination. Within a few hours, tiredness set in, additional loss of grip strength in both hands, but especially in the arm that received the vaccination. 9 hours after the shot, severe fatigue set in, as well as hot and cold flashes, switching between fever and chills, headache, excessive sweating, weakness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, body aches, skin pain, and flare-ups of old injuries. I woke with tremendous, debilitating neck pain as well, which was the site of previous whiplash injuries, in both my neck and lower back, and my knees hurt as well. Woke every hour or so throughout the night, severe symptoms. By the next morning after the shot, the fever and chills had stopped, as well as the nausea and vomiting. Fatigue remained, headache on and off, and body aches. By day 3 most symptoms had gone away except for tiredness. By day 4 I started to notice sun sensitivity, and on day 6 have developed what seems to be a heat rash? My forearms are hot, red, sensitive, and reactive as well. Every day since the shot I have gotten tired in the afternoon as well, even if earlier in the day I felt OK. Have had mild shortness of breath in addition, but nothing that has stopped me from regular activity. As a 25 year old, I experienced incredibly severe symptoms, and this was my first shot of Moderna. No known previous exposure to Covid, either. Noticed that symptoms started worsening rapidly around 6 p.m. the day of my shot after taking my borth control pill as well. Wondering if related, or possibly coincidence.

                                                Around after the 2nd week of having the vaccine, I started to develop joint pain. Bones cracked more often and it hurt to walk a bit. This  joint pain then resulted in tingling in my hands, which made my arm feel weird. Almost numb. Sometimes my face feels a bit numb too. My heart rate was elevated.

She went on to have typical side effects (fever, muscle pain, injection site reaction) over the past 3 days, However today when she presented at the pharmacy she said the reaction in her left arm where the vaccine was given had continued to grow worse. She described it as hot, painful and hard to the touch, She also relayed she had been experiencing significant muscle pain only in that arm (the entire arm) as well as some numbness in her left hand and wrist. She did indicate she had previously had an issue with numbness that had since resolved and could not say definitely it was related to the vaccination.

Patient noticed central chest pain on the second night after the vaccine as well as vague flu like symptoms, bone pain, fatigue and stomach ache. Symptoms all resolved shortly after 2am and have not returned today. Patient recently had covid back in March. Suspect over-reaction to vaccination due to remaining antibodies from recent covid infection. Chest pain likely pleurisy due to location indicated and stable vital signs and no cardiac risk.

According to patient&#39;s husband she has no significant past medical history but has ?passed out? with vaccines.  No reaction noted with her first COVID vaccine.  Approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection today she told her husband that she wasn?t feeling well.  She said was light headed and nauseated.  Patient then proceeded to become nonresponsive.  Her eyes deviated upward and her whole body became stiff.  Her skin had notable pallor.  She was lowered to the ground by staff, myself, and her husband, and put in a supine position with her legs elevated.  911 was called. This episode lasted approximately 40-60 seconds when she became responsive and cried out for husband.  Her muscles relaxed and she became notably upset.  She kept saying she wasn?t able to see or feel her extremities.  Her lack of vision resolved within 10-15 seconds. She had weakness in her arms and legs but was able to squeeze her hands on command.  She was alert and oriented X3.  BP was 130/90.  The patient was stable when the ambulance arrived to transport her to Hospital.

I took acetaminophen round the clock but still felt uncomfortably hot all day.  I had severe fatigue most of the day and slept or laid in bed. My body ached especially at the injection site and at times it felt like my hand was in pain on that arm. I had brain fog as well.   Today is Day 3 and I have so much pain at injection site it was sometimes hard to sleep. It feels almost intramuscular and my pain from the first dose went away after Day 2 and the site mostly just felt sore.  I have also experience nausea and drainage in my nose. I?m tired today but less so than Day 2. I am still a little foggy in my brain and my neck hurts quite a bit.
