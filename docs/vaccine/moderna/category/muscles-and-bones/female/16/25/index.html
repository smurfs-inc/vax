Rash described as &#34;traveling across chest&#34; and similar to what happens when she takes prednisone. Stated she has not taken prednisone for over a year. Client stated that rash did not appear anywhere else on her body. Itchiness was experienced on chest and arms only.  Client also stated symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness,  and &#34;super sore arm&#34; that lasted from day of vaccination until 1/10/2021. Client also reported a headache that lasted 2 day after vaccination. She contacted her provider on 1/7/2021 and, per provider&#39;s instruction, took 1 tablet of Benadryl. Client was unsure of dosage of Benadryl. On the morning of  1/8/2021 she took a second tablet of Benadryl and reported that her rash resolved after the second dose of Benadryl. Her itchiness resolved the morning of 1/9/2021. Stated that her Doctor did not specify a diagnosis but did state to hold off on the second dose of this vaccine.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                My arm became incredibly sore within an hour. I woke up in the middle of the night aching like I had the flu. The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

I became pale, had fatigue, headache, stomach ache, and the arm i recieved the vaccine in was sore to the point I couldn&#39;t hardly move it. These side effects lasted until 12/25/2020. I had no fever and after the 25th I felt fine.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

Patient presents on 1/27/2021 after onset of pain, decreased ROM ongoing since administration.  I was able to visualize ecchymotic area where vaccine was administered and patient has photo evidence.  The physician responsible for the vaccine administration needs to be retrained on where to give deltoid muscle IM injections and to avoid the extremities where recent surgeries occurred (patient had right shoulder labrum repair in October 2020)

Around 7pm i felt dizzy and chilly, at 1am i threw up and had very bad chills and was still sore, at 7am the next morning i realized my vaccine site was swollen and bruised and felt like a large lump, the skin was rough and very hot to the touch. over the next day i had rolling headaches and nausea and it was difficult to move without pain in my extremities, this started to lessen over the next days but my arm is still swollen, hot, lumped, and painful.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

                                                I got up to use the bathroom at 4:30 this morning. I was extremely shaky but made it. I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

My chest felt heavy and I was having labored breathing, My heart was racing at 160bpm and my blood pressure was 180/90, both of which are very high and abnormal for me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                Approximately 2 hours after the vaccine, I developed severe pain to the injection site and arm. Inability to lift arm. I had severe night sweats that night, but no fever.  Now it is day 3 post vaccine and I have a severe headache causing dizziness and nausea.

                                                Axillary pain started on day 4 (1/4) after vaccine and continued until day 7 which was so bad I could not sleep or move that arm. Took 1 Aleve for the pain. Then on day 7 axillary pain went away and a rash started to form on arm where vaccine was given. Day 8 rash spread at was bright red. Around noon on day 8  hives popped up next to left eye. On day 8 did a virtual doctor appointment and the NP prescribed antibiotics because she said the &#34;rash&#34; is cellulitis.  At this time took zytec to help with the hives.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly. By 06:30 AM on 1/7/2020, the lump had mostly gone down in size significantly, the dull ache had subsided completely, the redness had gone away. By 1/8/2020, 10:00 PM, the lump and swelling are gone, no ache, no itch, still a slight discoloration where lump was.

I have been taking photos and making the site.  The area inside the ring is warmer compared to my other deltoid on the right side. I am schedule for the next vaccine on the 1/26/21.  I just wanted to make sure I would still qualify to get the second dose/ safe? I can send pictures as well. I just wasn&#39;t able to attach an image.

                                                Gradual onset of soreness beginning about an hour post-vaccine and worsening throughout day. By the evening, left arm pain was too uncomfortable to wash dishes and lift household objects. Pain woke me up at 3am that night and I could not push the covers off of me, dress or undress, and I experienced severe pain with slight movement (7/10). Nausea and cold sweats began around 5am and lasted for 45min. I contacted the nurse via messaging system and was told to take OTC nausea medicine and Tylenol. I took the maximum dosage for Tylenol that day but could not do my normal school functions. The next day I was still limited by pain but did not require medication to cope. By day three, I had full range of motion back and minimal pain. Day four I am back to exercising normally.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

It is now Friday and I am still having very bad joint and muscle pain when I walk and move and still have a headache and fatigue/weakness.

                                                Starting 3 days ago (approximately 10 days after vaccine) I started having muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was given in similar to the soreness right after the vaccine was given.  A few hours after the soreness was noticed I noticed red-raised hives in the injection site. Over all symptoms (soreness to touch same as the soreness right after vaccine was given, itching, redness, raised hives, and warm to touch in the area of redness). The next day the symptoms remained about the same but area of raised-red-hives now seems to be a more defined 4-5 inch long red oval in the area the vaccine was given. 3rd day redness seemed lighter in color but still a pretty defined oval with warmness to touch the soreness was a little better by the 3rd day. I started taking Amoxicillin 500 mg that I had at home on the 3rd day. Today, 4th day, overall seems to be getting better still some soreness, still a red oval but is getting lighter, still soreness but defiantly better than it was. My doctor had me start Keflex 500 mg Q 6 hours for 7 days I started taking that today.

                                                Twitching of the face; Syncope; Weakness; A spontaneous report was received from a pharmacy intern, concerning a 23-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced syncope, weakness, and twitching of the face.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine I felt fine. Around 7 pm that night I began having body aches that continually worsened throughout the night. At 2 am on Saturday I took my temperature and it was 101.6 F, at 3 am it was 102 F. The body aches, joint pain, fever, and headache continued through the next day until about 6 pm on Saturday. Also on Saturday around 12 pm I began experiencing severe nausea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. At one point it felt as if I was going to pass out. All the major symptoms finally subsided Saturday night around 6 pm. Saturday till Sunday I have felt fatigued and sore but otherwise fine.

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                When I was eating chips I wanted to lick my fingers and my mouth felt funny. I looked in the mirror and my face looked fine. The following day I noticed half of my face was paralyzed and I went to urgent care. The Dr. diagnosed me with Bells Palsy and put me on antibiotics for 10days. I asked for more because it wasn&#39;t healing, but hey didn&#39;t me anymore. Maybe a week after I did a phone visit and asked If I should get more medicine and they said no. Maybe a week ago from today 1/27/21 I seen my PCP and she contacted the Neurology department at medical center regarding  my situation. After about 3 weeks of having this im about 90% better.

Flu like symptoms starting that evening (unsure what time, as I was trying to sleep). Arm soreness where I received the vaccine, muscle aches that kept waking me up throughout the night, headache, fever, slight congestion, chills and sweating, nausea, dizziness when I stand up, fatigue.

I felt cold and feverish though did not have a fever. Took 1 g of Tylenol which helped chills and muscle aches. This morning (next day) I am still having muscle soreness so I will probably take another 1 g of Tylenol.

It was also incredibly painful,  such as when my shirt was just resting on it, as shirts do. This lasted for 2 days and it still has some redness and sensitivity. The joints on my hands and wrist also became swollen and incredibly sore, and this has still not gone away.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? The day I got the vaccine all that happened was a dead arm and then when I was driving home after the 15 minutes of waiting in the parking lot, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, but it didn&#39;t last very long. The next day my arm was sore to move, but not at the injection spot, if looking at my arm (someone else) it was down 3 inches and to the left about 1 inch. The next day that same spot was still sore but to the touch, then it went away.    What is more interesting and concerning is that on 1/6/2021 (a week after I got the shot), I noticed 3 little bumps on my arm (9:45pm), in that same location that was sore to move and touch on day 2 and 3 but they also were itchy. When I woke up the next morning (6:15 am) the area had spread to the size of my palm (3 inch by 3 inch roughly)  it was all red, hard to the touch,  stilly itchy and I had the feeling of a dead arm again. One of the nurses at my work drew a circle around the red spot so we could watch to see if it was still growing , by roughly 11:45 am it had grown an additional 2 inches.

                                                A few hours after the shot my left arm was VERY sore.  It felt as if someone had hit me with a metal rod. I started to feel chills and back pain around 7 pm.  Throughout the night my arm was throbbing and I had a hard time sleeping. I woke up around 12 am to use the restroom. My body felt VERY heavy and weak. I woke up today (1 day after the shot) and felt better.  However, my arm still has severe pain and I experiencing fatigue. I also feel like the back pain goes in and out.

However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

My symptoms stopped about 12/13 hours later.  Symptoms felt very similar to the flu.

                                                I walked in to received my first dose of the Moderna Covid19 vaccine at approx 12:20pm 1/7/21. The RN who was giving me my injection palpated the top of my shoulder and NOT my acromian process and administered the injection closer to the top of my shoulder, the vaccine did initially hurt more than a typical vaccine would when it was being administered but i thought that might have been normal. Approximately 1hr after receiving the vaccine my left shoulder joint started to have this pinching sensation in the anterior joint when I would raise my arm forward. The pain got progressively worse throughout the day with significantly decreased range of motion in that shoulder and significant pain in my shoulder joint. The pain was so bad it actually kept me from sleeping that night. I never had any muscular pain or any other symptoms beside the joint pain, which was alarming since it should have been administered into the muscle. I believe the vaccine my have been incorrectly injected into the shoulder joint or potentially a smaller muscle in the shoulder. The pain and decrease ROM is preventing me from doing most of my regular day to day activities. Today 1/9/21 has been a full 48hrs after receiving the vaccine and the joint pain has not gotten any better and my range of motion is still significantly decreased, which would prevent me from performing my tasks as an RN.

Unsure of exact vaccination date and onset of symptoms.  really having to focus to place hands under water to wash them, walking through doors without bumping into them, turning on faucet, getting dressed; left hand is worse than right and not able to easily align things properly;  &#34;feels like her brain isn&#39;t doing what she&#39;s telling it to do&#34;.  Aunt said the symptoms are not improving. Patient had tested negative for Covid the day she got the vaccine.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

                                                Arm became incredibly sore about 4 hours after injection.  The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included gluten allergy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included ethinylestradiol/ ferrous fumarate/ norethindrone acetate.   On 06 Jan 2021 at 10:30am, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient became very nauseous through 08 Jan 2021.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient started having neurological symptoms. She started having headaches, dizziness, difficulty with coordination and balance, and vision changes in the left eye (not specified). She reported that she had a &#34;drift&#34; in the left arm and described it as &#34;when you try to manipulate the arm, but it does not go where you want it to go&#34;.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient still had neurological symptoms, issues moving left arm, colliding with objects all day, and issues going through daily routine.  On 12 Jan 2021, the patient was seen by a neurologist and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) was scheduled. The MRI revealed inflammation, and brain bleed and swelling. The patient was sent to the emergency room and admitted on 19 Jan 2021.  Treatment for the events included calcium carbonate for nausea, ibuprofen for headaches and diphenhydramine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The event, very nauseous, was considered resolved on 08 Jan 2021. The events, neurological symptoms, headaches, dizziness, difficulty with coordination, difficulty with balance, vision changes in left eye, drift in left arm and issues going through daily routine, confusion, and brain bleed were considered not resolved.   Follow-up received on 23 Jan 2021 included patient details, medical history, lab tests, concomitant medications, hospitalization, and updated events.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a female patient, who experienced a non-serious unexpected event of dizziness, coordination abnormal, balance disorder, visual impairment, movement disorder, loss of personal independence in daily activities, and neurological symptom, and non-serious expected event of nausea, and headaches. The events of nausea occurred 1 day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown. The event of neurological symptoms, dizziness, coordination abnormal, balance disorder, visual impairment, loss of personal independence in daily activities, and movement disorder occurred 3 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown. Treatment for the events included, Tums, nauseam, ibuprofen and Benadryl. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  On 21 Jan 2021, approximately two hours prior to the start of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 032L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Approximately two hours after receiving the vaccine at 12:30 pm, the patient experienced heavy feeling in her neck and face area that hurt really bad. Later, she noticed numbness in her hands and feet. Slurred speech was reported from a bystander. By 3:30pm, the patient was completely paralyzed on her right side. She was taken to the hospital, and a code stroke was initiated; however, all labs were normal.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient was still paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, had shooting pain feeling, and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly. The doctors planned to discharge her on the next day to a rehab center because she could not function alone.  Treatment for the event included pain medication and hospitalization.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly, unable to walk and shooting pain feelings were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 25-year-old, female, patient, who experienced heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly and shooting pain feelings.
