Rash described as &#34;traveling across chest&#34; and similar to what happens when she takes prednisone. Stated she has not taken prednisone for over a year. Client stated that rash did not appear anywhere else on her body. Itchiness was experienced on chest and arms only.  Client also stated symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness,  and &#34;super sore arm&#34; that lasted from day of vaccination until 1/10/2021. Client also reported a headache that lasted 2 day after vaccination. She contacted her provider on 1/7/2021 and, per provider&#39;s instruction, took 1 tablet of Benadryl. Client was unsure of dosage of Benadryl. On the morning of  1/8/2021 she took a second tablet of Benadryl and reported that her rash resolved after the second dose of Benadryl. Her itchiness resolved the morning of 1/9/2021. Stated that her Doctor did not specify a diagnosis but did state to hold off on the second dose of this vaccine.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                For my first dose, I had quite mild symptoms. I woke up with a migraine the next morning and some soreness at the injection site. Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

                                                My arm became incredibly sore within an hour. I woke up in the middle of the night aching like I had the flu. The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

Dr. was updated  and we had orders for close monitoring, the next day when she got up, her leg appeared better, and she had passed a small BM, but by lunch she had developed significant pain and edema in her left leg, and the color of her leg was reddened again.  She was sent to the emergency room with  her symptoms.   She was admitted back to our facility  yesterday, her diagnoses included Acute provoked left external illiac, femoral, popliteal, and peroneal DVT.  Elevated Factor II levels, Elevated APC resistant, May-Thurner Syndrome, history of developmental disabilities, fecal impaction and urinary retention - suspected related to her fecal impaction.  Vascular surgery was consulted,  and pt. was  started on a heparin drip, and mechanical thrombectomy was needed for both legs due to multiple clots.  She was started on Eliquis and Plavix, and thigh high compression stockings were ordered, ace wraps being used until these are supplied.  Her Fecal impaction was addressed also and the urinary retention resolved.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

I have never before had a swollen lymph node in either axillary regions of my arm. It was very painful, I could barely put my arm down because of the pressure of it pressing against the side of my body at rest. It has gotten better, there isn?t as much pain but it is still uncomfortable. The lymph node was/is palpable, and hurt upon touch and rest. The pain was an 7/10, but has now gone down to a 2/10. My arm is also still sore from the injection site, but it is not bad.

So far this whole next day my arm is still very sore, my whole body aches, and I have had a headache all day.

On 3/12/21, she started feeling jaw pain on same side of injection and shoulder pain intensified plus numbness.  Patient says the pain and numbness  comes and goes. She is due for her next  dose on Saturday, March 28 but decided to wait  a little bit longer before she gets her second dose.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:50pm on 01/25/2021. Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

The injection site was swollen and red in addition to general muscle pain from the shot.  This continued until about 48 hours after the vaccination.

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

Vaccine administration proceeded without complication. Shortly after receiving vaccination, while the patient was in the waiting room during observation she stated that her chest was feeling tight and her heart was racing. Pharmacist brought her back into clinic room so she could breath freely without her mask and take a puff of her proair inhaler. After 5-10 minutes, she stated that her chest was still tight and her back hurt. Family members were called to take her home/to ER. She did not want to wait so a store employee drover her to patient&#39;s preferred emergency room for a breathing treatment.

I slept with my mom in fear of having episode again. Around 2:45 am, my mom woke to me shaking like I was having a seizure. it lasted about 30 secs. she called 911 and i was checked out by paramedics, who said my vitals were fine and I should flollow up with medical care. My mom and I agreed that perhaps I needed stress dosing of Cortef. I took stress dosage and have been taking stress dosage all day and so far no more episodes.  Now waiting for Doctor to call me back and advise.

I woke up and could barely move my arm, and throughout the day I got progressively more fatigued. By the next night, I had a low-grade fever and had extreme all-over body soreness. It felt like I had the flu. By morning, I was feeling a bit better and got progressively better. The next day (2.5 days after the vaccine), I was feeling better other than some soreness in my injection site.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the event, I had throat swelling, chills, sweats, temperature of 102.5, headache, muscle soreness, dizziness, lightheadedness. Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

Upon calling the health center, they said that I may have eaten something bad. Around 6pm the same day, I started sweating but I was freezing, and had a headache and muscle pain. I had a 101 fever and that persisted until the next day (3/24/21). It is currently (3/24/21) and I have noticed sharp chest pains on the right side of my chest throughout the day, especially when exerting forces breathing (such as riding my bike or walking up stairs, or getting into and out of bed). I still have a slight fever and feel very cold, but I in fact, still have a slight fever of 100.4

                                                First day I had immediate swelling at the injection site, red circle form around the site of injection following up with an itch that lasted for 3 days. Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

Within the next hour, my jaw began to lock and my throat began to burn/tighten. Within this timespan, my body, especially my back began to ache as well as my chest feeling tight.  After three hours, I went to the on-campus clinic and they gave me 50mg of Benadryl.

I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

PCH EH sent CG to WorkMed and CG was given Rx for Keflex which was completed on 01/07/2021--CG stated symptoms are greatly improve.

My chest felt heavy and I was having labored breathing, My heart was racing at 160bpm and my blood pressure was 180/90, both of which are very high and abnormal for me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

                                                On the first day i felt my nerves shoot up into my neck. Got stiff neck and back 3 days after the vaccine. The stiffness turned into nerve problems and I felt hot and tingly on my neck, back and head for several days. 8 days later from the vaccination day i got a huge rash on my left arm. On top of that my armpit area was severely sore . Soreness and pain from the arm continued 2 weeks later.

At work (noon), suddenly became very lightheaded, cold, sweaty,  experienced blackout vision around periphery and felt faint and nauseous. Threw up. Went home and had extreme chills and could not get warm. Nausea subsided around 6:00pm 1/27. Headache and neck soreness continues still today (1/30). Headache feels like pressure inside my head, pushing and causing dull pain at the base of my skull and top of neck.

A concerning side effect was that my resting HR was consistently above 105BPM from about 4:30AM-4PM the day after receiving the second dose. It reached as high as 125BPM without doing much movement at all to account for the high HR.

At that time, she experienced muscle pain for a day or two then it subsided. When she awoke today (2/2/21), she felt a lump at the injection site. Throughout the day, she said it grew larger and more painful. She said it is now swollen and red and larger than the morning. I advised her to call her doctor to get it checked out and to report and adverse events to the website (which I provided to her).

Day 11 after the vaccine, I noticed a red, asymptomatic ring around the injection site. I have never had a reaction to any vaccine or shot before. In total, I experienced fever, sore throat, muscle weakness, fatigue for 4 days after the symptoms started.

This lump went away after some time on its own.   Today, 02/06/21, the itchiness and pain returned, and what looked like a ?ridge? shape under my skin appeared on my arm at the site where the shot was administered.  It?s just bothersome but doesn?t impair my regular functionality. I intend to take a Benadryl and stay hydrated. Noticed I?ve been excessively thirsty today, much more than usual.

                                                Moderate headache, fever, myalgia. The latter two lasted 2 days after vaccine, the headache lasted about 2.5 days after vaccine. I was back to normal after the weekend (about 3 days later). Some mild fatigue and feeling ?off? occurred as well during that 2.5 day period. Took some ibuprofen and that helped a little bit, otherwise just took it easy and recovered pretty quickly (relatively).

Patient was monitored for 30 minutes and assessed before departure.

As the day has gone on, my arm has become swollen around the injection site, has become more sore, and it hot to the touch. There is no rash. The soreness/pain radiates down my arm and up my shoulder.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Pollen allergy (environmental allergy) and Dust allergy (environmental allergy). Concomitant products included CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]), FEXOFENADINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ALLEGRA) and CLARITHROMYCIN (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN]) for Allergy, MONTELUKAST for Asthma, COLECALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) for Supplementation therapy.   On 23-Apr-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) at an unspecified dose. On 24-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainted) (seriousness criterion medically significant), THIRST (Thirsty), TREMOR (Shaking), PALLOR (Look pale), HYPOTENSION (Hypotension), MYALGIA (Arm soreness), NAUSEA (Nausea), CHILLS (CHILLS) and PYREXIA (Fever). On 24-Apr-2021, SYNCOPE (Fainted), TREMOR (Shaking), PALLOR (Look pale) and HYPOTENSION (Hypotension) had resolved. At the time of the report, THIRST (Thirsty), MYALGIA (Arm soreness), NAUSEA (Nausea), CHILLS (CHILLS) and PYREXIA (Fever) outcome was unknown.   The action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.  The treatment medications included Tylenol (paracetamol) and Advil (Ibuprofen).

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                Axillary pain started on day 4 (1/4) after vaccine and continued until day 7 which was so bad I could not sleep or move that arm. Took 1 Aleve for the pain. Then on day 7 axillary pain went away and a rash started to form on arm where vaccine was given. Day 8 rash spread at was bright red. Around noon on day 8  hives popped up next to left eye. On day 8 did a virtual doctor appointment and the NP prescribed antibiotics because she said the &#34;rash&#34; is cellulitis.  At this time took zytec to help with the hives.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

                                                On 1/4/2020 at roughly 07:00 PM, a dull ache started in my right arm where the vaccine was injected, it radiated from my right shoulder, to my right shoulder blade. My arm felt very heavy. There was also a small hard lump beginning to form with a little heat at the injection site. I had difficulty sleeping due to the aching pain. On 1/5/2020, I woke up at 06:30 AM, the lump had grown in size, and was much more red and hot to the touch, in an oval shape. By roughly 11:30 AM same day, it began to itch, I had checked it and the lump had raised significantly. Hot to the touch. The dull ache had begun radiating into my right armpit as well as down to my right elbow. By 06:00 PM, same day, the aching had continued,  the lump was still very raised, itchy, red, and hot. It looked like a large hive. By 06:30 AM on 1/6/2020, the dull ache had mostly subsided, my shoulder blade still felt uncomfortable. The itching continued. The redness spread in size, however the swelling of the lump had gone down slightly. By 06:30 AM on 1/7/2020, the lump had mostly gone down in size significantly, the dull ache had subsided completely, the redness had gone away. By 1/8/2020, 10:00 PM, the lump and swelling are gone, no ache, no itch, still a slight discoloration where lump was.

I have been taking photos and making the site.  The area inside the ring is warmer compared to my other deltoid on the right side. I am schedule for the next vaccine on the 1/26/21.  I just wanted to make sure I would still qualify to get the second dose/ safe? I can send pictures as well. I just wasn&#39;t able to attach an image.

                                                A few hours after receiving the vaccine I had muscle soreness onset in L deltoid near site of injection. A few hours after that I had moderate soreness in L deltoid, down L arm (bicep/tricep), and up into L pec and trap. I had difficulty abducting L arm to 90 deg but was not hindered in normal movements. Approaching midnight that day the soreness was improving and by mid next day it was limited to L deltoid upon palpation. After 2-3 days soreness resolved. No other adverse effects noted.   I have had very minor muscle soreness to a few vaccinations before, but not this bad. In those cases it has been limited to site of injection (deltoid) and less severe. Usually I don&#39;t notice anything after injections and I&#39;ve never had any other adverse effects.

Now on 01/16/2021, I started getting a cough, a sore throat, a  fever, and extremely tired. Then the next day the symptoms got worse and now I had a stuffy nose, inner ear pain, nausea, muscle aches all over my body, dizzyness, and chills. This continued into Sunday and now Monday.

                                                Following the second phase around 5pm the intense feeling being extremely cold and despite being under 4 covers and a heated blanket I did not find relief. At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                The day of the vaccine about 4 hours later, I started experiencing chest pain. It was not tightness or a heartburn feeling type of chest pain. I have asthma, and it is the type of chest pain I start feeling right before I get bronchitis, almost like breathing in mist and the irritation that comes from having a cough, but I had not had a cough that would have caused this sensation. The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection. Ibuprofen helps the headache slightly but makes the pressure in my head feel worse and makes the joints in my hands and forearms hurt and my fingers swell for some reason which has never happened before for me when taking ibuprofen.

At 10:30pm began to feel chills and body aches. 11:00pm  got very hot and sweaty, hands began to tingle, vision became fuzzy around the edges, felt like I was going to pass out. Experienced tachycardia, tachypnea, and headache. 12:20am- vomited. Restless sleep through the night, chills, fever (100.6-99.6 on Tylenol), body aches, joint pain, stomach ache, woke at 5:00am.  1/26- spent all day vomiting. At least once every hour. Continued tachycardia, tachypnea, stomach ache,  fever, headache, body aches,  and joint pain. At 7:00pm took Zofran and I stopped vomiting. Still nauseous. Could not eat all day.  1/27- woke up with headache and slight body aches but otherwise felt okay during the day. Was hungry and able to eat. Starting at 10:00pm my stomach began to hurt again. Experienced bloating, sharp stabbing pain and nausea. Felt like I needed to vomit or pass a bowel movement but could not do either. Took Zofran at 11:00pm, did not help in relieving my GI symptoms. Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

                                                Starting 3 days ago (approximately 10 days after vaccine) I started having muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was given in similar to the soreness right after the vaccine was given.  A few hours after the soreness was noticed I noticed red-raised hives in the injection site. Over all symptoms (soreness to touch same as the soreness right after vaccine was given, itching, redness, raised hives, and warm to touch in the area of redness). The next day the symptoms remained about the same but area of raised-red-hives now seems to be a more defined 4-5 inch long red oval in the area the vaccine was given. 3rd day redness seemed lighter in color but still a pretty defined oval with warmness to touch the soreness was a little better by the 3rd day. I started taking Amoxicillin 500 mg that I had at home on the 3rd day. Today, 4th day, overall seems to be getting better still some soreness, still a red oval but is getting lighter, still soreness but defiantly better than it was. My doctor had me start Keflex 500 mg Q 6 hours for 7 days I started taking that today.

                                                Moderate pain in injection site for first two days (02/02/2021, 02/03/2021). Nausea, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat, low-grade fever (~99°F) and persistent headache, and took Theraflu nighttime before bed on day two (02/03/2021). Temperature of 99.7°F throughout day three (02/04/2021); also, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat with swollen lymph nodes and tonsils with white spots (did at-home test for strep-A, got a negative result), and persistent headache?this night I also took Theraflu nighttime. Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

After 2nd shot on 02/06/21, I had most symptoms listed. I got the 2nd dose at 9:03am and once I woke up from a nap at 1pm, most of the side effects had already started. I had severe pain at the injection site where I was unable to dress myself or do normal activities, severe muscle pain and soreness, severe chills, a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a mild headache, severe dehydration that remained throughout the day and night even though I drank almost 2 gallons of water, stomach pain and bloating, and nausea and vomiting that occurred in the middle of the night at 2am, and extreme fatigue. Even though I had fatigue, I was unable to sleep due to the pain. I finally took pain medicine at 8am on 2/07/21 to help myself go to sleep as well since I was awake for over 24 hours. I slept for 6 hours and woke up still having chills, muscle soreness, a slight fever, a mild headache, and pain at the injection site where I am still unable to lift my left arm and put clothes on.

                                                Joint pain and cracking at shoulder lasting a whole week now. After receiving my injection, I noticed that it was given very high up on my arm, just barely 1 finger width&#39;s away from my shoulder joint. As a healthcare provider myself, I know to be aware not to administer too high as this can result in shoulder injury. I unfortunately seem to have encountered this firsthand myself. I wanted to wait a week hoping the pain would go away, but it is still there even after a week. It was severe pain starting about 36 hours after receiving the shot, then for two more days, the pain was about 8/10. The pain has become less severe over time, but I am unable to use my left arm to the same capacity anymore due to this constant shoulder joint pain. Prior to this, I have never had any shoulder pain.

The whole arm was swollen for three or four days. There is still a mark on my arm with a shadow of the bruise.  General fatigue and muscle soreness in arm which radiated into my back.  Lingering weakness in my arm and pain on movement.  I took Ibuprofen and used ice.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

                                                Injection site pain, headache, and muscle pain. Muscle pain was mainly in the shoulders (more on the side of the injection), lower back, and in the legs. Lasted through the night and took a Tylenol 500mg tablet that next morning (3/18). Symptoms improved slightly, but did not got away and got a little worse as the day progressed (but still improved from the morning). Took another Tylenol that evening, felt better by bedtime, and feel much better today (3/19). Still have some arm soreness when I lift the arm my injection was placed in, but not too bad.

The next morning, I had a severe tightening of the left side of my neck and shoulder, along with arm soreness. I saw my Physical Therapist and was told that it was a result of the vaccine. I was fine until I got the vertigo Friday evening. It came on really quickly and I&#39;ve never experienced it before. I was okay the next morning with the exception of a headache, which lasted for about a month after that. My doctor offered shots for them, but I couldn&#39;t take them due to my current meds. I was told to come back if they continue.

Muscle stiffness - started an hour after vaccine and lasted about 48 hours, no pain medication or stretching helped, caused sleep issues due to not being able to get comfortable. Difficulty breathing - chest felt tight and felt like I wasn&#39;t getting enough oxygen in each breath so I had to pause to take deeper breaths.

Around lunch today (01/04/21) I was moving my neck around and when I move it to the left it rolls over something. I began to feel around the area and noticed that where the sore area is I have a rather large knot. It is a hard knot that is very tender and sore. No other signs and symptoms present. I have not been to a doctor or clinic regarding the issue. I was unsure if this issue was directly related with the vaccine or not.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

At 2 am on Saturday I took my temperature and it was 101.6 F, at 3 am it was 102 F. The body aches, joint pain, fever, and headache continued through the next day until about 6 pm on Saturday. Also on Saturday around 12 pm I began experiencing severe nausea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. At one point it felt as if I was going to pass out. All the major symptoms finally subsided Saturday night around 6 pm. Saturday till Sunday I have felt fatigued and sore but otherwise fine.

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

In the morning the swelling and chills were gone, and I had a really stiff upper shoulder and up to my neck. I feel totally fine the next morning, but concerned about a worse reaction to the second shot.

                                                With the second dose I felt arm pain at the injection site and muscle pains, my whole body was aching, specially my arms, both of them. My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

Symptoms began 48 hours after the injection of the second dose.  There has also been nerve problems in the left arm starting on 1/27, about 22 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine taken on 1/5, in the left arm. Loss of motor function and clawing of the fourth and fifth finger resulted in the left hand. As of 2/1 motor function returned, however forth and fifth fingers are still not able to enforce resistance against external pressure. The lot number of the first dose is #025J20-2A

                                                I got the first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 3pm 1/13/21. I was fine for the 30 minutes after, not even sore at the injection site.  Around 6pm, my muscles started aching, but not painful enough to be concerned.  At 3am 1/14/21, I woke up in pain in every muscle. Enough to wake me, but not terrible.  At 7am, I noticed a pinpoint pain in my armpit, and my muscles still ached.  At 9:30am, I took ibuprofen to attempt to curb the pain a bit.  Around 10am, it got so painful I was limping, and having trouble bending down or reaching above shoulder height.  At 11:30am, I noticed the pinpoint pain in my armpit had gotten worse, and there is a hard, approximately quarter-sized round lump in this spot. Very painful.  At 2:30, I went to move my shirt sleeve and the pain at the injection site was so intense I screamed when I touched it.  This pain continued until 1/16/21 when I woke up feeling entirely normal.  Since 1/16/2021, my hands have been randomly stiffening, either completely stretched out and dropping anything in them, or closing tight enough to leave fingernail marks on my palms. I will also reach to grab things and my hands will sometimes bend into odd shapes, instead of what I intended for them to do. This began at 1-2 times a day, and is becoming more often. It is now up to 2-4 times daily.

Normal for me is between 80-100 bpm. My heart rate remained high (between 120-140 bpm) for about 6 hours. I did not notice it go down to 100bpm until the next day. The high heart rate was never provoked by any physical activity. I rested in bed or in a chair all day and drank lots of water. Throughout the day I had fluctuating periods of feeling very hot and very cold. I took 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 hours throughout the day.  I also experienced expected side effects (chills, joint aches, muscle aches, nausea, headache, fever (100F w/ Tylenol)).

                                                The first vaccine I only had mild arm pain which went away after a few days, exactly 7 days later I had a delayed localized reaction (extreme swelling size of a golf ball, redness, itching, hot to the touch). I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. I am currently experiencing redness the size of a silver dollar on and around the area of where my injection was. Also I am experiencing heat coming off the red area and itchiness. Also there are times where my forearm feels as though the blood flow is being constrained. This has been happening already for over 8 days and am concerned because it is not going away.

Pain worsened over the next 24 hours but was assuaged using 1000 mg Tylenol.  During this time, injection site was also painful and swollen. These side effects subsided by the morning of 3/7/2021. On the morning of 3/7/2021 injection  site pain also lessened and a minor red rash appeared around the site and is still present to current time (3:00pm on 3/7/2021). Rash is itchy if touched.

Then later in the evening at around 4 pm began feeling muscle spasms in my chest and abdomen area which I had not experienced before, so around 7:30pm I went to the hospital for treatment and was given ibuprofen again and also a lidocaine cocktail which relieved my symptoms.

                                                I have had floaters in my eyes since the vaccine. I started to use  refreshing eye drops on Saturday March 13. I am not sure if the acne cream got in my eye the night before the vaccine. it is called Retin A cream 0.025%. I have also been feeling very weak. I got a B12 injection on my butt for energy(Friday, march 12). My legs feel like they are in pain and the hurt when I walk. I also had a lot of pelvic pain after the vitamin injection. I drank ibuprofen March 14 at night. I woke up feeling very weak. Before going to bed on March 15 I drank Tylenol. I still feel pain in my legs today and now I have lower back pain.

                                                No side effects from first dose of vaccine. Many side effects from second dose. Once second dose was administered, arm immediately became sore. This progressively got worse during the day, including a hard lump and was itchy. Approx. 6 hours later, I became fatigued and had body aches all over. At 30 hours post second vaccine, I started to run a temperature. It got up to 101.5 F, I took Tylenol and went to sleep. By the morning, it was gone. The next 2 days, I had a headache and very sore arm. On day 3 I developed a very sore armpit/under arm area on the same arm as I received the vaccine. As I&#39;m writing this (4 days later), my arm is still sore &amp; itchy and my underarm area is still sore, but no fatigue or fever.

                                                Mild muscle soreness in right arm (injection site) beginning within an hour post-injection, noticeable with movement. Took 400mg of ibuprofen before bed.  At 10.5 hours post-injection (middle of night), right arm soreness was moderate-to-severe at rest and severe, almost unbearable, with movement. Mild muscle soreness and joint pain were present throughout the body; joint pain (wrist, elbows, and knees) was an issue prior to injection and was exacerbated during the event.  I also experienced chills and sharp headache pains. Took 400mg of ibuprofen, 1000mg of acetaminophen, and secured right arm with a pillow, which allowed me to fall back asleep.   At 17.5 hours (following morning), muscle soreness was present in right arm alone and was mild at rest, moderate with movement. All other symptoms were gone. Experienced fatigue that afternoon (approx. 24 hours post-injection), treated effectively with a short nap and vitamin D (through sun exposure).  On the 2nd full day post-injection, right arm muscle soreness is minimal with movement.

                                                Arm pain throughout the day that worsened (couldn?t lift up arm past 45 degrees)  and at night I had muscle aches all over my body. I felt cold and feverish though did not have a fever. Took 1 g of Tylenol which helped chills and muscle aches. This morning (next day) I am still having muscle soreness so I will probably take another 1 g of Tylenol.

It was also incredibly painful,  such as when my shirt was just resting on it, as shirts do. This lasted for 2 days and it still has some redness and sensitivity. The joints on my hands and wrist also became swollen and incredibly sore, and this has still not gone away.

Raised, warm to touch, itchy.  at time of reporting, approx 12 hrs later, there is minimal improvement. Took 1 benadryl at 2330 on 1/5. Mild discomfort and tingling throughout triceps on rt arm.  I did not experience any side effects other than injection site soreness for 72 hrs after receiving the vaccine.

I started to feel chills and back pain around 7 pm.  Throughout the night my arm was throbbing and I had a hard time sleeping. I woke up around 12 am to use the restroom. My body felt VERY heavy and weak. I woke up today (1 day after the shot) and felt better.  However, my arm still has severe pain and I experiencing fatigue. I also feel like the back pain goes in and out.

However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

                                                Severe headache developed about 30min after administration. Relieved by sleep. Almost exactly 24hours later, around 2pm the day after administration, developed severe occipital h/a again with radiation down into neck. Mild chills, body aches, fatigue, and tachycardia about 28 hours after administration - duration about 5 hours. Again, around 2pm the second day after administration, developed the same occipital h/a and neck pain/stiffness as well as mild tachycardia.

                                                Starting at 9pm, I experienced chills, shaking, headache, wide spread muscle soreness, fast heart rate, and nausea. My temperature was 99.5 consistently throughout the night but did not exceed this number. I took Advil twice throughout the night which relieved some of the headache. My symptoms stopped about 12/13 hours later.  Symptoms felt very similar to the flu.

                                                I walked in to received my first dose of the Moderna Covid19 vaccine at approx 12:20pm 1/7/21. The RN who was giving me my injection palpated the top of my shoulder and NOT my acromian process and administered the injection closer to the top of my shoulder, the vaccine did initially hurt more than a typical vaccine would when it was being administered but i thought that might have been normal. Approximately 1hr after receiving the vaccine my left shoulder joint started to have this pinching sensation in the anterior joint when I would raise my arm forward. The pain got progressively worse throughout the day with significantly decreased range of motion in that shoulder and significant pain in my shoulder joint. The pain was so bad it actually kept me from sleeping that night. I never had any muscular pain or any other symptoms beside the joint pain, which was alarming since it should have been administered into the muscle. I believe the vaccine my have been incorrectly injected into the shoulder joint or potentially a smaller muscle in the shoulder. The pain and decrease ROM is preventing me from doing most of my regular day to day activities. Today 1/9/21 has been a full 48hrs after receiving the vaccine and the joint pain has not gotten any better and my range of motion is still significantly decreased, which would prevent me from performing my tasks as an RN.

                                                Arm became incredibly sore about 4 hours after injection.  The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

                                                By 3:30pm I had a fever and experienced arm soreness to my right arm. By 11:30pm I could not move my arm and also could not pick my son up who  weighs 30 pounds. On the following day I continued with severe  body aches  and joint pain. I went to see a doctor about 10:00am who examined me and advised my to take Tylenol and Ibuprofen  for pain.  They did a Covid-19 swab which as negative.  My symptoms are improving and I can say that it took about 24 to 48 hours to recover from my right arm.

                                                After receiving the vaccine 1/9 in my left arm, I had normal side effects of chills, body aches, and fatigue. On 1/14, I noticed the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, no pain with palpitation. On 1/15 the underside of my left arm was itchy but no visible rash. On 1/16 the arm was still itchy and the lymph node was more enlarged. No neck or axillary nodes were enlarged. On 1/17 in the morning I woke up with a large red rash on my left deltoid. It was not itchy, but as the day went on was more red, raised, and warm. The node in my neck was causing some neck discomfort. I presented to Urgent Care and was treated for a local reaction. I was given a steroid cream to use on my arm and was told to take an OTC antihistamine. I have been using the cream for 2 days and so far the rash is resolving but is still visible. The node has not yet decreased in size.

                                                I first got symptoms on Jan 19th with extreme muscle soreness from my shoulders to my toes with hives on my thighs and what felt like a bug bite on my knuckle and a circular bite on my left forearm.  The muscle soreness was there for 3 days.  It was very hard to walk for a while cause of just the soreness.  I still feel a little in my ankles and toes still but fully recovered.

                                                At the time of the vaccination, I experienced a sore arm for about 48 hours, and muscle aches and chills for about 12 hours.   7 days after receiving the vaccination, I noticed a rash at the injection site. It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

I was a little feverish: 99.9 to a little before 100F.  Then on Saturday I had a pain on my left side from my arm all the way up to my neck, and it was really hurtful. And I also had it on my right side not so strong as the left side.

                                                I experienced fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches and headache after 9 hours from receiving my second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The pain was so severe I almost went to the ED and had to take off work the following day. My temperature was as high as 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. I took acetaminophen but this did not help the pain. However, this only lasted less than 24 hours and I made a complete recovery. I have not experienced any issues since.

Had shoulder soreness day 2 post vaccine and was taking Motrin and Tylenol with some relief. Pain continued to get better. On day 9 post vaccine, pain returned with intensity and was seen at urgent care on 1/9. Shoulder was swollen and red at the time, so urgent care NP diagnosed cellulitis and I was prescribed Keflex, along with instruction to continue taking Motrin, Tylenol. Called out of work on 1/11 d/t shoulder pain/decreased range of motion. Today (1/13) pain is much better but still having some pain/discomfort in the shoulder.

I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

                                                I received the second dose of the Moderna COVID Vaccine 3 FEB 21. Within 2-3 hours I was incredibly tired. I was hit with intense nausea and vomiting that has been persistent since the night of 3 FEB. I can?t keep much down. 4 Feb I had a fever of 102.3 starting around 4am, I brought it down with a 600 Mg dose of Ibuprofen but it came back off and on throughout the day alongside sweats and chills. All of my lymph nodes were swollen and my entire body hurt. I was unable to sleep last night 4feb/5feb due to muscle pain.  As of today I feel a little better and am without a fever, but I am still incredibly nauseous and have developed a sore throat.

On 2/3 my arm felt very warm, so I looked at it in a mirror and found a large, round/hexagonal area of swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness. Today is 2/6 and it continues to spread the redness, swelling, and warmth down towards my elbow. It occasionally itches, but is usually painful and stings.

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

Throughout the night, I would wake up frequently suffering from body aches and cold chills. Symptoms lasted for about 15 hours from time of onset.

Treated with ibuprofen and resolved about 10 hours after onset. Swelling and lump the size of a quarter at injection site noticed about 10 hours after injection.

Now, (3 days after injection) swelling still present. Still hot and hard to the touch and size remains the same. Pain and redness mostly resolved. Now starting to itch.

That pain then spread to my upper back alongside a mild headache. I was otherwise well until 12.5 hours post the vaccine where I developed fever and debilitating chills which went on for the remainder of the night. I had full body aches and immense pain in my arm, and kind of a stiffness all over my body accompanied by fatigue which may just be due to the lack of restful sleep I obtained. I also had a loss of appetite. I took 2 advil the next moring and felt better within 2 hours and regained my appetite. The sweating from what I presume to be fever still hadn&#39;t subsided nor had the chills. I would say within 36 hours all that remains is mild arm pain.

Approximately two hours after receiving the vaccine at 12:30 pm, the patient experienced heavy feeling in her neck and face area that hurt really bad. Later, she noticed numbness in her hands and feet. Slurred speech was reported from a bystander. By 3:30pm, the patient was completely paralyzed on her right side.

On 26 Jan 2021, the patient was still paralyzed on her right side, unable to walk, had shooting pain feeling, and two fingers on her right hand were able to move but still felt tingly. The doctors planned to discharge her on the next day to a rehab center because she could not function alone.  Treatment for the event included pain medication and hospitalization.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly, unable to walk and shooting pain feelings were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: A spontaneous report concerns a 25-year-old, female, patient, who experienced heaviness in her face and neck, numbness in hands and feet, slurred speech, completely paralyzed on her right side, right fingers tingly and shooting pain feelings.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

                                                My arm started hurting very bad after about 2-3 hours. At the 12 hour mark from my vaccine (11:30PM), I started to have chills, a fever, and feel nauseous. Around 1 AM I started to vomit and this occurred for about 15 minutes, and then repeated again about an hour later. By the morning of the day after I was no longer vomiting or had chills but still had a fever. The most prominent symptoms on the day after my vaccine were extreme body aches and horrible joint pain. My hands and feet felt swollen and stiff. I had terrible pains and aches in my whole entire body. I was also very tired and still had a low grade fever. On the second day after the vaccine I had bad chest and neck pain and started to have a mild cough. By the third day after the vaccine, the chest pain was gone but still had bad neck pain and a headache that radiated through my skull.

I also had severely painful swollen axillary lymph nodes on the same side that I received my injection. I was not able to work or do any of my daily activities for almost three days. Then on day 7 after receiving my first vaccine dose, I developed a itchy, painful, red rash and hives surrounding the injection site (about a two to three inch radius around the injection site. I also got hives and red itchy painful skin on my face. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed prednisone and a week of pepside and zyrtec. After a week I stopped taking the allergy meds and then the hives came back, so I kept taking the allergy meds until my second vaccine dose.

The sleep aid did not help as I only slept a few hours but could not stay asleep due to the pain. I woke up at 7 AM to feed my cat, then tried to lay back down, but was unable to. I went to the toilet feeling nauseous and wretched a few times but did not throw up. I did, however, experience diarrhea that morning and throughout the day. I laid down on the couch and fell in and out of sleep for a few hours. I felt the headache most of the morning, until about 11 AM,. I felt the chills throughout most of the day. I treated my pain with ibuprofen 200mg tablets (3 taken each time, 4-6 hours apart), Pepto-bismol for the nausea and had mostly liquids such as water and juice as well as bread and crackers. I felt much better by around 2 PM, except for the tenderness and swelling in my arm.

The morning after the vaccination, I also had fever, chills, headache, joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue. The fever was relieved somewhat by an ibuprofen, and went away entirely about 24 hours after the injection. Other symptoms subsided more slowly. The second day after the vaccination, I still had a mild headache and some joint and muscle discomfort, and my right arm was still painful, though somewhat improved by evening. The third day after the vaccine (Monday 3/15), I had no symptoms except occasional joint pain and a slight soreness of the vaccination site.

                                                Pt received 2nd COVID vaccination at 1024. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have dropped her water bottle and become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, she was noted to have moderate pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. Her head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. Pt noted to have some muscular rigidity and not verbally responsive. Another provider advised to call 911 due to unresponsiveness and seizure-like activity. 911 called @1027, meanwhile pt lifted and placed into a wheelchair and moved to treatment area where vitals were obtained, patient became verbally responsive @1034, responses/speech was clear but slow, pt was oriented to self, place, time and situation. Oxygen applied via facemask @4L. Pt provided staff with phone number to call her mother who was notified of daughter&#39;s condition @1032. FD Engine arrival @1033 report given and pt also became more responsive, eyes opened and stated clearly that she was feeling better. Pt color also improved. Pt denied any allergies, PMH or hx of seizure activity. Pt only reported a syncope many years ago. Ambulance arrival @1036, report provided to emergency staff and pt taken to ambulance for further evaluation @1039. Pt returned to vaccine clinic @1052, having declined ambulance transport. When asked about events, pt stated that upon sitting down she felt a sudden onset of moderate nausea and reached for her water bottle in her bookbag, pt states she could not recall or hear anything until she was moved to wheelchair, and did not recall how she came to be in the observation area (based on this information, suspected time unconscious was approx 6-12 seconds). Pt was educated regarding the many causes of syncope and the neccesity for further evaluation in the Emergency department. Pt discouraged from driving herself from the clinic and was able to obtain ride from her roommate. Pt urged again to obtain a ride to the hospital for further evaluation, understanding verbalized and agreed with plan of care.

That pain lasted through the night. At 2pm or 3pm the next day, her pain backed away to a 5 or 6, which is not uncommon for her.

                                                I felt arm pain in my left arm Around 4:00 pm, I started reaching for my face but I could not feel my face - it felt numb and tingly. That went on for two hours. There was no other droopiness juts facial numbness. My arm pain lasted for a good three weeks. It caused the lymph nodes under my armpit to swell. The pain went from my axilla Lymph nodes down to my left breast.  I got a pinkish, reddish, itchy rash at the spot on the injection about a week later. I don&#39;t recall the date for the doctor visits - one telehealth and one in person. They wanted me to use Primrose oil to massage the oil. They told me to keep an eye on it. I still continue to get the pain under my arm pit from time to time. I have still been seeing physician about that.

I was tired. I got a really bad headache that evening and I took Tylenol for it. When I went to sleep, I didn&#39;t have a temperature - at one point - it was 96. something. All night I felt hot and feverish internally. I had body aches, groggy, tired and my muscles hurt like I&#39;d worked out - for the next three days. I felt feverish randomly for the next couple of days as well. The facial numbness only lasted about an hour. Still am  experiencing irritation under my axilla from the first reaction to the vaccine.
