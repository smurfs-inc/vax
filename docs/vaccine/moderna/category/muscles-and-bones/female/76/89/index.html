Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

                                                The morning after receiving the vaccine, I could barely use my arms and had no use of my legs.  My husband called an ambulance and I was taken to emergency room.  I did not regain use of my legs until approximately 3:00 A.M., MONDAY 18.  Around 4:00 P.M., I was released to go home with PT through an in-home health provider.  While in the hospital MRI, x-rays, numerous blood work, etc. we?re performed.  No reason could be found.  It was speculated that I still had antibodies from having COVID in December and the vaccine was too much.

                                                My arm wasn&#39;t sore right away but I think I laid on it and the next morning it was sore. It felt like a bee sting I took some medicine and it went away.  On the 27th I had bad gas. I did try a new cereal and thought it was cereal. On the 28th I still gas and upset stomach like flu like symptoms  and felt light headed but not bad. On the 29th still an upset stomach and had diarrhea, I was still light headed and really shaky. I was really weak. I was shaking a lot at arms (hands) and legs were both shaking  and made it hard to walk. On the 30th I still really light headed and my legs and hands were still shaky, still having difficulty walking, still had an upset stomach and still felt weak. On the 31st my stomach was a lot better, I was still shaky and light headed, and I had a weak feeling. My head felt like when you feel like you have a head cold (pressure in my head). Today my stomach is better, I am still lightheaded and still shaky but not as bad. I still feel pressure in my head, but no runny nose or any other cold symptoms.   These were symptoms I had in March when I was sick for 3 weeks. I was negative for COVID but didn&#39;t get back to my normal self until the June.   Doctor was a private practice and recently closed so I do not see my new doctor till the 24th.

I didn&#39;t want to do anything Saturday, I rested most of Saturday and Sunday. Today the 22nd I am back to my normal self.

I was awake and knew what was happening.  I don?t know how long it lasted. When the episode was over, I went to sleep.  I awakened in about 3 hours, went to the rest room, and returned to bed.  I was uneasy  and thought I might fall.  I slept another three hours and went to the bathroom again. I felt a little better. I got up in about two more hours and felt a little better. Didn?t feel good all day and my arm was really sore.

The next morning she experienced a kind of paralysis, could not sit up or stand up, was falling out of bed and out of her chair, had to be carried to the bathroom, although she usually can walk by herself. This lasted about a day. I took her to the ER where they excluded other possible causes of her condition and simiply attributed it to the vaccine. No treatment was prescribed.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal. I am now on a heart monitor for 30 days. Upon departure of hospital the symptoms in L leg and arm have nearly resolved but face is still numb/decreased sensation. Plan to contact PCP tomorrow.

Pain bad enough Wednesday night/Thursday early morning to contact Dr. Thursday. He determined my pain was muscle pain. Suggested Aleve (as Tylenol and Advil weren&#39;t working) and heating pad (which I had used on Wednesday during day). Aleve helped a lot. Pain by today (Sunday) is minimal but still some minimal discomfort.

                                                This event , because so many elderly people have the fillers in their knees should be widely publicized! We have fillers that help so much to be able to walk without pain, but this vaccine has caused me to have extreme pain and burning and not be able to walk without pain for 4 days now. NO ONE has said anything about how this Moderna vaccine would  affect us because of the Hyaronolic Acid injections to our knees. We should have been allowed to get Pfizer!!!! I am so upset about this and extremely disappointed in our government&#39;s lack of disclosure.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

When I got of bed the following morning I felt so weak, woozy and light headed that I was afraid I would fall.  I slept all day but by that evening I began feeling better and by the following day (day 2 after the shot) I felt normal except that my arm was still sore. It is now day 3 and my arm is still slightly sore but not limiting my use and is steadily getting better.

Then I didn&#39;t worry about till the 01/18/2021 in the evening and it felt warm and it was a big patch of red (looked like a rash) about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide like a oval shape. On Tuesday 01/19/2021 I called my doctor,  spoke with nurse what was going on. Doctor told her to put cold compresses on the site 15 minutes on and then 15 minutes off and take Tylenol as needed. The area is still warm and the redness area is still there.    Did go to local grocery store and spoke with pharmacist who advised her to contact VAERS.

Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

By 7pm I was dizzy and nauseated, and it got worse, I got chills and shook and shook and shook, I had a fever and the next day I tried to get out of bed, and I fell to the floor and couldn?t stand up, I had no energy or appetite. I had covid in August 2020 and the wasn?t made aware of the possible side effects if you had covid. They didn?t ask if I had covid in the past and the pharmacist told me later that people who has had covid has reported having bad side effects. I had gone a couple weeks ago to see if I had the covid antibodies and I was positive for antibodies and the injection works against the antibiotics. This part of the procedure was overlooked. I have no one else to help me and going through this alone, it would have been better to have been made aware of this ahead of time.

Pain was intermittent, coming and going but taking my breath away. I called CVS about aspirin and took 5 Baby Bayer aspirins. Pain went away at around 9 pm. Never returned. NO  other adverse effects  Surprising result is diminished pain in knees! When it gets cold, rainy, my knees have been extremely painful so I&#39;d have to lift myself up from sitting but since then the pain is at 1 to 2 on the scale rather than 10 ! It sounds strange but it has happened and that&#39;s why I felt I needed to report this.  Rainy days this week with no debilitating pain and I waited to report this for a week since the pain usually began days before.

THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

She waited and as she was leaving she fell to the floor and hit her head.  The other patients around her said it looked like she slipped, but when speaking to her it seemed that she had become dizzy and fell.  I spoke with her after she fell, she did not loose conscienceness, but was disoriented.  She did know what day it was, who she was and where she was.  She said her head hurt and she could move all her limbs.  I asked the store director, to call for an ambulance.  I sit with her for a few minutes and talked to her, then asked store director to stay with her until the ambulance arrived.  They arrived and spoke with her and decided to transport her to the hospital.  Later that day, her sister in law came by and said she was doing fine and had been released.  The doctors indicated they thought she because dizzy due to dehydration

It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

The second day she shaking and jerking, couldn&#39;t hold on to anything.  Her blood pressure was up and down that day. She said she felt like she was dying and then she vomiting where she bruised both elbows on the toilet bowl due to the jerking movement she was experiencing.  She took a nap and woke up confused.  She was hallucinating saying she felt like she went from a small box to a blue box to red box and didnt recognize her room.  Her sitter said her eyes were glazed but was able to recognize her sitter at that time.  Blood pressure dropped so the sitter then called EMTs where they checked her out.  Vital signs were good but she declined to be transported to the hospital via ambulance.  The third day she was feeling some better where she was able to eat and get a sponge bath.  Fourth day she was better so was able to shower.  She states she is better now with just a little soreness and redness around the injection site.   Pt has contacted her PCP and spoke with the nurse about her symptoms.

                                                My shot was Saturday at 2 PM.    Monday night I developed a VERY tender, sore achilles tendon.  I could barely walk Tuesday.  I kept working it up and down and I do not excercise,   so it&#39;s certainly NOT from overuse.   I have never had this problem before   I can remember at one time taking some meds that the warnings said they could cause problems with tendons. . so , I&#39;m wondering if this could be because of my shot on Monday.   Hence, the report.

She went to bed, and all night and into the next day had fever/chills.  She got up during the night to get some water she collapsed and could not get up as she was so weak.  Her husband found her and helped her back to bed.  Today, 2/22/21 she is better today and feels almost to normal.   She took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea.   Tylenol/Ibuprofen did not take the headache, but it did finally go away.   The headache was on the top of her head.

EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

Unable to use my hands due to excruciating pain.  The pain began  3-4 days after the 2nd shot, starting in 2 of my fingers and progressively moved to all the joints in all of my fingers, wrists and my shoulders.  In addition there is swelling. I have very little use of my hands, requiring assistance to care for myself.  I have never had joint pain in my hands before.  The pain has continued for 2 weeks non-stop.  At the doctors recommendation I have been taking Tylenol for Arthritis, however this does not alleviate the pain, only reduces some of the discomfort.

                                                She got the vaccine and did not get an immediate reaction, and on Thursday morning she was tired and couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  So her husband kept her in bed all day and by Friday morning things didn&#39;t get any better, and he helped her to get to the end of the bed and went into the kitchen to get breakfast and he heard her fall, and she fell off the bed and was semi-consciousness, and was able to get her back into the bed and called the ambulance.   She was taken to the hospital Friday morning and she&#39;s still in there.  She has been diagnosed with hydronephrosis, and they keep going back and forth on her diagnoses.  At first they said that she had a UTI, and then they said she didn&#39;t, and then said that she did.  The son feels that all three of the doctors feel that it was some sort of reaction to the vaccine.  They did give her steroids at one time, and she developed severe tremors when she moved which have subsided.  She also has had fever, in a weakened state due to this condition.  She is still being treated for this still and said that she will be having to go to rehabilitation before going home.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

                                                On January 1, 2021,  patient was admitted to Medical Center with COVID. Tested positive on January 2, 2021. Spent 10 days in hospital. Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

Felt like her face was drawn and tight. This morning, she has been very shaky, sounds like some congestion in her chest (cough), very tired, very dry mouth. She is never sick, so this is alarming to her and to me.

The whole prior she kept saying I am just not right. On the 2/7/21 she a COVID test done, a nurse came to her house and preformed. On the morning of the 8th patient was on the phone with someone else and patient asked this person to call me and go check on her. Within 5 minutes I was over at her house, and I found her on the floor, she on her belly facedown. It looked like she was on the toilet, and it looked like she fall getting her off, she was still wet, she still felt warm. I called the ambulance and immediately  began CPR. When EMS arrived they took over the CPR and transported her to the Hospital. The EMS was there for about 40 minutes and used an machine to preform the compressions. She was pronounced deceased at the hospital.  No autopsy was done.

Requested vaccine be administered without moving patient from wheelchair. After administration, patient remained in waiting area for recommended 15 minute observation time, then patient&#39;s wheelchair was moved nearby, but still waiting area. Approximately 20 minutes after vaccination, granddaughter called me over to help. Patient was unconscious and appeared not to be breathing, but pulse was palpable. Called for code white. Pharmacist asked granddaughter to hold patient&#39;s head up. Pulse remained palpable, pharmacist administered 1 dose of 0.3mg epinephrine via epi-pen into patient&#39;s left thigh. Patient quickly regained consciousness, spoke to family, said she didn&#39;t feel well. EMS arrived. Patient began to vomit, was placed on stretcher by EMS and left with EMS. A few hours later the granddaughter reported to us that the patient had a UTI and physical exam by ER attributed her experience to untreated infection.

Is this a huge coincidence or did she have really bad reactions to the covid vaccines?  Should she have been observed for 24 hours afterwards by the assisted living facility, had a family caretaker watch her for 24 hours, Pharmacy should have observed for 24 hours?

On the date of her second vaccination, Feb. 17, she was getting around with her walker.  On Friday, Feb. 19, she was so weak she was no longer able to walk with her walker, and she declined every day thereafter.  On Monday, Feb. 22 she began crying and saying &#34;help me&#34;.  That lasted approximately a week.  her health declined every day until Saturday, March 6, when she passed away at 6:15a.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

                                                At 9am on 1/14/21, Patient was unable to speak and unable to move her arms. After an undetermined period of time (likely less than 5 minutes), she was able to call me (her daughter).  She could hardly move her mouth but she was able to tell me that she needed help. I arrived about 20 minutes later.  She had full movement at that time and was able to speak.  Her BP was 140/73, HR 60. She was tired but scared to go to sleep around 5pm so we went to the local ER.  Her labs, EKG, and MRI were all normal for her age. Today (1/15/21) at 10:30am, she experience the same thing but only in her face.  She was able to move her arms but not able to talk.  I was with her and could tell that she was fully conscious and aware, just couldn&#39;t move.  It happened again but not as severely after she ate lunch around 12pm.

On Saturday, January 23rd, she was exhausted and unable to get up. We learned this from a friend of hers who had called us back after both my brother and I were unable to reach her by phone.  This was about 3:15 pm and we drove to her apartment and found her semi conscious in her bed. We awoke her but she was unable to talk or get up. We then called 911 and emergency paramedics came and took her to hospital.

                                                My mother has experienced a severe reaction to her vaccine. Diagnosed with brain encephalopathy probably caused by molecular mimicry in response to the Covid vaccine, she is now being treated as an inpatient at the Clinic.  She was fully independent- living alone, mobile, with excellent cognitive function.  On January 21, 2021 she received her 1st Moderna vaccine. Subsequently family noticed small balance changes, slight fine motor coordination changes (handwriting, etc) and a little forgetfulness not previously seen. Everything was chalked up to her being 89 years old.  She remained independent and relatively fully functional.  Patient is now unable to stand without assistance, leans backward when trying to stand, has developed a spastic tremor bilaterally in her arms, and her cognition is completely altered.  Hallucinations, memory loss, can follow some directions but not all, speech clear but inappropriate.  This declines DAILY. As of March 7th, she could not identify immediate family members in a photo. These changes have all occurred within the past few weeks and appear to have an acute underlying cause not related to age.    Medical staff are looking at an autoimmune encephalitis picture based on the antibodies developed from the vaccine attacking the tissue in the brain and spinal cord that resembles the small piece of the vaccine.    She is currently at the Clinic affiliated hospital. At this time, family is contacting Clinic main campus to request further investigation.   Photographic evidence of rapid decline available, but not able to attach to this form:   Available are three pictures of a log patient keeps with her vitals that she was doing every day.  1. Personal log of vital signs pre Covid vaccine/dose 1 - you can see the handwriting is concise, clear, and orderly.   2. Personal log of vitals after Covid dose 1 on Jan. 21 - slight changes in the handwriting and orderliness but still ok.  3. Personal log of vitals after Covid vaccine dose 2  Feb. 17 - note the illegible handwriting, missing entries, and no spatial awareness of line alignment.  Available are three photos of crossword puzzles she does every day.    1. Puzzle dated Feb.12. Demonstrates her ability to accurately fill most answers with clear writing.   2. Puzzle dated Feb.19 shows an ability to fill in only a couple answers with obvious handwriting changes.   3. Puzzle dated Feb. 21 shows inability to complete, and a strange discrepancy between ability and inability- note 29 across and 18 down.  Patients outcome is undetermined as diagnosis/treatment and prognosis are ongoing.

                                                History of Present Illness     89-year-old female with past medical history significant for osteoporosis and hypothyroidism, who initially presented to ER on March 2 due to lower extremity weakness and right knee pain after a recent fall.  Patient lost her balance and suffered a mechanical fall on February 22.  Patient developed right lumbar and hip pain radiating down her leg.  She saw Dr from orthopedics on February 26 who recommended offloading knee and wearing a knee immobilizer.  Patient was admitted to hospital on March 2 due to worsening knee pain and was incidentally found to be positive for COVID-19.  Patient had received her second Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on February 26.  Patient was evaluated by neurology during that hospital course, who recommended outpatient EMG, physical therapy, and pain management.  No evidence of Guillain-Barré or viral induced neuropathy.  Patient&#39;s lower extremity weakness did improve, and she was successfully discharged home with family and home health on March 5.   Patient reports doing well at home with family initially, was making improvements with her strength and was able to stand and take a few steps with walker and assistance.  On March 8, patient was in bed and she attempted to turn onto her right side, and as she was turning she felt a pop and a pain in her right hip that radiated down her right leg.  Since that time, patient reports having severe pain with movement, rates pain as 8/10 severity.  Denies falls or new trauma since her previous fall from February 22.  Patient was unable to control pain at home, so she came into the emergency department for evaluation.  Initial hip x-ray series revealed questionable greater trochanteric fracture.  CT of right hip subsequently revealed fracture.  Orthopedics consulted.  No significant laboratory abnormalities.  Foley catheter was placed in ER.  Patient was admitted to hospital service for management.  On my interview, patient reports that right hip pain is under good control as long as she does not move, but has 7/10 pain severity over her right lateral hip with movement.   Patient reports following Covid isolation protocols at home with family.  Reports that her Covid isolation will be completed on March 12.  Denies upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient has oxygen saturations of 100% on room air.

Initial ED workup was unremarkable, including CBC, CMP, Troponin, CK, Magnesium, CXR and EKG. Her vitals were normal and she was subsequently discharged home with family. She then returned several hours later following a witnessed cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU intubated and on multiple vasopressors in critical condition.
