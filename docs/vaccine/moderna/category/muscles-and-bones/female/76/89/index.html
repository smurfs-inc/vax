                                                Developed a severe headache within 2-3 hours of receiving vaccine. Took 2 Tylenol. Headache abated but did not resolve. Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

                                                Felt fatigued and weak while taking routine daily walk (cold, clear, sunny weather).  Had to stop once to rest (almost never happens). Then nearing end of 2-mile walk, knees buckled and fell down on sidewalk. (Did not trip).  Hurt arm, scraped face.   Went home, put ice on face, laid down, rested.

The symptoms I&#39;ve had from the shot are pretty much the same as when I was sick.  I was fortunate not to have any respiratory symptoms either time as confirmed by my oximeter.  I had two Antibody tests.  One on Nov. 23rd, which was positive for both  IgG and IgM.  I had my second anti-body test on 1/17/2021, the day of my injection which was positive for IgG and negative for IgM.  I have not contacted my doctor concerning this and I am taking Advil for the fever and ached and pains.  Today i feel better than yesterday.

Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

Then, the evening of Day 6 (Jan. 20) I felt a little itchy around the injection site.  Morning of Day 7 (Jan. 21) I was very itchy and my upper right arm was very itchy, red and inflamed.   I called my dermatologist, and she told me to use a prescription cream I had from an irritation  on my thumb last year, called Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.1%.   I also called my primary doctor,  to let her know what was happening.  Day 8 (Jan. 22) my upper arm was still very inflamed and seemed to be spreading wider across my arm, maybe 4&#34;x3&#34;.  Day 9 (Jan. 23) a little better. Day 10 (Jan. 24) much better. Almost gone. Little bit of red left. Still using cream until it goes away..

                                                I got extremely hot.  I undressed quickly and got into my bed.  My head moved from side to side with out my control.  I was swallowing rapidly.  I was awake and knew what was happening.  I don?t know how long it lasted. When the episode was over, I went to sleep.  I awakened in about 3 hours, went to the rest room, and returned to bed.  I was uneasy  and thought I might fall.  I slept another three hours and went to the bathroom again. I felt a little better. I got up in about two more hours and felt a little better. Didn?t feel good all day and my arm was really sore.

She went to bed around 8:00 PM and then she couldn&#39;t sleep all night.  She kept trying to drink liquid, running fever, hot and opened a window with temp being 30 outside.  She could hardly walk to the bathroom due to the muscle weakness and fear of falling.  She tossed and turned all night long.  She got up and her temp was 99.8, and she was told not to go to PT this morning.  She is being treated for a frozen shoulder.   She feels dehydrated and is drinking water, and going to drink Ginger ale and crackers due to the nausea.

The next morning I woke up and the rash was there, and spread over the different areas of body. I was sweating bad, muscle pain, joint pain, and nauseated for about 3 days. I had knots in my arms. I went to the doctor last week, and she gave me a shot in the hip, it helped with the swelling.  Then I called her back and she called in a cream for me.  The other symptom remaining is the rash at the injection site, I have been putting the cream on it twice a day, taking Benadryl and Tylenol for pain

                                                On the 9th day (Fri., 2/19) after my shot I developed a very intense rash all over my stomach, and on the underside of my breasts. It was very itchy.  I considered the possibility that it was the seafood soup I had eaten, but all day I also  had very bad pains in my lower back, left hip, and left knee. I had knee surgery in August, but this pain was much worse than I&#39;d had in months. The pain and rash continued thru the next day Sat., 2/20.  Then on Sunday the pain was completely gone, and the rash started to subside. Then the following weekend  (2/27 and 2/28) the rash had a mild flare-up, and there&#39;s mild itching off and on since them.

The following day I was feeling a little better, but the chest pain was worrisome. I went to Urgent care and they said my EKG was not normal. I was taken to the hospital which was also the vaccine site. I was treated in the ER and they ruled out a heart issue with a complete workup. I was admitted for an unexplained bowel obstruction and remained in the hospital for four days. I got the second dose of the vaccine and I did not have any significant problems. I may have Covid-19 in the spring of 2020.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.  2:00 am 1/28/2021- woke up feeling queasy, joints in legs were achy. My left  knee replacement felt like it was in a vise,  This  was a  short lived event with some residual feeling in the knee in the morning.   3 days after injection  10:00 pm 1/30/2021- I noticed a small rash on my left abdomen near the navel, this rash moved quickly to the left and soon covered entire left abdomen, moving to the groin area then down left inner thigh.  I took a Benazepril and went to bed. During the night I woke up several time with a strong pressure in left bowel area. Changing position seemed to help and went back to sleep. woke up about 5 am and checked the rash which was mostly gone except for the original spot where it began.  The rash and pressure seemed to be restricted to front left side below waist area. It is now 11:00 am 1/31/2021 and I am feeling fine, very little residual rash at initial site.   I had not read anything about delayed reactions as late as 3 1/2 days after the injection so wanted to report this event.

I took two Tylenol and went to bed.  I got up two times during the night to go to bathroom.  I felt more achy all over and unsteady on my feet. Did not want to get out of bed next day, so slept until noon.  At noon my temperature was 100.4. I took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours.  Had a very achy, miserable day and just rested.  Was somewhat better by bedtime and had a better next night of sleep. Next day am still achy but much better.

                                                Started out with waking the next day a fullness in her head, but kind of a headache, and very tired.  Then a couple of hours later she got a severe case of the chills.  She laid down and slept on and off for about 5 hours.  When she got up she took her temperature and it was 101.  She also had body aches in her back and her legs felt very heavy.  She then noticed a rash on her body from a line that went underneath her breast, and redness on the left side of her breast to her belly button, all red around the belly button.   When she realized she had a fever she took Tylenol.  The rash by Saturday was fading and she also had diarrhea on Saturday, persistent diarrhea.  She felt almost normal except that she was tired.  Today, 3/1/21 she has the returned diarrhea, doesn&#39;t k now if it was related to the vaccine.  She spoke to a nurse yesterday, and she told that she had a typical side effect from the vaccine.  She was not sure if the diarrhea was from the vaccine.

At 9:15 pm, I had chills and fever for 3 hours  and during that time, my right forearm, wrist and hand became very, very sore.  I  couldn&#39;t even flex my fingers the pain was so bad.  Pain throughout my body continued during the night, including stomach cramps, back and leg pain and then I took another 200 mg of Advil at 9:15 am on 3/4.  I feel I am 20% improved 25 hours after my second shot.

Upon awakening early on the morning of the second, I had moderate aching in all joints, headache, weakness and fatigue. I stayed quiet for day. Upon getting ready to shower on the morning of the 3rd I found I was covered with an angry bright red rash from my neck down to my knees both front and back. Because I did not shower on the 2nd of March I have no idea when it began. On Thursday my head still felt pressure but felt a little stronger and that evening I again showered and the rash looked less angry and bright. Waking this morning on Friday the 5th the rash is gone and I am feeling much better except for soreness in the armpit of the right arm that received the injection.

When I got of bed the following morning I felt so weak, woozy and light headed that I was afraid I would fall.  I slept all day but by that evening I began feeling better and by the following day (day 2 after the shot) I felt normal except that my arm was still sore. It is now day 3 and my arm is still slightly sore but not limiting my use and is steadily getting better.

No pain in a sitting or standing position. the pain happens at night when lying down often followed by cramping and &#34;charlie horse&#34;  symptoms. This has lessened somewhat after 2 weeks, but it does still happens. Really considering declining the second vaccine as that is reported to be much more likely to have side effects.

At approximately 7 days post injection she began to have another localized reaction that included reddness, swelling, pain, heat, and a dry skin tecture that progressed to cover the lateral aspect of upper left arm from shoulder to elbow. At time of examination by RN, the patient reports that size and intensity have been increasing for about 7 days.  Patient finds relief in hot shower.  No other treatments attempted at time of exam. Patient reported area may be improving, but she is unsure.   Area was outlined with marker by RN and patient was advised to see PCP for treatment if area increased in size and was not continuing to improve.  Counseled on using OTC benadryl cream if there was itching.

                                                The first day felt fine, the next day when she got up in the morning she didn&#39;t feel well, but felt well enough to put a roast in the crockpot.  Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

Then about the  7th day I started experiencing an itchy arm and a 6 inch circle of intense red at the injection site, with a wide band of white surrounding it, that itched unbelievably, was hot and swollen.  That lasted for several days, then began to subside and now is only slightly red, itches some and is no longer swollen or hot.   My question is:  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose, after experiencing this kind of reaction?

                                                The patient was administered the Moderna  Covid-19 vaccine on 1/14/2021. The patient reported experiencing arm pain around the injection site during the 2 days following the vaccination. The patient reported experiencing hip pain and trouble with her legs on 1/21/2021. On 1/22/2021 the patient reported not being able to stand without bracing. The patient visited a doctor on 1/25/2021 and there was suspicion for inflammation of the spinal cord leading to the patient being prescribed prednisone for 6 days. The patient visited the doctor again on 2/2/21 and another course of prednisone was initiated. The patient reports that she can stand from a sitting position without help getting up about half the time and that she had no such trouble standing prior to the vaccination. The patient returned to the second vaccination clinic on 2/11/2021, which was  4 weeks after receiving the first dose, to report her symptoms. The patient was not administered the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

Then was fine for 7 days.  On 2/5/2021, I went to get my B12 shot and asked the doctor to check left arm where Moderna shot was given as it was itching and a bit sore at the same time.  He told me I was having reaction.  By evening, a third of my arm around injected area was swollen an had red rash.  Then same symptoms of fatigue, etc. came back and I was in and out of bed for the next three days....then at end had a bout of diarrhea.

Top of foot and all along the outside side of it both on top and at bottom of foot all very painful. Ankle and leg very swollen and painful. Can&#39;t walk on foot.  As of 2/26/2021  swelling is not as bad and not so discolored but still some swelling and redness burning and very painful and still cannot use the foot.  Also have noticed places where  I have had surgery or injuries is hurting and being stiff. Am questioning whether or not I should get the 2nd shot. Concerned it will make situation even worse.

Hospital ruled out acute stroke but could not entirely exclude a cerebellar stroke due to her dizziness with vertigo and nystagmus (per hospital report). Client was in hospital 2.5 days, per hospitalist. note-all work up including MRI and tte were negative for acute findings- symptoms have resolved. Hospitalist noted symptoms may be worse following second shot. Spoke with client 1/19/21 and she reported feeling weak and tired only.

                                                6:13 pm - 9 pm   Extreme shooting pain, right shoulder, clavicle and neck causing my arm to jerk and sometimes my body spasmed. Pain was intermittent, coming and going but taking my breath away. I called CVS about aspirin and took 5 Baby Bayer aspirins. Pain went away at around 9 pm. Never returned. NO  other adverse effects  Surprising result is diminished pain in knees! When it gets cold, rainy, my knees have been extremely painful so I&#39;d have to lift myself up from sitting but since then the pain is at 1 to 2 on the scale rather than 10 ! It sounds strange but it has happened and that&#39;s why I felt I needed to report this.  Rainy days this week with no debilitating pain and I waited to report this for a week since the pain usually began days before.

THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

I vomited 5-6 times even though I had not eaten anything. I also had diarrhea. I had chills. Some point during the night I spiked a fever, I woke up and drenched. Yesterday  the 23rd I  had a fever, my stomach still does not feel settled. I have not ate much since Sunday but have been trying to stay hydrated with lots of water.  I also developed a cough yesterday. Tuesday night my temperature 100.6 and I think it got higher because I woke up once again drenched in sweat. This morning my temperature was 99.  I am achy today with muscle and joint pain,  my stomach feels better but I still leery of  eating. I did eat some Ginger ale and eat some saltine crackers.  I also feel horse.  I called my doctor yesterday and still have not heard back. I will call again today.  It feels like I feel better in the morning but as the day goes on I get worse and start feeling worse. I have been resting a lot in bed.

It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

                                                Experiencing muscle weakness in legs and arms.  Feel as if I have over-stressed those muscles, and they resist by being weak and feeling as if they sort of tremble.  I usually walk one mile a day and as I was walking the day after my injection my calf in my left leg shortly after I started began to tighten up.  At first I thought I would press on through but the muscle tensed more something like a &#34;Charlie Horse.&#34;  I quit walking came in an rested.  I have not attempted my mile walk since then because my leg muscle is still sore from the cramp.  When I raise my arms they feel heavy and seem to quiver and my legs do the same as I&#39;m doing my stretching exercises.     I have been waiting to contact anyone to see if time would take care of this problem I am having.  I am seeking guidance as to whether or not I should proceed with my second injection on 18 Feb 2021.   I am waiting for my doctor&#39;s office to respond regarding my call about this.  I did speak with a nurse at the local HD who said I should file this side effect event report with you.  I have never had a reaction to any of my flu shots and I have had one each year for a number of years.  One thing I do want to mention is that my mother took the flu shot the first year it was offered and she was one who experienced muscle loss due to it and never completely recovered muscle strength.

In the meantime starting Sunday, Feb. 14th, I had pain in right chest and right upper back, that I contributed to making a wrong move and straining muscles.

It is in the same arm in which she got the vaccine. She tried tylenol but it didn&#39;t help. I applied Voltaren gel to the wrist and that helped the pain. I advised if it worsens for her to return. She will monitor the wrist for signs of infection however at this time we will treat for arthritis flare.

EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

Waited till Saturday, the 29th to see a doctor., and she diagnosed that I had Shingles. She gave me two medicines to get from my druggist. One was valacyclovir and the other was HYDORcodone. These helped to relieve the pain. I was limited to  5 of the HYDROcodone,  so when I was finished with those tablets, my nighttime pain in my shoulder was very uncomfortable.

                                                Several days after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine for COVID 19, I began have pain in all the joints in my hands, shoulder.  Unable to use my hands due to excruciating pain.  The pain began  3-4 days after the 2nd shot, starting in 2 of my fingers and progressively moved to all the joints in all of my fingers, wrists and my shoulders.  In addition there is swelling. I have very little use of my hands, requiring assistance to care for myself.  I have never had joint pain in my hands before.  The pain has continued for 2 weeks non-stop.  At the doctors recommendation I have been taking Tylenol for Arthritis, however this does not alleviate the pain, only reduces some of the discomfort.

                                                The patient received her FIRST dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/26/21 and SECOND dose on 2/23/21. On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

I did NOT have a heart attack. He thinks it is due to the vaccine. Advised that I take the second shot.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (also treated with 5 days of Remdesivir) in January 2021 and Lumpectomy. Concomitant products included NICOTINAMIDE, PYRIDOXINE HYDROCHLORIDE, RIBOFLAVIN, THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (VITAMIN-B COMPLEX), ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN-C), VITAMIN D [VITAMIN D NOS], ZINC, APIXABAN (ELIQUIS), CARVEDILOL, ATORVASTATIN and LETROZOLE for an unknown indication.    On 03-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.

For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

By 10:00 p.m. my lower back, sides were in pain and abdominal muscles and stomach were like frozen in place.  Couldn&#39;t move anything and the area seemed to be swollen.  Had  lost appetite in late afternoon so had not eaten dinner, only liquids since figured I needed something.  Couldn&#39;t sleep, aspirin didn&#39;t help.  Next day around  noon my abdominal area was better and pain decreasing  on sides.  Still no desire to eat. Trouble sleeping,   2nd day after shot, still  lower back pain, feel bloated, no desire to eat.  Very little side pain.   Had slight headache   This third night after shot I could finally  sleep.  This fourth day I felt back to normal.  During all this time, the arm that had the shot never really bothered me

It looked like there were 2 giant hives on my my arm (bigger than a nickel). Took 1 Benedryl (25mg), which didn&#39;t help. Hardly slept due to itching, and soreness to the touch. I can&#39;t wear a blouse with a sleeve. Today (Sunday 1/24), the redness came together into 1 big red blotch, measuring  2&#34;x3.5&#34;. Hot to the touch, and very sensitive. I feel pain into my shoulder blade area and where my arm meets my body in the front. Also, pain going towards my elbow. Ice / cold packs make it feel better. I will call for Dr. appointment tomorrow (Monday morning).

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

                                                Got the vaccine and was feeling tired, and her arm hurt, an all she wanted to do was lay in bed with her heating pad.  The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

She said she couldn&#39;t lift her legs and she could not tell when she had to go to the bathroom.  Prior to this shot she was able to walk with a walker ; she knew when she had to go to the bathroom and she got up by herself in the morning and knew what her routine was.  Now she is unable to walk and is totally incontinent.  She does not know her routine anymore and is waiting for directions from her caretakers on when to get up, when to go to the bathroom and sits in bed all day or is moved to a chair by caretakers.  She needs pillows propped around her in order to sit upright.

The worst has been the increasing tremors in my head and hands.  This is what I am most concerned about. I have a history of tremors, but since the vaccine, there has been a marked increase in the tremors. I did not report this right away because I thought it would go away, but now on the eve of my second shot I am very nervous that it will get even worst.  My physician encourages me to continue and get through the side effects than to get COVID with my underlying lung condition. I want to take the vaccine but am nervous that I am experience so much shakiness even a month after the first shot. Would you advise me to take the second shot? My shot is scheduled for tomorrow, February 17.

The patient reported that that she had facial tingling, numbness in lips, shortness of breath and blood pressure of 210/90 after getting her first Moderna vaccine. Patient also reported weakness in her leg and severe headache. Patient said facial tingling lasted for about 2 hours and lip numbness lasted for about 4 hours(21-FEB-2021). Patient also complained about swelling in her leg/edema but she said she has cellulitis in her left leg and she was not sure if the swelling had something to do with the vaccine or not.   Patient did not take anything to treat symptoms but contacted her doctor and pharmacist.   The patient reported that all other symptoms like weakness in her legs, Shortness of breath, and the headache lasted for about 4 days(25-FEB-2021). Patient said all she wanted the Moderna team to know that she reacted to the vaccine.  Seriousness criteria for the event of swelling and edema was medically important.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome for all the events was considered as recovered/resolved.  No further information was provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a strong temporal association and the established safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association between the reported events and the product use cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

She was sick to her stomach, really tired and lost her appetite.   On the 22nd I called her doctor again... no response, on the 23 I called again.  On the 24th finally someone spoke to me.. they stated they had called my mom and spoke with her.  They are suppose to call me, my mom could not remember by the time she would hang up.  They said to let her rest and give her electrolytes and Vit. B6.  On the 26th when I called the doctor and said she is lethargic they said to take her to the ER.  She flat lined at the hospital and her body went into shock.  She ended up having Kidney, Heart and Liver Failure.  She was still driving and doing all of her cooking, banking, shopping, showering, walking every day on Feb 18th.  She died on March 5th.

The rash has spread to cover most of her upper left side of her back, under the left arm and across the left side of her chest.  Patient says that it feels like it is spreading down her arm now.  She visited the doctor on 3/1/2021 thinking it was an allergic reaction.  The doctor diagnosed her with shingles.  Patient has never had shingles in the past.

                                                Received call from patient on 3/3/2021. She reports that approximately 1.5hrs after receiving her COVID vaccine, she began having pain in the top of her head, neck, between her shoulder blades, down both arms to her fingertips, and down her spine.  Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

                                                History of Present Illness     89-year-old female with past medical history significant for osteoporosis and hypothyroidism, who initially presented to ER on March 2 due to lower extremity weakness and right knee pain after a recent fall.  Patient lost her balance and suffered a mechanical fall on February 22.  Patient developed right lumbar and hip pain radiating down her leg.  She saw Dr from orthopedics on February 26 who recommended offloading knee and wearing a knee immobilizer.  Patient was admitted to hospital on March 2 due to worsening knee pain and was incidentally found to be positive for COVID-19.  Patient had received her second Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on February 26.  Patient was evaluated by neurology during that hospital course, who recommended outpatient EMG, physical therapy, and pain management.  No evidence of Guillain-Barré or viral induced neuropathy.  Patient&#39;s lower extremity weakness did improve, and she was successfully discharged home with family and home health on March 5.   Patient reports doing well at home with family initially, was making improvements with her strength and was able to stand and take a few steps with walker and assistance.  On March 8, patient was in bed and she attempted to turn onto her right side, and as she was turning she felt a pop and a pain in her right hip that radiated down her right leg.  Since that time, patient reports having severe pain with movement, rates pain as 8/10 severity.  Denies falls or new trauma since her previous fall from February 22.  Patient was unable to control pain at home, so she came into the emergency department for evaluation.  Initial hip x-ray series revealed questionable greater trochanteric fracture.  CT of right hip subsequently revealed fracture.  Orthopedics consulted.  No significant laboratory abnormalities.  Foley catheter was placed in ER.  Patient was admitted to hospital service for management.  On my interview, patient reports that right hip pain is under good control as long as she does not move, but has 7/10 pain severity over her right lateral hip with movement.   Patient reports following Covid isolation protocols at home with family.  Reports that her Covid isolation will be completed on March 12.  Denies upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient has oxygen saturations of 100% on room air.

Initial ED workup was unremarkable, including CBC, CMP, Troponin, CK, Magnesium, CXR and EKG. Her vitals were normal and she was subsequently discharged home with family. She then returned several hours later following a witnessed cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated and admitted to the ICU intubated and on multiple vasopressors in critical condition.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported).    On 12-Mar-2021 at 1:30 PM, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 13-Mar-2021, the patient experienced OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED (oxygen level was low) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (could not get up or walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle weakness in her legs) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 14-Mar-2021 to 17-Mar-2021 due to GAIT DISTURBANCE, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS and OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED. The patient was treated with Rehabilitation therapy for Gait disturbance. At the time of the report, OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED (oxygen level was low), GAIT DISTURBANCE (could not get up or walk) and MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle weakness in her legs) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 13-Mar-2021, Blood test: normal (normal) Normal. On 13-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Low.         No concomitant medications were reported.  The treatment information included oxygen for 2-3 days.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Further information has been requested.
