                                                Developed a severe headache within 2-3 hours of receiving vaccine. Took 2 Tylenol. Headache abated but did not resolve. Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

The symptoms I&#39;ve had from the shot are pretty much the same as when I was sick.  I was fortunate not to have any respiratory symptoms either time as confirmed by my oximeter.  I had two Antibody tests.  One on Nov. 23rd, which was positive for both  IgG and IgM.  I had my second anti-body test on 1/17/2021, the day of my injection which was positive for IgG and negative for IgM.  I have not contacted my doctor concerning this and I am taking Advil for the fever and ached and pains.  Today i feel better than yesterday.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine shot, my left upper arm from should down began to itch.  Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

                                                I had no side effects after the injection except for very slight arm discomfort for a day or two.  Then, the evening of Day 6 (Jan. 20) I felt a little itchy around the injection site.  Morning of Day 7 (Jan. 21) I was very itchy and my upper right arm was very itchy, red and inflamed.   I called my dermatologist, and she told me to use a prescription cream I had from an irritation  on my thumb last year, called Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.1%.   I also called my primary doctor,  to let her know what was happening.  Day 8 (Jan. 22) my upper arm was still very inflamed and seemed to be spreading wider across my arm, maybe 4&#34;x3&#34;.  Day 9 (Jan. 23) a little better. Day 10 (Jan. 24) much better. Almost gone. Little bit of red left. Still using cream until it goes away..

                                                Patient came out of a sleep feeling numb all over and head felt empty.  Thrashed about on floor with muscle spasms in both legs.  Kept trying to hold onto head and not swallow the tongue.  The attempt to swallow the tongue went on for one hour, if the patient was reclining  on a bed.  If standing, the tongue felt sore.  The patient was still shaken, the next morning.

                                                7 days out  from first vaccine I had extreme pain in my neck, shoulders and upper back. Could not turn my head left or right because the 6 Scalene Muscles in the neck were so tight. The pain also went up the right side of my face &amp; skull affecting my TMJ and eating. The Scalene Muscles are on the side and front of a person&#39;s neck so I looked on the web as to how to release them. I gently used my knuckles, fingers and a tennis ball for 4 days on these 6 muscles while someone used a large 2 ball massager on my spine from my bra line and up my neck, and I laid on a heating pad but the stiffness and pain remained.  Pain last 2 weeks, first week the worst. Extreme fatigue for a week . I believe I might have some arthritis in my neck and I frequently have minor aches and pain in my upper back, shoulders, &amp; neck. So this area is venerable so maybe that&#39;s why it happened.  I hope my 2nd shot won&#39;t be worse.

                                                I woke up with severe Number 10 pain in my right knee, front , back and side. It was red, tender and swollen. The pain moved down to my right ankle and foot with severe muscle spasms pulling my right foot inwards toward my left foot. I could not walk to bathroom without screeming. Then it moved to my right hip area with muscle spasms across my lower back.  I am still experiencing pain and muscle spasms (not as severe) today at this writing. It seems to be attacking my body where I have old injuries.

It was a sharp pain like being stung.  Thus happened for two days, woke me up at night.  I took a picture of my left wrist on Feb  11 and my right, both in the same minute.  The structure and size of vein enlarged on the left side,  as well as the color of skin.  The right side was normal.  As of today, the difference in the veins is still there, yet the jabbing pain has stopped.

Next morning got up and was really tired and sleepy for about 5 hours, and then no more side effects.

The next day when I woke up around 6:00 am I felt muscular pain in my upper left arm (arm of vaccine) when I moved my arm, and I could not raise my arm.  Later that day I took an Ibuprofen and went out to eat Indian food at night.  The pain went away.  The following day the pain was almost all gone, and after that it went away completely.

I didn&#39;t want to do anything Saturday, I rested most of Saturday and Sunday. Today the 22nd I am back to my normal self.

I was awake and knew what was happening.  I don?t know how long it lasted. When the episode was over, I went to sleep.  I awakened in about 3 hours, went to the rest room, and returned to bed.  I was uneasy  and thought I might fall.  I slept another three hours and went to the bathroom again. I felt a little better. I got up in about two more hours and felt a little better. Didn?t feel good all day and my arm was really sore.

                                                Immediately after the injection and got a pounding headache behind her eyes.  Then about 7:30 PM she started to ache all over and very tired.  She went to bed around 8:00 PM and then she couldn&#39;t sleep all night.  She kept trying to drink liquid, running fever, hot and opened a window with temp being 30 outside.  She could hardly walk to the bathroom due to the muscle weakness and fear of falling.  She tossed and turned all night long.  She got up and her temp was 99.8, and she was told not to go to PT this morning.  She is being treated for a frozen shoulder.   She feels dehydrated and is drinking water, and going to drink Ginger ale and crackers due to the nausea.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal. I am now on a heart monitor for 30 days. Upon departure of hospital the symptoms in L leg and arm have nearly resolved but face is still numb/decreased sensation. Plan to contact PCP tomorrow.

I went to the doctor last week, and she gave me a shot in the hip, it helped with the swelling.  Then I called her back and she called in a cream for me.  The other symptom remaining is the rash at the injection site, I have been putting the cream on it twice a day, taking Benadryl and Tylenol for pain

                                                2-3 days after 2nd Moderna vaccination a 10 inch area around injection site swelled and became hot, painful and hard, and a large bright red rash appeared . It persists without improvement today. I also had pain in the joints in my feet and ankles, hands. Some fatigue. No fever, no chills. I had NO reaction after 1st vaccination, although injection site was hot and very tender for days. Used left arm both times. I saw an online photo of &#34;COVID arm&#34; hypersensitivity reaction and looks exactly like mine. Really quite uncomfortable.

I considered the possibility that it was the seafood soup I had eaten, but all day I also  had very bad pains in my lower back, left hip, and left knee. I had knee surgery in August, but this pain was much worse than I&#39;d had in months. The pain and rash continued thru the next day Sat., 2/20.  Then on Sunday the pain was completely gone, and the rash started to subside. Then the following weekend  (2/27 and 2/28) the rash had a mild flare-up, and there&#39;s mild itching off and on since them.

Also, overall very painful joints.  Also, joints in hands locking when using.

                                                Fatigue, headache, joint pain, chills, fever, slight nausea. Started Saturday day after vaccination with fatigue to the point couldn&#39;t stay awake and weak. Sunday woke with bad ache all over and harder to move along with fatigue. Small headache along with slight nausea in afternoon. Woke about 5 am Monday with total sweat, then chills and couldn&#39;t warm up. still had fatigue but not as much pain. Called Hospital Covid Hotline as directed by my Dr.s office (never talked to my Dr.) Nurse with Hotline discussed it with me and we determined it was probably side effects. Since I am aware of allergic reactions, I didn&#39;t feel threatened, only messed up. The fatigue and some aches lasted throughout the weak, and I am still fatigued and weak compared to normal.Aches seem better.

                                                On March 9, I noticed some discomfort in my left arm.  Upon examination, I observed swelling in my left arm around the injection site. There was also redness around the site measuring 4 1/2? long and 3 1/2? wide. It was warm to the touch. I applied ice to the area and took a Benadryl capsule.   The ice brought down the swelling and the redness did lighten some.  Today I still feel some discomfort in the shoulder, the swelling is gone, and the redness, although lighter, has increased in size to 5 1/2? long.

Thereafter, through the night,  a  feeling of fever, back &amp; forth: skin hot, then normal feeling.  Some chills.  Took my temperature several times and would only get a normal reading.  Puzzled, because  I thought I must have a fever.....the STRANGENESS  of this  was that my skin felt like it was BURNING UNDERNEATH my skin....not like any fever I might have ever had. Still normal temp readings.   The next day...mostly in bed, tired, no appetite, continued fever feeling, but no fever temp reading.  The second day, up and around, eating.

                                                The evening  of the first shot on February 5, I had a strong headache, muscle aches and was extremely tired for the next two days.  I had brain fog for the next 2 weeks.  Tylenol and Advil mostly relieved physical discomfort.    I had the second shot March 16.  The next day I had a severe headache, no energy, achy body,  chills and fever and on the second day after the shot my temperature was 101.4 - 101.8.  Tylenol and Advil relieved the symptoms.  Today, one week after the second shot I developed a pungent chemical taste in my mouth and a similar sense of smell.  The tip of my tongue is tingling, and while I can breathe in deeply,  my chest feels heavy, like I&#39;m not getting enough oxygen.

A couple of days later it was hurting and bother her and went to a dermatologist who diagnosed her with shingles which came out on her neck and her shoulder, and typical shingles reactions with stinging, hurting, itching, etc.   Her dermatologist put you on Acyclovir, which is helping a lot, fading reaction, and help with the pain.   She does still have some sensitivity around her neck but the rash is fading. She also had pains in her ears at the same time.

The following day I was feeling a little better, but the chest pain was worrisome. I went to Urgent care and they said my EKG was not normal. I was taken to the hospital which was also the vaccine site. I was treated in the ER and they ruled out a heart issue with a complete workup. I was admitted for an unexplained bowel obstruction and remained in the hospital for four days. I got the second dose of the vaccine and I did not have any significant problems. I may have Covid-19 in the spring of 2020.

                                                Patient&#39;s husband alerted pharmacy staff that patient was having difficulty breathing with bright red pallor roughly 5 minutes following her second dose. She was slightly hyperventilating, had pain radiating from her neck superior to her ears and anterior down her back. She described the pain as &#34;shooting&#34; and moving downward. She was able to take deep breaths and converse with no issues so epinephrine was not administered. Paramedics were called to the scene to assess her condition. She was able to stand, showed no signs of dizziness or change in mental status, and her pallor began returning to baseline. EMS took her BP and oxygenation, she declined transport to a hospital and remained at the pharmacy for an extra 30 minutes.

                                                Stiffness and increasing pain in shoulder, arm.  Inability to sleep due to pain.  Unable to rollover at night, and loss of use of arm.  Saw 2 doctors, neither of which could identify the source of the pain.  Inability to rise from bed or couch without assistance.  Both doctors recommended physical therapy.    I waited to visit a doctor for a week, then another week to see a specialist.  I started physical about 3 weeks after the vaccine was admiistered.

                                                Chart notes written on 4/16/2021: Patientis presenting for having muscle aches and back pain since she received the 1st Moderna vaccine on 03/26/2021. The patient states that her arm started hurting right after she got the vaccine but just over the past couple weeks it has gotten worse. It is red under her arm and not by the injection site.  Her whole body has been achy since the injection.  On Monday of this week she developed 3 areas of red itching round patches.  She denies any other causes for the hives.  She has been taking some tylenol for the muscle aches and this seems to help a little.

Extra strength Tylenol, 2 every 8 hours helped.  Then the symptoms would return.  This lasted off and on for weeks.  Gradually feeling better but still taking some Tylenol now and then.  Had blood work and my sed rate which is usually 5 was 67 and showed positive antibodies for Covid.  I have not had Covid 19.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below. Concurrent medical conditions included Dairy intolerance, Drug allergy (allergic to Compazine), Hay fever since 1976, Osteopenia since 2000, Tinnitus since 2016 and Osteoarthritis since 1990. Concomitant products included MACROGOL 400 (BLINK TEARS) for Dry eye, VITAMINS NOS (MULTIPLE VITAMIN) for Multi-vitamin maintenance, VITAMIN D3, PROBIOTICS NOS, FISH OIL and HOMOCYSTEINE THIOLACTONE HYDROCHLORIDE for Routine health maintenance, CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) from 01-Jan-2020 to an unknown date and MOMETASONE FUROATE (FLONASE [MOMETASONE FUROATE]) for Sinusitis, MAGNESIUM CITRATE for an unknown indication, GLUCOSAMINE &amp; CHONDORITIN. On 22-Jan-2021 at 9:00 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Feb-2021 at 9:00 AM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 27-Jan-2021, the patient experienced ARTHRALGIA (severe leg pain (both)/Pain seemed to concentrate in back of legs/intense pain in joints and muscles of the legs). On 21-Apr-2021, the patient experienced POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia Rheumatica) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness in the chest). At the time of the report, POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia Rheumatica) and ARTHRALGIA (severe leg pain (both)/Pain seemed to concentrate in back of legs/intense pain in joints and muscles of the legs) had not resolved and CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness in the chest) outcome was unknown. mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosing remained unchanged. Additional concomitant medication taken at the start of the events included OsteoThera 4 times per day. On 27-Jan-2021, the patient experienced intense pain in the joints and muscles of the legs. She applied ice as treatment. Over the next 2-3 weeks pain moved to other joints and muscles with varied intensity; fatigue and weakness noted. Overtime it became very difficult for the patient to stand up from a seated position, walk, turn over when lying down, or bend over to sit down. On 09-Feb-2021 additional daily supplements were started: Pea Protein, Calcium D-Glucarate, Digestive Enzymes (Digest Gold), GI Motility Complex, Glutagenics Powder, Sun Fiber. The patient sought medical attention from her Primary Care Provider (PCP). The patient&#39;s ESR and CRP were elevated, indicative of an inflammatory condition. The patient was referred to Rheumatology. While she waited 5 weeks for the appointment, she experienced tightness in the chest and continued loss of function. She eventually went to the Emergency Room (ER) and 1 lab result was slightly elevated, indicative of Lyme disease. The ER doctor administered ketorolac and iodixanol and the patient started treatment with doxycycline. On 21-Apr-2021, doxycycline was stopped as additional lab tests for Lyme disease were normal. The patient was diagnosed with Polymyalgia Rheumatica and started treatment with Prednisone 15 mg daily (gradual tapering off was planned), heat, light stretching, and exercise to regain leg movement.

She is able to stand and walk without any difficulty.  I discussed keeping her for MRI as we cannot completely rule out stroke.  She verbalizes understanding of this.  She still wishes to go home.

                                                Patient received the second moderna covid-19 vaccine on 4/1/21.  2 days later she developed a painful itchy rash at injection site that traveled down her whole arm to her hand.  Over the next few days she began to feel dizzy and weak.  She had an episode where she was parked in her driveway and felt she could not get out of the car due to feeling dizzy, weak, and faint.  She was able to get out of her car and to her bed were she remained for the next 8 hours.  She felt she could not get our of bed due to feeling so weak and faint and she feared she would fall.  She woke up the next morning able to get out of bed.  She then began to develop pain and weakness in both shoulders, both arms, both hands, both knees, and both ankles.  We ordered blood test on 5/11/21 including a CBC, CMP, CRP, urinalysis, ESR Wes&#43;Fer, Rheumatoid arthritis factor, and ANA all blood test came back within normal limits.  Patient was seen in the office on 5/24/21 for a physical exam and was found to have loss of range on motion in both shoulders and arms, pain and swelling at both elbows, both hands, and both knees.  Patient also complained of general weakness, fatigue and a fullness or swelling in both ankles.  She has been doing physical therapy, is taking tylenol for the pain, and has been on 2 rounds of steroid medrol dose packs.  Patients continues to suffer with weakness, fatigue, muscle, joint pain in whole body. We have also contacted the moderna company and was told they could not help us and hand no treatment or other advise for us.  We have referred our patient to a Rheumatologist.

                                                Within 15 mins after the vaccine, I felt weakness and weak in the knees and chills;  it didn&#39;t feel flu-like though. and within the first few hours I had &#34;Moderna arm&#34; - right near the injection site - big red splotch and the arm was sore. The redness in the arm lasted a good week. It was a red blotch but not itchy or swollen. I didn&#39;t feel well for a few days after the vaccine.  The symptoms came and went as far as how I felt - chills, weak, not feeling terrific for those first few days or so. A month after the second shot, I had a rash on my neck. It came and went - a little itchy and then not itchy. (This happened for a month.) And then at the same time, I felt the same original symptoms - chills and not feeling good. It lasted about three days - the chills and weakness. And then it went away. Even since, April, I get this periodically - I feel weak in the knees, I get the chills and I have to take a Tylenol or something. The middle of May, I was taking off my makeup and I felt a burning on my face (same stuff I&#39;ve been using for 20 years on my face) red splotch from  top of nose and all around and on cheekbones and down the face - it was puffy, swollen, red and caused bags under my eyes and redness under my eyes- and it still is. He gave me a cortisone lotion (my dermatologist) - It&#39;s not as red as it was but if I press on it the redness comes back. I have not changed anything with make-up; lotion or food. I have photos of it that I can send of my face. It&#39;s still here  - maybe not as bright - and I&#39;m not sure that I notice difference using the cortisone cream. It&#39;s been a good six weeks since it started on the face.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.  2:00 am 1/28/2021- woke up feeling queasy, joints in legs were achy. My left  knee replacement felt like it was in a vise,  This  was a  short lived event with some residual feeling in the knee in the morning.   3 days after injection  10:00 pm 1/30/2021- I noticed a small rash on my left abdomen near the navel, this rash moved quickly to the left and soon covered entire left abdomen, moving to the groin area then down left inner thigh.  I took a Benazepril and went to bed. During the night I woke up several time with a strong pressure in left bowel area. Changing position seemed to help and went back to sleep. woke up about 5 am and checked the rash which was mostly gone except for the original spot where it began.  The rash and pressure seemed to be restricted to front left side below waist area. It is now 11:00 am 1/31/2021 and I am feeling fine, very little residual rash at initial site.   I had not read anything about delayed reactions as late as 3 1/2 days after the injection so wanted to report this event.

On Jan 28, 2021 I noticed stiffness and pain in both of my knees. My Right knee was replaced in 2015 and my Left knee was replaced Oct 5, 2020.  I thought it was strange to have pain in the Right knee. The stiffness has increased in both knees since Jan 28. I otherwise feel fine but am having difficulty bending both knees and I have pain when I am weight bearing. I am wondering if the vaccine is attracted to artificial joints? I am scheduled to get my second dose on Feb 17.  Please advise if this is a common reaction.

                                                I took the first shot of Moderna?s COVID-19 vaccine  the middle of January. Two and a half weeks later, I developed a two inch rash above my right breast even though it didn?t itch or burn, if pressed, it hurt. I treated it with antibiotic ointment and calamine lotion. During that time, I experienced tiredness, exhaustion, sluggishness as well as aches around the right shoulder. I went to get a mammogram where they told me my lymph nodes were swollen on the right side under my arm. They had seen adults who had taken the shot develop swollen lymp nodes  which made it necessary to retake the mammogram. I also went to the dermatologist to see what the inch rash was, he took a biopsy, and it turned out it was shingles even though I had had the shingles shots a year before.

It is painful whether I am stationary or moving...it doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference.  I take aleve to help with the pain.  I am questioning whether to go for the second dose in under3 weeks since the pain does not seem to be lessening after ten days.

Getting progressively worse it radiated from neck under Left ear to end of fingers in Left hand  Pain was so extreme that I took 2 - 500mg tylenol at 10:30pm.  Pain evident without even moving.  At 3:30am (2/17) I took 2 - 200mg Ibuprophin.  Unable to sleep.  At 9:30am took 2 - 500mg tylenol.  Called pharmacist explained to him the pain. He said he probably hit a nerve upon injection.  Take tylenol and ice it 20 min on and off.  Today Friday 2/19 I am still in pain even with meds. Not as severe but still have limited motion. Scale of 1-10 with out motion about 2-3, on motion 9-10. Is there anything else I can do?

I took two Tylenol and went to bed.  I got up two times during the night to go to bathroom.  I felt more achy all over and unsteady on my feet. Did not want to get out of bed next day, so slept until noon.  At noon my temperature was 100.4. I took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours.  Had a very achy, miserable day and just rested.  Was somewhat better by bedtime and had a better next night of sleep. Next day am still achy but much better.

Then a couple of hours later she got a severe case of the chills.  She laid down and slept on and off for about 5 hours.  When she got up she took her temperature and it was 101.  She also had body aches in her back and her legs felt very heavy.  She then noticed a rash on her body from a line that went underneath her breast, and redness on the left side of her breast to her belly button, all red around the belly button.   When she realized she had a fever she took Tylenol.  The rash by Saturday was fading and she also had diarrhea on Saturday, persistent diarrhea.  She felt almost normal except that she was tired.  Today, 3/1/21 she has the returned diarrhea, doesn&#39;t k now if it was related to the vaccine.  She spoke to a nurse yesterday, and she told that she had a typical side effect from the vaccine.  She was not sure if the diarrhea was from the vaccine.

                                                I felt like I was hit by a ton of bricks. I got feverish, the chills, and muscle aches and pains to the point that all I wanted to do was sleep. So I went to bed, but just as I would be close to falling asleep I&#39;d have to get up to empty my bladder. This was happening almost every 15 minutes for a few hours. I knew I probably should hydrate, but I chose not to because I wanted to get some uninterrupted sleep which I finally did at about 4:00am which only lasted a couple of hours. Then up at about 6:30am when I took some acetaminophin and went back to sleep. I was in bed all day, sleeping most of the time. When I&#39;d wake up I&#39;d take my temperature and most of the time I&#39;d hydrate. I haven&#39;t had anything to eat because I wasn&#39;t feeling  strong enough to even heat water for soup. My normal temperature is about 97.6 give or take. The highest temperature I had was 100 when I took another dose of acetaminophin. But one time it was 94.3!!! I started feeling better at about 8:30pm (3/1/21)  and was able to make myself some chicken noodle soup and had some cereal and cottage cheese with it. I finally felt &#34;normal&#34; on Tuesday morning (3/2/21) after getting a good night&#39;s sleep.

At 9:15 pm, I had chills and fever for 3 hours  and during that time, my right forearm, wrist and hand became very, very sore.  I  couldn&#39;t even flex my fingers the pain was so bad.  Pain throughout my body continued during the night, including stomach cramps, back and leg pain and then I took another 200 mg of Advil at 9:15 am on 3/4.  I feel I am 20% improved 25 hours after my second shot.

                                                On 3/1/21 at 11:00 AM I received my second dose of the vaccine Moderna. I was fine all throughout the rest of the day. Upon awakening early on the morning of the second, I had moderate aching in all joints, headache, weakness and fatigue. I stayed quiet for day. Upon getting ready to shower on the morning of the 3rd I found I was covered with an angry bright red rash from my neck down to my knees both front and back. Because I did not shower on the 2nd of March I have no idea when it began. On Thursday my head still felt pressure but felt a little stronger and that evening I again showered and the rash looked less angry and bright. Waking this morning on Friday the 5th the rash is gone and I am feeling much better except for soreness in the armpit of the right arm that received the injection.

                                                I am starting this report with the current status of my, nearly, 6-week ordeal of  agonizing pain, doctor appts. debilitation, pain meds, a blood test and the final  MRI  this past Saturday, 3/6.  Finally, an MRI has confirmed physician&#39;s recent suspicion that my  second Moderna vaccination was improperly administered. In fact, it tore a  tendon in my right shoulder. I knew something was wrong when I saw how high  the needle was injected into my arm/shoulder. I just didn&#39;t know what the  ramifications would be.  I have been referred to a surgeon, and my appt. is 3/16).  Summary of Events:  On 2/1/21, I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine and had 2 days  of moderate pain and soreness.  But about 3 days later, 2/4, I awoke to excruciating shoulder/arm pain that had  me sobbing out loud. I took Tylenol and waited. Nothing. I took more Tylenol and  slowly the pain diminished. For an hour or so.  All I could do was lie on the couch, literally, groaning and unable to lift my arm  By evening, the only relief I could get was from an old (hip surgery) Oxycodone pill. I took 1/4 piece and slept the night.  Friday and Saturday I was totally debilitated. I couldn&#39;t lift my arm, care for my  dog or do anything but lie on the couch, still sobbing, until small pieces of the  Oxy set in again.  It was the weekend, and I didn&#39;t want to bother anyone but I never felt such pain  for such an extended time or survived so long on meds.  Monday morning, 2/8/21, I called my Doctor. I was very  concerned and really wanted to make sure this pain was still from the vaccine  and not some &#34;weird&#34; condition that might have hit me. The office told me the  pain was probably from the vaccine and advised me to keep taking Tylenol. So it  continued, on and off, relief and agony. I was sure it would stop. It didn&#39;t.  Thursday, 2/11, I saw the Doctor, in person.  Physician did not have an answer for the pain but gave me a prescription for  Celebrex and did a blood test to see if there was a bacteria infection that might  have invaded the area. We would wait for results. Another weekend of pain but  lessened a bit.  Around 2/13, a neighbor called me with an article he found about the SAME  situation MANY people were suffering (thousands) and LAWSUITS pending!! I  didn&#39;t know what was happening to me but the Gov&#39;t did. The article was found  on internet, 2/12, and printed an article from news paper, 2/12  No  other reports appeared anywhere. The pertinent findings of the article: thousands of vaccinated people (Covid and  flu) have reported similar pain and debilitation. The previous gov&#39;t has  introduced a law prohibiting lawsuits (l think against the pharmas but not the  administering agencies. Not sure.) that was to go into effect, 2/23. Again, not sure  of details.  But no one knows about this - people NEED to know. I immediately notified my  family and close friend about my situation. While the cause is not certain, it is  suspected that improper injection technique/training/experience is to blame.  To get the word out, I posted on social media, wrote representatives, etc.   And now I found you. The information must be made available; not to stop  vaccinations but to alert the public if they occur.

It has been 6 days, and it is somewhat better, but still quite limiting in what I can do. I sure wish I was told that this could happen.  I have osteoarthritis, and i rely on my left arm/shoulder when I take the stairs and do daily activities.  I am in a lot of discomfort and my activities have had to be quite limited.

These symptoms resolved two days after first vaccination and four days after second vaccination.  No medical advice was sought and acetaminophen was taken on an as-needed basis.   What I found to be unusual after both vaccinations was profound changes to the color of my urine two days after the vaccinations. I use the PureWick external catheter and urine collection system due to my NMO-related incapacitation. This system facilitates the assessment of urine output and characterisitics. After my first

                                                She got the vaccine, was fine and went to bed.  She sleeps in a fetal position with her legs curled and when she woke up she was not able to get up and was stuck in the fetal position.  She was in excruciating pain, and had a dog to let out as she lives by herself.  This went on for about 3 days.  Then she went back to work and worked 2 days and then she woke up the next morning 3/28/21 and every joint in her body including her toes was throbbing and aching like she had arthritis.  Since then she has continued with these symptoms, and aching all the time in her feet, shoulders and other areas.   She saw her stomach doctor who she told him about her side effects and he advised her not to take the 2nd vaccine.  She took her normal pills and Tylenol arthritis.  She did notify her regular provider of her reaction as well.  She went and got x-rays of her knees and legs at healthcare facility that said that they did not find anything other than some arthritis.  It also affected her arms, legs and feet and had x-rays again and showed nothing but some arthritis in her hips.  She still continues with the same symptoms.  It will ease up, she will go about her business and then will wake up with throbbing pains.

Within a couple days, the joint/body pain increased to the point she was not able to walk and was using a wheelchair. She has been evaluated by her PCP who then referred to an orthopedic specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Now two weeks after the vaccine, her mobility and joint pain have improved to the point she is only needing a walker to move around. However, she states she is still not back to her pre-vaccine mobility/pain status. There may be another VAERS report from her PCP

Some swelling  in hand as well numbness - fullness feeling in inside of arm especially at bend and hard lump in muscle of arm. I had this w first shot, filled report, met w 3 doctors, each prescribed  different rememdoes.  First time went to UC - prescription for steroids &amp; ice. Family dr back from seminar visit - said should never have prescribed steroids  -- prescribed heat, topical cream.  2nd shot effects mush later showing - this time dr prescribed xtra strength Tylenol,  ot ibuprofen.  Do not want to talk meds, want to know why this is happening. Since last major surgery, 2019, after 2 others in 6 years, only take low dose aspirin &amp; vitamins pills.

Upon her discharge the doctors told her they believe she had a minor stroke. She starts rehab next week. I tried to reach out to patient several times about retrieving her current medication list but there was no answer.

This would start early evening and progress into and through the night.  I met with my doctor in his office, had an x-ray of the areas involved.  Nothing noteworthy appeared on the x-ray.  His suggestion was to take ibuprofen and acetaminophen throughout the day and evening.  The pain in my hips and right leg is still considerable.  I will be seeing my doctor again about this problem.

That is why I took these vaccinations  Over the last twenty years I have taken a number of vaccination including an annual seasonal flu shot. I have learned during these years that when I take such a vaccination I need to do it when my schedule is clear to allow for several days of down time. I usually need several days to recover from such a vaccination. I also take only one vaccination at a time to lessen any problems I may have with it. Sometimes I have had a large red spot on my vaccination arm, up to four inches wide, near or around the injection site.  Continued:

                                                Pain in area of where the lower buttocks meet the upper leg. Pain radiating down and across upper leg. I wouldn&#39;t have even thought about this being related to the vaccine, but 2 other acquaintences have mentioned the same problems coming up since the last vaccine. There has been no injury or event to explain this pain.

                                                She got her vaccine, her left arm hurt as it does with her regular flu shot and normally goes away after a week.  The next day she read what to do, but she moved her arm slowly around to exercise it to get rid of the soreness.  On the 2nd day the pain went away.  By the 3rd day it was back with a vengeance, and stayed there and never got better.  Her joint and everything started to hurt.  It felt like she had to have rotator cuff surgery again, and it still feels that way.  She went to her doctor who gave her a steroid shot which helped but then it came back again.  Within a week she could move her arm, but in a certain position it hurts her extremely badly.  If she raises her arm it &#34;bites&#34; her and the pain does not cease.  Her groin area also she is having pain there as well that radiates to her knee.   The front top side is burning and sore all of the time, and does not want to quit.  She takes baby aspirin and was given Norco but she did not like how it made her feel and doesn&#39;t take that.  The 800 of Ibuprofen did not help with the pain, neither does Tylenol or Advil.  She states that the medicines make her muscles sting and burn and feel worse.  She feels that the vaccine got to her vulnerable places of pain from before that have healed and feels that it has reactivated that pain and the pain won&#39;t go away.   Her arm did not hurt her for years, and her leg pain had been gone for a long time, but since the vaccine she has had nothing but pain.  She got her 2nd vaccine on 3/25/21, she did not have any adverse reaction, just the reaction from the 1st one did not go away and it did not go away after the 2nd one and still has the same pain.  It did not bother the bladder where she had surgery, just the joints of her body where she had previous problems.    Her back has been out of place and could not walk for a year and a half, but this has not bothered her back.

                                                I never considered it as an adverse effect. I did wonder if by stimulating my immune system if it stimulated the shingles. I had pain in my shoulder and going up the side of my bed. It wrapped around my head and behind my eye. I had had shingles before and it felt like shingles pain. I noticed I was breaking out on my shoulder and starting up the side of my neck. I went to the urgent care and they diagnosed me with shingles. They gave me some medicine and it went away 2 weeks later. It didn&#39;t affect my eye itself, but it did affect my eyelid and around my eye. I saw my regular doctor later on. I just had a prescheduled appointment with her. I did tell her about it. She looked at the area and said I was healing up nicely. She suggested I get the shingles vaccine.

I did not go to the doctor but was very worried about it. I am 5&#39;2&#34; tall, weigh 100 lbs. and in excellent health. I am very active, ride my bike, go to water aerobics, and walk - this reaction was very debilitating; I am concerned about taking a booster shot and feel that the dosage should be adjusted based on weight as I had the same dosage a much heavier person would receive. Please consider this issue in the  future if a booster is needed. Thank you.

                                                Nine days after receiving first Moderna shot I broke out with rash on injection site.   That evening I experienced extreme abdominal, back, underarm pain and bloating.   It was enough to double over and almost pass out.  Pain has continued on still.   I called my gastroenterologist a few days after.  We had a telehealth call.   I?ve had ultrasounds, endoscopys, mris, ct scans, blood work.  No diagnosis as yet.  I have malnutrition and extreme weight loss.

It is now day 3 and my arm is still slightly sore but not limiting my use and is steadily getting better.

No pain in a sitting or standing position. the pain happens at night when lying down often followed by cramping and &#34;charlie horse&#34;  symptoms. This has lessened somewhat after 2 weeks, but it does still happens. Really considering declining the second vaccine as that is reported to be much more likely to have side effects.

                                                Patient had small localized reaction for 2 days after injection that cleared. At approximately 7 days post injection she began to have another localized reaction that included reddness, swelling, pain, heat, and a dry skin tecture that progressed to cover the lateral aspect of upper left arm from shoulder to elbow. At time of examination by RN, the patient reports that size and intensity have been increasing for about 7 days.  Patient finds relief in hot shower.  No other treatments attempted at time of exam. Patient reported area may be improving, but she is unsure.   Area was outlined with marker by RN and patient was advised to see PCP for treatment if area increased in size and was not continuing to improve.  Counseled on using OTC benadryl cream if there was itching.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

                                                After administration of the Covid-19 vaccine I had 2-3 days of chills, muscle aches, fatigue, sore arm.  Symptoms gradually went away.  Then about the  7th day I started experiencing an itchy arm and a 6 inch circle of intense red at the injection site, with a wide band of white surrounding it, that itched unbelievably, was hot and swollen.  That lasted for several days, then began to subside and now is only slightly red, itches some and is no longer swollen or hot.   My question is:  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose, after experiencing this kind of reaction?

                                                The patient was administered the Moderna  Covid-19 vaccine on 1/14/2021. The patient reported experiencing arm pain around the injection site during the 2 days following the vaccination. The patient reported experiencing hip pain and trouble with her legs on 1/21/2021. On 1/22/2021 the patient reported not being able to stand without bracing. The patient visited a doctor on 1/25/2021 and there was suspicion for inflammation of the spinal cord leading to the patient being prescribed prednisone for 6 days. The patient visited the doctor again on 2/2/21 and another course of prednisone was initiated. The patient reports that she can stand from a sitting position without help getting up about half the time and that she had no such trouble standing prior to the vaccination. The patient returned to the second vaccination clinic on 2/11/2021, which was  4 weeks after receiving the first dose, to report her symptoms. The patient was not administered the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

I think the injection was administrated to high in my arm.  The within the next 24-48 hours I had a headache and was tired. About the 4th-5th day I had tingling, prickly feeling across right shoulder, down both arms down to my fingers and down  my legs down to my toes. This lasted about 5-10 minutes. Then on the 16th it happened again but this time it was my whole body the torso area and my limbs. I also had weakness, I felt like I needed to hold onto to someone to be able to stand. I had an unstable feeling while standing. The headache has occurred on and off since time of vaccination  about 4-5 times.  I  went doctor on Tuesday 2/16/2021, I did not see my doctor this time I see a different  it was a lady doctor.  She wasn&#39;t aware of this being one of the side effects and just to monitor myself and return if the symptoms worsen. She thought it was safe to get the 2nd dose. I have a virtual visit scheduled with Dr. on 2/23/2023

                                                injection site started aching almost immediately but within 6-7 hours upper arm painful and hard, back of head so painful had to go to bed. Body became like a lead weight, couldn&#39;t raise my arms, couldn&#39;t turn over, couldn&#39;t reach my phone 8 inches away. Had shaking chills for 8-9 hours even though temp. was only 99.8. This was 10 times worse than when I had Covid. Thank goodness the severe reaction only lasted a day and a half then slowly got better over the next 2 days.Took week for arm tenderness to go away.

Then was fine for 7 days.  On 2/5/2021, I went to get my B12 shot and asked the doctor to check left arm where Moderna shot was given as it was itching and a bit sore at the same time.  He told me I was having reaction.  By evening, a third of my arm around injected area was swollen an had red rash.  Then same symptoms of fatigue, etc. came back and I was in and out of bed for the next three days....then at end had a bout of diarrhea.

Top of foot and all along the outside side of it both on top and at bottom of foot all very painful. Ankle and leg very swollen and painful. Can&#39;t walk on foot.  As of 2/26/2021  swelling is not as bad and not so discolored but still some swelling and redness burning and very painful and still cannot use the foot.  Also have noticed places where  I have had surgery or injuries is hurting and being stiff. Am questioning whether or not I should get the 2nd shot. Concerned it will make situation even worse.

I can only remember a couple of times in my life ever feeling so sick. Within 24 hours my side effects subsided. Ten days later I developed itching and burning on hands, arms, chest and neck which, when scratched, turned bright red. The rash  lasted  about three of days.

This is a typical allergic reaction  I have to ibuprofen, Benadryl and occasionally to something I?ve eaten (source unknown). This is a stronger reaction than I usually have. 24 hours after the shot, I had headache, muscle ache, chills, and fatigue. Those symptoms had pretty much abated about 36 hours after the shot. I did not notice the hive reaction earlier than 48 hours after the shot.

Too weak to make it to the bathroom by myself.  I felt like I was in a delirium but my husband said that I was not incoherent.  Appetite is still not normal.  Mouth was so dry that I was not able to feel any moisture at all which I feel led to my sinus infection.

                                                On day 3 there was slight swelling, tenderness and heat at injection site.  On the fourth  and subsequent days there has been a red rash. It is about 2&#43; inches wide and 3&#43;inches long. Still quite red and tender to touch. Muscle underneath the injection site is still tender. It has been eight days since the injection. I also experienced some lethargy for the first two or three days.

Is it a coincidence that I now have arthritic-like pain in my left fingers at the nail first joint? I am unable to use those fingers for even support of a small dinner plate. Advise if you can.

Feb.8, 2021 leg was continuing to swell.  went to doctor&#39;s office where he prescribed an ultrasound.  Was told there was a clot behind my left knee and in some of the smaller veins.  I had the chills, joint pains all over, which lasted about the three weeks, but was slightly different every day.  When I began the 20 mg dose of Xarelto, every symptom cleared up and I felt great.  I am continuing on the 20 mg Xarelto.

She was told by her rheumatologist to stop taking methotrexate for 14 days after she had the vaccine.  Yesterday afternoon the patient began experiencing left groin pain.  It progressively got worse.  During the evening it was 10 out of 10 in severity.  Patient took 100 mg of prednisone and also went ahead and took her methotrexate but got no pain relief from this. She localizes the pain to her left groin region.  She said the exact same thing happened 5 years ago right before she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.  The pain was localized to the same exact area. Over the course of her admission, the patient improved after the methotrexate and the prednisone she took the today prior to arrival, and also started on as needed Percocet.

The reason for this is unclear. After the injection a rust colored liquid came out immediately according to the patient. She feels that she may not have received all of the first dose of the vaccine. She later reported brusing and pain. The pain is still present to this day. She has received the second shot and did not experience any problems.

                                                Noted change of consciousness in evening following vaccination.  She had a tonic gaze to the right when EMS 1st arrived at the scene.  She was not having any overt epileptic activity. She is normally very debilitated and moderately demented but conversational and jovial according to the daughter.  She is normally able to be fed, taken to the toilet, and has no trouble with day-to-day living.  She was brought to this hospital day after vaccination.  She was alert at the time of the vaccination.  She had COVID in August of this last year.  In ED, she was given a very small dose of Ativan.  She had immediate effect from this with resolution of the tonic gaze, developed a voluntary gaze and had minimal but clear-cut purposeful conversation.  She was also able to move her extremities after the Ativan.  Prior to that she was fairly rigid in her extremities.  She did not have any obvious seizure activity however.  She was transferred to another hospital for higher level of care and continued management.

On the ER they only did the CT scans. I have been to many doctors after that and  they did a bunch of CTs, MRI, x-rays, echocardiogram, EKG. The diagnosis was that I fractured my sacrum and had acute strains of the muscles in the pelvis. I am still being treated for the muscle sprains.

About 2-3 days later I had a bad rash spread from around the injection site.  I went to see my doctor after a week of having that and they told me to take Benadryl.  I also was taking cortisone cream.  I went back to the doctor because it would not go away.  My doctor prescribed me two different pills, the rash and swelling went away a little.  I had to back to the doctor and he prescribed a different pill, and the itching and swelling went away.

                                                I had very tender injection site, with stiff ness in the injection shoulder. The next day I had a steroid injection in both knees , the day after the steroid,  my injection site and shoulder were fine. Also I had the hot flashes and flushes. Possibly from steroid, or the vaccine, is the steroid masking the reaction to the vaccine? Will the steroid negate the effects of the vaccine on my immune system?

                                                6:13 pm - 9 pm   Extreme shooting pain, right shoulder, clavicle and neck causing my arm to jerk and sometimes my body spasmed. Pain was intermittent, coming and going but taking my breath away. I called CVS about aspirin and took 5 Baby Bayer aspirins. Pain went away at around 9 pm. Never returned. NO  other adverse effects  Surprising result is diminished pain in knees! When it gets cold, rainy, my knees have been extremely painful so I&#39;d have to lift myself up from sitting but since then the pain is at 1 to 2 on the scale rather than 10 ! It sounds strange but it has happened and that&#39;s why I felt I needed to report this.  Rainy days this week with no debilitating pain and I waited to report this for a week since the pain usually began days before.

SUBSIDED OVER A PERIOD OF 72&#43; HOURS.  1 WEEK LATER THE SEVERE SORE/STIFF SITUATION REAPPEARED, COULD NOT TAKE MY NIGHTGOWN OFF THE NEXT MORNING AND COULD NOT PUT A SEATBELT ON OR DRIVE, DRY MYSELF AFTER A SHOWER, ETC.... THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

She has pain in the bend of her left knee that radiates down through the calf of her leg.  When she gets up from sitting it hurts, and having to use two canes to walk and it still hurts.  The pain has not gone away from the day of vaccine, but the persistence has continued since Sunday.   The arm is okay, but the leg that is on the same side.  She did not have any problems with walking prior to the vaccine.

I have osteoarthritis in my left knee and right hip as well as a left hip  replacement and right knee replacement I thought perhaps the pain I experienced was weather related as I had not experience pain in these joints like this before.  I went to bed that night about 9 p.m. and was experiencing more pain in my legs.  The pain kept me awake most of the night and I got up about 4:30 a.m. By then I could barely walk.  The pain was not only in my joints but felt like it was in my bones as well.  My skin on the lower leg felt tight, almost like my legs were swollen, but they did not appear to be.  My right leg hurt the worst.   I still have a discolored spot on my arm where I had the shot.  It is about a 1/2&#34; diameter.  It does not hurt.

                                                Really tired on Monday the 22nd and I felt fatigued. I began to get nauseated and then I began to vomit. I vomited 5-6 times even though I had not eaten anything. I also had diarrhea. I had chills. Some point during the night I spiked a fever, I woke up and drenched. Yesterday  the 23rd I  had a fever, my stomach still does not feel settled. I have not ate much since Sunday but have been trying to stay hydrated with lots of water.  I also developed a cough yesterday. Tuesday night my temperature 100.6 and I think it got higher because I woke up once again drenched in sweat. This morning my temperature was 99.  I am achy today with muscle and joint pain,  my stomach feels better but I still leery of  eating. I did eat some Ginger ale and eat some saltine crackers.  I also feel horse.  I called my doctor yesterday and still have not heard back. I will call again today.  It feels like I feel better in the morning but as the day goes on I get worse and start feeling worse. I have been resting a lot in bed.

Then had headaches off and on, as well as muscle and joint pain everywhere, weakness all over her body.  She also had a low grade fever Saturday and Sunday.  She did have the  Corona Virus in July of 2020.  She is feeling better today as far as the weakness, just a little bit of muscle and joint pain.  She did have a trace of nausea this morning, but took her medication and it subsided.  The weakness was something like she had never had before.  She took Tylenol for her symptoms.  She did not call her doctor.   Just has a small amount of symptoms, but still not feeling herself yet.

                                                Was napping the day after receiving the vaccine and woke up about 3:00 pm to severe chest pain on the right side radiating deep into the shoulder blade.  It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

Denies injury from fall, on Eliquis  History of Present Illness     Patient is a 79 year old of Dr who is well known to the Hospitalist program. Patient was originally dx with pelvic fracture 12/29/20 with direct admission to hospital until 1/11/21.

Her only new pain at this time is to her left ankle, feeling well otherwise, no recent Rx changes, generally poor intake per daughter. No other new concerns today. No change in chronic lower back pain.   Addendum;  COVID screen &#43; which could account for her weakness in her legs past 24 hours.

It is now over 2 weeks after the second shot, and it only gets worse. I have a hard time getting out of a chair without assistance, much less off the toilet.

                                                The patient stated that she gets paralyzed after getting vaccines.  I asked her if she had someone in the pharmacy to help her. She said she came alone.  I told her I would have her wait 30mins after dose to make sure there were no issues. After I gave her the shot, she looked at me and said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. Then she looked and said my neck hurts. So I had her take deep breaths with me to get her to calm down as she appeared anxious. She was doing great then she went limp. I held her head up and asked her is she was ok.   She said she was, but then her breathing become shallow. She was un responsive at this time with her tongue pushing her mask off her mouth.  So I lowered her mask and her tongue appeared to be enlarged.  I had my technician call 911 and I gave her a dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg.   She was unresponsive, but breathing on her own.  The paramedics came and got her vitals, placed her on stretcher, and put in a medicine line to give her medications if need be.  She left somewhat unresponsive. They said she should be fine  and took her to ER.

Completely different from her chronic osteoarthritis.  Complete work-up including labs were negative. Normal CBC; normal electrolytes; normal inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP); rheumatoid factor was normal; urinalysis was normal; chest x-ray was normal. She was discharged home on no medication.  She was seen by primary care on 3/29/21 and reported her symptoms, although not completely resolved, were markedly improved.  Because of her autoimmune liver disease, she did not take Tylenol or Ibuprofen for her discomfort.

My concern is that the Moderna vaccine stimulated an underlying &amp; unknown arthritic condition, diagnosed via xray on 4.8.21.  The disabling pain continues, even after the 2nd shot, 3.4.21, which I listed in item 4, so that I could include the first shot as happening one month prior in item 22.

According to the family member, he does not think her oxygen was set at the right level.  He thinks it was set up higher because she tends to get confused and fall when this happens.  The patient really has fallen twice of late.  She said she aches all over. She also cites dizziness when she stands up.

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA&#34; A week after the first shot,  an itchy red area appeared on the inside of that arm.  It went away in about a week.  Approximately two weeks after the second shot, a small, red sore spot appeared on my left shoulder close to the joint of the collar bone with the arm bone.  Redness began to appear, first forming a streak downward.  By the end of the week, the redness continued to spread and pain developed in my bones on that shoulder.  On May 19, I was referred to Urgent Care by my normal healthcare provider.  There I was prescribed prednisone.   The course of treatment was 3 pills per day for four days, 2 pills per day for  four days and 1 pill per day for three days.  I have not yet finished  those pills.  The pain in the bones has decreased but the redness continues to spread.  Where it was at first just a streak that developed, it started over my shoulder and now has crossed the middle of my chest.  I had been told that I could stop taking the prednisone if the pain went away.  Earlier this week, I thought it was gone, so I didn&#39;t take the pills that day.  However, the next morning, the pain was back and I resumed the prednisone.

                                                Patient has serpiginous choroiditis of unclear etiology, diagnosed 2017 with about 6 total lifetime flares with unclear triggers. She had COVID-19 infection 12/2020, with no significant symptoms. She was treated with monoclonal Ab infusion (bamlanivinab) which she received 12/24/20. After the infusion she developed fatigue, headache, nausea lasting for 1 day that were self limited.  Subsequently, her arthritis has significantly worsened since 1/2021 and continues to be very poorly controlled with significant arthralgia.    She received her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/26/21, ~90 days after her infection. On 3/28/21, she developed blurred vision in left eye, no other symptoms. Specifically no rashes, no respiratory symptoms, no GI symptoms. She went to her Ophthalmologist on 3/30/21 who noted she has a flare of Serpiginous choroiditis in left eye. She had prior Utiq infusion 1/12/21 still active in left eye. Given flare, her methotrexate dose was increased from 4 tabs to 6 tabs and she was given 4mg intravitreal dexamethasone in left eye on 3/30/21. She was seen by Rheumatology on 4/5/21 who noted her arthralgia could be from viral infection, but did note the source of her current choroiditis flare is unclear and could not advise on whether or not she should receive the second COVID-19 vaccine. She returned to ophthalmology on 4/7/21 when she received a second dose of intravitreal dexamethasone 4mg in left eye. She again returned to Ophthalmology on 4/21/21 where she received a 3rd dose of intravitreal dexamethasone 4mg given persistent inflammation. Her vision has continued to be slightly blurred in left eye, but no worsening since receiving dexamethasone. She was due to receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/21, and she was referred by her ophthalmologist to allergy/immunology clinic 5/3/21 to determine the safety of receiving her second dose of moderna vaccine.   Our team performed a literature review that revealed that vaccines (though not specifically the COVID-19 vaccine) can be associated with serpiginous choroiditis flares, therefore we recommended she not receive her second dose of the Moderna vaccine series given risk of recurrent flare.   Based on chart review completed today, she continues to struggle with this flare and continues to require intravitreal steroid injections.

She presented back on 6/8 with persistent cough with new hemoptysis, decreased appetite and weight loss and ct scan done 6/15 showed a large heterogenous mass of the mediastinum 6.6 x 7.6 x 13cm encasing the r main pulmonary artery the r brachicephalic, r subclavian and common carotids. There was mass effect on the trachea and r main stem bronchus. The 6mm nodule seen in the posterior left upper lobe was stable and unchanged from previous ct chest from 9/20. This rapidly progressed in a very short time resulting in her admission to the hospital  for respiratory failure on 6/28 and she was so unstable we were unable to transfer her for a biopsy and start of treatment as recommended by oncology. She passed away on 7/2/21. The family decided they wanted to pursue a limited autopsy to have the mass biopsied to determine what the cancer was which was so rapidly progressive. They describe her as prior to the start of the cough and hemoptysis  on 5/20 that she was living alone, used no assistive devices and other than her dementia was generally healthy and was very interactive and involved with her family

                                                Experiencing muscle weakness in legs and arms.  Feel as if I have over-stressed those muscles, and they resist by being weak and feeling as if they sort of tremble.  I usually walk one mile a day and as I was walking the day after my injection my calf in my left leg shortly after I started began to tighten up.  At first I thought I would press on through but the muscle tensed more something like a &#34;Charlie Horse.&#34;  I quit walking came in an rested.  I have not attempted my mile walk since then because my leg muscle is still sore from the cramp.  When I raise my arms they feel heavy and seem to quiver and my legs do the same as I&#39;m doing my stretching exercises.     I have been waiting to contact anyone to see if time would take care of this problem I am having.  I am seeking guidance as to whether or not I should proceed with my second injection on 18 Feb 2021.   I am waiting for my doctor&#39;s office to respond regarding my call about this.  I did speak with a nurse at the local HD who said I should file this side effect event report with you.  I have never had a reaction to any of my flu shots and I have had one each year for a number of years.  One thing I do want to mention is that my mother took the flu shot the first year it was offered and she was one who experienced muscle loss due to it and never completely recovered muscle strength.

                                                Suddenly this morning, 13 days after receiving the first Covid Moderna vaccine - my arm is red and feverish at injection site.  In the meantime starting Sunday, Feb. 14th, I had pain in right chest and right upper back, that I contributed to making a wrong move and straining muscles.  The back pain is better, but I still have it when I reach high , move wrong, or take a deep breath.

By 6 hours after the shot, pain was excruciating and I was in literal Agony for the next 8 hours. It felt like a hot poker was being pushed along that pathway.   Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen had no effect.  I could not sleep &amp; could barely move the arm  at all.  (I am Not a pain Wimp)  I would say this was the longest lasting without relief/strongest pain I have ever experienced and I have had one child;&#43; hip &amp; shoulder surgery which required almost no after surgery medication at all.  By 5 a.m. I was able to sleep a bit &amp; most of the extreme pain was gone by 8 a.m.  I had some headache the following day and was barely able to function (I live alone) just from all over tiredness.  About 36 hours after injection, I was back to normal.

Went to bed, with 2 @400 mg. Tylenol boosted during the night with Tramadol 50 mg.   Was able to drive &amp; swim in the morning (21 hours) post. 24 hours post: extreme fatigue (kept falling asleep), then felt like I&#39;d been run over by a rototiller. Aches in joints, body, and skin.  2 @ 400 mg Tylenol alleviated symptoms enough to sleep for 2 hours. Arose at 3:30 pm feeling better. Not great, but better ! Better enough to feed animals and prepare dinner for myself.

I thought nothing of it and got my 2nd shot,on 2/5/2021,but the pain increased every day and I finally called my rheumatologist, who ordered CRP and sed rate.  The lab tests were elevated and he told me to increase the prednisone to 10 mg, which did very little.  The pain now was also in my shoulders and neck.  I eventually went to 20 mg of prednisone, but that still does not relieve all the pain.  I use excedrin during the night to help tide me over.  I will be seeing my rheumatologist in April for follow up, but the pain is worse than it was when it started.

I had Extreme fatigue, nausea, headache, balance was off, muscle and nerve and back pain.  Just took covid test and just got results--Negative. (3-19-21)  The symptoms subsided March 12.  Still vaguely experiencing all of them.   Should I take the 2nd shot.  Feel those results would return at an even heightend level.  Pharmacist said I was probably 85 % covered now with these effects from the 1st shot and should not take the 2nd.  My Dr.  said the 2nd shot was my call to make and that I should report it to CDC.

Then about 6 weeks later (3/29/21) got dizzy and felt no energy, still had headaches, slight ear aches and achiness in neck and lower skull.  Lasted about 3 days but seems to be better (took Meclazine starting on 3/30.    This all concerned me until I saw my chiropractor today (3/31) and he told me 2 of his patients had dizziness too.  They took Benedryl and that helped immensely.  They told him that they looked it up and dizziness can be a an adverse reaction to the Covid vaccs.  I looked it up on FB and saw that dizziness can be a reaction although the timeline for it to happen varied greatly - from immediately after to 3 weeks after.  In my case it&#39;s about 6 weeks after.  Felt ok in between the vacc #2 and first reaction of sore arm.  5 weeks after til next reaction of achy neck, skull and earaches.  6 weeks after Vacc # 2  til dizziness.

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

Of course he gave it to me, so the 02/01/2021 he tested positive and then he had the antibody infusions and a couple of days later I tested positive and I had the infusions on 02/05/2021. About 2 weeks later I got very sick, back ache and chest pains so I went to the ER so I ended up with blood cots in my lungs. They did scans and tons of blood tests, heart scan, lung scans. I have been on blood thinners since them. After Covid and everything I had me second dose this past Friday. So far I am doing okay, I am feeling a little bit dizzy.

                                                As far as I know, I was sitting after dinner reading and I was aware that I could not see well out of my right out, it was very blurry and at the very same time though I had a very sharp pain in the left occipital region. So I was most worried about my eye because I know something was wrong. First thing in the morning I called my eye DR and she told me that I had a right side occlusion in my right eye. So then what she had me do was wait a couple weeks to see if it would go away spontaneously and it didn&#39;t. So I went to a retinal specialist and they gave me shots in that eye because I could still not see out of my eye. It has not completely cleared but it is much better. I also had a severe pain in my neck and brain. I went to the ER and the DR that evaluated me there didn&#39;t know what my diagnosis was at the time but he put me on some medications that he thought would help with the inflammation. So he put me on cortisone and gave me a prescription for valacyclovir, because I have a history of herpes infections all over my body. SO that was on the Sunday that I went to the ER. Then by Wednesday the pain was so severe that I went to the ER at the hospital because I was so uncomfortable and worried. At the end of five weeks it just went away. I did see a neurologist but it was over by then, he said the diagnosis was occipital issues.

                                                2-3 days following second vaccination I woke in night with hands swollen and painful trying to use them even to pull up sheets in bed. Pain not changed by Tylenol.  Ordered Paraffin and used  baths on hands with only temporary relief. Symptoms seemed to constantly change over following days and weeks. Individual joints in hands would be inflamed and tender to touch. This varied from day to day as to which joint was inflamed. Shooting pains in lower arms and hands in April and May,. Sometimes extended to all joints. Pain when interlacing fingers. Pains shooting through fingers when just sitting.  Sensations of pin pricks  or bugs crawling on my skin when nothing touching me.

It is in the same arm in which she got the vaccine. She tried tylenol but it didn&#39;t help. I applied Voltaren gel to the wrist and that helped the pain. I advised if it worsens for her to return. She will monitor the wrist for signs of infection however at this time we will treat for arthritis flare.

                                                On Sunday, Feb. 14, I awoke to find my left arm paralyzed. I was unable to move  my fingers or thumb. Could not hold anything. Towards the end of the day, I got feeling back in my thumb, first and middle fingers. the outside of my hand, the ring finger and little finger were still numb and I had no control over them. Could not keep them straight. Since Monday was a holiday, the clinic was closed so I sent an email to Dr. explaining the situation. He told me to report to the CDC and that he would refer me to a neurologist. My two fingers and the outside of my hand are still numb. I have seen Dr. and have been referred to a hand therapist.

Besides this were chills, extreme tiredness, a sort of &#34;brain fog,&#34; general aches and pains with the second shot and knees weak and feeling like a rag doll which lasted a couple days.  Several episodes of urgent diarrhea with the first dose.  First &#34;Covid arm&#34; lasted 8 days, the second just 4.  With both, there was an almost constant feeling of queasiness.

                                                Patient is a 81-year-old woman who last Tuesday received her second vaccination shot in her left arm.  Several hours after the procedure she developed pain and discomfort in her left arm.  The left arm discomfort gradually increased over the past 3 to 4 days and she began to experience symptoms of claudication in her left forearm and hand.  She had a difficult time performing her daily tasks.  The pain significantly worsened today to the point that she had constant pain in her hand and developed numbness in her fingers.  She presented to the urgent care clinic and was subsequently transferred to the emergency room where CT angiogram demonstrates thrombus in her left brachial artery.  She denies a history of heart palpitations.  She has no history of hypercoagulable state.  She has no history of blood clots or easy bleeding.  She has no history of infection and denies fevers chills or night sweats.  She has no significant history of peripheral vascular disease and can walk over a mile without difficulty.  She denies symptoms of transient ischemic attacks.  Left brachial ulnar and radial artery thrombectomy due to inflammation of the brachial artery and thrombus in the brachial artery extending into the origin of the radial and ulnar arteries done on 3/22/2021. Discharged on aspirin 81 mg daily and Lovenox. Has transitioned to Eliquis now. Complication of left arm wound dehiscence. Debrided by wound clinic on 4/9/2021. Taken for washout/wound closure on 4/13/2021. Continues to f/u in our clinic.

Took Tylenol and seemed to be improving, but pain started getting worse a few days later and had muscle spasms occasionally.   Dr suggested  using Motrin instead of Tylenol during the day and 1/2 10 mg Baclofen tablet nightly.   Appears to be getting better at the moment, but that happened earlier before I went to the DR.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine --Approximately 4 days after the second dose was administered on 3/1/21, I woke up with a totally weak left leg.  I would have fallen down getting out of bed except I usually first grab a cane because that is also the same leg that I had TKR in about 2 years prior.  I wonder of the vaccine somehow affected the artificial knee--but the whole leg was not able to bare my weight--as if the muscles and tendons were gone.  I used a walker to slowly bring back the leg support over about 5 hours.  I told my knee doctor about this on 3/9/21  and he said one other patient of his who also had TKR 2 years ago (same as mine) told him about the same thing happening to him.  Now I am having a &#34;tight knee&#34; in that same leg and am very worried.

                                                Pt called and stated she received her vaccine on 05/18/2021, started having arm and neck pain, nausea, lightheadedness, stomach cramping, on 05/19/2021 in the afternoon. She sat up to get some saltine crackers to help her feel better, and she started to get dizzy. She then remembers trying to hold herself up, and then the next thing she recalls is laying on her back on her kitchen floor. It was then she felt dizzy again and then sat herself up enough so she could vomit 3 times. She also reported having profuse sweating and dry heaves. Her husband found her about 30 minutes later when he returned home from picking up lunch for them. She refused to go in the hospital to get checked out until she called her PCP on 05/21/2021 because she still was not feeling well. They recommended that she go into the ER. She had a CT scan, UA, troponin levels checked, and other blood work. Was treated with IV lactated ringers in the ER, and given meclizine for the dizziness. UA showed positive E. coli, indicative of a UTI. Pt chose to be discharged home instead of staying overnight because she stated she would get plenty of rest at home. Spoke with pt 05/25/2021 after she had called to let us know what happened. Pt has scheduled additional CT scan on 06/08/2021 and follow-up with a neurologist 06/10/2021.

                                                I began feeling dizzy, nauseous, weak in legs, blurred vision in early May which continued throughout the month.  On June 3 I experienced an event like no other.  My legs felt like rubber and  tried but could not speak.  My husband carried me to the sofa, when I sat down I felt disoriented, and saw a circle in front of my eyes.  I felt as if I was about to pass out.  I saw my cardiologist a week later.  He is concerned that the neurological symptoms are new.  He suspects I had a mini stroke despite being on blood thinner for my CHF and referred me to a neurologist.  He suggested I report this sudden change to VAERS.

The rash is red, with little pea shaped pimples that are burning and spreading all over her body.  The skin is prickly and very sensitive.  She still cannot think clearly and still has fatigue.  Her legs are bothering her know as well.  She saw PCP Dr on 2/19/21 and told to take Claritin which did not help.  On 2/26/21 she saw Dermatologist PA.  She was given a skin biopsy.  She was diagnosed w/ spongiotic and interfaced dermatitis w/ rare eosinophils.  She was prescribed triamcinolone.  She has since developed nose bleeds that would come every couple of days then started happening daily.  She has had blood test which white blood count cells were up, the doctor thinks the steroid cream may have caused this so she is no longer using it.   She has been to the doctors several times due to the skin rash and nose bleeds and nothing the doctors have done for her has helped with her symptoms thus far. She goes back to the doctors in a couple of weeks for another biopsy.  These has had these symptoms for months.

                                                On 4/7/21, she received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Then, around 5/1/21, she developed fevers to 102 with associated fatigue and poor appetite, but no other clear localizing symptoms, including no sore throat, cough, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, N/V/D, joint swelling/pain, rashes, or dysuria. She presented to an outside hospital ED where she had an infectious workup that included a CXR concerning for LLL pneumonia. She was prescribed doxycycline for 7 days with resolution of her fevers and subjective improvement.    In early June 2021,  the patient redeveloped fevers and chills, worst at nighttime, without localizing symptoms. Her appetite and energy level remained very poor despite several changes to antidepressants as an outpatient. She was treated with nitrofurantoin x 5 days for presumed UTI, but fevers persisted, still without associated cough, CP, or SOB. With going fevers, fatigue, and poor appetite resulting in ~18lb unintentional weight loss, she was admitted to Hospital on 6/22/21 for further evaluation.  While at Hospital, she continued to have fevers to 102&#43; without localizing symptoms despite empiric doxycycline. A broad infectious workup returned negative. CT chest and CTAP were also unrevealing for a cause of fevers. She was found to have an elevated ferritin, LDH, and triglycerides, as well as a low fibrinogen, concerning for HLH (high H-score). She received high-dose dexamethasone. Bone marrow biopsy was performed that was negative for malignancy. However, peripheral flow cytometry returned with a clonal B-cell population, her soluble IL-2 was elevated, and she was found to have splenic enhancement on PET-CT, all concerning for occult lymphoma as the potential driver of her HLH. She remains admitted and is critically ill with complications of DIC and bleeding that preclude a splenic biopsy to confirm the suspected diagnosis of lymphoma. Since her fevers, malaise, and fatigue started less than 1 month after her second dose of the Moderna vaccine, and the patient was insistent that she &#34;hadn&#39;t felt right&#34; since she received that second dose of the vaccine, we decided to report this event in the VAERS system.

                                                Seizure like episode on 1/12/21, one week after vaccine, last 1.5 hours, consisting of both eyes twitching and clenching/spasm of right hand and arm.  EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

Waited till Saturday, the 29th to see a doctor., and she diagnosed that I had Shingles. She gave me two medicines to get from my druggist. One was valacyclovir and the other was HYDORcodone. These helped to relieve the pain. I was limited to  5 of the HYDROcodone,  so when I was finished with those tablets, my nighttime pain in my shoulder was very uncomfortable.

I was seen by emergency medical personnel, had an EKG, and then my children, with whom I live, took me to see my primary care provider who ordered some basic blood tests: a CBC and panel.  All blood tests were normal as well as the EKG, I assume.  We think the faint was perhaps triggered by the diarrhea and exertion of chores in addition to the vaccine&#39;s effect .    Since then I have had fatigue.

She stated it was oval in appearance and covered most of the upper arm.  She noted a lump in her underarm of the left axilla also.  Denied any fever or other symptoms and otherwise felt fine.  On 3/9/21 she noticed a lump in the groin area and noticed that walking was a little more difficult than usual since both of her knees bothered her.  3/12/21Pt went to orthopedic surgeon and had a &#34;cortisone injection&#34; in the right knee.   This afternoon, the patient&#39;s daughter suggested that she go a local Urgent Care because the patient stated that the lump (previously in groin area)  &#34;was moving.&#34;  She waited in there for over one hour and then a nurse came out and told her to go to the ED for evaluation of her left upper arm for the redness and swelling.  She went directly to the ED and is being evaluation and having bloodwork done.  Daughter said if the lab results are normal, her mother will be discharged with an oral antibiotic and benadryl

                                                Several days after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine for COVID 19, I began have pain in all the joints in my hands, shoulder.  Unable to use my hands due to excruciating pain.  The pain began  3-4 days after the 2nd shot, starting in 2 of my fingers and progressively moved to all the joints in all of my fingers, wrists and my shoulders.  In addition there is swelling. I have very little use of my hands, requiring assistance to care for myself.  I have never had joint pain in my hands before.  The pain has continued for 2 weeks non-stop.  At the doctors recommendation I have been taking Tylenol for Arthritis, however this does not alleviate the pain, only reduces some of the discomfort.

She said within 3 days her legs started to go numb and especially her thigh muscles and her veins in her left foot were engorged. She said she went to the ER and they rxed 40mg prednisone for 4 days and her papers from the ER read &#34;allergy.&#34;  When I spoke to her for the second time and advised her she does not qualify for a second moderna vaccine, patient said that when she went to the ER she went for abdominal swelling, leg swelling, leg numbness, and swelling of the left ankle and foot. I confirmed with her that her symptoms have all improved and she said &#34;yes, tremendously.&#34; She said she spoke to her PCP and at least one additional doctor yesterday.

This has continued for 4 WEEKS and is just beginning to slightly  let up. My immune system has been in the worst flare I have ever experienced  in all the 20 years I have had auto- immune flares--it just cannot seem to down regulate itself and I have crippled up badly as a result.  Every movement hurts--even my chest hurts every time I take a breath!

                                                The patient received her FIRST dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/26/21 and SECOND dose on 2/23/21. On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

On 04-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (hit her head and blacked out) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling awful), MALAISE (not felt well ever since), DECREASED APPETITE (don&#39;t feel like eating), COVID-19 (feeling the same symptoms as she did when she had covid), TASTE DISORDER (taste not the same), HEADACHE (headache), FATIGUE (Fatigue), MYALGIA (mucsle aches), NAUSEA (slight nausea) and INJECTION SITE LYMPHADENOPATHY (problem with a lymph node in that arm). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (hit her head and blacked out), FEELING ABNORMAL (feeling awful), MALAISE (not felt well ever since), DECREASED APPETITE (don&#39;t feel like eating), COVID-19 (feeling the same symptoms as she did when she had covid), TASTE DISORDER (taste not the same), HEADACHE (headache), FATIGUE (Fatigue), MYALGIA (mucsle aches), NAUSEA (slight nausea) and INJECTION SITE LYMPHADENOPATHY (problem with a lymph node in that arm) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Mammogram: sensitive (Inconclusive) Sensitive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.

                                                Within a couple of hours of the first vaccine, after a long walk, my R hip/leg became weak and unreliable to the extent that I was limping and it has continued to be a problem.  I&#39;d had no problem at all with that since recovering from the surgery done in April 2019.  I delayed the second vaccine until 5 weeks, and after some gradual improvement, it did get somewhat better during that fifth week -- though still not normal.  Prior to the first vaccination, I was accustomed to walking 1 to 2 miles almost every day with no difficulty at all.   The initial reaction to the second dose was less than with the first.  (I didn&#39;t walk for two days after that one.)  However, it worsened over the next couple of weeks so that again I could barely walk 1/4 mile without making things worse again.  Now it&#39;s about 3 1/2 weeks since dose #2 and it does seem to be starting to improve, but slowly.  (And I took ibuprofen for 5 days last week, 400 mg 2x/day, which helped.)   The only other reaction I had to either dose was the usual sore arm.  Neither affected the L hip which still has severe arthritis.   I have kept a day-by-day journal with details.

Today it&#39;s back with a vengeance, rash is redder and spots larger. Doesnt itch and not sore. A couple weeks ago severe joint pain started. This too comes and goes. I had absolutely NONE of these symptoms before the vaccine!

Patient subsequently transferred to HCF on 4/28/21 for concerns of Guillain-Barré syndrome with recent COVID-19 vaccination (Moderna: first dose on 4/14/21) with lower extremity paraplegia lack of deep tendon reflexes. Unable to perform MRI due to type of pacemaker that patient has. Lumbar puncture done 5/1/21 was consistent with Guillain-Barré with elevated protein. However, patient had minimal improvement in symptoms despite full 5-day course of IVIG. During her hospitalization, concern emerged for central compression and after further imaging patient was subsequently found to have a T8 compression fracture, spinal mass, and severe spinal canal stenosis at the level of the compression fracture. Spinal biopsy completed suggestive of DLBCL. Hematology/Oncology were consulted, and chemotherapy initiated. Bone marrow biopsy done on 5/7/21 with results pending as of 5/11/21.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

                                                Few hrs after getting shot at mid day,  lower back started aching.  By 10:00 p.m. my lower back, sides were in pain and abdominal muscles and stomach were like frozen in place.  Couldn&#39;t move anything and the area seemed to be swollen.  Had  lost appetite in late afternoon so had not eaten dinner, only liquids since figured I needed something.  Couldn&#39;t sleep, aspirin didn&#39;t help.  Next day around  noon my abdominal area was better and pain decreasing  on sides.  Still no desire to eat. Trouble sleeping,   2nd day after shot, still  lower back pain, feel bloated, no desire to eat.  Very little side pain.   Had slight headache   This third night after shot I could finally  sleep.  This fourth day I felt back to normal.  During all this time, the arm that had the shot never really bothered me

It looked like there were 2 giant hives on my my arm (bigger than a nickel). Took 1 Benedryl (25mg), which didn&#39;t help. Hardly slept due to itching, and soreness to the touch. I can&#39;t wear a blouse with a sleeve. Today (Sunday 1/24), the redness came together into 1 big red blotch, measuring  2&#34;x3.5&#34;. Hot to the touch, and very sensitive. I feel pain into my shoulder blade area and where my arm meets my body in the front. Also, pain going towards my elbow. Ice / cold packs make it feel better. I will call for Dr. appointment tomorrow (Monday morning).

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

                                                Got the vaccine and was feeling tired, and her arm hurt, an all she wanted to do was lay in bed with her heating pad.  The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

I was not ill before I had the vaccine.  I only know that after my reaction to the second Moderna Vaccine, I had side effects and never felt well after the vaccine.  My bloodwork done for my Wellness Checkup showed low platelet and as time went by my white count went higher and higher above normal.  Weekly bloodwork and testing of my blood showed that &#34;something&#34; caused my platelets to fight, thus dropping my count to  a low of 21.  What caused the platelets to attack?  We will never know.  Now, with all the study done by my Oncologist, I am beginning to heal.  It all started after my Moderna Vaccine.  Do you think that the vaccine may have caused my health issues?

I advised her to take Claritin during day and Benadryl at night and NSAID for pain to see if improvement. I told her to trace perimeter of the swollen area to see if improvement, if yes then continue, if not or if pt develops fever or feels worse then to seek immediate medical advice

After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics. While hospitalized, she had a repeat of a rash/swelling at injection site that began about 48 hours after vaccination.  The hospital treated the rash with some barrier cream and within 48, the redness, rash and swelling abated.

However, unlike the first dose, on the next day,  the muscle soreness was accompanied by a  large red rash and swelling  just below the injection site.   Today, the third day, the  muscle soreness is gone, but the rash is still there.   It is tender and warm to the touch, and itches.   I have no fever or other symptoms.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Cancer ((has cancer, no thyroid)) and Cardiac disorder (congestion cardio attack before the vaccine) in February 2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Shingles (Patient has experienced four times since her twenties and suffering since vaccination) and Bell&#39;s palsy (She had bell&#39;s palsy 2 days after the vaccine.) on 14-Mar-2021. Concomitant products included ALPRAZOLAM (XANAX) for Anxiety, DICLOFENAC SODIUM (DICLOFENAC SODIUM ER) for Arthritis, LEVOTHYROXINE, OMEPRAZOLE, ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM (LIPITOR), ISOSORBIDE MONONITRATE, DICYCLOMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, ALOE VERA, UREA (STRATUM), ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (BABY ASPIRIN), VITAMINS NOS, PROBIOTICS NOS, PREDNISONE and VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID] for an unknown indication.    On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PARAESTHESIA (littles tingles). On 14-Mar-2021, the patient experienced FACIAL PARALYSIS (bell&#39;s palsy after the vaccine) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 23-Mar-2021, the patient experienced BACK PAIN (back pain like a heart attack). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HERPES ZOSTER (Shingles). At the time of the report, FACIAL PARALYSIS (bell&#39;s palsy after the vaccine), PARAESTHESIA (littles tingles), BACK PAIN (back pain like a heart attack) and HERPES ZOSTER (Shingles) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 06-Jan-2021, COVID-19: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       When patient received the vaccine felt like the solution going under her armpit to the back side, she felt littles tingles there. On 30MAR2021 she went to the cardiologist. They did a check, and all was ok. She was concerned because she has a congestion cardio attack before the vaccine (Feb2021).  Very next day she went to the dermatologist because her doctor recommended. She was diagnosed with shingles (where she thinks the solution went, is there where she had the shingles).  Wants to know if she still needs to get the next shot. Permission follow-Up directly: yes.

Harsh &#34;hot&#34; pain in shoulder joint, radiating across shoulder blade and up neck to base of skull. Have not reported to doctor, for why bother??? Only pain med I can use is tylenol, and it helps some. Also use ice pax wrapped around  neck.  Pain at times is disabling. Will not take a booster. Also will not advertise this side effect. But have a friend who is also suffering same pain.

                                                February 10, 2021 my right arm at the injection site felt tight and appeared a little red. The pain I have experienced has been short pains which radiate up into my neck.  I was told that one one the side effects could be a knot but this is a slight swelling  which leaves the upper right arm puffy.  The only medication that I have taken for pain is Aleve.

The worst has been the increasing tremors in my head and hands.  This is what I am most concerned about. I have a history of tremors, but since the vaccine, there has been a marked increase in the tremors. I did not report this right away because I thought it would go away, but now on the eve of my second shot I am very nervous that it will get even worst.  My physician encourages me to continue and get through the side effects than to get COVID with my underlying lung condition. I want to take the vaccine but am nervous that I am experience so much shakiness even a month after the first shot. Would you advise me to take the second shot? My shot is scheduled for tomorrow, February 17.

                                                Within the first 24 hours she showed a look of serious aging, and then the following day extreme pain in the mid and left side back making it difficult to walk or move. Severe pain. The pain seem to shift around like more nerve pain showing in the muscle . Started on the left side but moved around.  This was initially helped with some strong curcummin/boswella (inflammation pain formula at our health food store) and a homeopathic remedy. But the symptoms came back and kept going . She is very active and was unable to do her regular routine. She was sleeping more and in considerable pain. After several days, we tried what another country recommends for reactions to vaccines and it seemed to help her within a very short time. There is still now residual pain but she is better.  We have GREAT concern over what a second dose could do and do not feel that with such a strong reaction the second dose safe. Also a great concern that the same amount of vaccine for a 250 pound person and a 100 pound elder. She is very tiny bones and weighs around 100 pounds are less. Very concerning as no medicine is usually the same for everyone. Also a concern of why just one month from second dose when it takes a known 6 weeks for blood to change. A high chance of severe reaction can happen with such a close proximity and a second dose. We would like to see advise of no second shot or considerable less for small people. CDC person recommended she switch vaccines?  That seems risky and there is no studies of adverse reaction to combining two different vaccines.  She would like to be comfortable moving around in public and is of great health for her age so this reaction was very concerning. If she had such a reaction on FIRST DOSE....wouldnt that be a indication that her body reacted and a second dose not necessary  advisable. Please advise. This is of great concern to all of us who love her and of great concern for the general public who may be at risk for such adverse effects. I put unknown below because she still feels some pain even though it is less.

                                                About 18 days after shot, I noticed pain on my left side in evening after sitting in bed two hours watching TV.  Turning or changing position hurt but passed if I held the position.  It affected my sleep a bit more as the days past.  But during the day, I could dance, move with no or sometimes, a tiny bit of pain in my side or back.  Because it got more painful at night and early mornings when I got up I decided I better contact you and delay the second dose which is scheduled for Friday, 4/23/2021 at l:00 pm.  Should I take Tylenol in the meantime at night.  Again I feel fine during the day when I am moving around.  But there is a reminder from time to time.

                                                My arm got progressively sore. within the week it migrated to the muscle next to my breast and up my neck. Two weeks later it settled in my shoulder and was very painful. It was akin to bursitis which I have never had in that shoulder but years ago I had bursitis in my other shoulder so I know what it feels like. But, now it has migrated to a sore neck and  causing stiffness when I try to turn my head.  It seems to hurt worse when I lay down and try to sleep than it does when I am sitting or standing. I have not gone to the doctor so I cant answer item 19. Driving is too painful so I probably wont go to the doctor and hoping it will get better. But, I am wondering if I should get my second shot in June or not.

She went to bed that evening and everything was hurting, and felt very nauseous.  She had a very bad nights rest, but when she woke up her temp was over 100, normal is 97.  She did take her morning meds and an extra-strength Tylenol and went back to bed.   She took Tylenol, was feeling better, but still the chills and fatigue and was better.  The problem with the headache continued and her temp was about 99.   On 2/12/21 had temp over 100 again, no energy, slept a lot.   Had difficulty sleeping that night and had sweats, had temp, nausea and was shaking.  On Monday felt shaky, chills and difficulty sleeping.  On Tuesday she was having headache, not sleeping well and no energy.   She also was not sleeping well, had  a headache.  By 2/17/21 was feeling better, not great as she was still not sleeping well.   She did have covid in April of last year, and was not allowed to see her husband who was in a nursing home until 6/3/20.   When she had the covid test she was inconclusive and that&#39;s why she could not see her doctor.   Her doctor did the antibody test that showed she had antibodies.  She is feeling back to normal as of today, 3/8/21.  She had the malaise from COVID after she got the 1st vaccine.  Feels that they should ask people before getting the vaccine if they had COVID.

                                                An avid crossword puzzle worker for 50 yrs, suddenly doesn&#39;t work them anymore. Short-term memory is worse than before.  Left side of the mouth droops.  Weight loss. Confused. Complained about leg weakness, legs and knees hurt, hard to walk, being tired, drooling, dry mouth, mind not right.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine administrations (Moderna) 3/23/21 lot# 013A21A 4/20/21 lot# 013A21A  Admission to Hospital (5/2/21 ? 5/10/21) for hypertension and acute on chronic back pain requiring ICU admission, hyponatremia thought to be due to SIADH. CT of abdomen done at hospital noting no significant lumbar abnormalities and a plain film of her lumbar spine with no obvious compression fracture. Outside hospital notes do not further outline why she could no longer ambulate. Brain MRI done and negative during that admission. Discharged to a rehab facility for ongoing weakness.  On 5/13/21, patient?s son requested admission to hospital for further evaluation. She states that she feels confused and her legs are very heavy and she can barely move them.  Notably she lives alone in her own home, used to drive, did not use any assistive device to walk, and paid her own bills until 2 weeks ago. The symptoms did occur approximately a week after receiving her last Covid vaccine. Pt also notes around April 1, 2021 having taken an engorged deer tick off her head. 5/14/21 Lyme serology IgM &amp; IgG = negative. Neurology was consulted. She had an MRI of her thoracic and lumbar spine, as well as an LP. She had had an MRI brain at a hospital. Her MRIs did not reveal a source of her weakness and pain. Her CSF revealed albuminocytologic dissociation. Given this finding and the constellation of symptoms and LP findings, it was thought she had Guillain Barre Syndrome, presumably due to her COVID vaccine. She was given IVIG for 5 days. She improved with this.    As above, she had a recent admission for hyponatremia and hypertensive urgency. Here, her blood pressure was somewhat labile, but at times was low. She was started back on amlodipine and carvedilol, but at much lower doses with plan for ongoing monitoring. In terms of her hyponatremia, her salt tabs were stopped, and eventually her fluid restriction was able to be lifted. Her sodium was 136 at discharge.

                                                Early April 2021, my mother said she was experiencing pins, needles, numbness and pain in right leg (mild in left leg), her hands, severe back pain, and extreme fatigue.  She soon lost the ability to hold items in her left hand.  On May 10th she was in extreme pain, barely able to walk or hold herself up, making her mostly immobile up to the present day.  She has experienced repeated intense &#34;shock&#34; sensations down her right leg, and localized areas of intense pain in different parts of her body such as the hip bone, wrists, collarbone, and left side of temple that come and go.  In recent weeks, she&#39;s lost function of two fingers on the right hand.  For the past several weeks, she&#39;s had an intense itchy scalp.

She reports that approximately 1.5hrs after receiving her COVID vaccine, she began having pain in the top of her head, neck, between her shoulder blades, down both arms to her fingertips, and down her spine.  Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

This has been going on now for 3 weeks.   I have no other medical problems &amp; the only thing  different is I had the vaccine &amp; never had problems with being dizzy before.   Also the day after the vaccine I started with back pain that still has not gone away.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

                                                She got her vaccine, was tired, no energy.  No rash or fever, perhaps a reddened area around the vaccine site but it went away.  About a week later she found a lump by accident under her arm in the armpit but down a little further towards her breast.  The lump is painful when she puts pressure on it when she&#39;s trying to sleep.  She knows it&#39;s there.  She went to her PCP yesterday, 5/24/21 and he told her that they will watch it and it should dissipate.  He did not give her any treatment for it.  She did also have a stiff neck on the side of her vaccine and a headache, which have disappeared.  She just wishes it would go away as it&#39;s a nuisance.  Her doctor said that it was swelling of the lymph node.   If she wears something tight it hurts her, but otherwise it doesn&#39;t, especially if she wears a bra.  She just does not have the energy that she had before.    She did get a Prolia shot on 2/4/21 but had no reactions from that, and was told that it would not interfere with the vaccine.

She had seen her dermatologist that week for another issue and the dermatologist was so concerned that she described Keflex. The patient was afraid to take the Reflex as she has a PCN allergy so she presented to  Urgent care. She has a cellulitis in the arm.  She has antihistamine a home and took one last night. I advised her to take it nighty until resolves and to start Clindamycin  po TID x 10 days to treat cellulitis and also may take Famotidine prescribed by her physician which she had not started yet and may use OTC cortisone cream on area.

                                                History of Present Illness     89-year-old female with past medical history significant for osteoporosis and hypothyroidism, who initially presented to ER on March 2 due to lower extremity weakness and right knee pain after a recent fall.  Patient lost her balance and suffered a mechanical fall on February 22.  Patient developed right lumbar and hip pain radiating down her leg.  She saw Dr from orthopedics on February 26 who recommended offloading knee and wearing a knee immobilizer.  Patient was admitted to hospital on March 2 due to worsening knee pain and was incidentally found to be positive for COVID-19.  Patient had received her second Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on February 26.  Patient was evaluated by neurology during that hospital course, who recommended outpatient EMG, physical therapy, and pain management.  No evidence of Guillain-Barré or viral induced neuropathy.  Patient&#39;s lower extremity weakness did improve, and she was successfully discharged home with family and home health on March 5.   Patient reports doing well at home with family initially, was making improvements with her strength and was able to stand and take a few steps with walker and assistance.  On March 8, patient was in bed and she attempted to turn onto her right side, and as she was turning she felt a pop and a pain in her right hip that radiated down her right leg.  Since that time, patient reports having severe pain with movement, rates pain as 8/10 severity.  Denies falls or new trauma since her previous fall from February 22.  Patient was unable to control pain at home, so she came into the emergency department for evaluation.  Initial hip x-ray series revealed questionable greater trochanteric fracture.  CT of right hip subsequently revealed fracture.  Orthopedics consulted.  No significant laboratory abnormalities.  Foley catheter was placed in ER.  Patient was admitted to hospital service for management.  On my interview, patient reports that right hip pain is under good control as long as she does not move, but has 7/10 pain severity over her right lateral hip with movement.   Patient reports following Covid isolation protocols at home with family.  Reports that her Covid isolation will be completed on March 12.  Denies upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient has oxygen saturations of 100% on room air.
