Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

The symptoms I&#39;ve had from the shot are pretty much the same as when I was sick.  I was fortunate not to have any respiratory symptoms either time as confirmed by my oximeter.  I had two Antibody tests.  One on Nov. 23rd, which was positive for both  IgG and IgM.  I had my second anti-body test on 1/17/2021, the day of my injection which was positive for IgG and negative for IgM.  I have not contacted my doctor concerning this and I am taking Advil for the fever and ached and pains.  Today i feel better than yesterday.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine shot, my left upper arm from should down began to itch.  Slight red, under the skin &#39;rash&#39; could barely be seen.  The individual spots did not seem to be the specific irritant.  The arm around the shoulder was somewhat achy and tight feeling.  I was able to sleep through the night after rubbing on Sarno-anti itch lotion.  Could not get comfortable on my left side, with the shoulder area hurting.

                                                I had no side effects after the injection except for very slight arm discomfort for a day or two.  Then, the evening of Day 6 (Jan. 20) I felt a little itchy around the injection site.  Morning of Day 7 (Jan. 21) I was very itchy and my upper right arm was very itchy, red and inflamed.   I called my dermatologist, and she told me to use a prescription cream I had from an irritation  on my thumb last year, called Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.1%.   I also called my primary doctor,  to let her know what was happening.  Day 8 (Jan. 22) my upper arm was still very inflamed and seemed to be spreading wider across my arm, maybe 4&#34;x3&#34;.  Day 9 (Jan. 23) a little better. Day 10 (Jan. 24) much better. Almost gone. Little bit of red left. Still using cream until it goes away..

                                                Patient came out of a sleep feeling numb all over and head felt empty.  Thrashed about on floor with muscle spasms in both legs.  Kept trying to hold onto head and not swallow the tongue.  The attempt to swallow the tongue went on for one hour, if the patient was reclining  on a bed.  If standing, the tongue felt sore.  The patient was still shaken, the next morning.

The pain moved down to my right ankle and foot with severe muscle spasms pulling my right foot inwards toward my left foot. I could not walk to bathroom without screeming. Then it moved to my right hip area with muscle spasms across my lower back.  I am still experiencing pain and muscle spasms (not as severe) today at this writing. It seems to be attacking my body where I have old injuries.

I was awake and knew what was happening.  I don?t know how long it lasted. When the episode was over, I went to sleep.  I awakened in about 3 hours, went to the rest room, and returned to bed.  I was uneasy  and thought I might fall.  I slept another three hours and went to the bathroom again. I felt a little better. I got up in about two more hours and felt a little better. Didn?t feel good all day and my arm was really sore.

She went to bed around 8:00 PM and then she couldn&#39;t sleep all night.  She kept trying to drink liquid, running fever, hot and opened a window with temp being 30 outside.  She could hardly walk to the bathroom due to the muscle weakness and fear of falling.  She tossed and turned all night long.  She got up and her temp was 99.8, and she was told not to go to PT this morning.  She is being treated for a frozen shoulder.   She feels dehydrated and is drinking water, and going to drink Ginger ale and crackers due to the nausea.

Vitals, EKG, CT scan, and MRI conducted. MRI showed an acute mild stroke on R side of brain.  Over-night stay was recommended. Echocardiogram was performed the following day and nothing was abnormal. I am now on a heart monitor for 30 days. Upon departure of hospital the symptoms in L leg and arm have nearly resolved but face is still numb/decreased sensation. Plan to contact PCP tomorrow.

The next morning I woke up and the rash was there, and spread over the different areas of body. I was sweating bad, muscle pain, joint pain, and nauseated for about 3 days. I had knots in my arms. I went to the doctor last week, and she gave me a shot in the hip, it helped with the swelling.  Then I called her back and she called in a cream for me.  The other symptom remaining is the rash at the injection site, I have been putting the cream on it twice a day, taking Benadryl and Tylenol for pain

It persists without improvement today. I also had pain in the joints in my feet and ankles, hands. Some fatigue. No fever, no chills. I had NO reaction after 1st vaccination, although injection site was hot and very tender for days. Used left arm both times. I saw an online photo of &#34;COVID arm&#34; hypersensitivity reaction and looks exactly like mine. Really quite uncomfortable.

Made appointment with my MD. Day 4 of pain a large painful rash appeared on my R upper back, under the arm and upper chest. ( Quite sure it was shingles. Started on Famciclovir  500mg. and tramadol 50mg. Had severe case of shingles with fatigue and excruiciating pain.  My MD stated he has seen a number of patients post vaccine with shingles.  Was scheduled for second vaccine on February 16th. The pharmacist at the vaccine center would not approve booster, stating my immune system is already stressed.

                                                On the 9th day (Fri., 2/19) after my shot I developed a very intense rash all over my stomach, and on the underside of my breasts. It was very itchy.  I considered the possibility that it was the seafood soup I had eaten, but all day I also  had very bad pains in my lower back, left hip, and left knee. I had knee surgery in August, but this pain was much worse than I&#39;d had in months. The pain and rash continued thru the next day Sat., 2/20.  Then on Sunday the pain was completely gone, and the rash started to subside. Then the following weekend  (2/27 and 2/28) the rash had a mild flare-up, and there&#39;s mild itching off and on since them.

MY BUTTOCK AREA WAS EXTREMELY TENSE AND HURT TO STAND OR WALK.  THE PAIN WENT DOWN BOTH OF MY LEGS, MORE PROMINENT ON THE LEFT SIDE.  I HAD BEEN FEELING THAT PAIN FOR A FEW WEEKS, BUT IT WAS A DULL ACHE, NOTHING DEBILITATING.  I HAVE BACK PAIN, BUT THIS WAS INTENSE AND NOT A PAIN I&#39;VE FELT BEFORE.  AS THE DAY WENT ON, IT EVENTUALLY GOT A LITTLE BETTER.  WHEN I AWOKE THE NEXT DAY, I COULD BARELY GET OUT OF BED.  MY DAUGHTER HAD TO TAKE ME TO THE ER BECAUSE THE PAIN WAS SO INTENSE.

Started Saturday day after vaccination with fatigue to the point couldn&#39;t stay awake and weak. Sunday woke with bad ache all over and harder to move along with fatigue. Small headache along with slight nausea in afternoon. Woke about 5 am Monday with total sweat, then chills and couldn&#39;t warm up. still had fatigue but not as much pain. Called Hospital Covid Hotline as directed by my Dr.s office (never talked to my Dr.) Nurse with Hotline discussed it with me and we determined it was probably side effects. Since I am aware of allergic reactions, I didn&#39;t feel threatened, only messed up. The fatigue and some aches lasted throughout the weak, and I am still fatigued and weak compared to normal.Aches seem better.

                                                On March 9, I noticed some discomfort in my left arm.  Upon examination, I observed swelling in my left arm around the injection site. There was also redness around the site measuring 4 1/2? long and 3 1/2? wide. It was warm to the touch. I applied ice to the area and took a Benadryl capsule.   The ice brought down the swelling and the redness did lighten some.  Today I still feel some discomfort in the shoulder, the swelling is gone, and the redness, although lighter, has increased in size to 5 1/2? long.

Thereafter, through the night,  a  feeling of fever, back &amp; forth: skin hot, then normal feeling.  Some chills.  Took my temperature several times and would only get a normal reading.  Puzzled, because  I thought I must have a fever.....the STRANGENESS  of this  was that my skin felt like it was BURNING UNDERNEATH my skin....not like any fever I might have ever had. Still normal temp readings.   The next day...mostly in bed, tired, no appetite, continued fever feeling, but no fever temp reading.  The second day, up and around, eating.

                                                The evening  of the first shot on February 5, I had a strong headache, muscle aches and was extremely tired for the next two days.  I had brain fog for the next 2 weeks.  Tylenol and Advil mostly relieved physical discomfort.    I had the second shot March 16.  The next day I had a severe headache, no energy, achy body,  chills and fever and on the second day after the shot my temperature was 101.4 - 101.8.  Tylenol and Advil relieved the symptoms.  Today, one week after the second shot I developed a pungent chemical taste in my mouth and a similar sense of smell.  The tip of my tongue is tingling, and while I can breathe in deeply,  my chest feels heavy, like I&#39;m not getting enough oxygen.

The following day I was feeling a little better, but the chest pain was worrisome. I went to Urgent care and they said my EKG was not normal. I was taken to the hospital which was also the vaccine site. I was treated in the ER and they ruled out a heart issue with a complete workup. I was admitted for an unexplained bowel obstruction and remained in the hospital for four days. I got the second dose of the vaccine and I did not have any significant problems. I may have Covid-19 in the spring of 2020.

Pain bad enough Wednesday night/Thursday early morning to contact Dr. Thursday. He determined my pain was muscle pain. Suggested Aleve (as Tylenol and Advil weren&#39;t working) and heating pad (which I had used on Wednesday during day). Aleve helped a lot. Pain by today (Sunday) is minimal but still some minimal discomfort.

The next morning the swelling got worse and she also noted similar swelling around her Left Hallux Longus (similar to a pseudogout reaction). No intraoral swelling. Speaking clearly in full sentences.  She has never had similar reactions such as this nor has a h/o pseudogout or polyarthritis.

My left  knee replacement felt like it was in a vise,  This  was a  short lived event with some residual feeling in the knee in the morning.   3 days after injection  10:00 pm 1/30/2021- I noticed a small rash on my left abdomen near the navel, this rash moved quickly to the left and soon covered entire left abdomen, moving to the groin area then down left inner thigh.  I took a Benazepril and went to bed. During the night I woke up several time with a strong pressure in left bowel area. Changing position seemed to help and went back to sleep. woke up about 5 am and checked the rash which was mostly gone except for the original spot where it began.  The rash and pressure seemed to be restricted to front left side below waist area. It is now 11:00 am 1/31/2021 and I am feeling fine, very little residual rash at initial site.   I had not read anything about delayed reactions as late as 3 1/2 days after the injection so wanted to report this event.

On Jan 28, 2021 I noticed stiffness and pain in both of my knees. My Right knee was replaced in 2015 and my Left knee was replaced Oct 5, 2020.  I thought it was strange to have pain in the Right knee. The stiffness has increased in both knees since Jan 28. I otherwise feel fine but am having difficulty bending both knees and I have pain when I am weight bearing. I am wondering if the vaccine is attracted to artificial joints? I am scheduled to get my second dose on Feb 17.  Please advise if this is a common reaction.

                                                I took the first shot of Moderna?s COVID-19 vaccine  the middle of January. Two and a half weeks later, I developed a two inch rash above my right breast even though it didn?t itch or burn, if pressed, it hurt. I treated it with antibiotic ointment and calamine lotion. During that time, I experienced tiredness, exhaustion, sluggishness as well as aches around the right shoulder. I went to get a mammogram where they told me my lymph nodes were swollen on the right side under my arm. They had seen adults who had taken the shot develop swollen lymp nodes  which made it necessary to retake the mammogram. I also went to the dermatologist to see what the inch rash was, he took a biopsy, and it turned out it was shingles even though I had had the shingles shots a year before.

I took two Tylenol and went to bed.  I got up two times during the night to go to bathroom.  I felt more achy all over and unsteady on my feet. Did not want to get out of bed next day, so slept until noon.  At noon my temperature was 100.4. I took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours.  Had a very achy, miserable day and just rested.  Was somewhat better by bedtime and had a better next night of sleep. Next day am still achy but much better.

Then a couple of hours later she got a severe case of the chills.  She laid down and slept on and off for about 5 hours.  When she got up she took her temperature and it was 101.  She also had body aches in her back and her legs felt very heavy.  She then noticed a rash on her body from a line that went underneath her breast, and redness on the left side of her breast to her belly button, all red around the belly button.   When she realized she had a fever she took Tylenol.  The rash by Saturday was fading and she also had diarrhea on Saturday, persistent diarrhea.  She felt almost normal except that she was tired.  Today, 3/1/21 she has the returned diarrhea, doesn&#39;t k now if it was related to the vaccine.  She spoke to a nurse yesterday, and she told that she had a typical side effect from the vaccine.  She was not sure if the diarrhea was from the vaccine.

So I went to bed, but just as I would be close to falling asleep I&#39;d have to get up to empty my bladder. This was happening almost every 15 minutes for a few hours. I knew I probably should hydrate, but I chose not to because I wanted to get some uninterrupted sleep which I finally did at about 4:00am which only lasted a couple of hours. Then up at about 6:30am when I took some acetaminophin and went back to sleep. I was in bed all day, sleeping most of the time. When I&#39;d wake up I&#39;d take my temperature and most of the time I&#39;d hydrate. I haven&#39;t had anything to eat because I wasn&#39;t feeling  strong enough to even heat water for soup. My normal temperature is about 97.6 give or take. The highest temperature I had was 100 when I took another dose of acetaminophin. But one time it was 94.3!!! I started feeling better at about 8:30pm (3/1/21)  and was able to make myself some chicken noodle soup and had some cereal and cottage cheese with it. I finally felt &#34;normal&#34; on Tuesday morning (3/2/21) after getting a good night&#39;s sleep.

At 9:15 pm, I had chills and fever for 3 hours  and during that time, my right forearm, wrist and hand became very, very sore.  I  couldn&#39;t even flex my fingers the pain was so bad.  Pain throughout my body continued during the night, including stomach cramps, back and leg pain and then I took another 200 mg of Advil at 9:15 am on 3/4.  I feel I am 20% improved 25 hours after my second shot.

Upon awakening early on the morning of the second, I had moderate aching in all joints, headache, weakness and fatigue. I stayed quiet for day. Upon getting ready to shower on the morning of the 3rd I found I was covered with an angry bright red rash from my neck down to my knees both front and back. Because I did not shower on the 2nd of March I have no idea when it began. On Thursday my head still felt pressure but felt a little stronger and that evening I again showered and the rash looked less angry and bright. Waking this morning on Friday the 5th the rash is gone and I am feeling much better except for soreness in the armpit of the right arm that received the injection.

                                                I am starting this report with the current status of my, nearly, 6-week ordeal of  agonizing pain, doctor appts. debilitation, pain meds, a blood test and the final  MRI  this past Saturday, 3/6.  Finally, an MRI has confirmed physician&#39;s recent suspicion that my  second Moderna vaccination was improperly administered. In fact, it tore a  tendon in my right shoulder. I knew something was wrong when I saw how high  the needle was injected into my arm/shoulder. I just didn&#39;t know what the  ramifications would be.  I have been referred to a surgeon, and my appt. is 3/16).  Summary of Events:  On 2/1/21, I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine and had 2 days  of moderate pain and soreness.  But about 3 days later, 2/4, I awoke to excruciating shoulder/arm pain that had  me sobbing out loud. I took Tylenol and waited. Nothing. I took more Tylenol and  slowly the pain diminished. For an hour or so.  All I could do was lie on the couch, literally, groaning and unable to lift my arm  By evening, the only relief I could get was from an old (hip surgery) Oxycodone pill. I took 1/4 piece and slept the night.  Friday and Saturday I was totally debilitated. I couldn&#39;t lift my arm, care for my  dog or do anything but lie on the couch, still sobbing, until small pieces of the  Oxy set in again.  It was the weekend, and I didn&#39;t want to bother anyone but I never felt such pain  for such an extended time or survived so long on meds.  Monday morning, 2/8/21, I called my Doctor. I was very  concerned and really wanted to make sure this pain was still from the vaccine  and not some &#34;weird&#34; condition that might have hit me. The office told me the  pain was probably from the vaccine and advised me to keep taking Tylenol. So it  continued, on and off, relief and agony. I was sure it would stop. It didn&#39;t.  Thursday, 2/11, I saw the Doctor, in person.  Physician did not have an answer for the pain but gave me a prescription for  Celebrex and did a blood test to see if there was a bacteria infection that might  have invaded the area. We would wait for results. Another weekend of pain but  lessened a bit.  Around 2/13, a neighbor called me with an article he found about the SAME  situation MANY people were suffering (thousands) and LAWSUITS pending!! I  didn&#39;t know what was happening to me but the Gov&#39;t did. The article was found  on internet, 2/12, and printed an article from news paper, 2/12  No  other reports appeared anywhere. The pertinent findings of the article: thousands of vaccinated people (Covid and  flu) have reported similar pain and debilitation. The previous gov&#39;t has  introduced a law prohibiting lawsuits (l think against the pharmas but not the  administering agencies. Not sure.) that was to go into effect, 2/23. Again, not sure  of details.  But no one knows about this - people NEED to know. I immediately notified my  family and close friend about my situation. While the cause is not certain, it is  suspected that improper injection technique/training/experience is to blame.  To get the word out, I posted on social media, wrote representatives, etc.   And now I found you.

It has been 6 days, and it is somewhat better, but still quite limiting in what I can do. I sure wish I was told that this could happen.  I have osteoarthritis, and i rely on my left arm/shoulder when I take the stairs and do daily activities.  I am in a lot of discomfort and my activities have had to be quite limited.

I slept all day but by that evening I began feeling better and by the following day (day 2 after the shot) I felt normal except that my arm was still sore. It is now day 3 and my arm is still slightly sore but not limiting my use and is steadily getting better.

                                                Deep muscle pain and joint pain on hips, knees and ankles. No joint pain above the waist. No pain in a sitting or standing position. the pain happens at night when lying down often followed by cramping and &#34;charlie horse&#34;  symptoms. This has lessened somewhat after 2 weeks, but it does still happens. Really considering declining the second vaccine as that is reported to be much more likely to have side effects.

                                                Patient had small localized reaction for 2 days after injection that cleared. At approximately 7 days post injection she began to have another localized reaction that included reddness, swelling, pain, heat, and a dry skin tecture that progressed to cover the lateral aspect of upper left arm from shoulder to elbow. At time of examination by RN, the patient reports that size and intensity have been increasing for about 7 days.  Patient finds relief in hot shower.  No other treatments attempted at time of exam. Patient reported area may be improving, but she is unsure.   Area was outlined with marker by RN and patient was advised to see PCP for treatment if area increased in size and was not continuing to improve.  Counseled on using OTC benadryl cream if there was itching.

Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

                                                After administration of the Covid-19 vaccine I had 2-3 days of chills, muscle aches, fatigue, sore arm.  Symptoms gradually went away.  Then about the  7th day I started experiencing an itchy arm and a 6 inch circle of intense red at the injection site, with a wide band of white surrounding it, that itched unbelievably, was hot and swollen.  That lasted for several days, then began to subside and now is only slightly red, itches some and is no longer swollen or hot.   My question is:  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose, after experiencing this kind of reaction?

                                                The patient was administered the Moderna  Covid-19 vaccine on 1/14/2021. The patient reported experiencing arm pain around the injection site during the 2 days following the vaccination. The patient reported experiencing hip pain and trouble with her legs on 1/21/2021. On 1/22/2021 the patient reported not being able to stand without bracing. The patient visited a doctor on 1/25/2021 and there was suspicion for inflammation of the spinal cord leading to the patient being prescribed prednisone for 6 days. The patient visited the doctor again on 2/2/21 and another course of prednisone was initiated. The patient reports that she can stand from a sitting position without help getting up about half the time and that she had no such trouble standing prior to the vaccination. The patient returned to the second vaccination clinic on 2/11/2021, which was  4 weeks after receiving the first dose, to report her symptoms. The patient was not administered the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.

                                                I had Soreness on the arm the same day of vaccination, redness, achy in the muscle area on my arm. I think the injection was administrated to high in my arm.  The within the next 24-48 hours I had a headache and was tired. About the 4th-5th day I had tingling, prickly feeling across right shoulder, down both arms down to my fingers and down  my legs down to my toes. This lasted about 5-10 minutes. Then on the 16th it happened again but this time it was my whole body the torso area and my limbs. I also had weakness, I felt like I needed to hold onto to someone to be able to stand. I had an unstable feeling while standing. The headache has occurred on and off since time of vaccination  about 4-5 times.  I  went doctor on Tuesday 2/16/2021, I did not see my doctor this time I see a different  it was a lady doctor.  She wasn&#39;t aware of this being one of the side effects and just to monitor myself and return if the symptoms worsen. She thought it was safe to get the 2nd dose. I have a virtual visit scheduled with Dr. on 2/23/2023

Then was fine for 7 days.  On 2/5/2021, I went to get my B12 shot and asked the doctor to check left arm where Moderna shot was given as it was itching and a bit sore at the same time.  He told me I was having reaction.  By evening, a third of my arm around injected area was swollen an had red rash.  Then same symptoms of fatigue, etc. came back and I was in and out of bed for the next three days....then at end had a bout of diarrhea.

Top of foot and all along the outside side of it both on top and at bottom of foot all very painful. Ankle and leg very swollen and painful. Can&#39;t walk on foot.  As of 2/26/2021  swelling is not as bad and not so discolored but still some swelling and redness burning and very painful and still cannot use the foot.  Also have noticed places where  I have had surgery or injuries is hurting and being stiff. Am questioning whether or not I should get the 2nd shot. Concerned it will make situation even worse.

Did not feel well by bedtime, and a bit fuzzy-headed. Next day, I was fuzzy-headed, body stiff and achy, very tired, upper arm excruciatingly  painful. All symptoms began to clear significantly by evening, and back to normal by the following morning (2/10).

This is a typical allergic reaction  I have to ibuprofen, Benadryl and occasionally to something I?ve eaten (source unknown). This is a stronger reaction than I usually have. 24 hours after the shot, I had headache, muscle ache, chills, and fatigue. Those symptoms had pretty much abated about 36 hours after the shot. I did not notice the hive reaction earlier than 48 hours after the shot.

Too weak to make it to the bathroom by myself.  I felt like I was in a delirium but my husband said that I was not incoherent.  Appetite is still not normal.  Mouth was so dry that I was not able to feel any moisture at all which I feel led to my sinus infection.

                                                On day 3 there was slight swelling, tenderness and heat at injection site.  On the fourth  and subsequent days there has been a red rash. It is about 2&#43; inches wide and 3&#43;inches long. Still quite red and tender to touch. Muscle underneath the injection site is still tender. It has been eight days since the injection. I also experienced some lethargy for the first two or three days.

Is it a coincidence that I now have arthritic-like pain in my left fingers at the nail first joint? I am unable to use those fingers for even support of a small dinner plate. Advise if you can.

Feb.8, 2021 leg was continuing to swell.  went to doctor&#39;s office where he prescribed an ultrasound.  Was told there was a clot behind my left knee and in some of the smaller veins.  I had the chills, joint pains all over, which lasted about the three weeks, but was slightly different every day.  When I began the 20 mg dose of Xarelto, every symptom cleared up and I felt great.  I am continuing on the 20 mg Xarelto.

She was told by her rheumatologist to stop taking methotrexate for 14 days after she had the vaccine.  Yesterday afternoon the patient began experiencing left groin pain.  It progressively got worse.  During the evening it was 10 out of 10 in severity.  Patient took 100 mg of prednisone and also went ahead and took her methotrexate but got no pain relief from this. She localizes the pain to her left groin region.  She said the exact same thing happened 5 years ago right before she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.  The pain was localized to the same exact area. Over the course of her admission, the patient improved after the methotrexate and the prednisone she took the today prior to arrival, and also started on as needed Percocet.

The reason for this is unclear. After the injection a rust colored liquid came out immediately according to the patient. She feels that she may not have received all of the first dose of the vaccine. She later reported brusing and pain. The pain is still present to this day. She has received the second shot and did not experience any problems.

Hospital ruled out acute stroke but could not entirely exclude a cerebellar stroke due to her dizziness with vertigo and nystagmus (per hospital report). Client was in hospital 2.5 days, per hospitalist. note-all work up including MRI and tte were negative for acute findings- symptoms have resolved. Hospitalist noted symptoms may be worse following second shot. Spoke with client 1/19/21 and she reported feeling weak and tired only.

                                                6:13 pm - 9 pm   Extreme shooting pain, right shoulder, clavicle and neck causing my arm to jerk and sometimes my body spasmed. Pain was intermittent, coming and going but taking my breath away. I called CVS about aspirin and took 5 Baby Bayer aspirins. Pain went away at around 9 pm. Never returned. NO  other adverse effects  Surprising result is diminished pain in knees! When it gets cold, rainy, my knees have been extremely painful so I&#39;d have to lift myself up from sitting but since then the pain is at 1 to 2 on the scale rather than 10 ! It sounds strange but it has happened and that&#39;s why I felt I needed to report this.  Rainy days this week with no debilitating pain and I waited to report this for a week since the pain usually began days before.

THIS CONDITION, WHILE IT HAS DIMINISHED TO A POINT, BUT NOT COMPLETELY HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR 3 WEEKS. 1/25/21 I RECEIVED MY SECOND VACCINE IN MY RIGHT ARM.  WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HAD A BURNING SENSATION AT THE SITE OF THE LEFT INJECTION, I AM WRITING TO  YOU ALMOST A WEEK AFTER THE SHOT AND THE SORENESS STILL PERSISTS. THE RIGHT ARM WAS SORE AT THE INJECTION SITE ONLY LIMITED AFFECT ON MY ARM MOVEMENT. THAT HAS SUBSIDED A BIT.  BUT MY LEFT ARM IS STILL A PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH BOTH MY DOCTOR AND MODERNA. IN EACH CASE THEY BOTH RECOMMENDED ADVIL AND THAT I SHARE MY REACTION WITH ALL OF YOU. THIS HAS  BEEN A VERY LONG A DIFFICULT REACTION TO THESE 2 VACCINES. I RECOGNIZE THAT ANY REACTION IS BETTER THAN COVID BUT THIS SERIOUS REACTION IS UNEXPECTED.  THE DOCTOR&#39;S ASSESSMENT BOTH TELEPHONE AND IN-PERSON VISIT, ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOT HEART, ROTATOR CUFF OR BURSITIS RELATED. THE DOCTOR SUGGESTED IT WAS MOST LIKELY A VACCINE RELATED EVENT.

She did not have any problems with walking prior to the vaccine.

I had a little nausea and my hips felt like they were going to collapse. I started coughing and developed a fever. The muscle pain is very bad. my chest area is very uncomfortable. ( its not over my heart, its higher up) I took Tylenol that seems to be helping the muscle pain a little.

I vomited 5-6 times even though I had not eaten anything. I also had diarrhea. I had chills. Some point during the night I spiked a fever, I woke up and drenched. Yesterday  the 23rd I  had a fever, my stomach still does not feel settled. I have not ate much since Sunday but have been trying to stay hydrated with lots of water.  I also developed a cough yesterday. Tuesday night my temperature 100.6 and I think it got higher because I woke up once again drenched in sweat. This morning my temperature was 99.  I am achy today with muscle and joint pain,  my stomach feels better but I still leery of  eating. I did eat some Ginger ale and eat some saltine crackers.  I also feel horse.  I called my doctor yesterday and still have not heard back. I will call again today.  It feels like I feel better in the morning but as the day goes on I get worse and start feeling worse. I have been resting a lot in bed.

Second  shot on the rt. arm didn?t cause any problem.  No warm sensation on injection site. She feels heavy on lifting her left arm and pain on motion of left arm above injection site.  She has used arm sling to support lt. arm and took Advil occasionally, but no help. No fever elicited. I am very curious . Not sure what specialty dr to take her for further assessment.

Then had headaches off and on, as well as muscle and joint pain everywhere, weakness all over her body.  She also had a low grade fever Saturday and Sunday.  She did have the  Corona Virus in July of 2020.  She is feeling better today as far as the weakness, just a little bit of muscle and joint pain.  She did have a trace of nausea this morning, but took her medication and it subsided.  The weakness was something like she had never had before.  She took Tylenol for her symptoms.  She did not call her doctor.   Just has a small amount of symptoms, but still not feeling herself yet.

It would last about 5 - 10 min., stop for the same amount of time, then start up again.... on &amp; off until close to 11:00 pm.   Since someone else I know had the same thing happen the day after her shot, I assumed I had the same symptom, tho&#39; it was very frightening.  A week later after going to bed on Friday night, I woke at 2:00 a.m. to the same pain only this time on my left side.  Thinking I could be having a heart attack, I went to the hospital where I was admitted after having a series of tests.  I was there for 2 days during which time I also began to have un-controllable diarrhea.  Altho&#39; they could find nothing wrong with my heart,  after scans, x-rays, a stress test, numerous blood tests etc., they cannot say positively whether or not it was from the Covid vaccine.  I tho&#39;t it best to report this in case others have similar events.  I had the MODERNA vaccine

                                                The patient stated that she gets paralyzed after getting vaccines.  I asked her if she had someone in the pharmacy to help her. She said she came alone.  I told her I would have her wait 30mins after dose to make sure there were no issues. After I gave her the shot, she looked at me and said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. Then she looked and said my neck hurts. So I had her take deep breaths with me to get her to calm down as she appeared anxious. She was doing great then she went limp. I held her head up and asked her is she was ok.   She said she was, but then her breathing become shallow. She was un responsive at this time with her tongue pushing her mask off her mouth.  So I lowered her mask and her tongue appeared to be enlarged.  I had my technician call 911 and I gave her a dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg.   She was unresponsive, but breathing on her own.  The paramedics came and got her vitals, placed her on stretcher, and put in a medicine line to give her medications if need be.  She left somewhat unresponsive. They said she should be fine  and took her to ER.

                                                Experiencing muscle weakness in legs and arms.  Feel as if I have over-stressed those muscles, and they resist by being weak and feeling as if they sort of tremble.  I usually walk one mile a day and as I was walking the day after my injection my calf in my left leg shortly after I started began to tighten up.  At first I thought I would press on through but the muscle tensed more something like a &#34;Charlie Horse.&#34;  I quit walking came in an rested.  I have not attempted my mile walk since then because my leg muscle is still sore from the cramp.  When I raise my arms they feel heavy and seem to quiver and my legs do the same as I&#39;m doing my stretching exercises.     I have been waiting to contact anyone to see if time would take care of this problem I am having.  I am seeking guidance as to whether or not I should proceed with my second injection on 18 Feb 2021.   I am waiting for my doctor&#39;s office to respond regarding my call about this.  I did speak with a nurse at the local HD who said I should file this side effect event report with you.  I have never had a reaction to any of my flu shots and I have had one each year for a number of years.  One thing I do want to mention is that my mother took the flu shot the first year it was offered and she was one who experienced muscle loss due to it and never completely recovered muscle strength.

                                                Suddenly this morning, 13 days after receiving the first Covid Moderna vaccine - my arm is red and feverish at injection site.  In the meantime starting Sunday, Feb. 14th, I had pain in right chest and right upper back, that I contributed to making a wrong move and straining muscles.  The back pain is better, but I still have it when I reach high , move wrong, or take a deep breath.

                                                Beginning about 4 hours after receiving shot, muscle aches in arm, from elbow radiating up the arm, over the shoulder thru collarbone &amp; up the side of the neck to the ear.  By 6 hours after the shot, pain was excruciating and I was in literal Agony for the next 8 hours. It felt like a hot poker was being pushed along that pathway.   Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen had no effect.  I could not sleep &amp; could barely move the arm  at all.  (I am Not a pain Wimp)  I would say this was the longest lasting without relief/strongest pain I have ever experienced and I have had one child;&#43; hip &amp; shoulder surgery which required almost no after surgery medication at all.  By 5 a.m. I was able to sleep a bit &amp; most of the extreme pain was gone by 8 a.m.  I had some headache the following day and was barely able to function (I live alone) just from all over tiredness.  About 36 hours after injection, I was back to normal.

Went to bed, with 2 @400 mg. Tylenol boosted during the night with Tramadol 50 mg.   Was able to drive &amp; swim in the morning (21 hours) post. 24 hours post: extreme fatigue (kept falling asleep), then felt like I&#39;d been run over by a rototiller. Aches in joints, body, and skin.  2 @ 400 mg Tylenol alleviated symptoms enough to sleep for 2 hours. Arose at 3:30 pm feeling better. Not great, but better ! Better enough to feed animals and prepare dinner for myself.

I thought nothing of it and got my 2nd shot,on 2/5/2021,but the pain increased every day and I finally called my rheumatologist, who ordered CRP and sed rate.  The lab tests were elevated and he told me to increase the prednisone to 10 mg, which did very little.  The pain now was also in my shoulders and neck.  I eventually went to 20 mg of prednisone, but that still does not relieve all the pain.  I use excedrin during the night to help tide me over.  I will be seeing my rheumatologist in April for follow up, but the pain is worse than it was when it started.

I had Extreme fatigue, nausea, headache, balance was off, muscle and nerve and back pain.  Just took covid test and just got results--Negative. (3-19-21)  The symptoms subsided March 12.  Still vaguely experiencing all of them.   Should I take the 2nd shot.  Feel those results would return at an even heightend level.  Pharmacist said I was probably 85 % covered now with these effects from the 1st shot and should not take the 2nd.  My Dr.  said the 2nd shot was my call to make and that I should report it to CDC.

No official diagnosis, treat as  ITP.   Follow up visits with oncologist/haematologist to keep an eye on platelets as they increase.   March 30-Apr 4 - ER visit due to swelling of ankles, feet, and left arm. Tests show superficial blood clot, fluid on lungs, and pneumonia. Oncologist said that &#34;we have no official diagnosis&#34;, that she&#39;s being treated for ITP.   April 6-14 - follow up visit to oncologist/haematologist show elevated kidney enzymes, then later liver enzymes,  low sodium.   April 14 - decision to move to short term rehab for regular PT and OT. Continued swelling (fluid in third spaces.)   April 21 - visit to cardiologist to perform cardioversion, successful (during first week of hospital stay, heart rhythm med had to stop).   April 23 - facility nurse discovered significantly low Hemoglobin and a blood transfusion was ordered.    April 24 - returned to short term rehab facility.   April 25 - discovered my mother on O2 and state of health was different,  extremely weak and not moving, arm hurting badly. I insisted that her oncologist is contacted. Transported to ER. Discovered her blood work abnormal. After stabilizing her, rushed to the hospital ICU.   April 26 -  Discussed with her ICU doctor the history of what you have read above. He explained that the covid-19 vaccination has a tendency to affect three proteins specifically that clot and thin blood. I begged him to &#34;get it out of her system.&#34; Her bleeding was significant and platelets dropped, again. Still has her mental facilities. Responding well to aggressive treatment: albumin transfusion,  plateletpheresis, and CRRT. Pleural catheter to remove fluid from the lungs. Mention of Sepsis.   April 27 - Lifted her head up today, opened her eyes, making doctors very happy.  Her cardiologist and the ICU doctor both said they were &#34;confused&#34; and everything happening to my mom was &#34;a mystery.&#34; Though going in to the evening, her nurse expressed to me that she&#39;s worried. The ICU oncologist called me at home in the evening.  He asked me if she had been having a fever on a regular basis. He said he thought it could be TTP or a rare disease called HTH, but both results wouldn&#39;t be back for one week. He planned to consult with a doctor.  He explained to me that the blood was attacking itself and &#34;confused,&#34;  and that her organs were shutting down. He indicated that the blood work wasn&#39;t indicating significant infection. He referenced how the vaccination has made her auto immune system &#34;go crazy.&#34;   April 28 -  I get a call very early from the nurse that she has been fighting with my mother&#39;s blood pressure all night, trying to keep it elevated. She told me to come to the hospital, because she had taken a turn for the worse. I arrive to find my mother&#39;s eyes wide open, breathing shallow, and blood pressure steady, but drops without assistance from medication. She continues to have her mental facilities. She passed away, organs shutting down, and blood pressure dropped.

It is in the same arm in which she got the vaccine. She tried tylenol but it didn&#39;t help. I applied Voltaren gel to the wrist and that helped the pain. I advised if it worsens for her to return.

                                                Seizure like episode on 1/12/21, one week after vaccine, last 1.5 hours, consisting of both eyes twitching and clenching/spasm of right hand and arm.  EMS called.  BP normal.   Continuing weakness of right arm and right leg, which was side weakened by stroke.  Could no longer stand or walk on right leg.  Some slurring of speech. Some confusion.  Went to hospital 1/14.  No evidence of stroke or current seizure.  Considered problem to be mild UTI, started antiobiotics, rapid improvement.  Discharged 1/17. Woke up 1/18 with aphasia.  Went to urgent care, sent immediately to hospital.  Doctors found no evidence of stroke or seizure.  Consider problem to be due to inflammation, caused by mild UTI (which was cleared by antibiotics) or perhaps due to inflammation caused by Covid vaccination.  The inflammation reinitiated the symptoms of her stroke, although she never had expressive aphasia prior to this, only word-finding problems, which had been resolved.

                                                Shoulder pain within 10 min. after shot.  Rash started the next day. Waited till Saturday, the 29th to see a doctor., and she diagnosed that I had Shingles. She gave me two medicines to get from my druggist. One was valacyclovir and the other was HYDORcodone. These helped to relieve the pain. I was limited to  5 of the HYDROcodone,  so when I was finished with those tablets, my nighttime pain in my shoulder was very uncomfortable.

I was seen by emergency medical personnel, had an EKG, and then my children, with whom I live, took me to see my primary care provider who ordered some basic blood tests: a CBC and panel.  All blood tests were normal as well as the EKG, I assume.  We think the faint was perhaps triggered by the diarrhea and exertion of chores in addition to the vaccine&#39;s effect .    Since then I have had fatigue.

She stated it was oval in appearance and covered most of the upper arm.  She noted a lump in her underarm of the left axilla also.  Denied any fever or other symptoms and otherwise felt fine.  On 3/9/21 she noticed a lump in the groin area and noticed that walking was a little more difficult than usual since both of her knees bothered her.  3/12/21Pt went to orthopedic surgeon and had a &#34;cortisone injection&#34; in the right knee.   This afternoon, the patient&#39;s daughter suggested that she go a local Urgent Care because the patient stated that the lump (previously in groin area)  &#34;was moving.&#34;  She waited in there for over one hour and then a nurse came out and told her to go to the ED for evaluation of her left upper arm for the redness and swelling.  She went directly to the ED and is being evaluation and having bloodwork done.  Daughter said if the lab results are normal, her mother will be discharged with an oral antibiotic and benadryl

                                                Several days after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine for COVID 19, I began have pain in all the joints in my hands, shoulder.  Unable to use my hands due to excruciating pain.  The pain began  3-4 days after the 2nd shot, starting in 2 of my fingers and progressively moved to all the joints in all of my fingers, wrists and my shoulders.  In addition there is swelling. I have very little use of my hands, requiring assistance to care for myself.  I have never had joint pain in my hands before.  The pain has continued for 2 weeks non-stop.  At the doctors recommendation I have been taking Tylenol for Arthritis, however this does not alleviate the pain, only reduces some of the discomfort.

She said within 3 days her legs started to go numb and especially her thigh muscles and her veins in her left foot were engorged. She said she went to the ER and they rxed 40mg prednisone for 4 days and her papers from the ER read &#34;allergy.&#34;  When I spoke to her for the second time and advised her she does not qualify for a second moderna vaccine, patient said that when she went to the ER she went for abdominal swelling, leg swelling, leg numbness, and swelling of the left ankle and foot. I confirmed with her that her symptoms have all improved and she said &#34;yes, tremendously.&#34; She said she spoke to her PCP and at least one additional doctor yesterday.

                                                The patient received her FIRST dose of Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/26/21 and SECOND dose on 2/23/21. On 3/8, she first started to experience shortness of breath, which was attributable to cardiac etiology and diastolic heart failure at the time, but which in retrospect may have been her earliest symptom of new onset myasthenia gravis, which is the AE I am wanting to report. She was hospitalized from 3/8-3/13, and underwent extensive cardiac workup that was negative. She again developed shortness of breath on 3/17/21 and was re-admitted to the hospital on 3/18/21 for diuresis for presumed diastolic heart failure exacerbation, received diuresis from 3/18-3/22/21 but then developed new onset diplopia, at which pint I evaluated her in neurological consultation on 3/22. Her brain MRI disclosed an UNrelated incidental  small left cerebellar infract, but her neurological exam showed a new R lateral rectus palsy and new moderate to severe left eyelid ptosis, suspicious for myasthenia gravis. Anti-acetylcholineseterase antibodies--- binding, blocking, and modulating, were all sent off and came back all strongly positive on 3/26-27/21. The patient then called stating she had developed recurrent shortness of breath, new onset dysphagia, and worsening double vision. I urgently re-evaluated her in outpatient follow-up in my office on 4/2/21 and sent her immediately to the hospital to be readmitted, where she remains as of this reporting date and she has been receiving IVIG with improvement in her symptoms. She did NOT have any previous known history of eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, diplopia, or muscle weakness. In retrospect, the patient states that her current symptomatology began around 3/7/21 with the benefit of hindsight. I am reporting this event because it is very unusual for an 82 year old WOMAN to develop new onset of myasthenia gravis, and it is a known autoimmune disease, and a vaccine would be a plausible trigger for its development, or trigger for its first symptomatic manifestation. I was also especially concerned because my fellow neurologist, ALSO had a patient develop myasthenia gravis about 2 weeks or so following their second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. It would be an EXTRAORDINARY coincidence for two instances of new onset myasthenia gravis to occur 2 weeks post- vaccination at essentially the same time in an institution of our size, so we both felt obliged to report both cases ASAP to the VAERS. I was not able to reach the patient in her hospital room today to get additional specifics about where she got the vaccine, its lot number etc., however she is a retired and has indicated her willingness to provide you with any and all additional information you need, and I am also personally very willing to provide any additional information about her eventual outcome.

The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment information included was acetaminophen for headache. The patient was hospitalized with coivd in January and had 5 days of Remdesivir. The patient also had problem with a lymph node in that arm. She had a Lumpectomy. They took at a lymph node in the left side of that armpit to see if it had spread. It was sensitive when she had a breast exam and was sent to get a mammogram. Got the breast exam last week in February.

For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

By 10:00 p.m. my lower back, sides were in pain and abdominal muscles and stomach were like frozen in place.  Couldn&#39;t move anything and the area seemed to be swollen.  Had  lost appetite in late afternoon so had not eaten dinner, only liquids since figured I needed something.  Couldn&#39;t sleep, aspirin didn&#39;t help.  Next day around  noon my abdominal area was better and pain decreasing  on sides.  Still no desire to eat. Trouble sleeping,   2nd day after shot, still  lower back pain, feel bloated, no desire to eat.  Very little side pain.   Had slight headache   This third night after shot I could finally  sleep.  This fourth day I felt back to normal.  During all this time, the arm that had the shot never really bothered me

It looked like there were 2 giant hives on my my arm (bigger than a nickel). Took 1 Benedryl (25mg), which didn&#39;t help. Hardly slept due to itching, and soreness to the touch. I can&#39;t wear a blouse with a sleeve. Today (Sunday 1/24), the redness came together into 1 big red blotch, measuring  2&#34;x3.5&#34;. Hot to the touch, and very sensitive. I feel pain into my shoulder blade area and where my arm meets my body in the front. Also, pain going towards my elbow. Ice / cold packs make it feel better. I will call for Dr. appointment tomorrow (Monday morning).

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

                                                Got the vaccine and was feeling tired, and her arm hurt, an all she wanted to do was lay in bed with her heating pad.  The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

A couple of days later she started breaking out in red spots on her back in the same area where the pain was.  She went to the doctor and was told that she has shingles.  She has had all of the shingles vaccines.  Given medicine for the shingles, Valtrex and the shingles have now dried up.   Everything is on the left side of her body where she had the vaccine.  She is now recovered from the vaccine and the shingles as of today 2/10/21.

The pain I have experienced has been short pains which radiate up into my neck.  I was told that one one the side effects could be a knot but this is a slight swelling  which leaves the upper right arm puffy.  The only medication that I have taken for pain is Aleve.

The worst has been the increasing tremors in my head and hands.  This is what I am most concerned about. I have a history of tremors, but since the vaccine, there has been a marked increase in the tremors. I did not report this right away because I thought it would go away, but now on the eve of my second shot I am very nervous that it will get even worst.  My physician encourages me to continue and get through the side effects than to get COVID with my underlying lung condition. I want to take the vaccine but am nervous that I am experience so much shakiness even a month after the first shot. Would you advise me to take the second shot? My shot is scheduled for tomorrow, February 17.

                                                Within the first 24 hours she showed a look of serious aging, and then the following day extreme pain in the mid and left side back making it difficult to walk or move. Severe pain. The pain seem to shift around like more nerve pain showing in the muscle . Started on the left side but moved around.  This was initially helped with some strong curcummin/boswella (inflammation pain formula at our health food store) and a homeopathic remedy. But the symptoms came back and kept going . She is very active and was unable to do her regular routine. She was sleeping more and in considerable pain. After several days, we tried what another country recommends for reactions to vaccines and it seemed to help her within a very short time. There is still now residual pain but she is better.  We have GREAT concern over what a second dose could do and do not feel that with such a strong reaction the second dose safe. Also a great concern that the same amount of vaccine for a 250 pound person and a 100 pound elder. She is very tiny bones and weighs around 100 pounds are less. Very concerning as no medicine is usually the same for everyone. Also a concern of why just one month from second dose when it takes a known 6 weeks for blood to change. A high chance of severe reaction can happen with such a close proximity and a second dose. We would like to see advise of no second shot or considerable less for small people. CDC person recommended she switch vaccines?  That seems risky and there is no studies of adverse reaction to combining two different vaccines.  She would like to be comfortable moving around in public and is of great health for her age so this reaction was very concerning. If she had such a reaction on FIRST DOSE....wouldnt that be a indication that her body reacted and a second dose not necessary  advisable. Please advise. This is of great concern to all of us who love her and of great concern for the general public who may be at risk for such adverse effects. I put unknown below because she still feels some pain even though it is less.

She went to bed that evening and everything was hurting, and felt very nauseous.  She had a very bad nights rest, but when she woke up her temp was over 100, normal is 97.  She did take her morning meds and an extra-strength Tylenol and went back to bed.   She took Tylenol, was feeling better, but still the chills and fatigue and was better.  The problem with the headache continued and her temp was about 99.   On 2/12/21 had temp over 100 again, no energy, slept a lot.   Had difficulty sleeping that night and had sweats, had temp, nausea and was shaking.  On Monday felt shaky, chills and difficulty sleeping.  On Tuesday she was having headache, not sleeping well and no energy.   She also was not sleeping well, had  a headache.  By 2/17/21 was feeling better, not great as she was still not sleeping well.   She did have covid in April of last year, and was not allowed to see her husband who was in a nursing home until 6/3/20.   When she had the covid test she was inconclusive and that&#39;s why she could not see her doctor.   Her doctor did the antibody test that showed she had antibodies.  She is feeling back to normal as of today, 3/8/21.  She had the malaise from COVID after she got the 1st vaccine.  Feels that they should ask people before getting the vaccine if they had COVID.

The patient reported that that she had facial tingling, numbness in lips, shortness of breath and blood pressure of 210/90 after getting her first Moderna vaccine. Patient also reported weakness in her leg and severe headache. Patient said facial tingling lasted for about 2 hours and lip numbness lasted for about 4 hours(21-FEB-2021). Patient also complained about swelling in her leg/edema but she said she has cellulitis in her left leg and she was not sure if the swelling had something to do with the vaccine or not.   Patient did not take anything to treat symptoms but contacted her doctor and pharmacist.   The patient reported that all other symptoms like weakness in her legs, Shortness of breath, and the headache lasted for about 4 days(25-FEB-2021). Patient said all she wanted the Moderna team to know that she reacted to the vaccine.  Seriousness criteria for the event of swelling and edema was medically important.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome for all the events was considered as recovered/resolved.  No further information was provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a strong temporal association and the established safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association between the reported events and the product use cannot be excluded.

                                                Two days after injection pain in upper back began.  When inspected there was a rash.  The rash has spread to cover most of her upper left side of her back, under the left arm and across the left side of her chest.  Patient says that it feels like it is spreading down her arm now.  She visited the doctor on 3/1/2021 thinking it was an allergic reaction.  The doctor diagnosed her with shingles.  Patient has never had shingles in the past.

                                                Received call from patient on 3/3/2021. She reports that approximately 1.5hrs after receiving her COVID vaccine, she began having pain in the top of her head, neck, between her shoulder blades, down both arms to her fingertips, and down her spine.  Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

This has been going on now for 3 weeks.   I have no other medical problems &amp; the only thing  different is I had the vaccine &amp; never had problems with being dizzy before.   Also the day after the vaccine I started with back pain that still has not gone away.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

She had seen her dermatologist that week for another issue and the dermatologist was so concerned that she described Keflex. The patient was afraid to take the Reflex as she has a PCN allergy so she presented to  Urgent care. She has a cellulitis in the arm.  She has antihistamine a home and took one last night. I advised her to take it nighty until resolves and to start Clindamycin  po TID x 10 days to treat cellulitis and also may take Famotidine prescribed by her physician which she had not started yet and may use OTC cortisone cream on area.

                                                History of Present Illness     89-year-old female with past medical history significant for osteoporosis and hypothyroidism, who initially presented to ER on March 2 due to lower extremity weakness and right knee pain after a recent fall.  Patient lost her balance and suffered a mechanical fall on February 22.  Patient developed right lumbar and hip pain radiating down her leg.  She saw Dr from orthopedics on February 26 who recommended offloading knee and wearing a knee immobilizer.  Patient was admitted to hospital on March 2 due to worsening knee pain and was incidentally found to be positive for COVID-19.  Patient had received her second Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on February 26.  Patient was evaluated by neurology during that hospital course, who recommended outpatient EMG, physical therapy, and pain management.  No evidence of Guillain-Barré or viral induced neuropathy.  Patient&#39;s lower extremity weakness did improve, and she was successfully discharged home with family and home health on March 5.   Patient reports doing well at home with family initially, was making improvements with her strength and was able to stand and take a few steps with walker and assistance.  On March 8, patient was in bed and she attempted to turn onto her right side, and as she was turning she felt a pop and a pain in her right hip that radiated down her right leg.  Since that time, patient reports having severe pain with movement, rates pain as 8/10 severity.  Denies falls or new trauma since her previous fall from February 22.  Patient was unable to control pain at home, so she came into the emergency department for evaluation.  Initial hip x-ray series revealed questionable greater trochanteric fracture.  CT of right hip subsequently revealed fracture.  Orthopedics consulted.  No significant laboratory abnormalities.  Foley catheter was placed in ER.  Patient was admitted to hospital service for management.  On my interview, patient reports that right hip pain is under good control as long as she does not move, but has 7/10 pain severity over her right lateral hip with movement.   Patient reports following Covid isolation protocols at home with family.  Reports that her Covid isolation will be completed on March 12.  Denies upper respiratory symptoms.  Patient has oxygen saturations of 100% on room air.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported).    On 12-Mar-2021 at 1:30 PM, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 13-Mar-2021, the patient experienced OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED (oxygen level was low) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (could not get up or walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle weakness in her legs) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 14-Mar-2021 to 17-Mar-2021 due to GAIT DISTURBANCE, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS and OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED. The patient was treated with Rehabilitation therapy for Gait disturbance. At the time of the report, OXYGEN SATURATION DECREASED (oxygen level was low), GAIT DISTURBANCE (could not get up or walk) and MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (muscle weakness in her legs) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 13-Mar-2021, Blood test: normal (normal) Normal. On 13-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Low.         No concomitant medications were reported.  The treatment information included oxygen for 2-3 days.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Further information has been requested.
