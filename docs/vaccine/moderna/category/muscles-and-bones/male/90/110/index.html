At that time VS were stable, equal hand grasp noted, and no further concerns. Around 3pm resident became flaccid on the left side of his face and speech became mumbled. Hand grasp was equal at that time and VS were stable, but B/P was elevated compared to previous recordings earlier in the day. Family did not want him sent to the hospital and asked for comfort cares. Hospice referral obtained and he will be admitted to hospice in the near future. Resident&#39;s left side of face has improved within the last 48 hours. He remains total assist with all cares.

                                                Dad woke up one morning in February with a a pain in his groin so severe he could not swing the leg forward to walk.  He used a walk-behind walker to get around for several weeks.  Eventually he could walk without support, but only if careful.  The pain would also radiate down  the thigh of the same leg.   After the groin/thigh issue started to improve the pain changed to the buttock  and thigh of the same leg.  He had to use the walker again to  safely walk.  He also had difficulty lifting the leg up to get out of a recliner. He had to use his fists on  either side of the bad leg and lift himself with his arms because of too much pain if he tried to push up with his leg.  He has discovered that if he swings the bad leg behind him before he starts to try to walk, movement of the leg is less painful. He is using the walker to maintain balance because of the problems with  his leg. It just recently occurred to us that  these problems coincide with the  Covid vaccine doses and decided to report this.

He realized the right side of his neck was swollen and his throat was swollen as well. He was having trouble swallowing, talking and his breathing felt obstructed. He tried to awaken my Mother but she couldn&#39;t understand what he was saying. He finally managed to get up with on walker and make his way to get a drink of water. After that his throat seemed to loosen up some and by later in the morning  the swelling had subsided. He did not inform me until I called later in that morning to check on them and he did not feel he needed to see a doctor.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included pulmonary fibrosis, sleep apnea, acid reflux and prostatitis. Concomitant medications reported included aciphex and ativan.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately two weeks prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, the patient experienced immediate flushing with red hot ears which persisted throughout the day and mild soreness at the injection site lasting approximately 24 to 48 hours. He experienced two instances of right-sided cramping neck pain accompanied by shoulder pain radiating to the head, lasting 5 to 10 minutes per episode between 20 Jan 2021 and 04 Feb2 021. These episodes were brief and have not returned and awaking to both legs and his back &#34;filled with pains&#34; on 23 Jan 2021. The leg pains subsided upon standing; back pain lasted all day 23 Jan2 021. The patient felt normal from 24 Jan 2021 until 04 Feb 2021.   On 04 Feb 2021, the patient&#39;s whole body became ice cold at approximately 3PM. By 3:15PM he was experiencing chills and shivering that lasted approximately one hour. Patient called his physician, and was directed to the Emergency Room (ER) immediately. There he received blood tests and prophylactic broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy immediately upon admission. Patient reports that Infectious Disease confirmed there were two strains of bacteria present in his bloodstream. From the patient additional samples were collected for culture to tailor antimicrobial therapy accordingly. He also said he was hospitalized for six days and discharged on 10 Feb 2021 with at home Iintravenous (IV) infusion device to administer continuous (24 hour) antibiotic therapy for a full 14 days. He was released from the hospital to his daughter&#39;s care.  He had no history of significant adverse events or allergic reactions post vaccine administration. He is concerned about the origin of the infection, as no source could be confirmed per Infectious Disease. The patient is concerned the infection could have stemmed from the vaccine or it&#39;s administration. He attests that his physician wants him to proceed with his second dose of Moderna.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events is unknown.   The events, flushing with red hot ears, mild soreness at the injection site, right-sided cramping neck pain accompanied by shoulder pain radiating to the head, leg pain, back pain, body became ice cold, chills and shivering were considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He felt itchy (still itchy but not as much). He stated he went to his PCP and they referred him to a dermatologist (seen about 3 weeks ago). He was prescribed Triamcinolone Ointment by the dermatologist and stated it&#39;s helping and blisters are subsiding. The PCP didn&#39;t prescribe anything. About 2 weeks ago he stated he started to feel neck pain (about 4 weeks after the 2nd shot). Patient has no c/o headache,fever or chills.  pt received dose 2 on 3/1/2021.   I advised the neck pain wasn&#39;t related to the vaccine but recommended to continue with the Triamcinolone ointment and he can also apply cortisone-10 cream/ointment to the help with itchiness or benadryl. He stated that the blisters have been getting better but he feels the problem is internally and he feels he needs to see the dermatologist again on 4/20/21.  4/21-onset 2 weeks after vaccine dose 1 --moderna on 1/28/21; 8.5 weeks of symptoms; feeling better but symptoms still present. Dermatologist said not vaccine related; using topical steroids. Saw PMD - to check blood work; told internal allergy.  Will call next week for follow up.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.  Concomitant products included ACETYLCYSTEINE, CALCIUM LEVOMEFOLATE, MECOBALAMIN (CEREFOLIN NAC [ACETYLCYSTEINE;CALCIUM LEVOMEFOLATE;MECOBALAMIN]), COLECALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D3) and AMOXICILLIN SODIUM (AMOXICILLIN [AMOXICILLIN SODIUM]) for an unknown indication.   On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (mini-strokes which have increased in frequency) (seriousness criterion medically significant), SEIZURE (placed on low-dose seizure medicine Aptiom 200 and Aspirin 325 to prevent further seizures) (seriousness criterion medically significant), WHEEZING (Wheezing), DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), HEADACHE (Headaches) and MYALGIA (Soreness in arm). The patient was treated with ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID] ongoing since an unknown date for Seizure prophylaxis, at a dose of 325 dosage form and ESLICARBAZEPINE ACETATE (APTIOM) ongoing since an unknown date for Seizure prophylaxis, at a dose of 200 milligram. At the time of the report, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (mini-strokes which have increased in frequency) had not resolved and SEIZURE (placed on low-dose seizure medicine Aptiom 200 and Aspirin 325 to prevent further seizures), WHEEZING (Wheezing), DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), HEADACHE (Headaches) and MYALGIA (Soreness in arm) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 17-May-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: mini-strokes (abnormal) mini-strokes were confirmed via MRI.         The patient&#39;s caregiver reported the patient stopped taking amoxicillin 875-125 prior to receiving the second dose of the vaccine. After receiving the second vaccine, he began to experience a repeat of symptoms similar to those after the first dose which were described as a number of mini-strokes which increased in frequency. The patient was treated and released in an emergency room (less than 24-hour stay). It was reported the mini-strokes occurred within 24 to 72 hours post-vaccination.
