                                                On 1/12/20 resident woke up and was not able to stand in the E-Z stand. E-Z lift was needed. In addition he needed assistance with eating. At that time VS were stable, equal hand grasp noted, and no further concerns. Around 3pm resident became flaccid on the left side of his face and speech became mumbled. Hand grasp was equal at that time and VS were stable, but B/P was elevated compared to previous recordings earlier in the day. Family did not want him sent to the hospital and asked for comfort cares. Hospice referral obtained and he will be admitted to hospice in the near future. Resident&#39;s left side of face has improved within the last 48 hours. He remains total assist with all cares.

                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.
