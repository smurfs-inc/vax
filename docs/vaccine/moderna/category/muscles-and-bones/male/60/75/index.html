These symptoms lasted for 48 hours and gradually subsided.  His wife (me) was so frightened that I will not be getting the Moderna series since it&#39;s so dangerous and will caution friends and family as well.

                                                I was fine the day of the vaccine. When I woke up the next day I felt like I had a severe case of the Flu.  I had severe body aches, headache, muscle weakness, worse cough, injection site pain and swelling, chills, weakness/tiredness,  I felt like I had been hit by a car. I just tried to sleep and drink Gator Aid. The second day out from vaccination I felt much better. Just slight headache, body aches,  weakness.  My injection site started to hurt later in the second day. It still hurts today-seven days out from administration.

I had a moderate case of COVID in May 2020 and had positive IgG AB in August. The symptoms started with heavy shaking chills, lasting 1 1/2 hours , fever and most concerning sustained tachycardia with heart rate of 180&#39; to 200&#39; over hours, which then destabilized into runs of Vtach and complex ventricular dysrythmia, low BP, profound weaklness, head aches and joint and muscle pains ( similar to the experienced COVID symptoms )

The right sided headache continued for days. On Saturday evening Jan 16th it became the worst headache of my life. Like a fool I didn&#39;t go to ER until Monday morning when I developed left handed weakness. I was visiting my son and presented to the Medical Center ER where I was diagnosed with an acute sub-dural brain bleed and airlifted to Specialized Hospital. Was admitted to the Neuro-Neurosurgery Unit.

Moved to Tendonitis/Arthritis wrists, hands, fingers and Left patellar knee tendon. SLOWLY improved but did not leave, despite treatment with Aleve, until 2nd vaccine 2/5/2021. Then, same symptoms worsened and included BOT patellar tendons, nd plantar tendons. Continues to present and are very painful at night, despite 2 Aleve BID daily, and  cannot make fist or extend fingers on  both hands and cannot walk on feet without pain at MTP&#39;s. Discussed with orthopedic surgeon who assured me that I was having &#34;an immune reaction in tendons to vaccine. It should get better over time&#34;. It has not at present.

But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

I called them and they had me marked down for no show but once I explained they set up another follow up appointment.

                                                Memory problems, some increase in headaches.  Also issues with balance and bumping into walls.  Still to not have smell or taste.   These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold). On 25-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation), COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) and MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold) outcome was unknown.   She said they had been very careful, but had met with some friends and 2 of their friends also tested positive.    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.      The day after he received the vaccine he felt minor aches, like he was coming down with a cold. On that Thursday he went into a fib. She took him to the ER and it took several hours to regulate his heart rate. While making arrangement to transfer him to a new hospital they did a COVID test and it was positive. They were shocked as he had not been showing any symptoms. He spent the night in the hospital.  Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. However the event of Covid 19 and myalgia is unlikely related to vaccine. Covid 19 is  a confounding factor for the event of myalgia and base of the available information, the vaccine is not known cause of Covid 19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

                                                My oxygen levels dropped below what they had been previously as I am recovering from Covid infection  tested positive 20 October 2020.  If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Jan2021, the patient tested negative for COVID-19). On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, and feeling weird/funny. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced difficulty breathing and swelling. On 18 Jan 2021, the patient declined dialysis, was tired and wanted to lay down. At 8 am, the patient was found nonresponsive and cold and is believed to have passed away around 4 am. The coroner tested the deceased for COVID-19 and the test was positive. No autopsy was reported. No death certificate was issued at the time of the report but the reporter believes it will list cause of death as COVID complications.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided. Based on reporter&#39;s causality the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19

Later in the morning, he complained of nausea, generalized muscle aches, intermittent increase in confusion. At approximately 14:00, he had a fall out of bed and at that time noted to be short of breath, tachypneic. He was taken via ambulance to Emergency Department. From there he was transferred to Hospital for admission with acute respiratory distress, suspected sepsis with lactic acid 7.4 and Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli. He was started on heparin and broad spectrum antibiotics and transitioned to ELIQUIS on 1/3/2021. Infectious etiology of sepsis was unclear.

                                                I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye; painful stiffness in the injection site arm; felt a little tired; joint pain in the injection site arm; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) in a 64-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 038A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Cataract (cataract surgery, left eye) on 26-Mar-2021. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: SHINGRIX in 2020.    On 27-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 28-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (painful stiffness in the injection site arm), FATIGUE (felt a little tired) and ARTHRALGIA (joint pain in the injection site arm). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) had not resolved and MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (painful stiffness in the injection site arm), FATIGUE (felt a little tired) and ARTHRALGIA (joint pain in the injection site arm) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       Treatment for the ophthalmic herpes zoster include sulfamethoxazole 160mg BID and valacyclovir 500mg 2 tablets TID. Company comment: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and recent history of cataract surgery the event eye herpes zoster is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. For the other events the causality cannot be excluded.   On 05Apr2021, his eye Dr assessed the area with shingles and thought that the shingles was most likely due to the trauma to the eye from the surgery.

Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

                                                Patient (me) had been hiking for first time in many months.  Arrived for vaccine with very sore, tired leg muscles.   Four hour after injection, patient exhibited extreme bilateral pain in muscles in the thigh. I would rate the pain as 9/10.  Pain lasted 5 minutes and resolved.  An hour later the pain returned this time for more than 20 minutes.  Twenty-four hours later, same muscles are exhibiting a strong burning sensation. Patient was also somewhat dehydrated at the time.

Went to bed at 8:00 due to fatigue.  Felt nauseated.   Was hurting really bad with the joint pain that lasted until about 2:30 AM.   He woke up this morning and is feeling much better.   He did not take anything for the pain.  It attacked his joints mainly his ankles and knees and was not able to move.  His knees felt hot to the touch.

Rec&#39;d shot Saturday morning, pain started Sunday evening and ended Wednesday morning.  Pain was enough that it woke me up Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights.  I treated the pain with ice and ibuprofen, but still very painful to move and to touch.  Wednesday it got better about as quickly as it started on Sunday.  I did not do any physical activity that would have triggered such sever pain.  The only thing that was different is that I received the Moderna  vaccine.  By Thursday my knee was back to normal.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

                                                I am allergic to polyethylene glycol ?  it actually put me in the hospital for years ago. I had no idea it was in the vaccine, although a smaller amount than I had taken before. I started experiencing severe and awful anxiety and panic that night I got the vaccine. I had other minor side effects that were expected but they went away within a day. Several days later, I began experiencing pain in both my bilateral Achilles tendons and bilateral knee pain. A physical therapist examined both and said that I was swollen. I have had both of those problems under control for a very long time. I am improving somewhat  but nearly 2 weeks later I am still having some repercussions. I am now scared and don&#39;t know if I should get the second injection done because the previous adverse symptoms were awful. Thank you.

I felt that I was extremely ill for the first 45 hours.  I ate very little and I could not bathe.  I stayed in bed, leaving only to go to the restroom.  On the 3rd day, I was much improved and I would characterize my symptoms as moderate.  I was able to get up for short periods and I was also able to bathe.  On the 4th day (today) I believe that I am symptom free with the exception of continued arm soreness at the injection sight.

This subsided in appx. 30 minutes however I suffered a very poor night?s sleep. Following day, Feb 20, 2012, I felt as though I had a very mild virus with achiness in neck and shoulders primarily with lesser discomfort in back and legs. Was a mildly fatigued with mild headache as well. Did not check temp but never felt feverish.  On 2/21/2021 I felt symptom free until evening when a slight trace of achiness returned. I slept very well that night and woke symptom free, encountering  no further reactive symptoms.

Ended up going to bed very early that evening (7:30) I woke up in the middle of the night covered in sweat, a fever of 101.4 degrees.  I woke up at 10:00am the next day still running a fever but on 99.4 but still ackey and tired throughout the whole day. I took a short nap in the afternoon. I woke on the 3rd day after my shot and all I have now is a little soreness in my armpits, fatigue and aches are gone.

I remaining in bed off and on for about 36 hours and then worked my way back to eliminate most of the symptoms.  However, after that and continuing at this time, i continue to be achy, particularly in my joints and my hands, fingers and neck, and I find that my lower jaw seems to be moved forward when I awake in the morning.  The achiness is particularly acute when waking in the morning, particularly in my fingers..  The pain is by no means debilitating, but it is noticeable.  I would rate the pain 3 or 4 when waking and 2-3 throughout the rest of the day.     I have not sought any treatment.

Assessment/Plan: Fever, myalgias and headache, I think this is all secondary to his recent Covid vaccine yesterday, dose 2.  I would anticipate his symptoms should resolve over the next 24 to 48 hours.  He was started on vancomycin in the emergency room given history of MRSA.  We will continue for now, though I think less likely secondary infection.  He is on Cipro for SBP prophylaxis.  He does not seem to have significant ascites.  I think bacterial peritonitis is less likely.   End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  I spoke with individual.  Plan is to dialyze him here today.   Cirrhosis -he was evaluated by the transplant center at Hospital on February 25.  His meld was 25 at that time.   History of type 2 diabetes.  His last hemoglobin A1c&#39;s have been all 5.  Can remove that from his problem list.

                                                A little over 12 hours after getting my first Moderna shot I experienced severe joint pain in my left knee that caused my entire left leg to become so painful I could not move it at all, as if I pulled an ACL. I decided to ride it out as each day went by the pain subsided more and more to where after 3 to 4 days later the pain was about 90% gone.  I still feel a little bit of soreness on the left side of my left knee cap though.  I am mostly back to where I was before the shot.  During the first few hours of the worst pain I did experience a cold sweat also.  All in  all I am feeling pretty good now however, a bit concerned about my second dose scheduled for March 23rd though, especially considering that I have neve had a negative reaction to a any type of vaccine before and I am not allergic. Great thanks to all!

The numbness extended from his hip to his toes. Felt a pressure-like sensation in his thigh and calf.  Denies pain. Felt as though his right foot is floating 2 inches off the ground when standing with both feet on the ground. Reported his right leg is 1-2 inches shorter after a femur fracture many years ago. Nothing made his symptoms better or worse.  Did have an episode of feeling generally hot and then cold the evening prior to admission. Denied any trauma.     Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stools, urinary habit changes, hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, myalgias, arthralgias, recent illness, or fever.

Patient did have Covid vaccine 7 days prior to onset of symptoms, one dose mRNA vaccine.    He is on day 3 high-dose methylprednisolone thousand milligrams IV ×3 days.  He has noticed an improvement in the pressure sensation from the knee up the thigh on the right, no longer having tingling in the right lower leg or the left foot.  He is still having numbness over the anterior right thigh.  Yesterday when he went to bear weight on the right heel, he had a sharp pain with increase in weakness.  That has since settled down.  He did have a few involuntary myoclonic movements as described yesterday.  This writer reached out on 3/22/2021 for information on his Vaccine lot number. He stated &#34;At this point I am attending physical therapy, I am walking with the aid of crutches or a walker. There is improvement in the foot and lower leg regarding the numbness, but the upper thigh is still pretty much completely numb yet.&#34;

Diarrhea is not a common health event for me.  It is not listed as one of the common side effects so I thought I should report it.  I have not been been feeling ill.  Event came on very sudden.  I had eating lunch between vaccination and diarrhea.  Only side effect from first shot was a sore shoulder for two days.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                Severe arm pain at area of injection about 9 hours after shot (bedtime). Next morning very severe total arm, head and joint pains, total fatigue, mild fever, no appetite. Unable to get out of bed except once to urinate which was a painful struggle. Next morning most symptoms subsided greatly. Only a mild headache and moderate arm pain remained. As of this writing headache is gone but moderate arm pain at injection site continues.

Been over 4 weeks now since the first vaccine. Going to see my primary care doctor on Monday the 1st to discuss 2nd shot, which is the 2nd of March. Did not do anything physical on that day and have only done daily walks since.

                                                About six hours after receiving the Covid Moderna vaccine I quickly began constant tremors that was strong enough that I could not walk or stand. I did not have a thermometer but I?m certain I had a fever. This lasted throughout the night. The following morning I was bedridden, unable to eat and had flu like symptoms. This is continued for three days now. I am slowly Beginning to gain strength but I?m still bedridden.

                                                Shot administered on 2/15/21 Monday @ 5:30 PM.  On 2/23/21 @ 5:30 AM Tuesday, I woke up with an itching at the area of the injection  site.  The site where the injection was given had bruised and is now fading and is a yellowish color.  Directly below the injection site and its bruised area is a hot feeling, itchy red rash.  Through the course of the day, the red rash has increased in size, approximately 3.5 inch in diameter.  The same day around 5:30 PM I begin to feel a pain/ache in right shoulder and up into my neck on the right side.  The pain level gains and the level of pain reaches 5 in about two hours.  The aching seems deep beneath the shoulder bone and into the spine of the neck.  The rash and pain remain to present, 2/28/2021 Sunday.  The rash maintained the same side and began to slowly disappear yesterday, 2/27/2021 Sunday late evening.  The pain was at it&#39;s worst with arm and shoulder movement but was worse, even without movement of the arm and shoulder between 2/26/2021 Friday and 2/27/2021 Saturday, even when in bed, interrupting my sleep.  On 2/27/2021 Saturday evening the red rash had noticeable fading and the pain level began to decrease.   Today 2/28/2021 the red rash is almost goin and the neck and shoulder pain is no worse than level 1.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

On 01/25/2021 in the evening I noticed a soreness in my left collarbone and  felt what I think is a swollen gland.  I have not pursued any additional medical assistance from my primary care physician or my healthcare specialist.

                                                Onset of fever (101.3), tachycardia (131), rigors, and myalgias that lasted about 12 hours followed by 24 hours of fatigue and increased need for sleep.  Similar reactions were shared with 6 co-workers who received the vaccination at about the same time. My concern is that if this second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination is making people ill, then it is imperative that CDC and FDA advise the public what to expect and maybe how to ameliorate.  Otherwise people who become ill will tell their friends and family.  This disclosure will make members of the public disinclined to get the shot which would be a public health nightmare.  I have used this adverse report as the forum to ensure that the FDA and CDC are aware of these reactions and will consider their consequences.  Thank you.

                                                Had a little bit more than normal soreness in the shoulder, felt like bruising.  The day after the injection started getting flu symptoms, fairly severe, fever, coughing, runny nose, no energy at all.  Felt like he had a the worst case of flu he ever had.  He is getting better, but still has some of the symptoms.  The only thing he has taken for it is Nyquil and took a Sinutab.   Did have nausea, diarrhea, everything that comes with the flu.  Sinuses are drying up, energy is coming back and able to eat again.  He did call his doctor and he recommended that he call us and report this event.  He did have to postpone a procedure that he was scheduled for on Monday.

The first shot I had a bad rash 14 days after receiving the vaccine.  This was treated with Benadryl and hydrocortisone and within two weeks, it was almost gone. Therefore, I was advised by my doctor to get the 2nd shot in the other arm.  Within 24 hours of the second shot, the same rash broke out from shoulder to elbow that happened after the first shot. In addition, at the same time, my right armpit gland became very swollen and sensitive to the touch.  Doctor advised to again use Benadryl for 48 hours and hyrdocortisone.

Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).

                                                The day after my second dose ( February 18th) I felt sore at injection site and slight headache/neck ache and fatigue. next day (February 20th) I noticed a tightness in chest and started checking pulse and ECG on my apple watch. Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                As a physician for over 40 years I tend not to pay attention to my symptoms if I develop the flu or a virus. I just put up with it  I received a COVID-19 Moderna vaccination on January 7. Approximately 12 hours after I started to develop adverse reactions. These of Inc. severe myalgias, fever to 102, chills, headache, severe fatigue (to the point where it is difficult to get out of bed)  Not much reaction at the injection site. Hydrogen saturation  in the 90s and pulse in the 70s.  I did contract Covid in March 2020. I was alone for two weeks. However no respiratory problems or hospitalization.  I?m currently speculating that having had covered in March has resulted in a significant immune reaction from this vaccine.  I would appreciate your input on this.  Can I expect this again when I receive my second vaccine in one month?  Thank you

The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

Difficult to raise arms, very difficult to put on shirt, sweater, jacket. Lessens over the day, but just as bad the next morning. I&#39;ve worked out my whole life, this is not usual post-work out soreness- no precipitating exercise.

                                                The patient noted weakness starting in the legs on January the 19th, 10 days  after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.  The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

                                                Nearly completely incapacitated.  Head spinning, very weak limbs, barely able to get out of bed and stand after extreme effort, no arm strength, could only move to the bathroom via baby steps with while holding on to whatever was available to steady myself.  I ended up on the floor and was barely able to get up and back into bed after considerable effort.  My arms and legs were like rubber.  I had fever and severe night sweats.  I was virtually unable to function.  This lasted from the night of 02/03 and continued through 02/04.  Finally 02/05 I was able to get out of bed and shakily stand. But I couldn&#39;t stay up long, as I had the aches and pains and a headache still.  Finally 02/06 I was able to get out of bed and stay out.  I hope my description describes the magnitude of my symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to survive.

                                                Got the vaccine, there was no pain, the shot was fine, no reaction.  Waited for 30 minutes due to his extensive allergies.  Went home and about 2 hours later he noticed when he was moving around it started to get painful just opening a door, etc.  It continually got worse, and maybe 3 hours later in the evening the pain got really bad, and it seemed to be more in his shoulder area.  Gave the shot kind of high, and the pain was real bad in the shoulder and could not raise the arm or use it much at all.  It was also a throbbing pain where he could feel his pulse with the pain in the shoulder.  It was almost like they hit a nerve.  He is still trying to get over it on day #5.  Each day it is starting to get better.  By Sunday the pain was letting up so that he could use his arm.  He is doing stretching exercises walking up the wall and it&#39;s complicated.  He has a history of shoulder surgery and had a total replacement in the right shoulder, and wonders if his pain is related to the bad shoulder and the cartilage being bad in that shoulder.  He is supposed to have surgery on it.  But the arm is better, can lift it 75%.

Chills and general body/joint aches started approx 26-30 hrs post injection.  Fever (101.2F) peaked ~ 36 hrs after 1st injection.  Mild but obvious headache ceased after 48 hrs.  No injection site rash, just soreness of the arm (like all of my previous flu vaccinations).   Second vaccination was followed with chills and peak fever of 101.4F along same time interval.  Current 02/25/21 at 2:30 pm pacific fever has ?broke? with some sweating.  Feeling much better.  I know these symptoms are positive evidence that body is geared up building the protection system for which we are vaccinated. Self-medicated with acetaminophen (500 mg) to relieve aches. Thank you!!

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                Friday evening, pt. was shaking so much that he could not even hold on to anything, had pain in his legs, hips, joints, knees to where he could not walk, and had a fever.  He had a hard time breathing as well so he went to the hospital.  They checked him out and ran tests but it was all in relation to the shot they thought.  Saturday he was very tired that he slept all day.  Sunday he was feeling better but had some issues with his vision and his peripheral vision went away for part of the day.

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                positive for COVID-19; unwell; fever; chills; body ache; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19) in a 69-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 047A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Pneumonia.    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (unwell), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and MYALGIA (body ache). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized for 1 day due to COVID-19. At the time of the report, COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19), MALAISE (unwell), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and MYALGIA (body ache) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 31-Mar-2021, COVID-19: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient was treated with Ibuprofen, Nyquil and Dayquil for the symptoms. Patient was discharged the next day. Patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.  Company comment: Based on the information provided including the established profile for mRNA-1273, a causal association between the event of COVID-19 and the product administration is assessed as unlikely.  Malaise is assessed as a symptom of the infection and also assessed as unlikely.  Chills, pyrexia and myalgia, although also considered as symptoms of Covid-19, are temporarily associated with the product administration and consistent with the product safety profile and thus , causality cannot be excluded.   This case was linked to MOD21-079024 (Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided including the established profile for mRNA-1273, a causal association between the event of COVID-19 and the product administration is assessed as unlikely.

I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.

In particular it was kind of cramped up and stiff when I woke up in the morning.   Two days after my second Covid vaccine on Feb 8,   those symptoms became much worse.   My hand was very stiff in the morning and I couldn&#39;t straighten my index finger except by pulling it up with my other hand.  Prior to receiving the Covid vaccines, I had never experienced these issues before.

We went to ER where they administered heparin IV, kept home, did an angiogram and then quadruple bypass. We are not doing the vaccination caused his blockages.. just want to make sure it doesn&#39;t cause blood clotting which led to his angina.

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall as the pain moved predominately to the left calf as I leaned on the wall for support rubbing both thigh and calf and yelling to my wife.Over a few minutes, I regained mobility and have not experienced that since. I have had discomfort(sharp aching) in the left hip joint and left calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to have a numbing/tingling from the injection site down to my left elbow as well as down the left side of my leg. There&#39;s a general feeling of &#34;weakness&#34; in my upper left arm. I&#39;ve reported this to our Infection Control Nurse (who administered the vaccination) anecdotally after waiting a few weeks to see if things went away. Her advisement was to go ahead and report in to VAERS.

                                                Yesterday around 1:30PM I received my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine. All went well between the time I got the shot to the time I went to bed at about 10PM. I thought I had it made. At midnight I awoke with intense shivering. I absolutely couldn&#39;t stop. I wasn&#39;t cold as my body was hot. I had plenty of covers, but I was hot and shivering cold. Include a severe headache in this picture. This went on for a good hour and I finally settled down and dozed off again. This morning I have a mild headache and a really sore shoulder where I received the vaccine.

                                                Emergency pacemaker; Pain in left shoulder; missed second dose; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer regarding her husband, a 71 year old male, who received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced missed the second dose due to hospitalization, emergency pacemaker insertion and pain in shoulder .  The patient&#39;s medical history includes high blood pressure, hereditary heart disease, Fuchs Dystrophy and heart attack last year. His concomitant medications were amlodipine 5 mg tablets daily, potassium chloride and indapamide. No information on allergies.   On 15-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of Covid-19 vaccine intramuscularly on his left arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection(Lot#012LZ0A or 017LZ0A) She is not sure about the Lot number as she couldn&#39;t read the handwriting.    On 11-FEB-2021, Patient had Emergency pacemaker insertion done at the hospital, where he stayed for two more days and discharged on 14-FEB-2021. As per his wife, this event is related to his previous heart problems which are ongoing for a long time. His 2nd dose of vaccine is scheduled on 12-FEB-2021, which he missed due to his hospitalization. Doctor said &#34;forget about the shot&#34; after seeing his results in monitor. She thinks, his doctor wouldn&#39;t talk about the 2nd dose of vaccine now, so wants to wait till his follow up appointment in March and he may get his second dose in 5-6-week limit. After being discharged from the hospital, wife reports husband is &#34;starting to feel better.&#34; Sleeps a few hours and gets up and goes lays back down. Still experiencing pain in shoulder.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine was postponing of appointment until he is fine.  The outcome of the event emergency pacemaker insertion was recovered and pain in shoulder is not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of product administration for mRNA-1273. Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273 vaccine, the events of cardiac pacemaker insertion and arthralgia are assessed as unlikely related.  The patient&#39;s medical history of high blood pressure, hereditary heart disease and heart attack are risk factors for cardiac pacemaker insertion and confounds causality.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

                                                When I received the vaccine I did not feel anything, 12hrs after the vaccine my arm suddenly became very sore. I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

Upon waking from sleep at any time during the day or evening cannot move without extreme pain.  Yesterday, 1/20/2021, I called my doctor&#39;s office and did a call.  Doctor prescribed Baclofen 10mg for lower back pain.  It has provided little relief.  I question what else can be done to alleviate the pain and, also, whether I should go for a second shot on Feb 12.  I told the Doctor it feels like a kidney infection I had in my teens but she dismissed that.

                                                I began feeling feverish about 12 hours after the vaccination.  Fever went above 101 deg, at times for about 24 hours.  I took one 650 mg Acetaminophen at 0330 the following morning to reduce the fever and continued taking this at 6 hour intervals until 1/22 (today).  Also I had a headache, sore muscles and symptoms similar to the flu during this entire period.  During the first night just before taking the Acetaminophen my pulse was up to 104 bpm.  It went down during the following day to about 84 and is now at 72 bpm (9am/Jan22); my normal pulse is usually between 58 and 64 bpm.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

On Thursday the knee didn&#39;t get any worse but my lower back and shoulders were sore. On Friday, there wasn&#39;t much change. On Saturday the knee seemed to stabilize and the back and shoulders were tolerable. On Sunday, my stomach was queasy. On Monday, sore joints and queasy stomach. On Tuesday, sore joints especially anything injured back in time, diarrhea started. On Wednesday upset stomach, just a piece of toast to eat, diarrhea, chills, sore joints everywhere, miserable. Thursday was the same as Wednesday plus I vomited twice in the evening with sweats and a 101.1 temperature which went back down. I was miserable. I slept well last night and feel better this morning. The diarrhea seems be abating. I feel like I&#39;ve turned the corner this morning but wanted to mention due to the vaccine shot as a possible cause.

Strangely my right hand was frozen open.  Was unable to make a fist or grasp a water bottle.  When I tried to close my right hand I had a weird sensation in my hand.  It felt like electricity flowing down my hand and into my 4 fingers.  Left hand was not effected.   Had the same effect when I woke up a couple times during the night.  When I got up on Saturday morning the problem with my hand was gone.  Still a bit stiff, was fatigued, headache and body aches.  Sore arm for a few days.

Took Colace, helped a little.  Dry heaving today, never vomited, still having pain in spine, gas pain comes and goes. Called pcp, had nurse call and told him to take Tylenol.

                                                Approximately noon 2 days after vaccination 2/26/2021 patient began to experience weakness, vomiting, dry heaving, abdominal pain and muscle aches. At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

On 1/24 the right leg was better but  I could hardly put any weight on the left leg in the am hours. In the pm hours both legs got some better. On Monday 1/25 both legs were much better and both finally cleared up on 1/27.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

I thought it was 14&#43; days since my dose 2 pneumonia vaccine, but I later looked it up and found it had been 10 days.

Several hours later I noticed that I had flu like symptons and my bones seemed to be painful.  Eventually I began having intermittent rapid heart beat.  I thought this may have been induced by tea (caffeine).  This rapid heart beat lasted until Monday (Feb. 15) I think.  As I mentioned it was intermittent.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

Monday I couldn&#39;t go in for treatment, and so Tuesday I went to the ER. I had a 100 degree fever. They did some tests. The ER doctor gave me prednisone treatments.

                                                Guillain Barre syndrome; He reports that he started to experience tingling of his feet and hands about 6-7 days ago. He came to ED at that time and was given pain medication for his back pain and muscle relaxants, which has since resolved but he feels stiffness in his lower back since then. At that time he was also noted to have low potassium and sodium, reports that he was given IVF and potassium repleted. He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I had the Qovid-19 virus back in March of 2020 and symptoms such as fever, chills, fatigue, muscle and body aches.  approximately 5-6 hours after receiving the vaccine i felt most of those same symptoms but on a much lesser scale.  all of those symptoms went away after 36 hours.  I spoke to some of my friends that took the vaccine the same day i took it and in general most of the friends that previously had the virus had similiar symptions again while those that never had the virus did not have any reraction to the vaccine.
