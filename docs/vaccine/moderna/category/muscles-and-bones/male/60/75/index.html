His wife (me) was so frightened that I will not be getting the Moderna series since it&#39;s so dangerous and will caution friends and family as well.

I remained in bed until about 4pm 2/5/21 &amp; soaked in a hot bath which relieved the joint pains.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

First severe gout flare up in 18 months, I take allopurinol and get gout in both ankles, right knee and right big toe.  At approximately 3:30 am started feeling gout starting in the left ankle and took Indomethacin. Pain started to subside around 7 am, took another Indomethacin at 9 am. by noon started feeling close to normal with some fatigue. I cannot think of any of my gout triggers in the past week that could cause the attack. Did not see possible gout flare up as a side effect until I researched the web as my knee was on fire.

                                                The night after my first vaccine, I awoke at about 3:45AM with extreme aches and pains all over my body for about 4 hours, then I was okay.  Twelve days later, I tried to go for a short walk with my wife and the pain in my left leg was horrible at times.  The calf muscle was swollen and pink and very warm to the touch.  Also my toes were kind of purple and my ankles were badly swollen.  I thought the toes and ankles might be related to my Bradycardia, but the calf muscle sent us to the ER to be checked for a blood clot.  They did check the major arteries, as those are the dangerous ones, but did not check the calf as they said if one was there it wouldn&#39;t throw to the lungs or heart.  I was discharged.  The swelling went down in the calf.  Still some aches in the back of both legs now when I walk very far - but really not bad.  Having the purple toes and a possible blood clot... my daughter who is a nurse encouraged me to submit this information.  Thank you.

Symptoms of greatest concern: Nausea, Headache, Chills for 1-2 days; and the ongoing Fatigue is now in its 4th day.  Details of symptoms with time of onset, duration and severity are provided below (Note: Injection with 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine took place at 9:24AM on 07APR21):  07APR21, 10:30AM ? Arm Pain: Onset of mild pain in arm that was noticed when not touching the arm; Level of pain was a ?1? out of 10).  An annoying level of pain where the pain ramped up to 3 or 4 on a scale of 10 when the arm was moved about began at 7:00PM on 07APR21 and lasted 12 hours until 7:00AM on 08APR21.  The pain diminished to a mild ache for another 33 hours until it became insignificant by 4:00PM on 09APR21.  07APR21, 1:00PM ? Dry Eyes: Onset of an intermittent feeling of very dry eyes that lasted approximately 1-2 hours at a time and continued over a period of 9 hours until 10PM on 07APR21.  07APR21, 3:30PM - Fatigue: Onset of mild fatigue that steadily increased until bedtime at 10:00PM on 07APR21; and was significantly more pronounced at 1:00AM on 08APR21 (was difficult to stand and walk 20? to closet to obtain a thermometer; could not walk straight and bumped into hallway on left 4-5 times).  Fatigue was rather frightening and severe from 3:00AM to 3:30AM on 08APR21 when I crawled to the bathroom, but could not get off my knees and collapsed on the floor until I could return to bed by crawling on the floor.  Was able to stand again at 7:00AM on 08APR21 and walked (slowly) 30? to a sofa.  Slept from 10PM on 07APR21 to 1:00AM on 08APR21; 4:00-7:30AM on 08APR21; 8:30-10:30AM on 08APR21; 11:00AM to 3:00PM on 08APR21; 7:00PM on 08APR21 to 3:00AM on 09APR21; 3:30AM to 7:30AM on 09APR21; 9:30PM on 09APR21 to 9:15AM on 10APR21; 6:40PM on 10APR21 to 7:00AM on 11APR21.  Ongoing weariness continues as I write this at 11:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Nausea: Onset of continuous nausea that lasted 13 hours and 20 minutes until 08APR21, 8:30AM. Nausea was particularly bad with intermittent dry heaves for the 7.5 hours lasting from 1:00AM to 8:30AM on 08APR21; Nausea then came in waves for 23 more hours until 09Apr21, 7:30AM when it was finally gone.  07APR21, 7:10PM - Headache: Onset of headache that has lasted 4 days (as of 11APR21, 10:30AM). Finally gave in and took one extended release tablet of 650mg Acetaminophen tablet about 25 hours after the vaccination (i.e., took painkiller at 10:30AM on 08APR21).  Took two Ibuprofen at 9:00AM on 11APR21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Chills: Onset of chills that increased to intermittent shivering by bedtime at 10PM on 07APR21. Awoke at 1:00AM on 08APR21 and could not get warm.  Two hours later, at 3:00AM, I felt completely opposite and could not feel cool.  These symptoms gradually subsided and were gone by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Joint Pain and Muscle Aches: Onset of joint pain and muscle aches that occasionally became annoying with twinges of pain. These symptoms subsided by 7:30AM on 09Apr21.  07APR21, 7:15PM ? Dizziness: Onset of mild dizziness that lasted 12 hours until 7:15AM on 08APR21.  08APR21, 1:00AM ? Measured Fever: Decided to measure temperature due to significant chills and shivering and found temperature was 101.0 at 1:00AM on 08APR21.  At 3:00PM on 08APR21, my temperature was 100.2 (this was 4.5 hours after taking one extended release tablet of 650mg acetaminophen).  At 3:00AM on 09APR21, my temperature measured 98.6 degrees and has remained near there ever since.  09APR21, 4:00PM ? Arm Rash: First noticed presence of a rash measuring about 2? x 3? on upper arm near the area that received the injection.  Mild itchiness was present about an hour later and a topical 2% diphenhydramine gel was applied.  The rash had dissipated by 5PM on 10APR21.

                                                I was extremely tired on Saturday. My shoulder hurt. About 3 pm, while urinating, I felt very light-headed as if I was about to faint. I stopped urinating and went back to bed.  That evening, about 8:30, I tried to eat dinner, but after three bites, I felt extremely tired. I leaned back in my chair, and I passed out. My wife woke me, but it took several minutes. She said my eyes rolled back in my head. She splashed water on my face. She said that I stopped breathing.  I woke up, then pushed my plate away and put my head on the table. I could not hold it up. I was sweating profusely. After several minutes, I felt that I was about to have diarrhea. My daughter and wife tried to walk me to the bathroom, but I did not have the energy to get there. I collapsed in the hall and hit my head on the door jamb. After several minute of trying , they pulled me up, and I then got the strength to walk the rest of the way. I had diarrhea, not suddenly, but it was as if my GI system emptied. It was soft, not loose, and there was a lot.  I went back to bed, and eventually slept.  I felt queasy the next day (Sunday), and I felt lightheaded at times, so I just sat or laid down. But I was feeling better. Today (Monday) I feel much better. A little tired, but much better. I went to the Pharmacy this morning, and they referred me to this website. I did not see the doctor.

                                                In summary this is a 60 year old male who was normal functioning presenting to hospital 4 days following second moderna COVID-19 vaccination with AKI, Rhabdomyolsis, Confusion/Delirium with agitation, multiple acute brain infarcts, DVT, and multilobar pulmonary embolism.  24 hours following vaccination patient began to become slightly confused while driving his wife to her vaccine appointment.  Symptoms progressed and included severe fatigue and muscle aches.  Patient was taking tizanidine and oxycodone to manage muscle / body aches which had been prescribed for his chronic back pain issues.  Patient was noted to be excessively sleeping, and also had fallen twice between vaccination and hospital presentation. 4 days following vaccination he presented to the emergency department with severe lethargy and confusion.  He was admitted with presumption of overdose of medication, given activated charcoal.  A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218. PT was 10.6, INR 0.99.  ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.22, co2 45, HCO3 18.4.  Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

                                                Within an hour or two of the vaccine second dose every area where I have ever had joint problems gave me problems. The worst was the arthritis in my left thumb, which also suffers from Carpal tunnel. My thumb where I do have arthritis became so painful and sensitive to any movement that I could not use it. At one point the pain took me to my knees. I now think that the far above average pain in that joint that I have been having for  several weeks  may have been from the first dose but the extreme increase in pain right after the vaccine seems very likely to be the vaccine. I also had painful electric like jolts in my back and ankle and have been experiencing higher than normal chest, center of rib cage pain. All these areas are problem spots for me but for all of them to flare up at once right after the vaccine is unprecedented as was the pain in my left wrist/thumb.

General sore joints throughout my body. 3. Intense and long headache that lasted for up to 36 hours until Acetaminophen was final taken.  The headache continued for another day or so at a lower intensity. 4. Fever up to 101 F and chills for up to 1.5 days. 5.

He then went speechless and began staring off to his left. He lost consciousness. His chin stretched out to the left and his head rolled back as did his eyes. Eyelids remained open. His head and upper body began to tremble and seemed stiff though his hands remained down by his side. Time slows when in such an emotional situation but I think the complete event lasted about 35 real seconds.  I wonder if his temperature being elevated a couple of degrees and with his absolute lymphocytes on the rise if his strong immune response revealed a family predisposition to dystonia?

                                                Had severe headaches and joint aches the first 8 to 12 hours which was on April 14th on a Wednesday. On Thursday April 15th I had a fever of 103.5 which took several hours to ever break below 103. On Friday April 16th early a.m. in the morning I my temp had drop to low grade around 99 F.  Saturday April 17th I noticed a 3 to 4&#34; diameter big red lump on the injection site which itched and hurt. Note! I used to give myself allergy injection in my twenties, the reaction was very similar to those reactions but bigger. It&#39;s been a week later I still not 100 percent and feel very tired all the time. But I know it was better than getting Covid.

                                                Couple days after 1st shot I started to feel tightness in upper back and then it started to bother  my right hand.  The pain would wake me up at night a couple of times- I would take extra strength tylenol and use a vibrator on it. Just before the 2nd shot I started to feel a little better. After the 2nd shot it made both my arms hurt but mostly my hands. I also had pain and difficulty raising and lowering my arms. Went to see my doctor; P.A. on 4/29/21 because my right hand was swollen. A blood panel was taken and results were good. Was prescribed Cadista-MethylPrednisolone 4mg.

Had decreased strength and sensitivity in extremities and Babinski&#39;s were upward going.  Discharged to home without medication and to F/U  with PCP in 4-6 days.  Saw PCP on 4/20/21. He had S&amp;G hyeresthesia, &#43; Rhomberg, failed tandem walk, and dysdiadochokinesia.  Neuropatic pain in shoulders, arms, legs, hands, and feet with weakness in hands and arms and sensory loss in left leg.  Was unable to get immediate MRI so patient was admitted directly to hospital.  MRI showed concern for transverse myelitis felt to be secondary to Covid 19 vaccine.  He will not get second dose.  Improved to near baseline with treatment of high dose steroids.  He also had an STEMI and was taken to the Cath lab where they found 50% blockage in a coronary artery.  They felt STEMI was caused by spasm.  Pt was discharged home on 4/26/21 and is having physical therapy to help regain his mobility.

                                                I received the Moderna Shot in My R arm on Wednesday 4/28/21. My R arm stayed sore ( not at the injection site ) but up in the shoulder joint. It was stiff and sore with abduction or any rotational movements. On may 10th I noticed that the injection sit was showing signs of irritation. Ove the next 2-3 day lesions formed at the posterior aspect of the shoulder joint and in the crook of the R elbow. By the end of the week lesions began to form on the anterior forearm 2 inches below the elbow joint and 1/2 way down the anterior forearm. A small Lesion also formed 3 inches above the wrist on radial aspect of the forearm and another small lesion on the bas of the R hand just below the wrist.  I started on proteolytic enzymes, L lysine and an anti viral 3x a day and acupuncture. Now  on 5/27 the lesions are mostly gone and the pain in the shoulder is almost gone also

Had scheduled chemotherapy on 5/6 and 5/7. Swelling/pain returned. Saw doctor on 5/13 and both primary and oncologist via video conference determined it could be cellulitis. Was given Doxycycline and was to follow up with doctor on 5/17 but I had an emergency visit with nurse practitioner on 5/15 with swelling from fingers to middle of my left arm. Was sent to hospital, then transferred to secondary hospital to see hand specialist, in case surgery was needed. It was not. Until my release on 5/19, I was on round-the-clock antibiotics and given pain meds as needed. Currently still do not have full use of my left hand. Chemo scheduled for 6/3 and 6/4. Oncologist will make determination whether to move forward or postpone.

On 6/5 He awoke at 3:00 a.m.  in the setting of leg cramps.  He got out of bed to walk off the cramps, but then developed substernal chest pain.  He describes the pain as ?squeezing? and cramping with radiation towards the left shoulder.  He began to feel lightheaded and diaphoretic, and thus began driving himself to the ED.  On the way, he felt his symptoms were worsening so he called dispatch he recommended he pull over at a nearby gas station.  EMS met him there and transported him the rest of the way to the ED. In the outside ED, he was initially hypertensive to 175/99.

He went back to the pharmacy and let her know that it hurt for several days and then went away, and he is still having the tenderness in the arm.  It was so painful that he could not sleep on it due to the pain.   He then had no problems up until 5/24/21 when he noticed some swelling on his ankle of his right leg.  He put it in cold water to see if the swelling would go down and it did not.  Then he didn&#39;t think about it again until it was stiff, swollen and wanted to turn to the right side and hard for him to drive and taking his anti-inflammatories.  It progressively got worse and around 5/25/21 the swelling was severe and doubled in size and getting worse and on 6/3/21 he could not get his pants off due to the swelling and he went to the Dr. The next day.  He had pain behind the knee, ankle, pain in the leg.  He went to the doctor, and they sent him to the ER for an US which showed DVT of the right leg.  He was informed that it was large and that it was in the thigh of his right leg and not returning blood to his heart.  He was put on Eliquis 5 mg twice a day and is doing well for him.  The swelling is a little better, the ankle is still swollen, and the leg is still swollen, the top of his foot is really bad, front of his leg and thigh.  The knee does not seem to be swollen, but the thigh is.   He has no problem with the left side.  He is to follow up with his doctor on Thursday.  He is on Hydrocodone as well for the pain as needed for his neck pain and lower back.

I also gained 15 pounds over that time period.  I also went to a allergist and he advised I was probably allergic to something in the shot.  He advised not to take the second shot.   All the other healthcare providers advised me not to take the second shot as well.   I have not had the second shot due to the symptoms I had.   With the &#34;tingly&#34; fingers there was also joint pain in the wrist and hands.

Maybe started after first shot.  Sometime shortly after second shot really noticed pain and I started experiencing trigger finger locking at night in my right hand middle and ring fingers.  NEVER had these symptoms or trigger finger experience prior to the vaccination.  Felt the pain and occasional clicking in those finger joints and soon thereafter started having trigger finger locking that wakes me up at night.  Never heard of trigger finger before and have since bought a brace to wear at night.

I waited two weeks to see my regular doctor and then I ended up in ER again because of pain. They gave me a shot of morphine. Sent me for an MRI and told me to see my doctor. My doctor sent me to another surgeon who had worked  on my arm on my left shoulder  . Months went by before I found out there was not anything physically wrong with the arm/shoulder. Trying to do Physical therapy twice a week - I&#39;m unable to fully work - I&#39;m a licensed aircraft technician. I&#39;m doing a desk job and  type with one hand.

                                                Approximately 2 to 3 weeks after my second Moderna shot, I began experiencing pain radiating from my shoulders to my hands.  Within days after that, I started to feel my entire body becoming inflamed.  I am experiencing excessive inflammation throughout my body.  Lab tests conducted two days ago found my sedimentary rate at thirty-four.  As a result of the inflammation, I have become unable to use my hands to perform menial functions as dressing myself, where my hands are unable to pull socks over my feet.  The inflammation continues today.  The pain level experienced as a result of the increased inflammation as resulted in significant diminished capacity for performing my daily routine.

                                                It was a very busy day at the pharmacy. I was working as a floater pharmacist, and the pharmacist of record told me they had some extra COVID shots and asked if I wanted one. I told him I did. He came back to me about 20 minutes later, after the paperwork had been completed, billed and my questionnaire filled out. He delivered the shot when I was standing and he was standing. I happened to glance over at him just as he injected me, and I thought he&#39;d injected me too high. I emailed my scheduler and told her to get in contact with him and get him to review his technique for administering vaccines. Two weeks later, I started having pain in my left shoulder. Stretching exercises helped me maintain a certain controllable level of pain until about a month ago. My condition has since gotten quite a bit worse to the point I had to leave work early two weeks ago. I went to urgent care and saw the PA listed earlier in this report. I missed the next week at work, and have since seen an orthopedic specialist who administered a cortisone shot. I have been advised to keep a log of my progress and report back in 2-3 weeks.

I was prescribe amoxicillin, albuterol inhaler, Codeine base cough medicine,  and prednisone.   I am fully recovered from my viral pneumonia.

                                                DX: Pericarditis  01/20/2021 S/S: Neck pain, acute chest pain or pressure, Chest pain, more on the left side at the anterior axillary line radiating across the chest while watching a movie occurred previous day and again day of admission while walking.  Possible alternative etiology: Initial concern for ischemia given history (prior MI with stenting, significant residual disease), but pharmacologic stress perfusion study did not show change from prior. One note describes pain reproducible with palpation, raising question of chest wall pain, but not mentioned elsewhere in notes, so appears pericarditis was considered the most likely etiology.  60 year old male with extensive CAD history with new chest pain.  Was hospitalized with new diagnosis of probable pericarditis.  Reported first dose vaccine given 01/14/2021, 4 days prior to initial symptoms. Of note, would not meet case definition for pericarditis (has chest pain but no other finding), but would meet myocarditis case definition (chest pain and troponin elevation); potential myocarditis is not discussed in the clinical notes, perhaps because the troponin elevation was fairly minimal.

I had a moderate case of COVID in May 2020 and had positive IgG AB in August. The symptoms started with heavy shaking chills, lasting 1 1/2 hours , fever and most concerning sustained tachycardia with heart rate of 180&#39; to 200&#39; over hours, which then destabilized into runs of Vtach and complex ventricular dysrythmia, low BP, profound weaklness, head aches and joint and muscle pains ( similar to the experienced COVID symptoms )

The right sided headache continued for days. On Saturday evening Jan 16th it became the worst headache of my life. Like a fool I didn&#39;t go to ER until Monday morning when I developed left handed weakness. I was visiting my son and presented to the Medical Center ER where I was diagnosed with an acute sub-dural brain bleed and airlifted to Specialized Hospital. Was admitted to the Neuro-Neurosurgery Unit.

Moved to Tendonitis/Arthritis wrists, hands, fingers and Left patellar knee tendon. SLOWLY improved but did not leave, despite treatment with Aleve, until 2nd vaccine 2/5/2021. Then, same symptoms worsened and included BOT patellar tendons, nd plantar tendons. Continues to present and are very painful at night, despite 2 Aleve BID daily, and  cannot make fist or extend fingers on  both hands and cannot walk on feet without pain at MTP&#39;s. Discussed with orthopedic surgeon who assured me that I was having &#34;an immune reaction in tendons to vaccine. It should get better over time&#34;. It has not at present.

But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

I called them and they had me marked down for no show but once I explained they set up another follow up appointment.

                                                After first shot in series, I developed slight headache, minor weakness, minor shoulder pain.    After second shot in series, 8 hours post-injection, I developed headache, moderate to severe joint pain throughout, fever around 100, extreme fatigue and weakness, slight difficulty breathing.  Went to bed for 19 hours and began to feel better with recovery in two days.  14 days post-injection, I developed a systemic rash throughout my body. Consulted with my PC physician. Was prescribed  Medrol Dose Pack.  This had very minor effect on rash.  Returned to physician for consult upon completion of steroid series.  I then received a steroid shot intramuscular in right hip and one week oral steroid protocol.  This achieved a more positive result, almost clearing up the rash.  I had a consult with a dermatologist on 03/02/2021 who confirmed the opinion that the rash was probably a side effect of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash has returned fully as of 3/14/2021.

I didn&#39;t sleep for 4 nights and I had difficulty walking. On February 28th I went to Emergency Room and I was given a Toradol shot. On Monday, March 1st I went to my primary doctor and gave Prednisone, Gabapentin and Meloxicam tablets then I was given 9 days off from work. Up to the present, I&#39;m under physical therapy  and I still have on and off pain on my left leg.

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

He was able to sleep okay, but then he starting on 3/20/21 his lower back and legs were very painful, really aching for the entire week.  The lower back and thighs were sore for the entire week, and didn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine, but talked to some coworkers and they too had the same reaction and missed work.  These symptoms lasted until about 3/29/21, and had a miserable week all week lying on a heating pad/ice.  He could not sit for very long, couldn&#39;t be in the car for longer than 20 minutes.  He took Tylenol and Diclofenac for these symptoms.

                                                I was very sore in the back and shoulders the following day.  Also, my blood sugar dropped severely into the low 60&#39;s and I was shivering cold.  Two days later I started to develop a rash that worsened over the next several days.  I tried treating it with Benadryl spray and tablets but there was no relief.  A doctor prescribed Prednisone which also provided little to no relief.

As time went on he developed a slight headache, then his body felt warm.  When he went to bed he tried to sleep and he could not and turned from side to side, and still could not rest, very restless, insomnia.  Then he noticed a pain in his right leg at the bottom by his ankle.  He then noticed that his right side was sort of numb and tingling, which went on for about 15 minutes and then it stopped.  The headache has subsided.  He has the soreness in the arm, but not like it was before.   All of his symptoms are subsiding.  He did not take anything for these symptoms.

                                                I woke at 4:30 AM and spent the next SEVEN HOURS explosively vomiting and diarrheic. Muscle pain and tightness spread from my left shoulder, across my back, to my right shoulder. Lying flat gave me dry heaves. Standing up made me dizzy. I?m coughing like there is fluid at the bottom of my lungs. The base of my skull felt like it was in a C-clamp. My temples felt like they were in a vise. I have a rash on my shoulder and arm. I  smelled like rotting flesh. (To head off any concerns over lifestyle or hygiene, I have a BA, BFA, MBA, MSL, and completing my PhD.)  After two days of exhaustion, vomiting, diarrhea, pain, etc. I took a shower at 11:58 PM Saturday. When I swiped my soapy face towel over my left should, I wiped away a layer of skin, like a burn victim.  Be grateful I don?t have power. I would stop the Moderna injections until someone finds out what it is about my genetic makeup that might signal those with similar genetics to stay clear of Moderna.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold). On 25-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation), COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) and MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold) outcome was unknown.   She said they had been very careful, but had met with some friends and 2 of their friends also tested positive.    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.      The day after he received the vaccine he felt minor aches, like he was coming down with a cold. On that Thursday he went into a fib. She took him to the ER and it took several hours to regulate his heart rate. While making arrangement to transfer him to a new hospital they did a COVID test and it was positive. They were shocked as he had not been showing any symptoms. He spent the night in the hospital.  Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. However the event of Covid 19 and myalgia is unlikely related to vaccine. Covid 19 is  a confounding factor for the event of myalgia and base of the available information, the vaccine is not known cause of Covid 19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.

                                                Patient received the first Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and a few weeks later he noticed jaundice and hematuria. He was admitted to the Hospital, and was noted to have dramatically elevated eosinophils (26.29 k/uL), elevated creatinine (2.36 mg/dL) and elevated LFTs (AST/AST/Alk Phos/Tbili all up, mostly direct). His eosinophils improved with pulse dose steroids and the diagnostic work up continues. There is diagnostic uncertainty about what caused this dramatic increase in eosinophilia, but it appears temporally related to getting the vaccination. Our working diagnosis is autoimmune vasculitis, but he is also being treated for possible parasitic infection, and will require very close follow-up. 61M with PMHx HTN p/w generalized fatigue, L flank pain, and decreased UOP.   He was in his usual state of health until 5 days prior to admission with onset of general fatigue/sluggishness. This was followed by a few days of dull abdominal pain, watery bowel movements, and increased frequency which spontaneously resolved, though the fatigue persisted. Yesterday evening, he noticed new L flank pain, red urine, and decreased UOP associated with mild dysuria (he describes it as needle-like pain in his urethra) which prompted him to call EMS. Denies fevers/chills/night sweats, myalgias, respiratory symptoms, melena/hematochezia. He&#39;s never had pyelonephritis or kidney stones before, no recent urinary instrumentation, antibiotic use, or hospital stays.    He recently received the first COVID vaccine and is due for the second COVID shot on Monday. He lives with his sister and works as a mechanic. He is not on any other medications or supplements. Not currently sexually active.

Notably has been afebrile and fairly well appearing. Symptoms were preceded by several days of watery diarrhea, cough with sputum production and subjective weight loss. Recently received moderna vaccine, and he was concerned it causes his symptoms.  Underwent extensive workup as below with involvement of multiple services including Renal, Pulm, Rheum, Allergy, ENT, and Cardiology. Had one nasal lesion biopsied by ENT, which was non-diagnostic. Renal bx prelim without clear e/o vaculitis, although obtained after steroids. Negative testing for primary hypereosinophilic syndrome. Extensive w/u notable for ANCA positive at 1:80 with  MPO only slightly elevated (20, uln 19) and PR3 wnl.  cMRI with eosinophilic cardiomyopathy, for which cards was consulted as below. Additionally, toxacara ab positive and schistosoma ab indeterminate, although per ID both schistosomiasis and toxacara infection unlikely. Per rheum, overall felt presentation 2/2 hypereosinophilic syndrome, potentially the eosinophilic stage of EGPA (given low &#43; ANCA, low &#43; MPO) vs.  End organ effects of idiopathic eosinophilia. Briefly received CTX 2g IV qd (4/10 - 4/12) until diagnostics returned. Treated with solumedrol 1g qd x3d (4/11-4/13) transitioned to prednisone 60 mg qd (4/14-) to be continued until rheum f/u, with rapid decline in eosinophilia. Received pre-treatment with PO ivermectin 20 mg before steroids. Treated with flonase nasal spray, symbicort and albuterol for respiratory symptoms. Deferred cyclophosphamide, with consideration of IL-5 or IL-5R targeted biologics as an outpatient. Treated with atovaquone for PCP ppx. Per ID, treated with praziquantel (for schistosomiasis) and albendazole (for toxacara) out of an abundance of caution, although low c/f visceral larva migrans given lack of compatible imaging findings and no known exposure to dogs and cats or schistosomiasis given remove travel history.  Data - CT A/P (4/10): Mild L hydroureteronephrosis with b/l periureteral and perinephric stranding and b/l urothelial thickening.

Baseline Cr unknown but Cr was 1.5 (OSH BI) and urine alb:Cr was elevated to 36 in 6/2018, at which time CKD was thought to be 2/2 untreated HTN. Now presented with persistent hematuria, HTN and proteinuria with UCx without e/o infection, all favoring nephritic process. Renal and urology consulted MALB/CCR 994.5. CT scan with hydronephrosis, felt to be eosinophilic pyelonephritis. Pt underwent uncomplicated renal bx 4/14 (after steroids) which showed preliminary very mild focus of interstitial nephritis with scattered eosinophils and immunofluorescence evidence suggestive of a mild immune complex-mediated disease without current activity. EM pending. He was treated with sodium bicarb 1300 mg bid. Hematuria improved but did not resolved by time of discharge. Cr on discharge 1.6, close to baseline of 1.5 in 2018.    #Sclera Icterus #CBD Dilation on CT #Elevated LFT Sclera icteric and CBD dilation on RUQUS to 1.8cm with gallbladder sludge and small gallstones. MRCP with diffuse intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation to the level of ampulla, with associated ductal and gallbladder wall edema, complex material in the gallbladder lumen and CBD, and confluent periportal lymphadenopathy. No obstructing stone or discrete mass. Findings likely represent cholangitis such as eosinophilic cholangitis in light of severe eosinophilia.. No documented LFTs here, but OSH (BI) records indicate normal LFTs and viral hepatitis studies in 6/2018. Repeat Hep B non-reactive non immune, HCV non immune, HAV non-reactive.  BIli remained stable and ALT and AST continued to rise after initiation of steroids. GI was consulted. RUQUS 4/15 with dopplers with persistently dilated CBD to 1.4 cm with sludge in CBD but with patent portal vein and hepatic veins. Anti smooth muscle ab positive on day of discharge; antimitochondrial ab pending. LFT uptrending at time of discharge, although patient declined to stay inpatient for further workup. LFT at discharge ALT 194, AST 114, ALP 262, TBili 6.3, DBili 5.3. ERCP to be considered as an outpatient.     #HTN SBP on admission 160-180. History of HTN, not on any home anti-hypertensives. Per BI records, he was prescribed amlodipine 10/valsartan 160 in 6/2019, but pt reports self-discontinuation after ~2 doses. BP remains poorly controlled. Likely related to potential nephritic syndrome or renal infiltration by eosinophils, likely with contribution of high dose steroids. While inpatient, treated with hydralazine, labetalol, carvedilol, and amlodipine. BP regimen on discharge amlodipine 10 mg qd, carvedilol 25 mg qd. Avoiding ARBs and ACEI per Renal, although will likely need to add once AKI resolved.    #Microcytic Anemia Patient with drop in Hct from 14.1 on admission to 11.4 4/14. Continues with hematuria, but denies current hematochezia. Suspect combination of blood loss and hypopoliferation given RPI 0.29, likely anemia of inflammation/acute illness given ferritin 1.010. Vitamin B12 &gt;2000, Folate 11. Iron 151, unable to calculate TIBC. Noted to have persistently low MCV in low 70. Hemoglobin electrophoresis ordered.    #Vitamin D deficiency #HyperPTH 25-OH Vitamin D 6. No e/o hypocalcemia. Phos slightly elevated on admission, but subsequently downtrending, likely iso renal dysfunction. Treated with ergocalciferol 50,000 U weekly x12 weeks   #Right mandible lesion Sclerotic changes of the right mandible near the condyle noted on CT scan. Surgeon recommends outpatient follow-up, although patient declined.    #Hematochezia #Hemorrhoids Patient with new bloody diarrhea 4/11. Some e/o hemorrhoids on exam. CBC stable. Treated with tucks pads, dibucaine ointment and hydrocortisone cream.   #Little Medical Follow-up Pt reports that he has not seen a doctor in ~3 years.Cholesterol 124l LDL 73, HDL 10. HgbA1c 5.2. Will join Dr&#39;s panel on discharge   #CHIP mutation  RHP with DNMT3A mutation at low VAF. Will follow in cancer precursor clinic

                                                Patient came in for first dose of Moderna vaccine. He reported no previous allergic reactions in the past. Once the patient received a vaccine, he was instructed to wait for 15 minutes. Close to the 15 minute mark, patient described  his arm and face feeling &#34;hot and a bit heavy&#34; on the side he received the vaccine. Patient reported no swelling of the throat or face area. He had no trouble breathing. Patient did report he was experiencing some dry mouth. I assessed the patient for any rash, redness or hives around his face, arm and chest area. Patient was told to lie down on the floor and we elevated his legs. At this point, pt was still reporting no trouble breathing, but still felt hot around his arm, face, and chest area. An ice pack was placed around his face and neck which helped a bit. Patient kept describing a sensation of tightness and heaviness around his left arm and  fingers . We continued to observe the patient for another 30 minutes till paramedics arrived to take the patient to a nearby hospital.

Rash was around the area of shot, all pink, about 3 inches long vertically and 2 inches wide. Itchy and hurt when touch. Today is Monday, 5 days after shot, rash is slowing going away and improving. No other rash in other parts of my body. Other symptoms: some fatigue and headache and muscle soreness which lasted for two days after shot. Took tylenol and symptoms went away.  I did not get rash on 1st Moderna shot on March 31 but did get sore shoulder muscle for 4 or 5 days. No symptoms.

Approximately two hours later I developed paralysis in my right fourth and fifth finger. I eventually saw a neurologist who diagnosed me as having Turner parsonage syndrome. The pain has resolved but I continued to have paralysis in my right fourth and fifth finger and the lateral portion of my right hand.

When I woke up, my body temperature was 100.4 F. Around 10 am I went to the kitchen to prepare my breakfast. During this time I was feeling that my head was heavy. Then I start to feel that I cannot stay anymore and I sat down on my stool. I don&#39;t know what happened after that because I lost my consciousness. After that   I found myself lying on the back of my kitchen floor and I was completely wet. Few minutes later my body temperature was normal 97.88 F and I started to feel much better.

                                                My husband passed away June 3, 2021 resulting from complications which began a few hours after receiving his 2nd Moderna shot on April 29, 2021. He never tested positive for Covid19, however his first symptoms were the typical fever, muscle aches, rash. He declined daily from a host of mysterious symptoms including full body rash, blood clots, muscle spasms, atrial fibrillation, ulcers lining his esophagus and colon, and exorbitant WBC (157K) with extremely high eosinophils (90%). He was treated with a host of drugs including antibiotics, steroids, blood thinners, ivermectin and finally chemotherpay (Campath). His ICU team  included hematology, pulmonology, ... oncology and infectious disease. After an incredible amount of diagnostic testing ( daily routine blood work, EKGs, chest x-rays, CT scans, MRI, bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, colonoscopy, skin biopsy, genetic testing) no definitive diagnosis could be made, however, he was given the possible diagnosis of chronic eosinophilia leukemia in late May. The big question among the medical staff was, &#34;Did the shot trigger something?&#34; He was eventually treated with the chemotherapy drug Campath, which reduced the WBC and EOs some, but his organs, especially, lungs had been very compromised by the high WBC and eosinophils. Several days after being placed on a ventilator and given a feeding tube at the end of May, a CT scan and MRI confirmed patient had suffered multiple strokes. He passed away a half hour after being taken off the ventilator the morning of June 3, 2021. His death certificate read:  A. cardiopulmonary arrest  B. acute hypoxic respiratory failure  C.  hypereosinophila

Patient reported that the adverse events started immediately after the first shot.  Increased anxiety and suicidal thoughts required increasing the dosage of a benzodiazepine.  Company Comment:  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Discomfort and soreness at the injection point and left elbow joint about 2 hours after vaccinated.  Similar to my 1st vaccine 4 weeks earlier, except this time my elbow joint had some soreness.  The soreness and swelling continued to get worse throughout the day and could not sleep well that night.  The following day I woke up with a painful and swollen elbow joint, and still had soreness around the injection point.  By the afternoon I could not move or extend my left arm with severe pain.  The swelling and pain increased and Advil or ice was not effective in reducing these symptoms.  The pain and swelling got so severe and I could no longer tolerate the pain and went to Urgent Care. I continue to experience left elbow joint pain, and now experience similar joint swelling and pain in my ankle and knee.  It&#39;s not as severe and painful as my left elbow joint.   I am making this report now because 2 days ago I started to develop the same symptoms in my right elbow joint and leg/hip joint, and now I can barely walk.  The joint pain is severe so I will seek medical treatment today.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

I needed to take Tylenol through the night which did help with headache.  The symptoms were significantly decreased by 6 pm that day (Feb 24th).

                                                I had the Covid virus early in November 2020 I had a bad reaction to my 1st Covid shot and wanted to ask if I should get the second one? I was able to get an appointment for a Covid vaccination thru store/pharmacy. I had the shot about 4:00 on Friday. On Saturday about noon I started not to feel right; head ache and stomach. About 4:00 I started to get an increase in my temperature. At 5:30 I started getting uncontrollable shaking. Over a span of about 30 minutes I had 4 or 5 episodes that lasted 30 - 45 seconds. I had a temperature at one point that reached 102.3 I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen every three hours before falling asleep for the night. On Sunday morning I still had a slight temperature (99.9), but it seemed like all my body joints ached. I ended up feeling better about 4:00 on Sunday. Reply

                                                The morning after the vaccine, the symptoms started with a stiff neck and headache on the left side including soreness at the injection site. As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.   As a school teacher, I have taken the appropriate precautions and received a Covid19 test: Results negative.

I have had two orthopedists trying to help me - had a shot of steroid in that joint and that didn&#39;t help. I have severe bursitis. The injection was given in the joint and not in the muscle which is what is causing this. I  take Motrin and Tylenol for the pain. Limited use of shoulder joint because of it. I communicated with the Health Department. have not heard a word back from anyone.

                                                Patient woke up the morning of 04/13/21 and explained to his wife that he felt &#34;foggy&#34; mentally. He went about his morning chores on the farm. He came inside to sit in his recliner with his feet elevated for almost an hour.  At approximately 9:40 am, his wife observed that patient suddenly stiffened without warning and cried out. His arms stretched over his head in the chair and his legs stiffened like a board. His body was visibly contracted.  He continued to cry out. His eyes were closed, he was salivating, and his forehead was sweating.  His wife watched him move his arms suddenly to his lap, however, his fists were clenched tight.  She tried to get his attention by calling to him. She noticed his lips were turning blue. She continued shaking him, shouting and then slapped him. Patient did not respond.  She called 911. After 7 minutes, he finally relaxed some and started snoring loudly in the chair. He continued sleeping soundly for about 10 minutes while she waited for EMS to arrive.  The wife did elevate his head , as she was told by 911 to do so.  She was not able to wake him up during this time period. When the EMS arrived, he was just starting to move. They got him up to stand and he was able to verbalize his need to go to the restroom.  They arrived at the hospital at approximately 10:25 am and was released after testing at approximately 2:30 pm.

Severe, recurring nasal discharge and minor amount of sneezing first night after shot.  After the discharge ended after a few hours I felt that my (prevaccine) sinus infection congestion in upper sinuses actually got better. I have taken a lot of prednisone for chronic sinusitis and asthma and after the vaccine (espec first night and second day) I felt similar (unable to sleep--jittery--flushed). Slight fever that never exceeded 100 degrees first night and second day.  Normal temperature 48 hours later.

                                                Several days prior to the shot, I had been experiencing sore, muscle-related pain in my neck, especially the left side and shoulder area, making it difficult to turn my head to the left. I was still experiencing this pain at the time of the shot. The evening of receiving the shot, I awoke at about 11:30 p.m. with extreme pain in my left shoulder (would describe as 8 on scale of 1 to 10)...not sure I could even get out of bed. Was able to &#34;walk it off&#34; and went back to bed, but had the same pain and difficulty getting out of bed twice more that night. Once prone, the pain would eventually subside. Went to work that morning (the day after receiving the shot) but returned home after an hour as I had a mild fever (100.1) and chills. I took 2 Ibuprofen and slept for about 2 hours. I awoke with temperature down to 99.7 and less pain in the left shoulder/arm area. Throughout the day, my temperature continued to go down and the chills lessened. Two days later, I have no fever and mild pain at injection site.

                                                On 3/4/21 noticed my left calf was swollen. I did not think much of it at first. A week later the swelling had progressed to include my ankle. Saw Dr. and ordered an ultrasound on both of my legs. Right leg was normal &amp; left lower leg had a clot(s) in it. Dr. ran blood work then prescribed Eliquis. Saw him in follow-up on April 14. Swelling down but not gone. Renewed the prescription for Eliquis and set a followup visit for Friday June 18. He ordered additional blood work to be drawn on Wednesday June 16 to have results at the next visit.

Not sure if I should report - wanted to &#34;log it&#34; if it helps the experience database.   Warnings of a &#34;couple of days&#34; were a way understatement in my case. Second shot went OK, without any issues. I was very hesitant before second shot, almost did not show up.

                                                The vaccine was given outside of the system (? county program).   Patient&#39;s daughter thinks diffuse or migrating arthralgias started about 4 days after the vaccine was given.  He visited ED on 3/09 complaining of pain in multiple joints for 3 weeks.  No labs were done then.  He returned 3/19 with difficulty walking and talking, was sent to SNF after MRI with diagnosis (probably incorrect) of acute cerebral infarct.  He returned to the ED on 3/29 less alert, and no longer able to speak.  LP showed 10 WBC (mostly lymphs) and protein 70.  MRI was repeated, looked similar to previous scan , but reinterpreted as diffuse cerebritis, worst in basal ganglia.   By 4/02 he was deeply obtunded ... (cont. on next page)

                                                I woke up at 3:10 am feeling cold and chilling. I took by temperature and it was 98.4. I normally have a temperature of 97.1 - 97.7. I take it daily multiple times. My hands were cold. When I got up and started moving around I didn&#39;t have any more chills. When I got up at 6:30 am. I just didn&#39;t feel well in general. Slight feeling of sniffles, congestion.  I would get some aches that went away in a few seconds. They were at various points in my body, knee joints, muscles, and my head. They were simply a nuisance. I felt tired all day. My blood pressure was up 15-20 points on both numbers during the day. I&#39;ve told my doctor when my blood pressure is higher, I&#39;m having more aches and pains as though I&#39;m fighting a virus. I tolerated the symptoms most of the day, letting my immune system try to work it out. My symptoms seemed worse at 5:45 pm, so I took two ibuprofen. My temperature was 98.9 at that point. The highest it&#39;s been. All my symptoms got better until 1:15 am. I woke up feeling like I was chilling, but not as bad as yesterday, so I took two more ibuprofen. I feel 50% better today and haven&#39;t taken any ibuprofen. Here is the really strange part. I had these exact symptoms and similar temperature ranges twic last year. In July and October I think. I didn&#39;t get tested last year because they were minor symptoms. They were just nuisance symptoms. I took ibuprofen right away last year.  I followed the masking guidelines, social distancing, etc. So, is it just coincidence I had similar symptoms last year two times, that I had when I getting the inactive Moderna vaccine? I had no reaction to the first shot.  I just wanted to provide the information in case it is helpful. Very strange. I expect no other symptoms in a couple of days.

NOTE: Automatic Wrist BP readings (also takes pulse) closely follows manually-taken Stethoscope Sphygmomanometer readings. 4/22/21 Doing active range of motion pre and post injection. 7:45pm Signs &amp; Symptoms (S/S) Mild - arm discomfort w/swelling, fatigue, lightheadedness, and body ache. Ice- alternating periods of 15 minutes on, then off - done several times. Lessen arm discomfort, no redness noted. Slow increase S/S through night. 4/23/21 mid afternoon- marked increase S/S plus start sporadic flush feeling, noted 1 x 1 inch oval red area over site. 8pm- Increased &amp; more constant flushed. Temp 98.9 F. Noted marked increase body ache, first moving across chest, then descending to both toes/feet. 9pm- Temp 100.4 F. Monitoring temp, hoping peaked. 9:30pm 99.9 F- 9:50pm Felt very dizzy, self-palpated pulse- felt weaker than my normal, noted more distended veins on arms. Asked wife to get pulse oximeter- sat/pulse ranging 93-97, depending on finger, hand, how long on each; noted amplitude lower than my normal; 82-86 range pulse. 9:53pm Obtained BP R wrist supine 105/61 Pulse 82. Felt too dizzy for BP to be done in sitting. BP confirmed by second reading. BP wrist supine sys about 30 -35 &amp; diastolic about 10-20 below baseline. 9:56pm Took 1000mg Acetaminophen. 11pm Temp less than 99, marked decrease head to toe pain, more towards my mild lightheadedness at times due to my mild TB baseline. Able to ambulate. 4/23/21 4-5 am Temp low 98 range (more my normal). 7am BP L wrist supine 135/70 Pulse 69. Sat 98 reading obtained very quickly, pulse amplitude more my normal. Feeling better but not to Pre-vax. Repeated BP &amp; Sat readings twice during the rest of date. Don?t recall time of 1st BP 135/70 Pulse 70 &amp; Sat 96/Pulse 69, noted injection site redness. 9:30pm- started having headaches, pain on L side head (near site of my head wound/mild TBI site), slight increase lightheadedness, injection site red area increased in pain &amp; size to covering almost full deltoid area. BP 125/73 Pulse 65 Sat 97/ Pulse 65. Both Sat numbers obtained very quickly, as per my normal. Ice used. Alleviated pain to tolerable. Monitoring size of red area &amp; intensity/duration of lightheadedness. Recall a strong tingling sensation going down my left arm once. Noted change in sensation afterwards. Slight increase lightheadedness felt due to what usually happens in change in weather, like rain coming. Rain occurred. 4/25/21- Basically the peripheral of deltoid showing redness with some scattered redness centrally. At 8pm redness fully covering deltoid area. Will continue to monitor (&#34;Covid arm&#34;). Other than fatigue thought due to vax, NO S/S of markedly reduce platelets. If need be, will contact Teledoc. Have prior training as a respiratory therapist &amp; occupational therapist.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Pain, Rash, Panic attack (2 episodes) and Anxiety. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: PREDNISONE (for 6 days). Concomitant products included PREDNISONE for Pain and Rash, METHYLPREDNISOLONE (MEDROL DOSEPAK) for an unknown indication.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking), GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse). At the time of the report, POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA (Polymyalgia rheumatica), PAIN (Pain became more consistent), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Arm pain/pain is in his arm), ARTHRALGIA (Pain in shoulders), ARTHRALGIA (Left hip hurt), ARTHRALGIA (Joint pain) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in legs got worse) had not resolved and HYPOKINESIA (Could not lift arm), INFLAMMATION (Inflammatory reaction), TREMOR (Shaking) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (he could not get out of bed, was shaking, and used a cane to walk) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Since the patient&#39;s first dose of the Moderna vaccine, he had not been on prednisone the whole time but was recently put on a Medrol pack. He was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica as his pain became more consistent after the first dose of the vaccine. His pain is in his arm and shoulders, his left hip hurt and he was not able to lift his arm all the way up.  The patient believed that the vaccine may had caused an inflammatory reaction that aggravated his pain that was present before the vaccine. The patient also stated there was a time that he was not able to get out of bed, he was shaking, and had to use a cane to walk. He says he never had joint pain, only stiffness when waking up and soreness in his hip and leg that was painful. After the vaccine, his arm hurt to the extent he could not sleep on it and the pain in his legs had worsened.

I had taken acetaminophen by 18:00 and again at 24:00.  Much to no avail.  At 06:00  the pain was pretty severe yet and acetaminophen was not cutting it.  I had some hydrocodone from a previous injury still in my medicine cabinet, so I took one of them.  It made a big difference.  By 08:00 most of the symptoms had diminished.  I didn&#39;t take anything else until 17:00.  By then my left arm was really hurting.  By 21:00 the pain was all the way down my arm and up into my neck and  jaw.  I took another hydrocodone.  The pain was still pretty severe at 22:30 so I took 2 Ibuprofen.  my pain had diminished enough to get to sleep by 23:30.  When I work up this morning my pain was localized to just around the injection site .

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Following first shot, I had really bad joint and muscle pain around joints. Took hot showers for pain and Tylenol. Pain in right shoulder (where I have something else going on) increased a lot. After the second shot (about 3 days later), joint and muscle pain returned in all joints. Now, May 9th, joint pain is really bad in arms, hips and legs. It is difficult to walk and to raise arms. I haven&#39;t slept due to severe pain. I hope this subsides. I will give it a few more days but it&#39;s very painful.

Previously, I have never had TMJ or bruxism issues, both of which have been diagnosed in the past two months and seem to have resulted from the post-vaccine pain. My GP prescribed anti-inflammatory pills that have helped to some extent with the neck pain and helped diminish the clenching. The original post-vax pain continues unabated, now three months later.

After a couple of weeks the lymph node pain continued and intensified with additional pain radiating up and around the entire left shoulder for about two more weeks. Then at about 4 weeks later, the ongoing pain continued, with an additional burning nerve pain and numbness radiating down the upper arm, across the elbow and down the lower arm into the wrist. No relief of pain, now at 11 weeks post second vaccination.

I got there at 8 or 9 o clock at night and was hospitalized until the next day. I was there for around 5 days. It ended up being diagnosed as a infectious disease. I was on Vancomycin IV.  I was then put on vancomycin home infusion for six more weeks that along with opiates for the pain.

On 4/11/2021, I awoke to excruciating, bilateral pain in my hips and shoulders. I could walk only with difficulty and I had trouble dressing myself. This pain persisted for days and, after testing to rule out Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis, I saw rhematologist Dr. at Health Center on 5/5/2021. She diagnoses me as suffering from PolyMyalgia Rheumatica and prescribes MethylPrednisolone 16mg.  Over the course of a few days, the pain subsided and I remain on this dose of MethylPrednisolone today and continue to see Dr. monthly to track the status of my Polymyalgia Rheumatica.  She suggested that I post my experience on VAERS because she has seen some other instances of Polymyalgia Rheumatica proximal to the Covid vaccine.

                                                Within 2 weeks of my first injection I became experiencing diffuse muscle and joint pain through my shoulders, back, and leg.  The pain during the first several weeks was so extreme that I was unable to sleep.  I then began experiencing tinnitus.  Since that time the tinnitus has persisted and I have severe low back and hip pain.  All X-rays from an orthopedic consult have shown mild arthritic changes.  I had MRI?s of the hip and lumbar spine 3 days ago and am awaiting the results.  My activities have been significantly limited due to pain any the tinnitus has gotten worse.  A week of prednisone therapy provided temporary relief of the tinnitus and some relief of hip pain.  Both symptoms quickly returned within a day of prednisone being discontinued.  Although I have a history of mild hearing loss, I have never had tinnitus before and the low back pain, sciatica, and hip pain were non existent prior to the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.  I did have the second dose on April 6, but noticed no changes after that dose.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

                                                My oxygen levels dropped below what they had been previously as I am recovering from Covid infection  tested positive 20 October 2020.  If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

Muscle aches and pains, joint pain, lower back pain right side, headache.  Fever broke after 24 hours.  Some continued weakness for a couple days.  Then back to mostly normal.  10 days later, mild fever returned in the evening of 2/9, and 2/10, temp of 101.  These second rounds of fever went away during the day.  And temp was between 99.8 and 101.2. My question is:  Is it normal to get a mild fever 10 days after 2nd vaccine shot?

                                                Injection 1 - Slight headache. Appeared a couple hours after shot, went away about 4 hours after that. Injection 2 - Sore at injection sight. About 12 hours after injection, woke up with moderate chills and joint &amp; muscle ache, diarrhea. Developed headache a few hours after this.  All of these symptoms went away after 5 - 6 hours except for joint/muscle ache.  Those took about a day to dissapear.  On the 5th day after 2nd injection I developed a cough in the chest trying to expel phlem.  Still have a little bit of chest cough (10th day) but very minor.

                                                Severe arm pain at and around the injection site 6 hours after the injection. Nausea and slight headache during the  night at about 3:00 AM that went away in a couple of hours. Arm pain persisted the next day. The following day the pain also involved the armpit, possibly lymph glands. Lesser pain at the injection site and arm pit areas the following day and was very slight the third day after the injection. Can?t wait for my second dose and despite the side affects will happily stand in line for my next dose.

After 5PM mainly 101 fever, tired, muscle aches, headcahes, chills, hair follicles hurting ( had this when I had COVID-19 mid-March 2020); My symptoms from the 1st shot brought back memories of how the COVID-19 virus felt, except I did not have the congestion and sinus issues.  Fever broke at 3AM morning of March 13, woke up soaking wet, entire body and hair drenched as if I stepped out of the shower, did not dry off and got into bed. Felt fatigued Day 3 but feeling a lot better, able to be more active. Today is March 19, 8 days since shot #1 and my arm at the Vaccine site is still a bit sore, redness has subsided however.  Worried post shot 2 may be worse.

                                                After the first day I developed soreness at the injection site.  After about 2 days, the soreness moved to my left shoulder joint.  Currently, 8 days after the injection, my left shoulder joint remains sore and any motion to left my left arm laterally from my side is painful; like my joint is inflamed.  There is no redness or other visible external signs or discoloration.  I can not say for certain it is linked to the Modern vaccine as I&#39;ve had left shoulder issues infrequently in the past.  But timing wise, my current discomfort started shortly after receiving the vaccine.

I&#39;m taking  Orencia and was taking that at the time of the outbreak (I forgot to put that in the medicines that I take) that&#39;s given to me by my rheumatologist. He also prescribed lorazepam to deal with the excessive itching. Then I saw a dermatologist he gave me some shots in my skin, but there was so many of them it couldn&#39;t continue I would be a pin cushion. He also gave me some cream that really isn&#39;t working. Seems like it&#39;s getting worse instead of better.

                                                My left hand was in severe pain for maybe two hours. I took three Aleve to try and stop the pain. I could not close my hand into a fist, nor could I hold anything in my hand. No grip at all. My hand remained like this for most of her night. Today it is a little better, I can close my hand and make a fist, but I am unable to close tightly and grip anything. I feel as though the strength in my left hand is gone for now. No pain today but the muscles in my wrist and in my left hand are still somewhat tight  and present what feels like muscle tightness parallel to a pulling of the muscle. I rode my motorcycle to work yesterday, the morning ride was good, on the way home, my hand started with the pain thing. It was severe enough to prevent me from using the clutch lever properly. Presenting a lot of pain squeezing the lever to engage the clutch.

Always been rock solid at 98 with maybe a 97 every two months.  This is really an outlier event.  Reading taken on six different fingers with one monitor reset.  Returned to 98 following day.  Other expected symptoms:   Temp 99.8  (generally 97.6 - 98.0).  Injection shoulder sore, felt puffy (but no visual difference).  Medium &#34;Brain Fog&#34; (senses seemed disconnected, lack of concentration).  Lethargic legs (not sore or weak, just slow to respond).  Left neck and ear aches.  Slept about 14 hours day after shot.  No symptoms other than sore arm the day of shot.  BP and blood sugars up, but at higher end of my normal ranges.  BP 175/93  (16th).  (at 149/93 on 17th). Blood stick reading 198 (16th).  (at 158 on 17th)

                                                I received my second dose of Modena vaccine last Thursday (4/15) morning at 9am.  No initial reaction occurred.   Later that Thursday my arm got the expected tenderness, muscle ache. Towards evening, I got pretty tired and was starting to get some body aches, took 2 tylenol and went to bed at 9pm. Slept in late and was tired. Started to feel like mild flu which is what I expected.   Friday took some naps and continued mild flu symptoms. Went to bed about 8pm and got up at 5:00, feeling a bit better.   Saturday I continued to improve, arm was much better, less flu symptoms, didn&#39;t need tylenol, had turned the corner.  Cont&#39;d... Saturday evening was going to go to bed at 10pm and noticed my left cheek was kind of pressing against my gums - it was swollen. It continued to swell some but was not hindering my throat or breathing.   I decided to stay awake, keep an eye on it and if necessary would go to an emergency room. The swelling increased only slightly more over the next couple of hours to the size of maybe a golf ball (a bit less) on the left side and a much smaller amount on the right side. No airway effects. I did apply some ice but not sure if that had an effect. I slept for a few hours.   Sunday morning I did not take my medications as a precaution.   Sunday the swelling was slightly less and seemed to be going down a bit. I took 2 Benedryl at 11:00 am which really knocked me out, slept. Sunday evening the swelling was noticeably improved but not gone. Took 1 Benedryl at 10:00pm bedtime.   Monday still had a bit of swelling on left and right swelling is nearly gone.  No other symptoms.

                                                I recently received the second Moderna vaccine, April 20. The next day I experienced severe body aches and extreme tenderness to the skin of the arms and upper torso, followed by 1-2 days of malaise. Then, on 29-30 April, I began having extreme pain in the lower back, migrating up the thoracic spine and around the left to the mid-chest area. I took one 500mg Naproxen 3x/day which helped mitigate the pain temporarily. I then discovered a red blister on my side 1 May. Since then my symptoms have been painful back/chest and stabbing pain at the site of the blisters which followed the path of the pain described above. I was diagnosed with Shingles yesterday, 3 May. I have been prescribed 1000mg of Valacyclovir

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.   On 06-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1. On 28-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (difficulty breathing), SINUS HEADACHE (headache/similar to sinus headache), MYALGIA (achy) and FATIGUE (tired). On 12-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PNEUMONIA (pneumonia) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced COVID-19 (COVID -19) and PYREXIA (high fever (for over two weeks)). At the time of the report, PNEUMONIA (pneumonia), DYSPNOEA (difficulty breathing), COVID-19 (COVID -19), SINUS HEADACHE (headache/similar to sinus headache), PYREXIA (high fever (for over two weeks)), MYALGIA (achy) and FATIGUE (tired) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 12-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram: she had pneumonia. On 12-Apr-2021, Drug specific antibody: Positive.         No concomitant medications reported by investigator.  Treatment included Levofloxacin, inhaler (albuterol) and steroid dexamethasone.  Based on the information provided, a causal association between the administration of mRNA-1273 and the event of Covid-19, pneumonia is assessed as unlikely as pneumonia is of an infective etiology. Although the other events are consistent with, the known safety profile for mRNA-1273, based on onset of the events, they are more likely symptoms of pneumonia,   This case was linked to US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-095621 (Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the administration of mRNA-1273 and the event of Covid-19, pneumonia is assessed as unlikely as pneumonia is of an infective etiology.

                                                Hello,  Had the 2nd Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at the pharmacy on April 2nd at 6:45 PM.  The nurse asked me to stay around the store for 15 minutes for any immediate side effects, and to drink plenty of water when I got home.  Did some shopping, and probably left about 30-45 minutes after the shot with no side-effects, and when I arrived home about another 45 minutes later still had no side effects.  Upon waking the next morning my right arm where I received the shot was extremely painful, and I could not raise any higher than parallel to the floor without extreme pain for 2-3 days.  Then I also started with a slight fever, which of the times checked, reached about 101.  Also was getting muscle and joint soreness, and later that started getting extreme cramping in my leg calf muscles while sitting on the couch.  I then had to stand up for 5-10 minutes, or walk around a little and then after sitting the extreme cramping would begin again so I would have to stand up again.  That went on all day.  When laying down that night the cramping would subside enough to sleep a little on and off during the night.  The calf muscle cramping started to gradually subside, but took about 17 days to go completely away.  The day after the vaccine when my legs were cramping I was extremely worried about possible leg clots since I had never had extreme leg cramping like that my entire life, and I was drinking plenty of water like the nurse recommended.  Best regards,

And indeed I was contacted by text everyday for a week, then weekly until my 2nd dose on May 3rd. After my 2nd dose, the only question I was ask was did I get my 2nd dose. Nothing about side effects. While I had no real side effects from the first shot, I did after the 2nd.  Started about 3am, 12 hours after the 2nd shot and continued for about 12 hours and then quickly disappeared within 2 hours. Pretty bad body aches, muscles and joints. Low grade headache. Extreme fatigue. Everything hurt, moving or sitting still. The only thing that remained normal was my appetite...I was hungry and was able to eat...no digestive problems.  Anyway, I was disappointed the system that had ask so often after my first dose, did not ask at all after my 2nd.

                                                Initial reaction to second dose was typical inflammation response - fever, chills, extreme fatigue and aches for 36 hours. Initial reaction also included severe joint pain. The joint pain has persisted to current date. The pain is most intense in joints that had previous pain from arthritis, surgery, burst disk or injury (in order, fingers, neck, neck, knee and hip.) In each case the pain after the vaccination is several degrees more intense than I experienced in the year previous to the vaccination.

                                                I started feeling cold and shaking and very bad headache and discomfort all over. I was bedridden for a couple of days, then it got a little bit better and then it got worse again. Then it got hard to breath. So I lost over 30 pounds in the matter of a month and that is unlike me, I have always been overweight and a food addict and so I called the DR and they told me to get a covid test because the symptoms were similar. I got the test and it was negative. I went to the ER and they said I got pneumonia, which I do not know is related or not but it did happen after the shot and seemed pretty odd. I tend to be the person to just tough things out. At the ER they told me pneumonia in my right light and gave me antibiotics. I called my pulmonologist when home because it was getting worse and he prescribed more antibiotics. I went to see him and he took another x-ray of my lungs. I still had stuff in my lungs so he gave even more antibiotics. He took another x-ray and CT scan recently that I do not have the results of yet. I have vertigo which just started about two weeks ago as well, I read about exercises to do for that and it helped a bit but it came back and now cannot get rid of it. It still is kind of hard to breath as well. I have no appetite which is weird for me and I am cold which is also very strange. I usually could go in a cold place of like 35 degrees and be fine and now I am just always cold. Even when I know I&#39;m hot and know it&#39;s hot, I am cold and using a blanket. I shiver and shake so much from being so cold but my bed is soaking wet from sweating, it just doesn&#39;t make sense. I have a hard time going to sleep because I am cold and uncomfortable. Even today I am still very tired and now with the vertigo it is hard to do anything today, just talking a lot like right now I am out of breath.

The itching made sleep very difficult for the next two nights.  The itching was decreased somewhat by the use of 1% hydrocortisone cream and moreso by 10 mg of Loratidine. The severity of the urticaria has decreased somewhat over the last 3 days since onset but is definitely still present.

I put a heating pad on the bed and even though the bed and pad felt warm, the chills continued for about 10 minutes. Later in the night, my daughter came and checked my temperature. It was 105, even though I didn&#39;t feel like I had any fever. I took some Ibuprofen and my daughter put a cool damp cloth on my forehead. I never felt hot. In the morning, the area in the bed where I was sleeping was completely soaked!  My temperature was normal.

He was observed for about an hour and then discharged since nothing was found and told him he had a reaction to the vaccine.  Pt still has constant pain in left leg and has not been able to work.  Pt has an appt w/ PCP on 3/12 for FU.

                                                A volunteer (vaccinator) who was being trained by a nurse injected the vaccine very high in the shoulder - approximately  1 inch below the acromion process. Pain in the area of the injection site and shoulder began 3 hours after the injection. Pain was exacerbated by active motion of the arm, especially abduction. The pain resolved over 48- 60 hours. There were no other symptoms from the vaccination- there was  no fever, fatigue, nausea, chills, adenopathy, etc. The concern is that the injection was clearly not in the proper location and I have questions about the efficacy of the 2nd dose that was administered and the efficacy of the overall vaccination series because of this. I contacted the Health Department and reported this. They instructed me to also submit it to Vaers.

                                                ADVERSE EVENT REPORT: MODERNA VACCINE 1 of 2 Dates: Feb. 17 to March 16, 2021  1. I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

                                                1.) Strong soreness in lower back and gut area. Hard to bend over. I don&#39;t typically suffer from back pain and didn&#39;t exert or do anything that might have strained muscles. Pain seems muscular in back and deep in lower gut/groin area in front.  2.) More concerning is the tinnitus or ear ringing I am experiencing. Very loud and unrelenting. Feels like ears need to be popped such as when air pressure changes. However, can&#39;t swallow hard or chew hard enough to clear ears. It&#39;s a bit flummoxing as it is unrelenting. Sounds like cicadas in my head.

                                                I received the shot in my right arm  at about 10:15 AM and was told to wait 15 minutes in my car in case of side effects.   After 15 minutes I had none so I left headed home. About 15 minutes into the drive I felt a tightness at first on the left side of my neck which then moved up into my cheek muscle and lip.   My face (left side) felt similar to having received a shot from a dentist but not as numb.  I then began to feel a sensation of numbness in the upper part of my left arm traveling down to my left palm.  The feeling in my arm felt as if I had been punched,  The feeling down the arm to the palm a numb feeling with a slight tingling like the development of pins and needles in my palm.   I got home about 11:00 AM 45 minutes after having received the vaccine and at that point the symptoms were beginning to dissipate..  At the time I am submitting this (12:23 PM) I only have a slight numb feeling in my upper arm.  Everything else is good. The site of the injection in my right arm is fine and I experienced no effects as of this point.

                                                I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye; painful stiffness in the injection site arm; felt a little tired; joint pain in the injection site arm; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) in a 64-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 038A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Cataract (cataract surgery, left eye) on 26-Mar-2021. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: SHINGRIX in 2020.    On 27-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 28-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (painful stiffness in the injection site arm), FATIGUE (felt a little tired) and ARTHRALGIA (joint pain in the injection site arm). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) had not resolved and MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (painful stiffness in the injection site arm), FATIGUE (felt a little tired) and ARTHRALGIA (joint pain in the injection site arm) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       Treatment for the ophthalmic herpes zoster include sulfamethoxazole 160mg BID and valacyclovir 500mg 2 tablets TID. Company comment: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and recent history of cataract surgery the event eye herpes zoster is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. For the other events the causality cannot be excluded.   On 05Apr2021, his eye Dr assessed the area with shingles and thought that the shingles was most likely due to the trauma to the eye from the surgery.

The next morning he woke up with a little headache, and by that evening his stomach started aching up, having diarrhea, throwing up and bones/joints and muscles were aching and felt tired.  He continued to take the Tylenol.  By dark Saturday evening he was getting better.  By Sunday evening he was feeling pretty good again other than feeling a little weak, 3/28/21.  He continued to feel week for 2-3 more days, but then was fine.  He did call his doctor on Monday to let him know whether he should take the shot or not, which he did today, 4/23/21.

The dizziness is coupled with nausea depending on my activity. I was unable to do much at all because of the severity of this. I will not take another vaccine no matter what. Being this sick is ridiculous, I will take my chances.

Two weeks after, however, developed severe unrelenting pain in the left shoulder girdle. After about one additional week, grip strength became weak and dexterity for manipulating small objects became impaired. Focused examination showed MRC grade (R/L as appropriate): trapezius 5/5, shoulder external rotation 5/5, deltoid 5/5, biceps 5/5, triceps 5/5, wrist extension 5/5, wrist flexion 5/5, finger extension 5/5-, APB 5/5-, APL 5/4-, FDI 5/4&#43;, ADM 5/4&#43;, FDP IV/V 5/3-, FDP II/III 5/5. Pinprick and temperature sensation were normal. Left biceps reflex was 1&#43;; all other UE reflexes were 2&#43;. EMG/NCS done and consistent with mild lower trunk brachial plexopathy. MRI done and shows enhancement in the scalene muscle just adjacent to lower brachial plexus. Presentation felt consistent with Parsonage Turner syndrome, brachial neuritis. He was treated with a one week prednisone taper. Over the next 3 months, he has had gradual improvement in strength and sensation. Only minimal deficits remain.

                                                Symptoms are variable but some combination troubles me every day since March 6, excepting the twelve days I was on the Prednisone prescription.  In general, pain increases during sleeping hours, when I grow stiff and less flexible. I wake several times during the night (almost hourly) dry-mouthed. I don&#39;t know if pain wakes me or not. I rise with great difficulty and hobble to the bathroom.  Mornings are the worst part of the day, but I find if I keep moving, I loosen up and the general inflexibility goes away, and to some degree, so does the pain. It is never entirely gone. I also find that the pain seems to generally occur during movement and not at rest, although the pelvic pain and upper leg pain has and does occur while at rest.  The most regularly-occuring pain is hamstring and shoulder (shot locations). Rising from a laying or seated position has always been the most difficult.  Lately, pelvic pain has been rare, and knee pain intermittent.

                                                June 14, 2021   This E-Mail concerns continuing ?side effects? from the second shot of the Moderna vaccine.   I received the second shot on May 11.   Today is June 14.  So, I am writing this report 5 weeks after the last shot, with many of the effects continuing.  I am 64 yr. old male.  I have a history of high blood pressure, which has been controlled successfully with medication for the past 8 years.  I had a hemorrhagic stroke in 2013, successfully recovered.  Otherwise no severe disease-type medical risks, I am health and physically fit.  I live with serious chronic pain from a multitude of factors.   I have severe tendinitis-type problems in my arms and legs; joint stiffness and pain, tight muscle problems.  The vaccine ?attacked? and severely worsened these symptoms.  The night of the vaccination, I started getting serious pain in a number of painful areas ? knees, ankles, elbows and forearms, like inflammation, all at once.  This pain advanced to injuries in prior injured areas, like knees forearms lower legs, and worsened when I would try basic loosening up exercises, to point that I could barely walk for a couple of weeks.  After exercising or loosening up, muscles and joints would tighten up severely, exacerbating pain and function.   I was barely able to walk or do much for a week or more.  I?ve needed extra bodywork and chiropractic sessions to deal with this.  The problem with tendinitis areas is less bad than right after the shot but still significantly worse than it had been before the vaccine.  When exercising, I am slower and able to do less time at cardio functions and have to lift 10-20 lbs. less weight when using weight machines.  I also get joint pain, ala knees when I use exercise bike; knees and shoulders get a certain type of pain (I feel it on the outside of the joint).  These are quantifiable factors.  The joint problems mirror a type of joint problem I had for a couple of years after my stroke, not what I experience every day.  The joint is weaker, and I feel a vague pain like the pain is coming from outside of the joint.   So, the vaccine seems to have ?attacked? and exacerbated problem areas of mine which already affect my ability to function adequately, and it is unclear whether or not these will fully resolve.  It is not a ?one or two-day? thing as suggested.    Additionally, I?ve generally felt drowsiness and ?headachy? during the day since.  These symptoms have lessened, but still there to some extent.  It is unclear whether or not I will fully recover or if anything else is wrong.  I am doubtful that I should take any additional ?booster shots? later if suggested or mandated.  Your attention to this matter is very much appreciated.

                                                On the midnight of April 29, 2021, I got fever at 100.4 degree. On the morning of May 1, the fever was gone; in the afternoon, I suddenly felt back pain. The pain lasted for about a month. During the time, I didn&#39;t see doctor and didn&#39;t take any medicine. On May 30, 2021, I suddenly got right leg pain which made me couldn&#39;t walk for even 20 steps. The whole right leg from the heel to the butt feeling painful. Those pain I felt like muscle pain, tendon pain, ligament pain and nerve pain. It&#39;s already the 7th week. Even though now the pain is lighter than before, but it&#39;s still painful. I took some medicines to ease the pain, but I didn&#39;t go to doctor.

                                                Beginning 1.5 hours after the 2nd Moderna dose, my hands began shaking, and my arm was sore. These symptoms continue today and have not gotten better.  Beginning 2 days after the shot, my left foot from my toes to my ankle turned black and green.  Beginning 1 week after the shot, my toes turned purple; this has continued on and off since May 5, 2021.  Beginning 2 weeks after the shot, the lymph nodes in my neck, roof of my mouth, nose, and ears were swollen and tender. At random times, I would get hot and begin to sweat profusely 2-3 times per day, and my ears would get extremely red. At this time, my temperature would be between 100F and 101F, and my blood pressure was elevated. These symptoms lasted about 4 weeks.  Beginning 3 weeks after the shot, I developed a walnut-sized, squishy knot on the inside of the joint of my left elbow. I also began losing the hair in my armpits and have since completely lost all the hair in my armpits and on my legs.   Beginning 4 weeks after the shot, I developed a golf-ball-sized, squishy knot on the inside of my right knee, similar to the one that appeared on my elbow. I also developed a walnut-sized, squishy knot on my left knee just below the kneecap.  Beginning 5 weeks after the shot, I developed shin splints but had not completed any running or other activities that could explain the tenderness in my shins.  Beginning 6 weeks after the shot, I noticed a loss of muscle mass in my arms and legs.   Beginning 7 weeks after the shot, I have had severe chest pain three times. Each felt like I was having a heart attack; 2 times were in the middle of the night and 1 time was early in the morning.   Beginning 8 weeks after the shot, I began getting lightheaded at random which has caused me to fall multiple times. In addition, I have begun bruising very easily; the bruises take weeks to heal. My left eye is also extremely tender and waters more than normal.   Beginning 9 weeks after the shot, I notice that I have begun drooling even though I have never drooled in the past. My gums occasionally feel tender when I brush my teeth.

                                                Shoulder became sore about an hour later.  Hands and feet started gradually becoming cold approximately after about 2 hours?.went to bed under covers to warm hands and feet?.put sock on but extremities became freezing cold.  Got up out of bed to drink some water and notice a green hue in the lighting. In my kitchen, we have ceiling bluish white lights but my vision color acuities saw the kitchen in a mint greenish color light. The green numbers and setting on my refrigerator panel were enhanced green. It is as though the other color perceptions in my eyes were not working. Everywhere I looked, the flat screen TV, laps etc. had mint green hue. After resting the night and highway into the next day my hands and feet got back to normal temperatures. The greenish hue or tint in my vision came back to normal  about a day and a half. My color perception didn?t instantly return to normal but a noticeable gradual return until the spectrum was normal.

                                                I got my injcetion on the &#39;top&#39; of my shoulder.  I didn&#39;t see it go in, but noticed entry point at home.  Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

An hour later the pain returned this time for more than 20 minutes.  Twenty-four hours later, same muscles are exhibiting a strong burning sensation. Patient was also somewhat dehydrated at the time.

Rec&#39;d shot Saturday morning, pain started Sunday evening and ended Wednesday morning.  Pain was enough that it woke me up Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights.  I treated the pain with ice and ibuprofen, but still very painful to move and to touch.  Wednesday it got better about as quickly as it started on Sunday.  I did not do any physical activity that would have triggered such sever pain.  The only thing that was different is that I received the Moderna  vaccine.  By Thursday my knee was back to normal.

Went to bed at 8:00 due to fatigue.  Felt nauseated.   Was hurting really bad with the joint pain that lasted until about 2:30 AM.   He woke up this morning and is feeling much better.   He did not take anything for the pain.  It attacked his joints mainly his ankles and knees and was not able to move.  His knees felt hot to the touch.

                                                History      Chief Complaint Patient presents with ? Elevated Blood Pressure ? Dizziness     multiple times a day   Patient who presents to the emergency department today for evaluation of hypertension, head pain, blurry vision, and neck pain. He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm. Currently patient states he still has a little bit of a posterior headache but it is much improved. He denies any fevers, body aches, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or swelling of the lower extremities. He has no known drug allergies.       ? ED Course: I discussed physical exam finding with patient. Apparently most of his symptoms have already resolved at this time. His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient&#39;s work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

Then,  five or six days after the injection, I began experiencing chills.  They progressed to violent shivering by Feb. 16.  On that day, I had a fever of 102.  The next day, the fever topped out at 103.  Today, my temperature has been dropping.  I  also have been experiencing itching all over my body.

                                                Approximately 16 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I began to get quite dizzy.  The staff was notified by my wife; and, a Pharmacist responded immediately to check on me.  As minutes passed, I became more dizzy and was experiencing a mild &#34;out of body&#34; type experience as though I was in some sort of a dream.  Knowing in advance that many people had experienced adverse reactions from these vaccines, my wife and I had brought along an &#34;eppie pen&#34; in the event I might experience something similar.  The problem was that my &#34;pens&#34; had expired in 2015.  My condition improved when I lifted my facemask to get more air.  While the Pharmacy was obtaining a new &#34;Eppie pen&#34; for me, the Pharmacist told me to take the mask off.  This stabilized me until  we left after 45 minutes.  I did not need to use the new Eppie pen.  Still dizzy, my wife helped me to my vehicle.  Enroute, being somewhat weak, I clasped against a parked car and to the pavement.  During the trip home, my muscles began to ache and my joints stiffen and hurt.   A heaviness began to present on my upper chest.

I had no idea it was in the vaccine, although a smaller amount than I had taken before. I started experiencing severe and awful anxiety and panic that night I got the vaccine. I had other minor side effects that were expected but they went away within a day. Several days later, I began experiencing pain in both my bilateral Achilles tendons and bilateral knee pain. A physical therapist examined both and said that I was swollen. I have had both of those problems under control for a very long time. I am improving somewhat  but nearly 2 weeks later I am still having some repercussions. I am now scared and don&#39;t know if I should get the second injection done because the previous adverse symptoms were awful. Thank you.

I felt that I was extremely ill for the first 45 hours.  I ate very little and I could not bathe.  I stayed in bed, leaving only to go to the restroom.  On the 3rd day, I was much improved and I would characterize my symptoms as moderate.  I was able to get up for short periods and I was also able to bathe.  On the 4th day (today) I believe that I am symptom free with the exception of continued arm soreness at the injection sight.

This subsided in appx. 30 minutes however I suffered a very poor night?s sleep. Following day, Feb 20, 2012, I felt as though I had a very mild virus with achiness in neck and shoulders primarily with lesser discomfort in back and legs. Was a mildly fatigued with mild headache as well. Did not check temp but never felt feverish.  On 2/21/2021 I felt symptom free until evening when a slight trace of achiness returned. I slept very well that night and woke symptom free, encountering  no further reactive symptoms.

I remaining in bed off and on for about 36 hours and then worked my way back to eliminate most of the symptoms.  However, after that and continuing at this time, i continue to be achy, particularly in my joints and my hands, fingers and neck, and I find that my lower jaw seems to be moved forward when I awake in the morning.  The achiness is particularly acute when waking in the morning, particularly in my fingers..  The pain is by no means debilitating, but it is noticeable.  I would rate the pain 3 or 4 when waking and 2-3 throughout the rest of the day.     I have not sought any treatment.

                                                Patient hospitalized for fever thought to be related to 2nd dose of covid vaccine. See hospital a/p from H&amp;P.  Assessment/Plan: Fever, myalgias and headache, I think this is all secondary to his recent Covid vaccine yesterday, dose 2.  I would anticipate his symptoms should resolve over the next 24 to 48 hours.  He was started on vancomycin in the emergency room given history of MRSA.  We will continue for now, though I think less likely secondary infection.  He is on Cipro for SBP prophylaxis.  He does not seem to have significant ascites.  I think bacterial peritonitis is less likely.   End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  I spoke with individual.  Plan is to dialyze him here today.   Cirrhosis -he was evaluated by the transplant center at Hospital on February 25.  His meld was 25 at that time.   History of type 2 diabetes.  His last hemoglobin A1c&#39;s have been all 5.  Can remove that from his problem list.

                                                A little over 12 hours after getting my first Moderna shot I experienced severe joint pain in my left knee that caused my entire left leg to become so painful I could not move it at all, as if I pulled an ACL. I decided to ride it out as each day went by the pain subsided more and more to where after 3 to 4 days later the pain was about 90% gone.  I still feel a little bit of soreness on the left side of my left knee cap though.  I am mostly back to where I was before the shot.  During the first few hours of the worst pain I did experience a cold sweat also.  All in  all I am feeling pretty good now however, a bit concerned about my second dose scheduled for March 23rd though, especially considering that I have neve had a negative reaction to a any type of vaccine before and I am not allergic. Great thanks to all!

                                                Neck pain began 4 or 5 hours after the shot in left arm.  It has persisted daily and contant since then ans limits range of movement in my neck.   I had to previous long term persistent neck pain.  I am currently undergoing physical therapy for my neck which is slowly improving  the condition.   I asked my doctor if I should take the second vaccine.  He was indecisive.

                                                Exactly 4 days after receiving the vaccine I experienced intense stiffness of muscles and joints from neck to ankles.  I struggled to get up from sitting and then could barely walk until I was moving for a short while; then it was easier to walk but with the pain of the sore muscle/joint feeling.  It felt like I had been beat up, especially in my upper torso front and back.  It stayed the same until approximately 3:00 a.m.  on the second day.  i noticed the pain, stiffness, and difficulty moving was getting better.  It gradually continued to get better for the next 24 hours until completely gone.  My calf muscles were the last to return to normal.

This has continues to get worse and at 9pm chills, fever and dry coughing began. Saturday morning the fever and chills cleared up . The fatigue has increased, but the muscle and joint pain are lessening. Dry cough continues.

                                                After roughly 3 hours my left shoulder muscles  started feeling weaker and started having mild pain but as time went on the pain got worse. As of today (3-16-21) my left shoulder muscles still have moderate pain when moving my arm.  I could also feel mild pain running up to the base  of my neck as well. Basically any left shoulder movement  still has some pain.

                                                Seen at the walk-In clinic on 3/9/2021 where he presented with complaints of right leg weakness, numbness, and tingling.  He was transferred to ER for further evaluation and management.    The symptoms (numbness in his hip and thigh) began around 1400 while he was working.  He went about his day. The symptoms progressively worsened while he was ambulating around the hardware store. In the ER, his sensation of his right leg was dulled as compared to the left. The numbness extended from his hip to his toes. Felt a pressure-like sensation in his thigh and calf.  Denies pain. Felt as though his right foot is floating 2 inches off the ground when standing with both feet on the ground. Reported his right leg is 1-2 inches shorter after a femur fracture many years ago. Nothing made his symptoms better or worse.  Did have an episode of feeling generally hot and then cold the evening prior to admission. Denied any trauma.     Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stools, urinary habit changes, hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, myalgias, arthralgias, recent illness, or fever.   MRI showed T2 changes on the right side of the cord down of the thoracic spine concerning for her transverse myelitis.  Patient did have Covid vaccine 7 days prior to onset of symptoms, one dose mRNA vaccine.    He is on day 3 high-dose methylprednisolone thousand milligrams IV ×3 days.  He has noticed an improvement in the pressure sensation from the knee up the thigh on the right, no longer having tingling in the right lower leg or the left foot.  He is still having numbness over the anterior right thigh.  Yesterday when he went to bear weight on the right heel, he had a sharp pain with increase in weakness.  That has since settled down.  He did have a few involuntary myoclonic movements as described yesterday.  This writer reached out on 3/22/2021 for information on his Vaccine lot number. He stated &#34;At this point I am attending physical therapy, I am walking with the aid of crutches or a walker. There is improvement in the foot and lower leg regarding the numbness, but the upper thigh is still pretty much completely numb yet.&#34;

Over next 2-4 hours weakness and aches worsened and also felt scratchy throat and sometimes mild chills. Slept about 3 hours, woke still feeling sick, took 2 Tylenol and had light supper, then slept all night. Better but still weak next morning (3/24), rested in day, nearly normal by evening 3/24.

                                                I initially had pain in left shoulder, some chills and light headiness. Those dissipated by the second day. But 5 days later I developed a hematoma in my left bicep. It was like someone punched my arm as it was purple and red. Within a few weeks it turned to a brown and yellow and currently no coloring. However, my shoulder is tight and some pain and my bicep is experiencing tightness and pain. The Dr who administered the shot was not wearing gloves and injected the vaccine towards the rear of the shoulder and caused me to bleed. I usually coagulate well.  My shoulder has discomfort and when moved side to side has a crackling and clicking.  I had Torn labrum surgery approximately 4 years ago.

                                                Patient presented to our facility due to progressive swelling of his LLE. Patient is an avid cyclist and reports he began training again for the spring season approx. 1 mo ago.  He had L calf tightness present for a few weeks as well as slightly painful knees which he attributed to his age and mild deconditioning over the winter.  He traveled with infrequent stops on 4/2/2021 to visit family.  He continued to have discomfort and increasing ankle pain, thus presented to ER.  LE ultrasound venous dopplers performed showing extensive DVT: L femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal veins.  CT also demonstrated acute PE w/in distal R and L main pulm artery and w/in bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulm arteries involving all the lobes.  Patient had remote history of LE DVT in 2017 after  mild bumping of leg and placed on Xarelto for 6 mo. Had genetic testing completed at that time which was negative. He has had no clotting issues since. ( Received Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on 2/3/21 and 3/3/21. Reports brain fog and fatigue approx. 20 hours after vaccination followed by the above.) Patient discharged on rivaroxaban.

                                                The night after this second Moderna shot began to have headache and low grade fever. Had some mild residual myalgia following first shot Moderna Lot 027AA21A on 03/11/21 in left arm but resolved. Overnight began to develop severe morbilloform rash first in buttucks and legs, then posterior chest, then anterior chest, neck. About 80% of body involved. Then after about 30 hours after inject began to have difficulty with esophageal narrowing. Breathing was okay, Speech was okay. Decided to go to Emergency Room at Hospital when I could not swallow my saliva. In the Hospital seen by nurse practioner and ER physician. They started IV line and gave bolus of Dexamethazone 10 mg. Immediately had relief of swelling in esophagus and some improvement in urticaria. They discharged me with orders to take Prednisone 50mg po Qam for three days. I also took Benadril 25-50mg po Q6H to treat pruritus which worked well. By forth day  had 90% resolution of uticaria and pruritus. I had cystic mass develop over right anterior tibial muscle which was red and warm about 5 cm in diameter. This has reduced in size post prednisone. Wearing support stocking and taking Ibuprofen 200mg po BID which as eliminated tenderness and it has shrunken in size. Waiting to see if it resolves or will get ultrasound

As the evening went on the tightness spread across left arm into chest and neck and over to right arm.  Felt somewhat better in morning but still sore in both upper extremities.  2 days later (3rd day after shot) he went to use the restroom in his home and could not get himself off the toilet - he describes himself as having lost all strength in his legs and when he went to stand he fell right over.  He could not get up and had to be helped to the bedroom.  He rested for several hours and used a walker to ambulate around the house for the next several days.  Now feels back to normal.

Date and time of vaccination: (list both if they received both shots): 1st dose 1/29/2021 ~1300-1400. 2nd dose 2/26/2021 ~1300-1400. Pt reported ~3-4 days post-vac of 1st dose, pt experience ache and pain in every joints &#34;joints felt like I was crippled&#34;, reports his whole body was in agony only with movement but not at rest. Pt reported that these symptoms did not subsided and the 2nd shot seems to make the symptoms worse per had lots of muscle pain and he could not move, had to have his wife help him in and out of the bed. Pt reported he took extra strength Tylenol on 2/27/2021 after his 2nd shot for a duration of 3-4 days which provided no relief. Pt reported that just approx. a little over a week prior to his scheduled orthopedic surgery (2/18/2021 - for an microscopic surgery for his torn MCL in his left knee), pt was seen by his orthopedic surgeon because his left knee had puffed up on the side, as a result his doctor drained his left knee and gave the pt a cortisone injeciton in his left knee to reduce inflammation. Pt reports that after rcvding cortisone injection he felt great and all his ADEs from the Moderna vaccine subsided. Pt reported that his orthopedic surgeon had adv that his ADEs of joint and muscle pain and achiness may be vaccine related. Pt reported doctor prescribed him Methylprednisolone 6 days dosing regimen approx. 1 month ago, and while taking pt reported he felt great and all symptoms subsided. Then approx 3-4 days post last Methylprednisolone dose was taken pt reports all his symptoms came back again. Pt reached out to his orthopedic surgeon again and got another prescription for Methylprednisolone and just completed his last day of dosing today and reported no pain again while on the treatment. Pt have another follow up appointment with orthopedic surgeon on 5/4/2021.  Recommend pt to monitor if any of those symptoms occur again, and if so discuss with doctor and contact MD for further evaluation.  5/5-Patient does not have any pain at this time, he went to see orthopedic surgeon yesterday on 5/4/21  to get another Methylprednisone script just in case of relapse since the steroids significantly helped with pain in left knee. Ortho surgeon did not refill Methylprednisone script. Patient is upset and is at primary provider&#39;s office today to get another script.

                                                About 2 weeks after the second Moderna shot, patient developed dry cough and noticed a weight loss.  Patient went to Dr. to report condition.  Dr. did bloodwork, chest x-ray, and abdominal ultrasound.  All came back negative.  Patient has subsequently started taking Ensure, which has stabilized weight, but continues to have digestive issues, which is mostly stomach gas that seems to come mostly severely when sitting down.  Patient takes 1-3 Tums a day to deal with gas, but has not returned to Dr. as the situation seems manageable, though somewhat distressing as gas has never been a problem with patient before.  The dry cough, the wet loss of about 10 pounds, and the stomach gas, all seemed to develop after the second Moderna shot.  The patient did test positive to Covid in November, 2020, and had a mild case that did not require treatment.

                                                Site of injection (left shoulder) was slightly sore after about 4 or 5 hours.  Shot was administered at 8:05AM.  Felt fine until about 6:45PM.  Noticed aches and painst beginning in neck, shoulders, and a slight headache which came and went.  at 8PM, was very tired and began to feel somewhat lightheaded.  Went to bed and felt chills.  Awakened six or seven times during the night to urinate.  Was a little dizzy each time I rose from the bed.  Also felt feverish and took my temperature.  It was elevated to 99.3F, which for me is definitely elevated, since it is usually no higher than 98.6 and is often around 97.9F.   Felt very tired the next morning and had continued mild aches and pains and occaisional shingles-like stabbing pains in rotator cuff of left arm , mastoid bone behind right and left ears, and occaisional  random stabbing pains in earl lobes.  The pains were mild to moderate on occaision.  Left arm was a little sore during movement, especially near the shoulder.  Felt very tired throughout the day and went to bed at 8PM the day after the shot.   That evening in to nightime when I would get up to go to the bathroom, I began to feel better and after midnight of the second day, I felt pretty much back to normal.  The lightheadedness, aches and pains, and tiredness all went away by the morning .   I would also report that I ate normally during these effects and did not suffer any nausea or feel like vomiting at any time.

He does have a heart condition.  He feels that he was coerced to get the vaccine, and informed that if he did not take it that he would be moved to an area where he would not have privileges for visitors, etc., and then found out a week later that was not the truth.     He got his vaccine, he has more shortness of breath, bad pain in his joints, lots of confusion with his brain, blood blisters on his hands that are oozing on his fingers.  Sick for 2 days on the 2nd vaccine, but he continues with joint pain, oozing, and brain fog.   He has an injury to his knee and he cannot get to the infirmary and cannot buy Tylenol in the canteen.

I was a little short of breath and my pulse was elevated.  It seemed to improve after a little time. I started to feel worse on 01/12/2021. Ten days after the vaccine I tested positive on 01/14/2021for Covid-19. I had serious symptoms with the Covid-19. After five months I have been unable to work as a Physician and I am still having. I recently got tested for Polyethylene Glycol and I tested positive on a skin test. I am unsure whether to get the second dose. I also have headaches and memory defects muscle aches weakness and a weak left arm. My headaches happen daily and they vary in severity. I am scheduled to have a Bifrontal MRI tomorrow. I started to have problems with concentration within a week of the vaccine and I am still having problems with that. I experience muscle and body aches as well as neck and shoulder problems. My energy level is improved but still very low. I am scheduled to see a Neurologist. My left arm is very weak from the shoulder to the forearm since that time Radiculopathy.

                                                June 16, 2021 Heart Ablation - because I had been in A-Fib and in order to get me off the medicine, I had to have the ablation. So that it would get me to stay out of A-Fib. Also  I gained a bunch of weight very fast - after the second vaccine. I had been on a bunch of steroids from January hospitalization when I had COVID pneumonia. I waited until March to have the COVID vaccine - on the 10th (the first one). I got the second one on the 9th of April. I had tiredness and flu like symptoms - body aches and slight fever (99.1) the first day after the 2nd vaccine and all the other symptoms went on another day. I felt good enough to try to play 9 holes of golf on the Saturday after - although I was pretty wiped out after. So I was fine - until lately when I had shortness of breath after the ablation. The weight gain had been coming on - I was  pretty active until that Ablation of time - I go to the gym and was getting rehab for my shoulder. But now with  having the Ablation and then after having shortness of breath after the Ablation, I haven&#39;t been able to do that. I just tried to start a little walking again yesterday for the first time. I think the shortness of breath is getting better - it&#39;s better today than it was last week.  Note: I got a Pneumonia vaccine at doctor&#39;s office in February; I got a 1st Shingles shot after I had both COVID vaccines - in the latter part of May probably; I haven&#39;t had the second shingles shot yet - should probably get that next month.

                                                Woke up with extreme pain in my lower back; lesser pain in various joints. I could barely walk.   I have had back pain before, this was different. At first I assumed it was coincidence, but later after my wife had me check the &#39;side-effects&#39; of moderna shots, decided it was more likely the shot (I had no problem except shoulder pain with the first shot).   This lasted for several days - fortunately I had the weekend, and then hobbling around at work all I had to do was say that I&#39;d had the second Covid shot and everybody gave me enough flex to do my job slowly and gingerly. It was Thursday or Friday before I was able to get around with a semblance of normalcy, and nearly as many days before I was back to normal.  I&#39;ve had back problems before, including debilitating like this - but this was different - just pain.  I went to the chiropracter twice - he immediately recognized that I was walking bent over sideways, and that it was muscle rather than actual vertebra, as I&#39;ve had in the past. The first visit made things feel better for a few minutes, but I was still walking bent sideways. The second visit was during the time I was getting better, and definiately helped more.  Note, I don&#39;t know if this is cause (shot 2) &amp; effect (joint &amp; muscle pain). I doubt it was just correlation, but I&#39;ll grant the possibility. More likely, my opinion is that the shot caused something, which made things worse than they would&#39;ve been. Just over a month, hence not required, but included in case the time between shots is significant - doubt it, but included anyway.

States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

Diarrhea is not a common health event for me.  It is not listed as one of the common side effects so I thought I should report it.  I have not been been feeling ill.  Event came on very sudden.  I had eating lunch between vaccination and diarrhea.  Only side effect from first shot was a sore shoulder for two days.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

On the same day around 7:30 p.m. head started to burn and the rest of my body shiver. Whole body skin became super sensitive - it hurt to move sharply. I took Tylenol 1300mg and Advil LiquiGel 400mg. Temperature was up &amp; down (97 to 100.7) for 2 days. Friday 1/15 temperature became normal, but my body started to feel severe muscle twisting aches and that continue for 4 days straight. I&#39;ve continue to take Tylenol and Advil every 4-6 hours. After muscle aches subsided on Tuesday 1/19, all joints started to hurt (two days of nagging &amp; strong pain, most-knees &amp; hands). Suddenly I started to cough for no apparent reason.

The jittery feeling subsided in about an hour. The chills remained and I got flushed and felt like i had a temperature. My joints in my hands felt very sore and during the night my body muscles felt wore out. My left shoulder at the site of the shot was throbbing  bad. For some reason I had to urinate every hour for the next five hours of the night without ingesting any more fluids. By 7:00 AM I got to feeling progressively better and by 9:30 AM I felt like I had just had a very poor nights sleep. No more chills, fever, being flushed and the pain in my arm subsided substantially.

Did not do anything physical on that day and have only done daily walks since.

                                                Shot administered on 2/15/21 Monday @ 5:30 PM.  On 2/23/21 @ 5:30 AM Tuesday, I woke up with an itching at the area of the injection  site.  The site where the injection was given had bruised and is now fading and is a yellowish color.  Directly below the injection site and its bruised area is a hot feeling, itchy red rash.  Through the course of the day, the red rash has increased in size, approximately 3.5 inch in diameter.  The same day around 5:30 PM I begin to feel a pain/ache in right shoulder and up into my neck on the right side.  The pain level gains and the level of pain reaches 5 in about two hours.  The aching seems deep beneath the shoulder bone and into the spine of the neck.  The rash and pain remain to present, 2/28/2021 Sunday.  The rash maintained the same side and began to slowly disappear yesterday, 2/27/2021 Sunday late evening.  The pain was at it&#39;s worst with arm and shoulder movement but was worse, even without movement of the arm and shoulder between 2/26/2021 Friday and 2/27/2021 Saturday, even when in bed, interrupting my sleep.  On 2/27/2021 Saturday evening the red rash had noticeable fading and the pain level began to decrease.   Today 2/28/2021 the red rash is almost goin and the neck and shoulder pain is no worse than level 1.

                                                Extreme pain in the left shoulder and arm at the injection site. Unable to lift arm past height of shoulder or head without further pain. Pushing with the left hand on an object creates pain in the arm and shoulder. Resting on the elbow will also create the same pain. The pain is constant. At night I usually wake up between 1 and 3 am from the throbbing pain. According to the physician, the pain seems to mimic a rotator cuff injury, which I do not have, nor have I had. I have been taking Motrin 2 to 3x per day, and Extra Strength Tylenol during those 1 to 3 am morning wake-ups. Putting the left arm thru a shirt is a painful task. Outside of arm at injection to the touch creates pain.

By 9:50 AM my temperature had risen to 101.4 and remained above 100 until 6:00 PM.  I experienced body aches, joint aches, and moderate exhaustion.  Walking 30 feet was very tiring and I needed to return to bed.  I took two Acetaminophen at 5:00 PM.  That was the only medication that I took.  By 10:15 PM my temperature was back to normal.  During the day my oxygenation levels were about 93% where my normal level is 97&#43;.  Breathing exercises improved my oxygenation to 95%.  It should be noted that I had COVID 19 in April, 2020.  I never had a positive PCR test but since May, 2020 I have tested positive for COVID 19 antibodies on at least 6 occasions.  Several of these tests were associated with blood donations and others were simply antibody tests done separately.  My most recent antibody positive test was in late January associated with a blood donation.

On Friday 02/26/2021 I had pain in my right ankle and foot and thought it was possibly just another bruise. Saturday evening 02/26/2021 I realised it was a blood vessel popping out. On Tuesday 03/02/2021 I had an ultrasound and it was diagnosed as a &#34;superficial thrombosis&#34;. It goes from the inside of my right foot to the top of the foot. Then it can be seen on the inside of my ankle, skip a spot, and is again visible on the inside of my calf. It ends mid-calf on my right leg.

                                                Lower legs felt tired and sore., muscle pain. Progressively got worse over the month of February making it nearly impossible to bend, raise and lower myself. Saw my personal doctor on March 1st. He does not think it is vaccine related. Rans some bloodwork tests. Put me on Prednisone for 3 weeks. That did alleviate the muscle soreness/stiffness  but that seems to be starting to return now that I am no longer taking it. Have a Dr. appointment with a Rhuematologist on Friday 3/26/2021.

                                                On 3/22/2021, 7 days after I received the second shot, after supper at ~6:00 PM, I felt pain from right feet below the ankle. The pain got worse by 8:00 pm. I though I might somehow got it hurt somewhere.  I massage the pain area and place the foot and lower leg in a bucket   filled with warm water. Those did not help. I went to bed at ~8:30 pm and felt the whole right leg  very uncomfortable. The dull pain came from the foot and extended to the whole leg,  I felt the foot and leg were swelling but they were not. By 12:00 am the pain became less and totally gone by 7:00 am, I urinated four times over night and had severe sweating in the second half of the night.   I  feel alright the next day, just some kind joint/musel  uncomfortable.

                                                By 9:00 pm the evening of my vaccine I was having chills and a fever of 100 degrees. Not that high I know but for me it is and gave me a very bad headache and body aches.  I did not feel good enough to try to sleep until about 1:00 am after using a heating pad and hot tea to try and chase the chills away and Ibuprofen for the aches.  My shoulder was so sore from the shot that I could not lay on my left side.  The following day I was about 50% better. No more chills but still slight fever and no appetite.  Didn&#39;t feel good enough to do anything except take a nap.  The following day I was pretty much back to normal.

Right leg buckles and gives out.  Unable to travel, or see my doctor.  The onset of my issues were very sudden and immediate, no lead-up.  In a sitting or lying down position, I am able to freely articulate and rotate my right leg without pain.  In the nine days since the onset, I have treated myself with Aleive and a heating pad for my neck.  The issues have lessened by less than 25%.        Background:  due to spinal cord injury in 1996, I have permanent damage; sensory issues on my right side [mid chest to foot], and motor issues on my left side.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

On 3/27/21, he got a fever that ranged between 99.7 to 102.6.  He could not eat and thinking about it made his stomach upset.  Every bone and joint in his body ached, even his skin hurt and he had a bad headache.  Tylenol did little to alleviate any of these symptoms.  His fever  broke on 3/27/21 about 11 pm.  He still did not sleep well and slept until noon on 3/28/21.  His symptoms persisted except for the fever, though he still had chills that night.  He still did not feel well throughout 3/29/21 and 3/30/21 and he still ate very, very little until 3/31/21.  On 3/31/21, he was able to eat and went to the grocery, but it wiped him out and he slept for a couple of hours in the afternoon.  He still has a dull headache and very little energy that is keeping him from doing his daily activities.

                                                About 14 hours after receiving my second shot of the vaccine, I awoke being very cold and began to shiver and shake almost violently after getting out of bed to urinate.  Also my back, hips and knee joint were aching when I moved about any at all.  I was able to fall back to sleep and in the few time I awoke during the rest of the night, I didn&#39;t experience the shaking, however, with the aching and feeling cold, it was reminiscent of times when I had a fever.  Unfortunately, I do not have a working thermometer, so I could not check this, but I suspect I did have a fever.  I was also experiencing a sort of mental brain fog of confusion and lack of full consciousness (felt like I could not bring myself awake enough to do much of anything).   The following morning, I was barely able to become awake enough and clear headed enough to send an email to my boss about having to miss work.  Except to get out of bed for a short time to use the bathroom or get something to drink, I slept most of Friday until late afternoon.  Then I was slightly more coherent and was able to get more to drink and eat.  But still sleepy and went back to sleep. I awoke in a sweat (not experienced before this time) and felt a little clearer in my mind and not as achy.  Slept again later through the night, but continued to wake up in a sweat during the night.  Finally this morning when I awoke, I felt more normal again.

                                                I had almost identical problems even after the first injection which lasted 2 1/2 days that time. This time, the second dose, affects were even worse. Injection site was sore almost immediately and started to get muscle pain in back of neck,gradually started aching with headache over time. About 8hrs after injection temperature started,my normal temp is 97-97.6 it went up as high as 102.8 &amp; stayed above 99.4  for approximately 36hrs. Also had swelling of left side of face,left had noticeable swelling under it. At same time aches &amp; pain got worse including chills &amp; sweating which made sleeping impossible. Took aspirin to break fever which didn?t come down till 2 days after shot. By third day was still achy and extremely rundown. Will absolutely NOT go through this ever again:especially with the Moderna vaccine!

Arm more sore than right after shot. Went away gradually over 4 day period. Just used cortisone cream.  Second shot was sick with flu like symptoms 12 hours after shot.

Drinking water and cold compress on forehead finally helped enough to be able to go to bed at 3:30 am and sleep.  The morning after vaccination fever gone but still had headache and some muscle aches, no appetite.  The second day after vaccination I felt pretty much back to normal except for slight headache which is still present today which is the third day.

On the seventh day post vaccination, he noticed he was unable to drink well from a straw because his mouth would not close normally.  His symptoms did not improve, and on the ninth day, he noticed drooping of his face and went to the ER, where he was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.  He has improved some now and states, &#34;I&#39;m getting better every day.&#34;  He continues to receive physical therapy and reports his speech is improving, and he is now able to close his eye on the affected side.

                                                Possible COVID Vaccine Reaction  Introduction I am writing this because I think all of the issues described under the ?Current Situation? section may somehow be tied to an adverse reaction to my second COVID shot.  Until today, I had thought they were separate incidents with no common thread.  I now can see the possibility that they may be related.  I am asking for competent and engaged medical help to determine whether this is so, and if not, what the causes are for my issues.  I will give a brief medical history to give some current perspective.  Health History Current Vital Statistics ? Age: 66, Gender: Male, Height: 6?3?, Weight: 245  Hemorrhoidectomy ? In 1999 I had a hemorrhoidectomy to stop episodes of severe bleeding.  Heart Attack ? In August 2000 I had a heart attack, diagnosed as unstable angina, while on vacation.  They did further tests, found blockages and inserted stents in two arteries.  I was sent home with instructions to contact a cardiologist.  AICD ? After returning home, my new cardiologist did further tests and found evidence of ventricular tachycardia.  I was sent to a specialist who did an electrophysiology study and immediately implanted an AICD.  I have had it replace twice, with the latest one in April 2012.  It has never gone off.  There are close to five years left on my current battery.  Knee Replacement ? In January 2015 I had a total knee replacement of my right knee.  That was a result of several injuries and four surgeries, which left the knee without cartilage.  The knee replacement has worked flawlessly, and I am able to pursue athletics, especially playing tennis, without limitation.   Current Situation February 23 ? Received my first shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Other than minor soreness around the injection site, I had no other reaction.  March 29 ? Received the second shot of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm.  Again, there was minor soreness around the injection site.  April 2 ? Had major pain in my tightness in my chest and major pain starting in my left shoulder and radiating down my left arm.  It caused significant discomfort, and I was awake a large part of the night deciding whether I need to call 911 for a possible heart attack.  I decided against that and instead went to urgent care in the morning (April 3).  My EKG was normal, my blood pressure was elevated (158/96 sitting, 157/91 standing).  Doctor could find nothing to suggest heart attack.  Prescribed a course of Prednisone for the shoulder/arm pain.  Had blood work ordered, which all came back normal.  April 5 ? Played doubles tennis as usual.  Noticed some weakness in my left shoulder and arm but played through it successfully.  The pain level was very low.  April 10 ? Played doubles tennis again.  From the first ball I hit I was aware of major weakness in my shoulder and arm.  They had no power at all, and I was almost unable to get my serve over the net.  I played through it again and played very poorly.  The interesting thing was that the pain and weakness did not worsen during the play or afterwards.  The pain remained after I had finished playing.  April 11 ? Chatted with the athletic trainer while I was officiating their women?s tennis match to look for clues as to what might be wrong.  He suggested in may be a shoulder impingement.  April 15 ? Had a phone consult with my primary care doctor.  I suggested the possibility of the shoulder impingement and he was willing to start there since this was a phone visit.  He referred me to orthopedics and physical therapy and prescribed meloxicam for pain.  The pain has continued unabated during this time.  April 21 ? Pain level was very high to the point where I was unable to work.  Went home and slept most of the day.  Meloxicam was not having much impact on the pain compared to my usual regimen of both acetaminophen and ibuprofen (which I had stopped using when I was taking the meloxicam).  After this I stopped the meloxicam and went back to the other drugs as required.  I had an initial visit with the physical therapist that afternoon.  She did not find anything which would suggest a rotator cuff or labrum injury.  Range of motion was normal.  She noted weakness in my left side compared to my right, which is unusual since I am left-handed.  She gave me three exercises to do daily.  April 23 ? Pain had been back to a more tolerable level.  I had a COVID test in the morning for a treadmill test I have next week, and also got an x-ray of my shoulder as requested by my primary care doctor.  After I went to bed, I had an incident of severe incident of chills which left me freezing and short of breath even with sweats on under my bed covers.  I called my wife in to check my vitals.  My blood pressure was a bit higher than normal but not critical.  My blood oxygen was 98 and my pulse was 70.  My temperature was 99.7 with an oral thermometer.  We called the after-hours nurse hotline and spoke with a nurse.  By that time, it had been about 30 minutes of chills and they were subsiding.  She said she would have a doctor call in the next couple of hours.  The doctor called back, and after going over everything, said to come in if the symptoms reoccurred.  Thankfully they did not.  All the while I am still having the pain in my left shoulder and arm.  April 24 ? Again, slept most of the day due to being worn out from the previous night issues and lack of sleep.  No change in the pain and discomfort.

                                                Initially, joint pain and fatigue.  Blood pressure became erratic and unstable, ultimately topping out around 210/130.  Irregular heart beat issue also.  Prior to injection BP had been stable on 50 mg Losartan.  It has now been ten weeks since I got the first vaccine dose and I still have pain in shoulders, elbows, log bones in my arms and joints in my hands.  Also in my hips, knees, ankles and lower back.  This occurs primarily at night.  Blood pressure now requires 100 mg Losartan plus 5mg amlodipine to keep it down.   I have been an endurance athlete (ultra marathon kayak racing) but am still experiencing excessive fatigue after even minor exertion.  I&#39;m probably overlooking some variable in this, but can&#39;t think of what.  Timing is very suspicious.   Was hospitalized for one day when the blood pressure topped out.

Six hours after having the Moderna vaccine on 4/23/21, I started experiencing fever which rose to over 101 over the next few hours.  Also experienced chills, muscle &amp; joint pain, headaches, slight difficulty breathing and fatigue.  Took Tylenol every 6 hours after fever started but temp at one point rose to almost 103.  Took almost 48 hours for symptoms to subside after waking up the on the morning of the 25th drenched in sweat.  The symptoms I experienced were very similar to symptoms I experienced with the virus.

Started getting better a few days before the second dose, got the second dose on 2/25. After the second things everything was exscaberated, weight started dropping, started losing muscle tone, appetite, and extreme fatigue.  Cognitive thinking was gone,almost like a psychosis, was suicidal, couldn&#39;t think straight.  Went back to the Er, couldn&#39;t find anything.

                                                Pt was healthy prior.  Approx 4-6 weeks after the 2nd vaccine injection the pt was noted to have joint stiffness in the R shoulder which then progressed to knuckles, wrists, and legs with weakness at his artificial knees.  Stiffness was initially worse in the am and was without relief with NSAIDS.   Pt had trouble with ambulation and getting up and down from chairs/sitting.  He became significantly debilitated and f/u with MD ensued.  Steroid dose pack helped but after several days post completion the s/s returned.  C-RP &amp; ESR were elevated but all other RA and autoimmune markers were neg on his labs.  Repeat f/u with MD a Ketorolac Injection was given that didn&#39;t touch the s/s.  As the s/s continued the pt was then put on Celebrex 200mg bid and instructed to f/u with Rheumatology.  The pt gets relief with the Celebrex bid but if the dose is decreased to 200mg x 1 q day &gt; the pt has immediate return of s/s.  Repeat C-RP and ESR were again elevated on the second set of labs also.  We are in the process of follow up with Rheumatology who after first visit said he didn&#39;t know what was wrong with him.  We are pending additional labs and xrays this week. The pt has always been very active and healthy with no medical problems other then slight hypertension.  His body has gone into a systemic inflammatory response acutely for no reason.

                                                Received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on 01/21/2021 @ 10:30am in my left arm.  On 01/25/2021 in the evening I noticed a soreness in my left collarbone and  felt what I think is a swollen gland.  I have not pursued any additional medical assistance from my primary care physician or my healthcare specialist.

                                                Onset of fever (101.3), tachycardia (131), rigors, and myalgias that lasted about 12 hours followed by 24 hours of fatigue and increased need for sleep.  Similar reactions were shared with 6 co-workers who received the vaccination at about the same time. My concern is that if this second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination is making people ill, then it is imperative that CDC and FDA advise the public what to expect and maybe how to ameliorate.  Otherwise people who become ill will tell their friends and family.  This disclosure will make members of the public disinclined to get the shot which would be a public health nightmare.  I have used this adverse report as the forum to ensure that the FDA and CDC are aware of these reactions and will consider their consequences.  Thank you.

The day after the injection started getting flu symptoms, fairly severe, fever, coughing, runny nose, no energy at all.  Felt like he had a the worst case of flu he ever had.  He is getting better, but still has some of the symptoms.  The only thing he has taken for it is Nyquil and took a Sinutab.   Did have nausea, diarrhea, everything that comes with the flu.  Sinuses are drying up, energy is coming back and able to eat again.  He did call his doctor and he recommended that he call us and report this event.  He did have to postpone a procedure that he was scheduled for on Monday.

                                                This is a follow up report to VAERS report 259546, and is regarding the second shot of COVID vaccine.  The first shot I had a bad rash 14 days after receiving the vaccine.  This was treated with Benadryl and hydrocortisone and within two weeks, it was almost gone. Therefore, I was advised by my doctor to get the 2nd shot in the other arm.  Within 24 hours of the second shot, the same rash broke out from shoulder to elbow that happened after the first shot. In addition, at the same time, my right armpit gland became very swollen and sensitive to the touch.  Doctor advised to again use Benadryl for 48 hours and hyrdocortisone.

                                                Fever, deep chills, shakes, muscle aches over my entire body, even my hair hurts, a slight dry cough. Very extreme fatigue and I am not able to sleep well which is causing me to be really tired. This started as a pain in my arm couple of hours after vaccination and by the next morning all these symptoms  started. These symptoms are causing me to not be able to function. I have no appetite.  I have spoke to my doctor on the phone  Monday evening 02/08/2021, doctor said to drink fluids and take ibuprofen and it will probably go away.

If I had fever, I would have thought it was a severe case of flu.

                                                Received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine EUA 2nd dose @ 13:30 on 2/24/2021.  Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

The itch lasted for about 72 hours.  My armpit is still slightly sore (its been about 96 hours since it began) but it is getting better.  On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being slight -10 being extreme) the itch and sore would be about a 3.

Around eleven that evening, severe headache; nausea; muscle aches arms &amp; legs; and most serious two seizures (spasms??) about 5 seconds apart.  I?ve only had a few muscle cramps in my life so the seizures were unusual to say the least. They started in my lower abdomen (seemed like a small band going full circle around my body) and moved incrementally up towards my shoulders.  Rapid movement upward...kinda like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. Each one was only about two seconds long but fairly violent. If I had anything in stomach, it would have been on the floor.  Everything was gone (except the sore shoulder) by five in the morning.

                                                ?I recd the first moderna vaccine 2-13-2021 at 11 AM.  Headache, right side only, started same day at 7:30 PM, sore shoulder at vaccine site about 10:30 PM same day.  Both were gone the next morning.  I recd the second dose of the moderna vaccine 3-13-2021 at 11 AM.  By 2 PM I had a ranging head ache, again right side only.  I drove four hours to the vaccination site, hospital.  I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

                                                Pain in left leg that started in hip and knee.  Felt like minor muscle strain from more than normal physical activity (pain maybe 1 to 2).  Over the next two days what appeared to be muscle pain increased from minor to a more moderate muscle strain (pain maybe 2 to 3) and pain started to move to the shin - Tibia with more pronounced pain in the shin (pain 3 to 4).  Night of the third day woke up with serious pain in the shin - front of Tibia (pain 8 - constant pain, could not be relieved by massage or change of position, breathing became involuntary with heavy exhale, occasional involuntary moan when change of pressure or position).  Pain was relieved somewhat with over the counter pain med.  Pain has been 24/7 since then for almost 3 weeks.

                                                Several hours after injection  I began experiencing severe and extreme muscle and joint pain in head, neck, and left shoulder and arm.  Further into the evening and past midnight I started experiencing shortness of breath and extreme headache pain above the eyes. Extremely Sharp pain in the right arm and shoulder, felt like my arm was being aggressively yanked.  I then became panicky and decided to call a 24 Hour nurse service and describe what I was experiencing.  After spending 20 minute on the phone with the nurse she concluded that an emergency room visit was necessary but that I should contact my doctor at the beginning of the next business day.  The pain still exists.

On Monday March 8, I started to feel muscle soreness and fatigue, primarily in my shoulders and other major muscles.  The soreness and fatigue grew progressively worse during the week, and peaked on Friday and Saturday, March 11 and 12.  On Sunday the 13th I felt somewhat better, with pain and muscle soreness primarily in my shoulders and large muscles in my legs.  The pain level has remained approximately the same since.  The pain is impacting my mobility.  Prior to the shot, I exercised on a regular basis but have not been able to exercise since.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                A  week after the initial vaccination, I started getting a headache. The night of the second vaccine, had joint pain, headache and lethargy. Since the second vaccination I have daily pain in my arm and a headache at least every other day. The pain in my left arm is painful at times excruciating. The headache is also much concern to me. I have not been to a doctor guessing that they may not do anything for me.

Toes felt like each were exploding for several hours Fatigue  Ache around brain At 6:00 a. m. I took one acetaminophen 500 mg At noon on that Saturday, April 3, I took one more acetaminophen 500 mg   Remained in bed all day except small meals  Tired with some aches on Sunday, April 4. Interesting: during late Saturday and some on Sunday a random, joint ached suddenly fired then ceased: example right elbow, left ankle, single disk in spine.  About 4:00 p.m. April 4, Easter Sunday my energy was back and I felt better and resumed a couple of activities spraying pollen off my porches, off car, and off the garage floor.   Monday: awakened with slight headache, disappeared after breakfast.

                                                He started developing right shoulder pain a week after the 2nd dose of the Moderna shot in his right arm. The pain persisted for another month and spread to both shoulders, both hips, and the muscles of his arms and legs. Tylenol and flexeril did not help much. He went to the ER on 3/15/21 where he received an IV fluid bolus and had his levothyroxine dose lowered a little. Since discharge from there, he then followed up in clinic on 3/23/21 where he said his pain and weakness were bad enough that he was having difficulty lifting his arms, grabbing objects especially at/above shoulder level, and holding objects in general to perform his daily activities of living. He was placed on a 2-week tapered course of prednisone on 3/23/21 and again required another 2-week course on 4/8/21 because when the prednisone wore off he was back to having pain and weakness.

                                                I should point out that I donated a pint of blood 2 hours before getting my Moderna shot. I thought it would 27 hours before the shot but after donating the pharmacy called and said they had vaccine available if we wanted to move  up getting our shots right then 24 hours before our appointment.  8 hours later,  at 3:00am I got up to go to the bathroom. I immediately started feeling nauseous and light headed. I ended up collapsing and falling flat on my back. I immediately started shivering and shaking along with the nausea. For the next 12 hours I was extremely weak and my joints severely ached. It was very hard to move.   The total experience lasted roughly 18 hours before I started feeling significantly better.  Before donating blood I asked the if getting the Moderna Covid shot 27 hours (I thought 27 hours at that time) after donating would be a problem .  They said no. We asked the pharmacist before getting the shot if donating blood 2 hours earlier would be a problem. She thought naught and said she had no guidance against it.  I?m a very very healthy 67 year old. I rarely get sick and I have no prescriptions.  Complicating my blood donation was that my pulse was 44 beats per minute but my good health allowed them to proceed.  I?m not complaining about anyone or anything. I just thought you should be advised of my experience.

On 3/8/2021 he went to a care clinic for knee pain but had also developed severe bilateral shoulder, bilateral hand and hip girdle pain with stiffness a few days after receiving the vaccine.  At the time he was told that this pain was likely related to compensating for his knee pain.  He then presented to see me (primary care provider) in my office after having the knee repaired on 4/5/2021.  Reported he was able to bear weight and walk as usual on his knee but was not seeing any improvement in his shoulder, hand and hip girdle pain and stiffness.  Ultimately was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica, started on prednisone and referred to rheumatology.

                                                He got the vaccine, when she gave him the shot if felt like liquid fire going in, it was then fine.  Two hours later the arm started swelling up and got so swollen he could hardly move the shoulder.  Then it started moving into the shoulder quadrant, as far as your fingers can spread, all the way back onto the back itself.  It then traveled up to the neck, to the spine to the ear in that quadrant and stops at the knot behind the ear.  The pain is so bad that you press on the knot behind the ear the headache will go away.  The headache is so intense  it feels like it&#39;s going to blow off and takes migraine headache medicine which does not help it.  It now has caused vision issues, he cannot read/blurry vision with large print things close up.  He can see fine 5&#39; or further with no problems, but nothing up close and he can&#39;t drive due to this or use the computer as he can&#39;t see the keyboard to type.  The pain has continued even up until today, 4/14/21.   The shot area is fine now.   Originally when the symptoms started he could not turn his head as it hurt so bad, and has taken all this amount of time to actually turn his head some, but cannot turn it to the left much.  He can gently and slowly turn his head but it is painful.  He has gone to his doctor and went to the COVID clinic with the first vaccine who want to see him to a neurologist.

No previous episodes. Very active, healthy exercising/running life style. some relief with self administered HCTZ and leg elevation. Very unusual, not expected, no obvious explanation.  Waxed and waned. No fever, SOB. No risk factors for DVT.  Painful due to new acute stretching of skin around ankle up to mid calf. consulted ab PMD 4/11/21, suspecting side effect of amlodipine or lisinopril, however, I&#39;ve taking these meds for years.  This is very unusual. Lab. tests are ordered.  My concern is clot.

                                                Initially I had arm pain at the site of the injection.  Over time I noticed I had shoulder pain that was causing me to lose sleep.  About a month from the shot I setup up an appointment with my orthopedic group.  Before my appointment time I thought my arm was feeling better so I cancelled my appointment.  The pain seemed to come back even worse so in April I scheduled an appointment with the ortho doctor.  Ortho doc thought maybe I had a torn rotator cuff so he ordered an MRI.  The MRI came back negative for structural damage but apparently the doctor was able to determine the bursa was inflamed.  I received an injection (cortisone?) today and have a followup in two weeks.

This is my right arm, not the left arm where I received the second dose. I was having trouble sleeping at night and I was having a stabbing sensation in my ear. I had a toothache in my mouth on the right side. They gave me amoxicillin. The tooth pain went away, and my ear did to a few days later. The pain in my arm did not go away. I went to the ER and they told me I might have carpal tunnel syndrome. They gave me steroids.  I also have a tingling sensation in my fingers. My normal doctor told me I had the symptoms of a pinched nerve, but they didn&#39;t think it was a pinched nerve, but nerve damage. I went to a neurologist. I was having so much pain in my arm that I was having trouble sleeping. The neurologist said they would have to run tests.

                                                Two days after my 2nd moderna shot I started to have pain in my upper left arm , at and above the injection site. a couple of days later a large raised welt developed on my bicep. it was as large as my hand. It last a few days but did fade away. The pain persisted in my upper left arm. some time later I started to feel soreness in my shoulder and the pain lessened. The soreness persisted and then it became more like a burning in my upper bicep. I visited my primary and she prescribed alleve. In a follow up visit she examined me, on 22nd , and recommended PT. She thought it was an impignment in my shoulder. I started physical therapy on June 24th. At that session the Therapist thought it to be a nerve issue causing loss of range of motion. I would get a severe burning sensation in my upper bicep , sometimes spreading to the entire bicep. Started some light exercise making sure to keep my arm in the painfree range of motion.

The pain keeps coming and going, I did go to the ER and my BP was very high, and the pain radiates across my chest. I was in the hospital for two days.

                                                As a physician for over 40 years I tend not to pay attention to my symptoms if I develop the flu or a virus. I just put up with it  I received a COVID-19 Moderna vaccination on January 7. Approximately 12 hours after I started to develop adverse reactions. These of Inc. severe myalgias, fever to 102, chills, headache, severe fatigue (to the point where it is difficult to get out of bed)  Not much reaction at the injection site. Hydrogen saturation  in the 90s and pulse in the 70s.  I did contract Covid in March 2020. I was alone for two weeks. However no respiratory problems or hospitalization.  I?m currently speculating that having had covered in March has resulted in a significant immune reaction from this vaccine.  I would appreciate your input on this.  Can I expect this again when I receive my second vaccine in one month?  Thank you

After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

Head spinning, very weak limbs, barely able to get out of bed and stand after extreme effort, no arm strength, could only move to the bathroom via baby steps with while holding on to whatever was available to steady myself.  I ended up on the floor and was barely able to get up and back into bed after considerable effort.  My arms and legs were like rubber.  I had fever and severe night sweats.  I was virtually unable to function.  This lasted from the night of 02/03 and continued through 02/04.  Finally 02/05 I was able to get out of bed and shakily stand. But I couldn&#39;t stay up long, as I had the aches and pains and a headache still.  Finally 02/06 I was able to get out of bed and stay out.  I hope my description describes the magnitude of my symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to survive.

                                                By 2:30 I began to feel sick to my stomach.  I was asked if I want to go to the ER or go home.  I went home. 5 hours later the intra-muscular pain started in the left arm.

                                                Neck pain near the top of the neck at the base of the skull slightly to the right of the center began around Feb 1. Began taking Ibuprofin, but it did not go away.  Thought I had muscle strain, but surprisingly there was no stiffness or loss of motion. Tried massage, heat, and cold packs with limited relief. Began interfering with sleep over the next few days. On the evening of Feb 4, I noticed a strange sensation on the right side of my tongue as if I was losing taste or feeling there. At 3 AM got out o bed due to neck pain and noticed right eye felt strange and was drooping. When I got up at 8 AM I saw eye droop and smile was only on one side of mouth. Called my doctor and was directed to an advice nurse who told me to go to the ER right away, since this could be a stroke or Bell&#39;s Palsy. Went to ER and was diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy after blood tests, EKG, CT scan, and tests of limbs. Given medications and and released with prescriptions sent to CVS for prednisone and valacyclovir.

Other symptoms were sore shoulder and mild headache that appeared on the second day following the shot.  The soreness and headache were expected and if those were the only symptoms I would not have reported them.  The dizziness was unexpected and had not completely gone away at the time of my second shot on 02/09/2021.  After the second shot they dizziness has gotten slightly worse.  The soreness in the arm is WAY worse with the second shot and there is achiness in my back, shoulders and neck as well as a headache that comes and goes.  Again, The only symptom that I did not expect was the dizziness.

                                                Got the vaccine, there was no pain, the shot was fine, no reaction.  Waited for 30 minutes due to his extensive allergies.  Went home and about 2 hours later he noticed when he was moving around it started to get painful just opening a door, etc.  It continually got worse, and maybe 3 hours later in the evening the pain got really bad, and it seemed to be more in his shoulder area.  Gave the shot kind of high, and the pain was real bad in the shoulder and could not raise the arm or use it much at all.  It was also a throbbing pain where he could feel his pulse with the pain in the shoulder.  It was almost like they hit a nerve.  He is still trying to get over it on day #5.  Each day it is starting to get better.  By Sunday the pain was letting up so that he could use his arm.  He is doing stretching exercises walking up the wall and it&#39;s complicated.  He has a history of shoulder surgery and had a total replacement in the right shoulder, and wonders if his pain is related to the bad shoulder and the cartilage being bad in that shoulder.  He is supposed to have surgery on it.  But the arm is better, can lift it 75%.

Chills and general body/joint aches started approx 26-30 hrs post injection.  Fever (101.2F) peaked ~ 36 hrs after 1st injection.  Mild but obvious headache ceased after 48 hrs.  No injection site rash, just soreness of the arm (like all of my previous flu vaccinations).   Second vaccination was followed with chills and peak fever of 101.4F along same time interval.  Current 02/25/21 at 2:30 pm pacific fever has ?broke? with some sweating.  Feeling much better.  I know these symptoms are positive evidence that body is geared up building the protection system for which we are vaccinated. Self-medicated with acetaminophen (500 mg) to relieve aches. Thank you!!

                                                I have what is described as Covid arm.  After initial vaccination  arm hurt where injected for a few days  but  continued to hurt deep into  area for following week and by  two weeks have developed cellulitis and rash  with pain throughout upper arm and into shoulder.  Went to my Nurse Practitioner and was  prescribed  cephalexin   and is really not improving  on day 4 of treatment.

It was very tender to the touch and hurt to bend or grasp objects. Today is the 28th, 6 days after injection and it seems to be getting better.

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

                                                I had mild Covid  March of 3020. Fully recovered. Was expecting only a sore arm from first vaccine. Next day had fire arm which progressed to muscle ache all over, headache, chills. By Thursday night had fever of between 100-100.8.  Friday felt somewhat better but still slight fever and very tired. By Saturday morning I was back to 100%. No fever, all aches gone. These were symptoms I would have expected after second dose. I have given convalescent plasma eight times, last was in November. Still showing positive for antibodies.  Not the worst  Experience overall, just unexpected.

                                                I woke up with heavy fever symptoms, sweating, chills, weakness in legs. The unexpected event included elevated resting pulse of 120, O2 level of 92 and a heavy pounding in my chest. I could feel my pulse throughout my extremities, and was short of breath.  Symptoms subsided about an hour later. The next day I experienced anticipated fever symptoms and slept all day.

Had pain in the right lower jaw below a dental implant and pain below the hip in the right ischium (in the hip with an artificial hip replacement).  The jaw pain disappeared in 2 weeks, and the hip pain still evident after 3 weeks.  X-ray of right hip revealed no abnormalities.

Pain subsided for almost a week then returned.  Same pain, same site and more.  Spasms in adjacent muscles.  Up neck, down arm, pecs and lats near area.  Hard to sleep.  Pain will wake me up at night.  Trying to take it easy, stretch it out.  Some relief after stretching  for awhile and increase range of motion for awhile.  no treatment yet.  Have used analgesics a little with little success.  So it&#39;s been 3 weeks and a day and I&#39;m still dealing with this.

                                                I&#39;m an FP physician - reporting on behalf of my father - although my father is taking immune therapy - within approximately 36 hours after receiving the second dose of Moderna he developed the anticipated side effects of body aches, fatigue, fever, joint pain however he also developed a sand paper like rash on his tongue and erythema and pain in his mouth these symptoms were fairly severe for 3-4 days and lasted  a total of 10 days. He chose not to take medication to treat. He did lose approximately 4 lbs which he has regained.   I didn&#39;t connect the two immediately but a close friend of mine who is a nurse - her sister had also had a similar event in close relation to having received the moderna vaccine - I&#39;ve encouraged her to report as well.   I hope this information is helpful.

When I would get warm from the chills then I would get overheated. This was on Thursday. Thursday night I sweated so bad that I went through four t-shirts and 4 pillow cases. This morning (Friday) the muscle pain has gone as has the chills. I woke up congested, still getting got easily and extremely tired.

                                                Since 2 days after the first vaccine in Dec 2020 I have experienced migrating discomfort in muscles and joints. I had to take medrol dosepak on 2 separate occasions to allow me to function. The symptoms go away completely with the steroids. Otherwise I take Advil 2 tablets BID (I did TID for a while). I never had to take anything before in my life. I never had these symptoms prior to the vaccines. I took the second dose with persistent symptoms from the first vaccine.

The pain varied between a constant ache to sharp  pains and a burning sensation in my wrist.  It is difficult and painful to do simple tasks like opening bottles and doors. Pain is constant. About two weeks after the second dose the same symptoms appeared in my right hand and wrist. All symptoms still exhibit themselves in both hands and wrists.

In addition to a nagging muscle pain in my upper right arm. It also seems to have increased the arthritis pain in my right hand. The muscle pain in right arm has become chronic. I&#39;d hoped it would go away with time but it appears to be getting slowly worse.

Intense throbbing pain began around 6:00pm same day (Thursday, Jan 21) and lasted four days (into Monday).  Ibuprofen and Tylenol taken in maximum allowable doses offered mild relief but was insufficient.   Arm became unusable during that period, losing all motion.  Sleep almost impossible over that period.  Mild redness and little or no swelling as was commonly reported by others; pain was deep in shoulder joint and radiated from neck to elbow.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) for Ulcerative colitis.    The patient&#39;s past medical history included Alcohol use from 1964 to 26-Dec-1989, Cigarette smoker from 1964 to 09-Sep-2010 and Ulcerative colitis. Concurrent medical conditions included Emphysema (Severe emphysema from smoking, started in 2003 or 2004.) since 2003 and Diabetes since 2013. Concomitant products included INSULIN ASPART (NOVOLOG), DULAGLUTIDE (TRULICITY) and INSULIN DEGLUDEC (TRESIBA) for Diabetes, FLUTICASONE FUROATE, UMECLIDINIUM BROMIDE, VILANTEROL TRIFENATATE (TRELEGY) for Emphysema, FISH OIL, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C PLUS [ASCORBIC ACID]) and FOLIC ACID for Supplementation therapy.   In 2014, the patient started ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) (Subcutaneous) 40 mg twice a day. On 28-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 29-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Mar-2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (COVID-19 pneumonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), COUGH (Cough) and PYREXIA (Fever). On 10-Mar-2021, the patient experienced WEIGHT DECREASED (Lost 17 pounds in 6 six days), DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath) and PAIN (Pain localised). The patient was hospitalized for 7 days due to COVID-19 PNEUMONIA. On 16-Mar-2021, WEIGHT DECREASED (Lost 17 pounds in 6 six days) and PAIN (Pain localised) had resolved. At the time of the report, COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (COVID-19 pneumonia) was resolving, DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath) had resolved and COUGH (Cough) and PYREXIA (Fever) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 03-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) Positive for CoVid 19 vaccine. On 10-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) COVID pneumonia. In March 2021, Computerised tomogram: inconclusive (Inconclusive) No significant finding.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (COVID-19 pneumonia), WEIGHT DECREASED (Lost 17 pounds in 6 six days) and PAIN (Pain localised) to be not related. No further causality assessments were provided for DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), COUGH (Cough) and PYREXIA (Fever).    Concomitant medications also included and unspecified probiotic.  Treatment for the events included remdesivir, prednisone, paracetamol, and rivaroxaban.  This case concerns a 68-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of COVID-19 pneumonia, and nonserious unexpected cough, dyspnea, pain, weight decreased, and expected pyrexia. Latency 2 days after first mRNA-1273 dose. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-108848 (Patient Link).; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 68-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of COVID-19 pneumonia, and nonserious unexpected cough, dyspnea, pain, weight decreased, and expected pyrexia.

                                                After 4-5 hours of the 2nd dose of Moderna I start to get pain in the arms and legs, feel weir at night time like light headache, dizziness and uncomfortable in breathing that wake me up at the middle of the night. Blood pressure elevated higher than normal. After a week the arm&#39;s pain getting better,but the legs&#39; pain gets worse. Since then my legs pain and join pain getting worse and worse, its hurts with activities and no pain at rest while seat or lay down. I&#39;ve been through many doctors visits including the Urgent Care, ER, Neurology and rheumatology doctors and had many kinds of testing and found nothing wrong with my heart, lung, blood clots in the legs, Both of my legs are just progressively getting worse,both legs are getting more pain and weaker, that make me hard to lift them up for walking. I almost can&#39;t work now. I also feel so tired, dizzy and headache for 2-3 days each time that come and go since the 2nd dose of the vaccine. I&#39;ll have the MRI tests on 06/05/2021 and 06/06/2021.

It has improved, but it still feels like he has a tight muscle in the shoulder what was injected. i was the one to give his vaccine, and i know for sure that i gave it in the most central, thickest region of the medial deltoid and did not give it too high. I told him that as well, and he confirmed that i gave it in the muscle. he said a long time ago, he received a shot that was too high, and he knew i didn&#39;t give it too high.

I advised him to ice the injection site as well as to call the doctor the next day. His arm is better today, he can sit up. Headache is still the same. He said he will call the doctor.

Then it went down his arms to his elbows, just ached.  Over time it seemed to get worse and started pain medications thinking it was going to go away, but also had pain in his back.  Not his legs, just his back and shoulders.  He did inform his PCP of the reactions and she didn&#39;t know if it was related to the vaccine or not.   The symptoms have eased up, the headaches are now faint  and still has some aches and pains in his arms, and shoulder, but very little in his back.

It never got better and in fact it got worse when he got his second vaccine.  Since then he has been working with many alternative modalities to try to improve the pain but he is getting frustrated by his lack of range of motion.  He worries that the weakness could lead to injury if he were to fall and try to brace himself. Exam today reveals decrease pain to motion secondary to pain in abduction, internal rotation.  There is no obvious deformity of the shoulder joint or acromioclavicular joint.  There is no crepitus.  Strength is intact.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                I went to my doctor yesterday  because my left calf muscle had acute pain.  He did an ultrasound to verify that it was not the result of a blood clot which was negative;  so he gave me pain pills and instructions to use hot/cold compresses.  After getting out of a tub of warm water I noticed blotches of redness (rash) above my right knee which had already begun to swell.  I also noticed that my right calf muscled is beginning to be sore and a rash was developing on my arm below my elbow.

                                                After 2 days of shaking chills, sweats, fever to 103, and myalgia, I had an acute and devastating flare of trigeminal neuralgia that left me unable to speak or swallow (due to pain) and with me dripping in sweat (again, due to the unbearable pain of the feeling of a razor blade slicing the underside and left side of my tongue) for 12 hours.  I got things under control by increasing the TEGRETOL dosage and adding gabapentin.  BP 125/75 P69 T99.0.  I have controlled this disease for 20 years and I never have had an event like this. I can only assume the inflammatory component of the reaction to the vaccine activated the neuralgia.

                                                Extreme dizziness during the night, weakness and headache (took Tylenol 650 MG  for headache). Around 6 AM got out of bed to use toilet.  Wife heard a loud crash and found me in bathtub.  I don&#39;t recall falling but shower curtain fell down and have minor neck and back discomfort at this time.  Wife assisted me to crawl out of tub and she reported I &#34;passed out&#34; two more times for short durations as I crawled back into bed. Had profuse cold sweating episode for about 15 minutes.  Much less weakness now at 10 am, no dizziness but still a mild headache.

                                                Patient and wife called in to report patient experiencing 7/10 constant stomach pain, uncontrollable shaking, and numbness and tingling bilateral feet. Patient reports receiving his first covid vaccine dose 2-17-21 and experiencing symptoms, today Patient states, &#34;I can&#39;t feel the bottoms of my feet&#34; and &#34;it feels like I&#39;m going to throw up&#34;. Patient denies difficulty breathing. Patient was able to check pulse will on phone with triage nurse with pulse 93 and blood pressure 147/107. Patient requesting to have triage nurse call 911-EMS; HPI  The patient is a 69 year old male who states that he had the 1st dose of COVID vaccine yesterday morning.  The patient states that approximately 24 hours later, he developed stomach cramping.  He has nausea.  He denies any diarrhea.  He has not vomited.  Patient denies any cough or shortness of breath.  He complains of generalized weakness.  The patient also has chronic back pain.  Patient is noted to have a low-grade fever here, however, he does not report any fever. CHIEF COMPLAINT: WEAKNESS (per ems, pt got covid vaccine 24 hours ago, feeling weak and dizzy since 1500, tachycardia); Assessment/Plan DIAGNOSIS at time of disposition: 1. Hepatitis; The patient presents with a low-grade temperature, which isn&#39;t unexpected given that he received his COVID-19 vaccine yesterday.  However, the patient complains of abdominal pain.  Lab work does show elevated bilirubin, alk-phos, AST and ALT.  The patient has no previous history of this.  I did obtain both CT and ultrasound imaging of the gallbladder, which shows no pathology.  Subsequently, the patient was reassessed.  He is ambulated.  He is steady on his feet.  He does not desaturate.  He has no subjective complaints while walking.  I discussed the patient&#39;s lab abnormalities with him.  The patient prefers to go home and follow up for lab retesting on Monday.  Patient was given strict return instructions.  He will return should he develop any new or worsening symptoms.  He is going to have his labs redrawn on Monday and follow shortly with his primary care provider.  Given the normal imaging studies, I do think that these findings are likely related to a reaction to his vaccination.  This was discussed at length with the patient.  Patient is discharged home in stable condition.

                                                Friday evening, pt. was shaking so much that he could not even hold on to anything, had pain in his legs, hips, joints, knees to where he could not walk, and had a fever.  He had a hard time breathing as well so he went to the hospital.  They checked him out and ran tests but it was all in relation to the shot they thought.  Saturday he was very tired that he slept all day.  Sunday he was feeling better but had some issues with his vision and his peripheral vision went away for part of the day.

                                                Got shot Friday afternoon and reaction started Saturday night. Injection site had a blue coloration about 1/4 inch and began feeling like 1.5 inch of pencil was in my arm. I was feeling very warm and cold at the same time with a normal core temperature. Extreme pain on any movement of arm that caused to muscle to tense. Having a fan on me  really help my heat/cold sensation be normal.  Most of symptoms went away Sunday afternoon, pain in arm reduced and I felt lethargic but OK. Pain in arm had subsided a lot and just felt like injection pain. most range of movement pain free but it did hurt if I moved my left arm up across my chest. Monday morning  had no issues with anything and injection site had no pain on movement or touch. I could just tell I had the shot there and the discoloration was lighter.

It is worse at night and I sometimes have trouble sleeping because of the pain.  I keep thinking it will get better, but so far it has not.  I do not have any trouble using the arm, but there is always a dull pain in it.

                                                Approximately 10 days after the vaccination I began to develop muscle and joint pain on my left side. two days later I started to have problems breathing and the muscle pain, all on my left side, worsened. A day or two later I developed a fever of 102 and the muscle and joint pain became worse, again all on the left side of my body. To treat the fever I took Motrin, this also helped with the headache. I also had a lose of appetite as these symptoms progressed and lost about 7 pounds. I developed a cough that persisted for about 7 days. These symptoms were intense for about three days and persisted at varying intensity for about 10 days.

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

                                                gout in right big toe started in early February-- not as a result of the first vaccine on 2/17/21.  About 2000 hours on the evening of March 17, 2021, my second vaccine of Moderna in the series appears to have reacted strongly with the gout.  The joint of the right big toe became severely inflamed and swollen, and as of today, March 31, 2021, it is finally almost gone.  I stayed away from contributors to the inflammation of gout, such as shellfish and alcohol.

I also had very noticeable aching light pain from one shoulder over to the other shoulder around the back of my neck during the first 6 hours of when this started. Today (4/1/2021) I woke up feeling normal and stronger and not so fatigue. I have been taking medications for diagnosed heart failure and do not know if the interactions of these helped to bring this on. My first shot of the Moderna vaccine shot was just a sore arm where the shot was given with no other reaction and I was on the heart failure medications back then.

I had initial soreness at vaccination point, but 3/4 days later I had neck pains which I understand in reading is associated with lymph gland response - these neck pains lasted 3/4 days. Then subsequently had minor headaches, which unusual as I do not typically suffer - the headaches have now gone.  To add, I had minor aches on my first shot, nothing more and lasted only few days  I am flagging circumstances given the delayed reaction maybe of interest for your records.

Patient is not a great historian, and his story is confusing.  Patient says that after 3/13 he spoke to his orthopedic surgeon, who told him to get a Pfizer COVID vaccine next time. (Calls to the provider&#39;s office refute this story, office staff say the patient was told to not get any second doses).  Patient came to a walk-in vaccine clinic on 3/30/21 and received a Pfizer COVID vaccine (lot #ER8732), 18 days after his Moderna dose. Patient does not report any adverse effects from the second vaccine.   CDC was contacted through their NIPINFO form, and they confirmed that the patient does not need any additional doses.

Only once a week.  Last night episode occurred, Wednesday April 14.  I do not think any weeks were skipped.  The last two episodes were milder.    I also have mild headaches and mild balance issues.  I had covid the last of December.  It is possible that the headaches and balance issues are from that.

                                                Shot on 29MAR21. First lethargy began 31MAR21, followed by mild chills 01APR21. Over the weekend the symptoms waned and seemed to be subsiding. Wednesday of the following week, 07APR21 the chills became increasingly unpleasant especially at night requiring two extra blankets. Sharp pain radiating horizontally along the &#34;hip-girdle&#34; and up along the spine on the right side began that night. In the morning the top of my head was painfully sensitive to touch (like it is when I have the flu), I was slightly groggy and while the chills had subsided the hip &amp; back pain remained. I went to work thinking I might be passing a kidney stone as the symptoms were similar in location &amp; intensity as when I passed a stone in 2003. The chills became so severe I was wearing my jacket in my office and that&#39;s when I made an appointment at a local Urgent Care facility to see if they could perform an ultrasound for stones. When the scan proved negative, I had to assume I was experiencing side-effects from the vaccine. The symptoms diminished considerably by Sunday, so I returned to work Monday 12APR21 with no other issues.

                                                Shingles (Herpes zoster without complication).  Pain developed on right shoulder blade with two hours of injection.  I could not see the rash so I did not know what was wrong, and associated it with my frozen shoulder.  Took acetaminophen and naproxen for the pain; neither pain-killer alone was effective.  On 4/15  my doctor identified the rash on my shoulder and took a photo.  The pain had begun to subside on 4/13, but is still painful enough to require the painkillers.

Symptoms in leg resolved over 2 weeks with PT.  R-foot began to swell 2 weeks later with pain over and below base of R toe that progressed with heat, swelling, and redness over lower R-foot. Physician thought knee problems may be due to gout because of presentation so a prescription for a methylprednisolone was made available (6 day taper  (21, 4 mg tabs) instituted within 24 hrs of severe foot symptoms). Pain, swelling, and temp. elevation of foot began to resolve within 8 hrs or steroids.

                                                At around midnight each night for about 3 days I was awakened with full body tremors and muscle spasms that lasted about 3 hours. After that it was just full body tension and sense of nervousness.  But the real problem is that it brought back a relapse of MS symptoms that were under control for 20 years.  Weak, burning heavy legs. This has been steady for 10 days now.  This has made me trepidatious about the second dose.

Could not stand up without the aid of his arms, low back was especially tight and felt like&#34; contacted&#34;.  Sought was seeing chiropractor about back pain more in the mid back prior but went to the ED with this new pain.  Was put on Prednisone, Flexeril, Lidocaine. and Tylenol.  Continued to have pain when standing and weakness requiring a walker or cane.  No one is sure this is related to the vaccine but the symptoms worsened within about 24 hours of the second dose.  Improving now but still limited by weakness and pain.

                                                I woke up approximately Wednesday midnight with a tummy ache. I got out of bed a little woozy and proceeded to kitchen to have a bicarbonate of soda and blacked out and fell to the floor for a few seconds. I crawled to the bathroom for a bowel movement. I then went back to the kitchen for the bicarb walking at this time. Still a little woozy but okay. Went back to bed, realizing the area of the shoulder was very sore. Much more so than 1st shot. Very restless night. No treatment necessary.

I will not follow guidelines that are against my best judgment for right or wrong.   I knew better then to get the second vaccine so quickly.  There was no research that indicated this was the optimum time frame.   The only justification was what was done during the trials, which was to rush it to market and garner the highest efficacy numbers.   As seen here, the outcome was anything but mild side effects and they continue.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Pneumonia.    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (unwell), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and MYALGIA (body ache). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized for 1 day due to COVID-19. At the time of the report, COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19), MALAISE (unwell), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and MYALGIA (body ache) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 31-Mar-2021, COVID-19: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient was treated with Ibuprofen, Nyquil and Dayquil for the symptoms. Patient was discharged the next day. Patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.  Company comment: Based on the information provided including the established profile for mRNA-1273, a causal association between the event of COVID-19 and the product administration is assessed as unlikely.  Malaise is assessed as a symptom of the infection and also assessed as unlikely.  Chills, pyrexia and myalgia, although also considered as symptoms of Covid-19, are temporarily associated with the product administration and consistent with the product safety profile and thus , causality cannot be excluded.   This case was linked to MOD21-079024 (Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided including the established profile for mRNA-1273, a causal association between the event of COVID-19 and the product administration is assessed as unlikely.

The next 5 days felt like a low level cold or flu. Then, a week after receiving my 2nd dose I experienced extremely painful and sore muscle and joint ache. It hurt pretty much everywhere unless I didn&#39;t move at all. I was quite exhausted and tried to not leave my house unless neccessary.   I have no history of this symptom and, because it came on from one day to the next, i could only assume it had to be a delayed reaction. Though the intensity of the muscle and joint ache has diminished I am still experiencing  it in my upper arms. This is now 6-9-21, so, a long long time.

Patient had difficulty breathing with swelling feet and ankles that did not begin until April 12th. Patient had no history of breathing problems. Cardiovascular history is unknown at the pharmacy as we had only ever performed vaccinations on the patient. Patient was discovered in his house deceased. Exact date is unknown. The pharmacy was contacted by the patient&#39;s prescriber which requested we file this report. I apologize for the lack of precise information.

                                                Eight hours after 2nd dose of Moderna was sitting at my desk in study and felt a &#34;hot flush&#34; start at my ankles &amp; move slowly up both legs to waist. Over the next several weeks had bouts of severe pain in legs &amp; feet. Sometimes felt like sunburn, especially on top of feet.  Three months later still have bouts of pain in legs, feet, lower back, hips, but do not last as long. Has crossed my mind that the vaccine may have somehow made an existing medical condition immediately worse.  Just had an MRI and have an appointment scheduled with a Neurologist for early July.

I also feel the area of my heart, a slight sharp pain that comes and goes. I also have buckling of both my knees.  I went to see my doctor,  They did a X-ray, CT scan,  and Venous duplex- everything came back normal and did not find anything, The doctor suggested I decrease salt intake.  As of now, I am still having intermitten swollen ankles and buckling of my legs, jaw pain and heart symptoms. I am using a air compression massager to increase the blood flow to the legs.

                                                I had a headache. I felt wiped out. I was exhausted and I hadn&#39;t done anything. I think I started having a fever. Not a high one but one that got my attention. I basically slept. I took Tylenol and went to bed and stayed there for awhile. Then the symptoms went away. Went to ER on May 13th at midnight (so Friday morning). I never had thrown up as much in my life as I had that Thursday night - it was black liquid - they think it was liver bile. They put a nasal to gastric tube in me for 12 days. Admitted to hospital on 14th - They were initially removing all the liquid in the stomach which was really distended. They were pulling more than a liter every 12 hours of liquid - that&#39;s what I saw next to my bed. It was black for three or 4 days and then it turned to gastric juices which were gold colored. They operated on me on 5/16/2021 and they pulled out. (I had had an operation in 2007 for an umbilical hernia) - that scar tissue from that 2007 operation incarcerated the small intestine - 19 inches of it - so they removed those 19 inches. It took awhile for my gastric tract to reset after that.  I have severe sleep apnea - the last time I was tested I stopped breathing 68 times every hour - for 12 nights I couldn&#39;t take my CPAP mask because of the nasal/gastric tube. I didn&#39;t sleep those 12 nights. I got the point I was having delusions.

Commonly known as  SIRVA. shoulder injury related to vaccine administration I had pain within 6 hours of the injection that was severe and was unable to sleep for control of pain for a good 48 hours.  I had loss of strength of my arm on abduction and continued to have pain and weakness in my left arm nearly 6 weeks from the first injection.

                                                2/16/2021:  Telephone call to PCP/DR: I.  This is all a little strange. Especially with the fever. I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.  Went to the ER at hospital yesterday.  Dx&#39;d with carpal tunnell syndrome and gave him a wrist brace. He is taking tylenol/ibuprofen (200mg two tabs q 8 hours) as directed. Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a &#34;real rough night last night&#34;, didn&#39;t sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn&#39;t heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR. His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.  His wife says that she call his rheumatologist and they started him on prednisone 40 X 3 days, 30 X3 days, 20 X 3 days, 10 for 3 days then stop.

I try and walk 3 miles every day, but began to notice left leg discomfort and slight pain from my hip to my ankle when walking.  Do not notice this discomfort when sleeping or if my leg is propped up.  Feet are both fine and my right leg is fine, no pain.   Also notice that it is harder and slower getting out of bed in the morning and I get drowsy earlier at night than I used to.  By 9 PM I feel like I want to go to bed.

In particular it was kind of cramped up and stiff when I woke up in the morning.   Two days after my second Covid vaccine on Feb 8,   those symptoms became much worse.   My hand was very stiff in the morning and I couldn&#39;t straighten my index finger except by pulling it up with my other hand.  Prior to receiving the Covid vaccines, I had never experienced these issues before.

Lasted almost 2 whole days, better by Sunday (felt guilty for not going to church).  SIDE NOTE, when I described my side effects to my  brother he went ballistic saying that the government is lying to us, the vaccine was not suppose to contain live virus and me getting sick was proof that it did. I explained that my symptoms were a result of my immune system gearing up for a fight once it had been given the instructions as to how it should fight the battle, but no explanation would convince him otherwise (he falls for every conspiracy theory that comes along).

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

                                                I had a horrid reaction to my second covid shot. I got it on Monday 3/15 and was fine Tuesday. I even walked for an hour on he beach with the dogs so I said ?this wasn?t that bad? ON THE MORNING OF 3/17. I woke up about 3 AM with a fever OF 104 and basically an inability to stand. I tried to get ofF the bed to go pee and fell to the floor from which I could not get up as I had no muscle control or ability to lift myself uo and using a small ladder t took a long time for me to be able to manage to get on my feet with my wife  assistance.  On the way to the bathroom i banged into walls almost falling again.  told me later I looked as though I had a stroke. I made it back to bed and my temp was 104.  Then 20 minutes later the process started all over again it?s me falling to the floor and not being able to get up. This time when i was finally  and my O2 at 80  heart rate 112 was able to get up after about 7 tries I again walked into walls making it to the bathroom. This whole process happened one more time but this time i took a cool shower to cleanup and get my temp down.  Got back to bed and took a Vicodin along with two Advil.  I woke up at 10 am. No fever, able to stand and walk no problem  I sure hope this is over. but tonight will tell. form Item below is checked patient died and there was no death

The muscle aches and pin prick sensations have awakened me repeatedly for the past two nights, resulting in poor sleep. After 2 1/2 days, the fatigue and muscle aches are mostly gone, but the itching\pin prick sensations (somewhat like the sensations one gets with a case of shingles, which I had once 25&#43; years ago, or when warming extremities after being exposed to extreme cold) are still intermittently present.

On CT of neck, an aortic dissection was partially visualized. A CT of his chest was done and aortic dissection was diagnosed. He was transferred to IMC for surgery.

Also, painful red raised bumps appeared on front of leg just below left knee.  Pain made it difficult to sleep for two nights from onset.  Joint pain in hip, knee, and ankle are still persisting to the present time, with pain intensity going from moderate to more serious.  Painful red raised bumps on lower leg are still present but are not as painful to the touch.  Joint pain in the left leg improves when I walk around, but gets worse with being seated or lying down for any length of time.

                                                Patient became unconscious the evening of 4/14/21.  This event occurred five days after his second Covid vaccination. Patient had just gotten up from a living room chair and was walking over to the stairs to go to the second floor when he became rigid, lost consciousness and fell backward.  911 was called by his girlfriend.  He was unconscious for a couple of minutes.  When EMT&#39;s arrived he was conscious but very groggy.  His blood pressure was 250/157.  He knew his name and year and SSN but did not correctly answer several other questions.  He was taken to ER.  After numerous tests over the course of several days, he was diagnosed as having a stroke.    In the ER, they performed CAT scans, EKG, blood work, urine test and chest xray.  Blood pressure remained high.  Complained of headaches.  Patient was also having trouble voiding urine in the ER so a foley catheter was inserted.  He was admitted to the hospital.  After admission, an MRI, echocardiogram and EEG were performed.  The MRI showed three small blood vessels had burst in his brain.  Echocardiogram showed functions were normal.  The EEG showed some slowing but no signs of seizure.  The conclusion was a stroke.  Physical and occupational therapy examined patient.  No need for further therapy.  Blood pressure remains slightly elevated but he does not appear at this time to have lost any physical or mental functions.  Patient does NOT have a history of high blood pressure or heart issues.  Tests showed his heart was functioning properly.  Per his family doctor, his BP ran approximately 124/64 when tested during the previous 12 months.

                                                I started pain in the left rotator cuff (shoulder) like a baseball pitch injury.  I know the type of injury as I used to pitch, however, I&#39;m right-handed.  The pain increased over the next few weeks and I lost the use of the left arm to lift or raise the arm.  It was still an issue at the time of the second shot Moderna [Lot# 047B21A 10-08-2021.] on 05/06/2021.  I mentioned it to the operator at the site.  A week later I was finally able to rotate my arm around with a lot of pain, but, no strength.   Today 05/22/2021 I can now use my arm at about 25% capacity and it seems to be improving.  My daughter knows of one other person with similar results.

Areas currently involved: pan-pelvic, bilat shoulders, lower neck, L knee and R Achilles. Symptoms worse with immobility/cooling (PMR-like). Partially respond to NSAID&#39;s  on which I&#39;ve been dependent since 01APR2021 to accomplish ADL&#39;s.

Vestibular dysfunction and Auditory issues.  I suspect a Guillain-Barre type immune system  response to second injection? I verified this on CDC website. I am trying to get in to a neurologist ( 3 month wait)  My Primary   care Dr. is aware of issues. Original response was to give it time. I have started PT as of 6-8-21. I need to have a Neurologist  investigate and I believe doing an NCV test will &#34;reset&#34;{ the nerves. This worked several years ago after neck surgery issues.

                                                On 04/14/2021 patient lost his memory for about 3 - 4 hours starting at 1600.  I called paramedics who suggested that he needed to go to ER due to an abnormal EKG.  At the ER he was tested and Dr. concentrated on his memory loss, no mention about his heart report and he was sent home.  04/15/2021 I spoke with RN regarding the ECG report which I did not understand; she was concerned and suggested that patient return to the ER. The doctor called early on 04/16/2021 and demanded that patient go to the ER, he was having a heart attack and needed to get there immediately; the doctor called the ER and let them know we were on the way.  We arrived at the ER at approximately 0900 and another ECG was performed and it was noted that he was having trouble with his heart and a Cardiologist was assigned to him.  By 1600 the patient was having a pacemaker implanted into his left chest wall. The patient is now living with a pacemaker, but still suffering from dizziness, weakness, short of breath, and is now experiencing muscle or nerve pain on his feet, legs, and arms.  The 3 - 4 hours that the patient suffered memory loss on 04/14/2021 is memory he has not been able to recall up to this date; he continues suffering from short terms of memory loss where he can&#39;t recall where he placed certain objects.

Treated initially with 2000mg acetaminophen and 660mg naprosyn per day, warm compresses to neck, walking and cervical traction.  After several weeks the symptoms diminished but continued and MRI&#39;s of back and neck were done and showed some chronic degenerative changes. EMG was abnormal with signs of radiculopathy in the lumbar back and peripheral neuropathy, but similar to findings 3 years earlier.  A trial of Medrol 20mg and tapering off in 8 days showed significant improvement in the muscle cramping and fasiculations. Improvement was maintained for 7-8 days after stopping the Medrol but returning gradually over the next 7-10 days but at about 60-70% of the level prior to the Medrol.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall calling out to my wife and  slid along the wall to the floor rubbing my leg and calf. After a few minutes I regained mobility and have not had that same experience. I have hadintervals of sharp aching in the hip joint and calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to experience a numbness/tingling from the injection site to my elbow as well as along my left leg and a general weakness in my left arm. After waiting a few weeks to see if things would change,I reported it anecdotally to our Infection Control Nurse and she advised me to report to VAERS.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall as the pain moved predominately to the left calf as I leaned on the wall for support rubbing both thigh and calf and yelling to my wife.Over a few minutes, I regained mobility and have not experienced that since. I have had discomfort(sharp aching) in the left hip joint and left calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to have a numbing/tingling from the injection site down to my left elbow as well as down the left side of my leg. There&#39;s a general feeling of &#34;weakness&#34; in my upper left arm. I&#39;ve reported this to our Infection Control Nurse (who administered the vaccination) anecdotally after waiting a few weeks to see if things went away. Her advisement was to go ahead and report in to VAERS.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient let me know that he had a warm sensation  from the injection site up to the left side of his neck and tightness of the left side of his neck.  I asked if he felt like his throat was closing and he said no.  At this time, I gave the patient a diphenhydramine tablet 25 mg tablet and a bottle of water and observed him.  I took the patient&#39;s blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it was 170/75. I asked if this was a normal level for him and he said when he took it last week it was 180 over something.  I continued observing the patient and took his blood pressure again in 10 minutes. It was in the same range. The patient left approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine. He said that he was feeling better.  I called the patient to follow up at 3 pm. I asked if he was feeling better. He said, &#34;I think I&#39;m ok.&#34; I asked if he was still experiencing the symptoms from earlier and he said, &#34;No, I left those symptoms in Massillon.&#34;

                                                The next day after the second dose I experienced severe fatigue. About 48 hours after the vaccine I started with muscle aches mainly in across the back and shoulder area. Also noted there was a rash on both legs (no itching and no pain, no bleeding) within a week of vaccination. That is when I decided to see dermatologist who said it would disappear in about 2 weeks.  I am not getting any new rashes so far. As a precaution I took regular Tylenol 1-2 hours after second dose to minimize any side effects.  Injection site was red and sore (more than first dose) for about 2 days.

                                                Yesterday around 1:30PM I received my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine. All went well between the time I got the shot to the time I went to bed at about 10PM. I thought I had it made. At midnight I awoke with intense shivering. I absolutely couldn&#39;t stop. I wasn&#39;t cold as my body was hot. I had plenty of covers, but I was hot and shivering cold. Include a severe headache in this picture. This went on for a good hour and I finally settled down and dozed off again. This morning I have a mild headache and a really sore shoulder where I received the vaccine.

Experienced considerable injection arm soreness for 12 hours after injection on 2-4-21. Injection was at 10:25 a.m.,  and, remarkably, soreness disappeared by 10:00 p.m. on 2-4-21. I have been getting extra sleep, and walking at little less than my usual routine of 6,000 steps per day. Extreme fatigue not noticed for ten or eleven days, until 2-17-21.

                                                Emergency pacemaker; Pain in left shoulder; missed second dose; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer regarding her husband, a 71 year old male, who received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced missed the second dose due to hospitalization, emergency pacemaker insertion and pain in shoulder .  The patient&#39;s medical history includes high blood pressure, hereditary heart disease, Fuchs Dystrophy and heart attack last year. His concomitant medications were amlodipine 5 mg tablets daily, potassium chloride and indapamide. No information on allergies.   On 15-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of Covid-19 vaccine intramuscularly on his left arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection(Lot#012LZ0A or 017LZ0A) She is not sure about the Lot number as she couldn&#39;t read the handwriting.    On 11-FEB-2021, Patient had Emergency pacemaker insertion done at the hospital, where he stayed for two more days and discharged on 14-FEB-2021. As per his wife, this event is related to his previous heart problems which are ongoing for a long time. His 2nd dose of vaccine is scheduled on 12-FEB-2021, which he missed due to his hospitalization. Doctor said &#34;forget about the shot&#34; after seeing his results in monitor. She thinks, his doctor wouldn&#39;t talk about the 2nd dose of vaccine now, so wants to wait till his follow up appointment in March and he may get his second dose in 5-6-week limit. After being discharged from the hospital, wife reports husband is &#34;starting to feel better.&#34; Sleeps a few hours and gets up and goes lays back down. Still experiencing pain in shoulder.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine was postponing of appointment until he is fine.  The outcome of the event emergency pacemaker insertion was recovered and pain in shoulder is not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of product administration for mRNA-1273. Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273 vaccine, the events of cardiac pacemaker insertion and arthralgia are assessed as unlikely related.  The patient&#39;s medical history of high blood pressure, hereditary heart disease and heart attack are risk factors for cardiac pacemaker insertion and confounds causality.

                                                Vaccine was injected into the shoulder joint causing extreme pain.  Band aid was directly over the joint.   I was not able to move the arm for 3 days.  Couldn&#39;t sleep or get dressed.  Pain gradually subsided but 6 weeks later I still have some residual stiffness.  Reported to Publix corporate office who did not take the information.  They had me call the store directly.  Evidently there is no corporate follow-up for problems.

Symptoms stronger in the afternoon and evenings.  More severe backache on days 3 through 10.  Days 2 to 7 or 8 very tired.  Took hot baths to be warm all 9 days.   Was able to sleep.  Backache helped with heating pad.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

The next day my legs started to feel funky, but I had a strong 4 wheel rollator and I continued on to assist my wife with getting her first shot at . By the time we got to the  elevators, after walking about two blocks the legs were feeling worse. On the way out my wife noticed me walking poorly and after about one block my legs &#34;gave out&#34; completely and I collapsed.

Have to use a cane with 3 feet for stability. I was undergoing severe pain throughout this time. Pain from my lower back, left hip and left leg to left knee.  Was given physical therapy through the VA for 6 weeks and that helped loosen my leg up, but still in serious pain. After 2 months i am still in moderate pain but it is slowly lessening. VA has precsribed both Chiropractic and Massage treatments for me in the future.  I have lost 2 months of work and hit hard financially.

Nurse asked resident to smile resident could not smile. Nursed asked the resident to talk, speech came out incoherent. Assessed resident&#39;s pupils which were found to be PERRL. LUE found to have weakened grip strength with decreased ability to control. RUE flaccid, unable to respond with this extremity when asked Dr advised educating pt on what it would mean to not go to hospital following what she believed to be a symptom of a stroke. After education resident expressed that he would like to go to the hospital despite DNR/comfort care. We asked him again and eventually, he clearly said &#34;yes&#34; which was witnessed by one other nurse and 2 CNAs. The order was given by previously stated MD to send out the resident.

The symptoms would come and go daily for about 8 weeks and last for about  one to three hours each time, sometimes before mealtimes.  Would often be gone after a meal.  As of today, 5/21 I still have the stomach ache once in a while.      The morning after the first shot, I awoke with a severe stiff neck all the way around.  I&#39;ve had the stiff neck every day so far.  After 7 weeks I went to a chiropractor for 6 treatments over about 6 weeks with little relief.  As of today the stiff neck is about 60 % better.

                                                I never had arthritis in either of my hands. Now I have it in both hands. My right hand is worse than my left hand. I play 6 string guitar and Bass guitar.  This new condition makes it very difficult for me to play either of these instruments.  I feel pain in both hands but more so in my right hand.

                                                HPI: Patient is a 71 y.o male with a history of postviral herpesvirus reactivation, B12 deficiency, and recent COVID vaccination who presents with tingling sensations bilaterally in the thigh of 2.5 weeks duration. Patient received 2nd dose of COVID (Moderna) vaccine on 3/20, and afterwards reported feeling lower back pain, tingling sensations mostly in the lateral thigh down through the lower leg and dorsum of feet. As of one week ago, these symptoms have receded somewhat, and the patient now reports tingling localized to the thigh only, bilaterally, circumferentially. He describes the tingling/numbness as similar to a sunburn, and that it bothers him when walking due to friction between his skin and pant legs. Of note, the patient denies any diplopia, and notes only very minor numbness in the jaw, both of which he has experienced during episodes of his postviral reaction. Furthermore, patient did report a worsening of his tinnitus, but states that it has improved in the past 3-4 days, almost back to baseline. Patient was taking 3x 200 mg ibuprofen to little effect, and reported similar lack of relief with naproxen. Patient notes inconsistent use of B12 supplements.  Diagnosis: Immune/inflammatory response to COVID vaccine. This is the most likely etiology of the patient&#39;s symptoms given the timing of events and his history of postviral herpetic reactions. His symptoms of tingling/numbness began soon after his 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine, and due to this rapid onset and temporal association, it appears likely that his current symptoms may be related. While the symptoms described by the patient and their duration are not typical of COVID vaccine side effects, these neurological symptoms are similar to previous episodes (albeit in a different location) experienced by the patient, which responded to antivirals. As the COVID vaccine is immunogenic, and given these prior episodes of similar symptoms, the patient&#39;s current presentation is likely a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                Was working and had a minor twisting injury to spine that has occurred occasionally in the past. However, it was one week post vaccine and it seemed as if the vaccine was attacking the areas of inflamation with a vengeance and it developed into an extreme pain syndrome of the lower back and pelvis region radiating down my right leg to my knee. Pain and symptoms lasted approx. 6 weeks. The pain was so bad I had trouble walking and standing. As advised by GP, Endocrinologist, Oncologist, and Orthopedist I seeked chiropractic relief x 3 visits, physical therapy x approx 6 visits, and finally accupuncture approx 6 visits before relief. Additionally I was advised by GP to take high dose Prednisone 40-30-25-20-15-10-5x3ea

Went to ER on Hwy 290 on 03/30/21 and doctor said I had cellulitis, and prescribed an antibiotic.  After about four days it wasnt&#39;t any better and went to ER.  They did some blood work and X-Rays and said it was Osteoarthritis.  Xray showed some mild to moderate arthritis to both hands.  Until that second shot, I never had any pain in my hands or anywhere else.  I asked the doctor if he thought I had ever had cellulitis and he said &#34;no&#34;.  I still have the pain and swelling in my hands but sometimes it migrates to my knee, my foot, or my shoulder.  I am currently taking 3 advil in the morning to cope with the pain.

                                                Severe pain in both shoulders. Some days it was so bad I could not function. As of today I&#39;ve been taking between 600 and 800 mg Ibuprofen with some relief. So when it started I figured it was a side affect of the vaccine but when it didn&#39;t stop I call the hospital and they suggested the Ibuprofen. If I started a fever they wanted me to come in. No fever.

                                                When I received the vaccine I did not feel anything, 12hrs after the vaccine my arm suddenly became very sore. I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

Got up in middle of night and my legs would not support me, had to hold onto furniture in order to pull myself across room.  Morning, I get up and tend to lean forward when walking causing me to try and control my balance while walking at an excelerated speed.

Upon waking from sleep at any time during the day or evening cannot move without extreme pain.  Yesterday, 1/20/2021, I called my doctor&#39;s office and did a call.  Doctor prescribed Baclofen 10mg for lower back pain.  It has provided little relief.  I question what else can be done to alleviate the pain and, also, whether I should go for a second shot on Feb 12.  I told the Doctor it feels like a kidney infection I had in my teens but she dismissed that.

                                                I began feeling feverish about 12 hours after the vaccination.  Fever went above 101 deg, at times for about 24 hours.  I took one 650 mg Acetaminophen at 0330 the following morning to reduce the fever and continued taking this at 6 hour intervals until 1/22 (today).  Also I had a headache, sore muscles and symptoms similar to the flu during this entire period.  During the first night just before taking the Acetaminophen my pulse was up to 104 bpm.  It went down during the following day to about 84 and is now at 72 bpm (9am/Jan22); my normal pulse is usually between 58 and 64 bpm.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

Day 1, prior to vaccine administration, BP 132/80 mmHg, Pulse 56 bpm, and temp 98.2 F.  1st dose of vaccine was about 7:30 PM on day 1 (January 7, 2021.) On day 2, at 8:40 AM, approximately 12 hours post vaccination, experienced low grade fever (99F), injection site  became very sore and lasted for nearly a week, headache, and myalgias.

While trying to rest I experienced palpitations, with a heart rate of 92-95 bpm.  About 20 hours post-vaccination, fever was 101.5F.  Took acetaminophen 500 mg.  3 hours later, fever was down to 99.1F and pulse was down to 74 bpm. On day 3, at 8:15 AM, BP was 106/61, SPO2 was 96%, pulse 71 bpm, and temperature of 99.5F.

                                                Almost exactly 48 hours after the injection, I felt pain behind my left ear, extending down my neck to my jaw and up to the side and back of my head.   The pain was so severe (maybe 3 or 4 on a 10 scale) that I was unable to sleep much for two nights.   It has now been 4 days since the injection, and my jaw area aches.  The paid behind my ear has subsided somewhat and I was able to sleep some during the day today.   My wife received her second injection at the same time as mine.  She experienced pain behind both her ears on the second day but it went away after 24 hours and she now has no symptoms. If this discomfort continues for another day or two, I wonder if I should go to a medical clinic or emergency room.

On Thursday the knee didn&#39;t get any worse but my lower back and shoulders were sore. On Friday, there wasn&#39;t much change. On Saturday the knee seemed to stabilize and the back and shoulders were tolerable. On Sunday, my stomach was queasy. On Monday, sore joints and queasy stomach. On Tuesday, sore joints especially anything injured back in time, diarrhea started. On Wednesday upset stomach, just a piece of toast to eat, diarrhea, chills, sore joints everywhere, miserable. Thursday was the same as Wednesday plus I vomited twice in the evening with sweats and a 101.1 temperature which went back down. I was miserable. I slept well last night and feel better this morning. The diarrhea seems be abating. I feel like I&#39;ve turned the corner this morning but wanted to mention due to the vaccine shot as a possible cause.

My lower back and right side started hurting the same night of vaccine, this morning it was worse and I was feeling like I wasn&#39;t going to make it. I still feel weak.  It was difficult for me for me to get out of bed this morning.

Then I began having pain and soreness in my scalp. Tonight the pain has become a headache, and my right eyelid is very sore. The area of pain and soreness in my scalp has grown larger. I am feeling kind of fluish.  Because I had polymialgia rheumatic a several years ago. My wife and I are concerned that I have Giant  Cell Arteritis. I am praying that this is not the case, and these symptoms are a temporary  reaction to the vaccine. But it is worrisome, because GCA needs to be treated early to avoid the possibility of blindness.

On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

                                                Patient woke up at 2:00am, approximately 14 hours after dose #1. Patient states he got up and went to the bathroom, got out of the bathroom took 3-4 steps and his legs from his knees down went weak, and he went down in slow motion, could not hold himself up. He could not get back up onto his feet, so he crawled back to bed and got up into bed. Then around 5:00 got up and went to the bathroom again, and walking was hard, but he used a cane, the same thing happened again, and his legs went under him and he fell backwards and ended up on his back. He laid there for a bit and got legs straightened out and his arms had not a lot of strength from elbows down. He crawled back into bed again and about 8:00 am got up and had trouble walking and had to use a computer chair to steady himself. Then sat for a while. Had trouble getting his lower body dressed and about 10:00 am felt as if he had no strength and was going to fall again so he called his doctor. He talked to the nurse who told him to take some Tylenol and see how he was in a couple hours. He said he could get around with a walker but felt as if his legs would not hold him up. Patient states he has stiffness in his legs, but not weakness. By that night was using the walker ok, by the next morning he stated he was walking fine and did not need a cane or walker.

One week or seven days after the shot I noticed the lump had started growing in size and was now  the size of a small marble. Having no pain however, now after 23 days it has grown to approximately walnut size and is slightly painful or sensitive to touch. I have tried to schedule an appt. with my Primary Care Dr. and I finally just today have a phone appt. on 3/24 at 11:50 am.

                                                My husband got first dose of Moderna on 2/16/21 without any side effects.  He got the second dose on 3/16/21 and after 10-12 hours had fatigue, myalgias and nausea which resolved within 10-12 hours.  HOWEVER, one week after second dose, on 3/23/21, my husband took a shower and noticed shortly thereafter around 8 AM a itchy rash on face and neck.  NO rash over Vaccine Site.  Over the day the rash got more intensely red and noticed blotches over his upper chest (symmetrical oval patches just beneath each nipple region).  He took 2 Benadryl Tabs at night and in morning of 3/24 the rash has improved considerably..  The rash was macular and erythematous and never raised with no blistering.   His first dose of Moderna was on 2/16/21 and lot number was 011M20M.

On 2/13 experienced polyarthralgias (wrists, shoulders, knees, ankles, hips), headache, scalp tenderness, and swelling and pain of testes. These had resolved by 3/4, after receipt of ceftriaxone, azithromycin, doxycycline, and ibuprofen. But on 3/10 he developed loss of vision in his right eye and new frontal headache and was referred to Ophthalmology on 3/11 where he was diagnosed with Giant Cell arteritis (GCA) and prescribed corticosteroids. Within 1-2 days of receiving the latter, his headaches and vision loss had resolved.

This continued, especially the weakness and muscle aches and chills for 10 days.  Then I began to have diarrhea, stomach ache and of course, continuation of weakness.  Basically, I feel pretty crappy and have not gotten back to my normal self before the 2nd shot.  I have no temp, no sore throat, no cough.  It is hard to do anything although I did accompany my wife grocery shopping but sat in the car part of the time.

                                                Due to recent onset of Polymyalgia, on the day of my first Covid-19 vaccination I was taking PredniSONE.  Four weeks later for the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccination I was taking PredniSONE . I have tapered off the PredniSONE and now am taking  per day. The nurse at the  vaccination facility told me that because I was taking PredniSONE my immune system was suppressed and the vaccine would not be as effective. If you are studying this matter I may be a candidate for the study.

By the end of the day, I had some fairly extreme pain in my left thigh and knee.  I have a orthopedic implant screwed into my left femur.  The pain level was about a 8 out of 10.  It was barely tolerable and seemed to mitigate over the next 7 days.  I still today have a pain level of about 2 out of 10 that I treat with an NSAID.  My knee is still sore.  No orthopedic implant in this knee however.

Strangely my right hand was frozen open.  Was unable to make a fist or grasp a water bottle.  When I tried to close my right hand I had a weird sensation in my hand.  It felt like electricity flowing down my hand and into my 4 fingers.  Left hand was not effected.   Had the same effect when I woke up a couple times during the night.  When I got up on Saturday morning the problem with my hand was gone.  Still a bit stiff, was fatigued, headache and body aches.  Sore arm for a few days.

He sent me straight to the Emergency room.  They gave me the clot buster for my left arm. I was in there for 3 or 4 days. I was discharged. I have blood clots in my lungs. I had a follow up appointment.  I also started seeing a new doctor, a pulmonologist,  for the blood clots in my lungs. I lost a lot of weight, 32 pounds.

                                                Initial pain and inflamation in left arm.  Shoulder muscle swelled as big as baseball.  Pain migrated to right shoulder a few days later. Minimal pain in both arms for next five weeks.   6 weeks after 2nd dose was administered on the night of April 18th, I woke with both shoulders severely aching and I had inflammation and pain all over my body. It is approx.5 weeks later since the pain became severe and I am presently trying to manage it with Tylenol and have no ides how to approach getting treatment.  My shoulders have extreme pain when I use my arms.  Body feels inflamed/sore constantly and restricts my daily activities.

                                                About 3 weeks after the 2nd Moderna COVID19 vaccine, both my knees became effused and quite painful, so that it was difficult to sit and arise from a chair. Although I have mild DJD in both knees, it seldom bothered me, and less than 1 month before the vaccination, I was able to hike 3 miles up &amp; down hills without knee pain. After onset of symptoms, pain was constant, 7/10 on most days, my knees were palpably effused, and I was having trouble getting out of bed and walking to the bathroom. I suspected a vaccine reaction, and consulted Orthopedist, who injected each of my knees with steroid. Now, 2 wks later, I am back to baseline, and am able to walk 2 miles without knee pain.

On March 1, 2021, an ongoing weakness in legs was reported to Nurse Practioner. It was established that this was NOT Mysthenia Gravis. Physical Theraphy was suggested but only made it worse. Last week my leg completely lost any sense of strength to stand and I had to be helped to my seat. Numerous time I have not had the strength to move at all. At this point the condition is disabling   Physicians Comments: &#34; You had antibodies because you had Covid even after 6 months&#34;.  The vaccine did not do you any good&#34; (I cannot rule the fact that the vaccine is the cause of your leg weakness.&#34;   WE NEED GUIDANCE; NO KNOWS WHAT TO DO: Ambulatory and moderately active at the time vaccine was given; The condition is getting progressively worse. Would appreciate any guidance or help that the center can give us.

                                                On January 19, 2021 (4 days after the vaccine injection) I developed severe itching in the palms of my hands.  By the next day, January 20, 2021, I had developed severe hives bilaterally from my groin areas down to almost my knees, as well as on my buttox.  I also had severe hives in both armpits.   Both hands (palms) and wrists had become swollen and fire-engine red and the itching was maddening.  I saw a Physician who gave me an injection of Depo Medrol and a 7 day prescription of Dexamethasone, 4mg ,  take twice a day and a prescription of  Hydroxyzine HCL 25 mg, 4 times a day as needed.      The hives began to fade after 18 hours of medication and got fainter and fainter each day, along with relief from itching.   Hives were completely gone by the time I completed the 7 day cycle of Dexamethasone.   I have not had a recurrence.

                                                I received Moderna vaccine. First vaccination - 1/4/21. Second - 2/1/21. No significant reactions to either: no fever, chills, myalgias, fatigue, etc. However, about 1-2 weeks post the first vaccine, I developed mild distal finger joint stiffness and slight pain and swelling. Both hands. R&gt;L. Involving 3rd - 5th fingers. Not symetrical. No other joint pains or spine pain.  There has been slight reddish soft tissue swelling  of distal phalanges  of involved fingers. Nails look normal.  Also, few punctate red spots - sl painful; they look like punctate hemorrhages. No systemic symptoms. Not requiring medication. Findings persistant till now. No involvement of toes. No generalized body rashes. I do not have psoriasis, but these findings are reminiscent of findings one would see with Psoriatic Arthritis. I am an MD (Internist). I thought this may be interesting since it looks to me like a possible immune-mediated reaction. I do have photographs available.

Later, I noticed that the muscles on my right side over my ribs were tightened and later the intercostal spaces of my ribs started hurting very badly and it made breathing very painful and difficult and the pain stretched around my ribs and to my back. If I drew a deep breath I would experience a sharp stabbing pain. Lying down vertically was very painful and uncomfortable. I took my temperature and it was 97.5 which is a little high for me. my blood oxygen level was 99 which was good. on the 16th I woke up and the stiff neck was gone and my headache was a little better. My temp was 98.5 which is 1.1 degrees of fever for me.

Generally 4-/5 proximally on the right, 4/5 distally; left deltoid, biceps, triceps were 2-3/5, 4-/5 at the wrist and hand. Sensation is largely impaired on the right in a patchy distribution to light touch, temperature, pinprick, vibratory (impaired significantly on the right) and proprioception.

                                                Client reports symptoms of severe abdominal cramping and nausea started around  midnight following afternoon immunization with Moderna Covid vaccine.  Cramping would come and go and were severe. Client states he did what he could to put up with the pain until Monday Feb 15th. He went to local ER. Client was unable to tolerate CT contrast oral liquid (caused immediate diarrhea) so an abdominal CT scan was not completed and he was discharged. Symptoms still persist and client states he lost 16 lbs so far. He has reached out to follow up with his regular HCP- VA clinic.  He is waiting for a call from them today.

Neck pain that goes down my arm (R), extreme fatigue and achy. I&#39;ve lost 5lbs in 3d.&#39; MEDS UTD  History of Present Illness     &#34;I had that COVID shot Thursday (l arm).  Friday I started having cramps in my neck--base of my skull, R arm, into the base of my jaw.&#34;  Worse with laying down, sleeping on L side.  &#34;Hurt too much to get up&#34; (had wife help him up to bathroom).    Tried?  Bayer back and body only.  Tried some topical ben gay (made worse), vibration therapy.  Hot shower seemed to help.  Review of Systems     &#43; for chills, HA, diarrhea.  Worst yesterday.  Missed work yesterday.  Had been eating/drinking well until recently.    Assessment/Plan      1. Adverse reaction to vaccine T50.Z95A    2. Myalgia after COVID-19 vaccination M79.10     1.  Adverse vaccine response will be reported.  This seems to be fairly significant due to being 5d after.  2.  Will try Tyl 1000mg up to tid and Ibu 400 up to tid-qid for next 3 days--try to get dose of each at hs tonight.  Push fluids.  Prednisone 20mg/d x 5d.  Call report tomorrow on status.  3.  At this time, will likely avoid 2nd Moderna covid vax in this pt due to reaction.  4.  Note provided for off work yesterday through tomorrow.

                                                Severe chills, overall muscle aches and debilitating fatigue that started around 10:30 on the morning after the vaccination date. After going to bed early, I awoke still fatigued and did not sufficiently awaken until near noon. It was not until the following morning that I felt sufficiently better to return to near normal activities.

                                                Immediately upon injection localized feeling of dull pain in an area of approximately a quarter size around the injection site.  Pain has continued for 3 weeks transitioning to a sharper pain (approximately 5 on a scale 1 to 10) and distinct loss of strength when raising the arm as it approaches shoulder height.   Difficulty in holding heavier objects (a full water pitcher) steady, even with the arm bent at waist level.  Pain and loss of function persist today as I am writing this report.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

                                                4/2/2021 - 10:00a.m., felt weakness in legs, 10:30a.m. had problem climbing steep stairs, 12:00p.m. - legs felt heavy - landing heavily and flat footed going down steep stairs. 2.30p.m., walked to gang mail box in next block - shuffled and dragged legs in both directions , 3:00p.m. - felt extremely tired and lay down on sofa. Slept for about and hour. Awoke and felt I had to go to the bathroom - I could not feel or move my legs. Finally used my arms to swing legs over edge of sofa but could not feel or use them. I used the my arms to lift myself to standing position and lost control of bladder - not and accident - felt it totally empty at once. Feeling started to return to legs and I was able to walk to clean myself up. Slowly began to regain use of legs and to stop shuffling and dragging my feet. I was doing better by 6:00p.m. and the leg problem was almost gone the next day. No repeat of the bladder issue.

This lasted for 24 hours and resolved spontaneously.  I had the identical symptoms 4/2/21 the day after receiving my vaccine, also resolving within 24 hours.  I tested negative for rapid covid testing on 4/16/21.  I am reporting this because I am not able to find reports of vaccine reactions two weeks post injection when I look on line or ask colleagues, and I wonder if this has been reported.

                                                After the first vaccination, I was tired for 24 hours. However, with the second vaccination, I began experiencing more serious symptoms or reactions. Serious shortness of breath, as if unable to get sufficient oxygen. Extremely tired. Headaches behind my eyes. It is normally very unusual for me to get headaches. Dizziness and loss of balance. Weak and impaired vision. Eyes very sensitive to sunlight. Changes in ability to taste foods and sometimes foods taste very different. Pain spikes - various muscle and joint pain spikes. These symptoms have lasted for the past 8 weeks. I feel like most of the symptoms are gradually subsiding, but the time period is too short to be sure (as some symptoms come and go). I am anxiously expecting them to subside in the near future. I am sending this information to you for the purposes of records and statistics. I really do not have a choice in accepting the vaccinations because I am in my 70s. My son developed cancer; so, I had to make sure I do not expose him.

                                                I received my first shot of Moderna vaccine on February 12 and my second on March 12, 2001. I experienced very slight reactions to both injections composed of mild aching, and tingling sensation of shoulders and back and very slight soreness at the injection sight and lasting only 24 hours after the injections.  On evening of May 24, 2021, I experienced a very upset stomach followed by multiple bowel movements during the night and intense aching of the joints, fatigue, tingling sensation of my back and shoulders, chills and loss of appetite lasting through the following day and night.  I awoke on May 25, 2021 feeling better but still experiencing slight fatigue and a mild head ache.  During these days both my wife and I consumed the same foods and carried out identical schedules.  My question is: could this have been a delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine?

The next morning I tried going to bathroom, but I was weak so I fell and hit my head. I landed hard on my back which resulted in severe back pain. I was taken to the ER and stayed 10 days in there. I was then transferred to a different hospital for 10 more days. I was under home health care for 5 weeks. I went to rehab center  because I was weak from side effects of Covid vaccine. I received physical and speech therapy. 4 months later, I am still under medical care receiving physical therapy under my neurologist. My neurologist referred me to  Clinic for follow up on June 24, 2021.

The next 1/23 2021 my left leg developed the same problem but more severe.  My gait was severely affected. On 1/24 the right leg was better but  I could hardly put any weight on the left leg in the am hours. In the pm hours both legs got some better. On Monday 1/25 both legs were much better and both finally cleared up on 1/27.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

After having recieved the vaccine and after approximately 18 hours I developed pain on my left lower side close to area of kidney. It is a dull pain but persistent in occurrence. There is no prior history of this type of pain in this area. It is sensitive to the touch. ?

Several hours later I noticed that I had flu like symptons and my bones seemed to be painful.  Eventually I began having intermittent rapid heart beat.  I thought this may have been induced by tea (caffeine).  This rapid heart beat lasted until Monday (Feb. 15) I think.  As I mentioned it was intermittent.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

Monday I couldn&#39;t go in for treatment, and so Tuesday I went to the ER. I had a 100 degree fever. They did some tests. The ER doctor gave me prednisone treatments.

                                                Saturday, Marth 5th -- day after vaccination.  Upon awakening, extreme pain head-to-toe, in muscles and joints.  Severe headache (very rare for me), Hands could barely move (like severe arthritis),  Slightly elevated temperature (98.9 when my normal is 97.8).  Overall symptoms faded slightly and then returned to full strength two or three times during the day.  Unable to eat (not nauseous, just not hungry) and only drank water.  No bowel movement and very little urination during the day.  By about 18:00, headache was gone and pain was receding .  Around 21:00 started getting very cold and could not seem to get warm.  Started shaking severely from cold.  Put on sweat suit, turned on bed heater, and added blankets, then went to bed around 22:00.    Woke up Sunday morning (March 7th feeling absolutely perfect!  None of the previous day&#39;s pain was present, no temperature, no limits to hand/finger movement, and was very hungry.  Ate a normal size breakfast with no problems, urination was normal,   It was like the reaction had never happened, but my wife assured me that it had.   Other than slight constipation, I have no had any problems since.

                                                I am incensed that I was not aware the the vaccination would (could) cause the worse Rheumatoid Arthritis flare I ever had.  The morning after the injection (very painful and I am used to many injections/IVs due to the RA) I had to crawl out my bedroom.  I was unable to walk due the RA  flare.  The staff at the POD indicated this was no different that a usual flu shot. HA!  I had to get a script for Methylprednisolone to alleviate the effects.  The following day I was back to normal.  Again I feel like we (collectively) are not being truthfully being informed.  At best this vaccine is in a raw state, effective I certainly hope so.

                                                Guillain Barre syndrome; He reports that he started to experience tingling of his feet and hands about 6-7 days ago. He came to ED at that time and was given pain medication for his back pain and muscle relaxants, which has since resolved but he feels stiffness in his lower back since then. At that time he was also noted to have low potassium and sodium, reports that he was given IVF and potassium repleted. He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.

                                                He received his vaccine in the right arm and the next day it was very sore, could feed himself but that was eat.  That morning he had a temp of 99&#43; fever, and then went up to 101.4 which lasted for the 2nd day.   He had fatigue like the flu, which he just rested and slept.  He had chills 5/10, headache as well 7/10 that was with him the entire day and on the 3rd day he had minimal headache.  Had minimal muscle pain and joint pain 5/10.  Just surprised that he was affected by it, and is concerned if he&#39;s going to have the same symptoms with the 2nd vaccine.  He had COVID in October 23rd and that his symptoms were severe and he was going to have a bad time of it.  He remained severely sick for 16 hours and went to see his doctor who told him to go home and wait it out.  These symptoms were similar to but not as intense as the symptoms he had with the COVID virus.  He did not take anything for the symptoms that he had from the vaccine.  He did take some CBD oil one day and he did not take it again.  He has resolved now from the symptoms.

                                                BURSITIS  in right shoulder (NOT the injected left shoulder!), knees (particularly right knee), possibly in right hip.  Clearly a systemic reaction to the vaccine.  The bursitis in my right shoulder precipitated a cascade of adverse effects that became quite debilitating, and from which I am still recovering. The bursitis in my right knew made squatting difficult for about a week, but that symptom is substantially gone.  Here is the sequence in more detail: Vaccinated (Moderna) on Feb 4; went to play tennis on Feb 10; had discomfort raising my right arm (racquet arm)  when hitting my topspin backhand which has a high follow through ; decided to instead practice slice backhand. Developed acute pain next pain. Could not raise my arm ab ove shoulder for weeks now.

                                                About one week after the first inoculation, I had back pain similar to the pain I had 25 years ago.  At the suggestion of my doctor I saw a chiropractor.  I received acupuncture which helped some what.  About one week after the second inoculation the back pain became the same as one month previously including for the first time pain in my neck, right hip and right leg.  I do not have arthritis.  I have an appointment on March 29 to see my doctor who hopefully will provide advice on how to treat this pain.

Went to bed and around 2:00 AM his brother got a call from his dad (he lives upstairs from him in the same house) who said that something was wrong and he needed to go to the hospital.

Just really sick for five days where I could only stay bedridden. I have never had any type of sickness like this except for a severe case of pneumonia in 2014 which took nearly one year to recover. This pain and reaction to the shot was similar but fortunately  short lived. I hope this does not happen again when I go back for the booster shot on May 3rd.

Symptoms: alert and lucid; amnesia, could not remember morning activity, day, or date; trembling; unsteady to walk; crying for no reason; abrasions to hip and knee; muscle soreness developed; no serious injury. ER performed CT head w/o contrast; PO chest; ECG x 2; CBC &amp; Diff Comp Metab Pn Troponin 1 x 2. All test results were VG normal. 2 1/2 hours after the crash I returned to a normal state while getting my CT scan. Sent home after all test results cleared.

Had to touch walls, etc      I was generally very weak and had trouble walking and sitting down, and then getting up At about 7-8AM, wrote my new PCP and as I was writing, I started to get intensley hot, sweat like I had malaria (I&#39;ve never had), my heart was REALLY racing, and my skin under my t-shirt became so sensitive I felt like the t was pricking me. Very strange. Started to minimize reactions about 6-8 hours after waking up. I was unable to do my morning PT because of the weakness. I typically go to bed around 23:30, but on the 26th I went to bed at 21:00 and fell right to sleep. Next day (today) was back to 99.9999% normal. Did my morning PT (about 20 minutes plus 10 minutes on the bike). What I have is still soreness in knees. Luckily my pacemaker/defib didn&#39;t get set off by my heart incident. Feel free to call me, if you want.

                                                The day after the injection I noticed I had muscle aches and joint stiffness.  I read that this is a side affect so I thought it would go away.  It has not and if anything it has gotten worse over the past 5 weeks.  I Have to take Tylenol several times per day to be able to function.  While it does not stop the pain it does dull it somewhat.  Before the shot I was walking 2 miles per day for exercise but since that if I walk any distance my ankles hurt real bad.  I try to walk a couple of times per week but it hurts to walk any distance.  I do not know what to do.  I see my family care doctor next week and hopefully he can help me.

LITERATURE REFERENCE: Severe, Refractory Immune Thrombocytopenia Occurring After SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. Journal of Blood Medicine. 2021;12:221-224     Previously administered products included for Influenza immunization: influenza in October 2020; for Pneumococcal immunization: pneumococcal in December 2020. Past adverse reactions to the above products included No adverse event with influenza and pneumococcal. Concurrent medical conditions included Hypertension, Gout, Hyperlipidemia and Cardiomyopathy.    On 19-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Jan-2021, the patient experienced EPISTAXIS (ACUTE EPISTAXIS) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and PURPURA (DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS PURPURA) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 20-Jan-2021, the patient experienced IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Severe refractory immune thrombocytopenia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 31-Jan-2021, the patient experienced MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (extremity weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ENCEPHALOPATHY (encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), FACIAL PARESIS (facial muscle weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), BACK PAIN (back pain causing inability to ambulate) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSARTHRIA (dysarthria) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONSTIPATION (Constipation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), URINARY RETENTION (urinary retention) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and STAPHYLOCOCCAL SEPSIS (MSSA) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized for 5 days due to EPISTAXIS, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS and PURPURA. At the time of the report, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Severe refractory immune thrombocytopenia), EPISTAXIS (ACUTE EPISTAXIS), PURPURA (DIFFUSE CUTANEOUS PURPURA), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (extremity weakness) and FACIAL PARESIS (facial muscle weakness) was resolving and ENCEPHALOPATHY (encephalopathy with facial muscle weakness), BACK PAIN (back pain causing inability to ambulate), DYSARTHRIA (dysarthria), CONSTIPATION (Constipation), URINARY RETENTION (urinary retention) and STAPHYLOCOCCAL SEPSIS (MSSA) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 20-Jan-2021, Platelet count: 10 10^9/L (Inconclusive) 10. On 01-Feb-2021, Blood culture: abnormal (abnormal) blood culture grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). On 01-Feb-2021, Culture urine: abnormal (abnormal) urine culture grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). On 01-Feb-2021, Platelet count: 21 10^9/L (Inconclusive) 21. On 02-Feb-2021, Cytomegalovirus test: negative (Negative) Negative. On 02-Feb-2021, Epstein-Barr virus test: negative (Negative) Negative. On 02-Feb-2021, HIV test: negative (Negative) Negative.

On 02-Feb-2021, Parvovirus B19 test: negative (Negative) Negative. On 04-Feb-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) MRI revealed sever L1-5 stenosis with multi-level disc herniation and fluid collections within the lumbar, posterior and paraspinal musculature.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Two months prior to vaccination, the patient had a platelet count of 224 x 10^9/L.  No concomitant medications were reported.  Treatment for the events included high-dose dexamethasone (400mg/kg/day), five daily doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (400mg/kg/day), three daily platelet transfusions, and two weekly doses of rituximab (375mg/m^2/dose). Immune suppression with dexamethasone (20mg/day) was continued after hospital discharge. Post vaccination day ten, TPO-RA eltrombopag (50 mg/day) was initiated. On post-vaccination day 14, he received one pheresis unit of platelets and an additional dose of IVIg of 80 grams. On post-vaccination day 12, he received high dose methyl-prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) and (5 mcg/kg). The patient was given cefazolin for MSSA infection. On post-vaccination day 19, after the third episode of plasma exchange, his facial weakness improved. On post-vaccination day 22, his platelet count was 72*10^9/L, a second dose of romiplostim 5 mcg/kg was administered, and a corticosteroid taper was begun. He was transferred to a skilled nursing facility on post-vaccination day 25 with a platelet count of 173*10^9/L.

                                                Following the injection I developed persistent shoulder pain consistent with SIRVA (Shoulder Injury Resulting from Vaccine Administration). That pain has continued for more than two months although it is diminishing. I did have a normal reaction to the vaccine the day following the injection. I wish to know whether the possible injection of the vaccine into the bursa rather than muscle has compromised the efficacy of the vaccine.

                                                Rheumatoid arthritis; Gait disturbance; Pain; This case was received via FDA VAERS on 18-May-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 18-May-2021.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (Rheumatoid arthritis) in a 74-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 027A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Glaucoma, Cataracts, Barrett&#39;s esophagus, High cholesterol, Kidney stones (High Cholesterol, controlled by medication.) and Carpal tunnel syndrome. Concurrent medical conditions included Rheumatoid arthritis, Osteopenia, GERD and Hypertension (High Blood Pressure, controlled by medication.). Concomitant products included ATORVASTATIN, OMEPRAZOLE and LABETALOL HYDROCHLORIDE (LABETALOL [LABETALOL HYDROCHLORIDE]) for an unknown indication.    On 10-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 11-Mar-2021, the patient experienced RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (Rheumatoid arthritis) (seriousness criterion medically significant), GAIT DISTURBANCE (Gait disturbance) and PAIN (Pain). The patient was treated with METHYLPREDNISOLONE for Adverse event, at a dose of UNK dosage form. At the time of the report, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (Rheumatoid arthritis), GAIT DISTURBANCE (Gait disturbance) and PAIN (Pain) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   On 11Mar2021, the day after receiving the first vaccine, it was noted by the patient that they experienced &#34; the worst rheumatoid arthritis (RA) flare&#34; they ever had. The patient stated the morning after was &#34;very painful and that they had to crawl out of their bedroom.&#34; The patient reported being unable to walk due to the RA flare.  The following day, presumed 12Mar2021, the patient was back to normal.  For treatment, the patient received a script for methylprednisolone to alleviate the effects.  The patient additionally expressed concern that they were not made aware that this could happen after the vaccine. The patient reported being told by staff at the POD that this was &#34;no different than a usual flu shot.&#34; The patient also felt as though they were not being truthfully informed.  Based on the information provided, which includes a temporal association between the reported event and the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, which includes a temporal association between the reported event and the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.

He has a lot of pain moving around felt like he had somebody punching him in both arms.  He went to his Ortho Dr. where he was given a shot of cortisone in his right arm.  This helped for about 3 days and then the pain came back.  He went to the doctor.  He had lab work with normal results.  He went to another doctor on 5/13/21.  He prescribed steroids.  This medicine seemed to help but after finishing the medicine his pain returned. On 5/29/2021 he went to Medical ER.  He had blood work and was prescribed more steroids.  He states his blood pressure has gone from 130/78 and now is 191/78.  He says his pain is better at this time while he is still on the steroid medication but thinks the pain will return once he completes it.

I spoke to some of my friends that took the vaccine the same day i took it and in general most of the friends that previously had the virus had similiar symptions again while those that never had the virus did not have any reraction to the vaccine.

At the night progressed he had muscle weakness, lip tingling, eyelid droop, loss of bowel and bladder function, moreso bladder.  He was slow in his responses, and his wife noticed that was getting weaker and could not get up from the bathroom.  She feels it was more muscle weakness than anything.    On 1/29/21 he was bad most of the day  1/30/21 he started to come out of it little and knew what she was saying.   Now today 2/8/21 he is about 93% back to his baseline.  Nothing taken, but did speak to the doctor and he at that time told him not to take the 2nd vaccine.

                                                Vaccination at 9:00am. Some discomfort but not real pain in upper arm throughout the day, but became really tired later in the day and went to bed early. Got up to use the bathroom at about 11:30pm.  Swung my legs out of bed to the floor and went to stand up but fell forward to the carpet.  I had no strength in my legs or arms.  I laid on the floor about 10 minutes and could not roll over or sit up or get up to my knees.  My wife came around and helped me get up and back on the bed.  She then helped me down the hall to the bathroom, then back to the bedroom.  She helped me back to the bathroom one other time that night.  I stayed in bed for several hours and was very week and mostly sat all day,  I regained my strength over the next three days to where I could stand and walk, although I was very fatigued.  I am now about 9 days later and feel pretty much normal but get fatigued and my balance is not normal.

                                                The day after (3/11/21) the vaccination at 9:30 PM I experienced shakes, as though very cold.  My pulse oximeter showed low blood oxygen (between 80 and 85%) and elevated heart rate (high 70&#39;s/low 80&#39;s).  [I took multiple readings to make sure the numbers were accurate.]  By 10 PM my temperature started to increase rapidly.  Max was around 101.5 to 102F.  Sweat profusely.  By about midnight the fever &#34;broke&#34; (dropped back to normal range).  This will sound odd, but I felt like I had been shown what a severe Covid-19 infection/disease would look like if I were to become seriously ill with the disease.  Felt light-headed on Friday (3/12/21).  [I had no reaction, other than some muscle soreness, from the first dose.The same day as and after the second injection I had soreness in my entire left bicep all day.  No other reactions that day.]

                                                Significant painful recurring intermittently muscle spasm on chest wall that continued until 3/15/2021. It was so strong that I initially thought I was having a heart attack. However, other symptoms associated with such an event did not occur, that is no profuse sweating, rapdid heart beat, etc. On Monday, I visted my doctor who listened to my heart and took an EKG. The EKG was normal and she felt that the spasm was associated with the Moderna shot.  I have had no further such events

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.

On the morning of 4/29/2021, about 7:30, I woke with a fever of 102. I had no appetite, and felt general flu-like symptoms--dizziness, etc. When I took Advil, my fever lessened. At about 1 pm I ate lunch as usual, and took more Advil in the afternoon for fever. At about 5 pm, I suffered a bout of severe muscle weakness, to the extent that I could not get myself to the bathroom unassisted, and required the help of 2 people to get me out of the bathroom and back to a chair in the living room. At the same time I had dry heaves, severe sweating, and physical exhaustion. I immediately fell asleep in the chair, and slept for 2 hours. When I woke, about 7:30pm, I felt a little better. I was able to take some fluids and a little food. I was also able to stand and walk with just a little support. By 9:30 that night I could stand and walk fairly steadily by myself. I slept well, and when I woke up the morning of 4/30, at about 7 am, I felt pretty much normal. I was steady on my feet, and my fever was down. I had a little dizziness on exertion, but fairly minor, and it passed quickly.

                                                Patient had first Moderna vaccine on 3/14/2021.  The day after he started having a lot of pain in his shoulders arms and hands, this is spread to general myalgias and he is very miserable.  He is on oxycodone chronically.  His wife is with him and very concerned as he cannot seem to get comfortable. Patient&#39;s pain distribution involving his hip girdle and shoulders is consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica.  Further supporting this diagnosis are the significantly elevated ESR and CRP markers, he is also had imaging which did not show any specific arthritic findings.  Given the timing of the polymyalgia rheumatica developing following his Covid vaccine this may be an adverse effect to the vaccine.  Finally his quick response to prednisone is further evidence of polymyalgia rheumatica.  He does not have any evidence of visual loss, or severe headache to suggest temporal arteritis presents.

                                                The next morning after receiving the vaccine in January my left wrist started bothering me, I didn&#39;t think much about it because that was a side effect presented. When I received my second shot in February my left wrist started bothering me during the 15 minute wait period. The discomfort has not gone away. Around April 1st my right wrist started bothering me like my left wrist. Both wrists bother me and the discomfort is about the same. The pain is worse in the morning and during the day it is a lot less as I use my wrist. The only thing different has been the Shingles shot. I had one in December and the second one in March.

                                                Four days after the vaccine I started to get muscle cramps and joint pain. They were mainly in my knee hips and shoulders. It seemed to be worse on the right side than the left. The pain got much worse and I was given some Prednisone. The first course cleared up the problems with the joints in my legs. Three weeks after the shot, the  pain in my shoulders persisted. I could not sleep at night and the joint pain which seemed to improve toward the evening kept me up all night. My shoulder joints were locked up. in pain even twelve weeks after the shot. That lasted for three weeks. The Bursae in both my shoulders were highly inflamed and I got Cortisone shots in my shoulders. I was prescribed Lyrica by a Neurologist. My arm muscles were also hurting and my Thumb joints were painful. I tried every kind of painkiller and I was taking as much as possible but the pain was still there. I have also experienced Brain fog during this whole experience. Tylenol, Ibuprofen and Naproxen at the same time. After Steroid Injections, High Dose Famotidine and Lyrica treatment I started to recover twelve weeks after the shot and I was able to sleep and not deal with pain. I have felt better for the last three weeks and my Prednisone is being reduced as well as the amount of Lyrica. Ruled out Lupus, and RA. I did not get the second dose of the vaccine.

Three days after the 2nd vaccine dose, patient had severe fatigue and some joint aches, this got much worse one week later with severe right hand synovitis, diffuse muscle and joint aches. He tried ibuprofen on 4/7/2021. this did not help. He came to see me 4/19 with severe pains. CBC, CMP, ESR, and CK levels were normal. CRP was elevated at 123. and I put him on a 12-days prednisone taper which made him feel better. He stopped that taper on May 1 and within one week his symptoms had returned in full force, this time with fever. I saw him again 5/14 and again he had elevated CRP level and also elevated ferritin level. other rheumatologic labs were normal. he still had right hand swelling and synovitis. He is miserable.

Awoke the morning after the injection with severe bilateral knee pain to extent that I could barely walk. I started Ibuprofen 800 mg bid with some improvement over the next day or two. I subsequently regained near normal function with resolution of the right knee pain but with residual intermittent left knee pain associated with tenderness to external pressure over the medial knee. I have been using Voltaren hs with good effect. Symptoms seem to be stabilized but persistent.

He developed a painless, distal greater than proximal, subacute onset weakness of the right greater than left upper and lower extremities with bowel and bladder retention. He was treated with methylprednisolone IV q24h for 3 days and IVIG (divided over 3 days). At one month from symptom onset, he was able to walk, but continued to have urinary and fecal retention. By 60 days since symptom onset, he had near resolution of symptoms.

                                                I was showering and all of sudden felt something in my left eye looked in the mirror and it was blood shot red. I went to the doctor and they gave me eyedrops. A few days later I started getting a rash all over my body. Then eventually it started going away. Then I had a mild case of gout.
