I remained in bed until about 4pm 2/5/21 &amp; soaked in a hot bath which relieved the joint pains.  Headache, nausea &amp; weakness continued 2/6/2021 &amp; 2/7/2021 with the headaches coming if any sudden movements such as coughing or standing up too fast &amp; nausea irritated by eating anything but saltine crackers.  Today is 2/7/2021, took sick days from work 2/5, 2/6 &amp; 2/7.

Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

First severe gout flare up in 18 months, I take allopurinol and get gout in both ankles, right knee and right big toe.  At approximately 3:30 am started feeling gout starting in the left ankle and took Indomethacin. Pain started to subside around 7 am, took another Indomethacin at 9 am. by noon started feeling close to normal with some fatigue. I cannot think of any of my gout triggers in the past week that could cause the attack. Did not see possible gout flare up as a side effect until I researched the web as my knee was on fire.

Symptoms progressed and included severe fatigue and muscle aches.  Patient was taking tizanidine and oxycodone to manage muscle / body aches which had been prescribed for his chronic back pain issues.  Patient was noted to be excessively sleeping, and also had fallen twice between vaccination and hospital presentation. 4 days following vaccination he presented to the emergency department with severe lethargy and confusion.  He was admitted with presumption of overdose of medication, given activated charcoal.  A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218. PT was 10.6, INR 0.99.  ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.22, co2 45, HCO3 18.4.  Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

My injection site started to hurt later in the second day. It still hurts today-seven days out from administration.

I had a moderate case of COVID in May 2020 and had positive IgG AB in August. The symptoms started with heavy shaking chills, lasting 1 1/2 hours , fever and most concerning sustained tachycardia with heart rate of 180&#39; to 200&#39; over hours, which then destabilized into runs of Vtach and complex ventricular dysrythmia, low BP, profound weaklness, head aches and joint and muscle pains ( similar to the experienced COVID symptoms )

The right sided headache continued for days. On Saturday evening Jan 16th it became the worst headache of my life. Like a fool I didn&#39;t go to ER until Monday morning when I developed left handed weakness. I was visiting my son and presented to the Medical Center ER where I was diagnosed with an acute sub-dural brain bleed and airlifted to Specialized Hospital. Was admitted to the Neuro-Neurosurgery Unit.

Moved to Tendonitis/Arthritis wrists, hands, fingers and Left patellar knee tendon. SLOWLY improved but did not leave, despite treatment with Aleve, until 2nd vaccine 2/5/2021. Then, same symptoms worsened and included BOT patellar tendons, nd plantar tendons. Continues to present and are very painful at night, despite 2 Aleve BID daily, and  cannot make fist or extend fingers on  both hands and cannot walk on feet without pain at MTP&#39;s. Discussed with orthopedic surgeon who assured me that I was having &#34;an immune reaction in tendons to vaccine. It should get better over time&#34;. It has not at present.

But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

I didn&#39;t get hurt but it felt like I almost passed out.  I fell backwards against a wall and slid down. I did not report this to my doctor previously listed.

I called them and they had me marked down for no show but once I explained they set up another follow up appointment.

                                                After first shot in series, I developed slight headache, minor weakness, minor shoulder pain.    After second shot in series, 8 hours post-injection, I developed headache, moderate to severe joint pain throughout, fever around 100, extreme fatigue and weakness, slight difficulty breathing.  Went to bed for 19 hours and began to feel better with recovery in two days.  14 days post-injection, I developed a systemic rash throughout my body. Consulted with my PC physician. Was prescribed  Medrol Dose Pack.  This had very minor effect on rash.  Returned to physician for consult upon completion of steroid series.  I then received a steroid shot intramuscular in right hip and one week oral steroid protocol.  This achieved a more positive result, almost clearing up the rash.  I had a consult with a dermatologist on 03/02/2021 who confirmed the opinion that the rash was probably a side effect of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash has returned fully as of 3/14/2021.

                                                On the evening of February 24th after the I received the vaccine, I had severe pain on my left lower back radiating all the way to my left foot with tingling. I didn&#39;t sleep for 4 nights and I had difficulty walking. On February 28th I went to Emergency Room and I was given a Toradol shot. On Monday, March 1st I went to my primary doctor and gave Prednisone, Gabapentin and Meloxicam tablets then I was given 9 days off from work. Up to the present, I&#39;m under physical therapy  and I still have on and off pain on my left leg.

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event.    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold). On 25-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation), COVID-19 (Tested positive for COVID) and MYALGIA (Minor Aches like he was getting a cold) outcome was unknown.   She said they had been very careful, but had met with some friends and 2 of their friends also tested positive.    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.      The day after he received the vaccine he felt minor aches, like he was coming down with a cold. On that Thursday he went into a fib. She took him to the ER and it took several hours to regulate his heart rate. While making arrangement to transfer him to a new hospital they did a COVID test and it was positive. They were shocked as he had not been showing any symptoms. He spent the night in the hospital.  Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. However the event of Covid 19 and myalgia is unlikely related to vaccine. Covid 19 is  a confounding factor for the event of myalgia and base of the available information, the vaccine is not known cause of Covid 19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

                                                I had the Covid virus early in November 2020 I had a bad reaction to my 1st Covid shot and wanted to ask if I should get the second one? I was able to get an appointment for a Covid vaccination thru store/pharmacy. I had the shot about 4:00 on Friday. On Saturday about noon I started not to feel right; head ache and stomach. About 4:00 I started to get an increase in my temperature. At 5:30 I started getting uncontrollable shaking. Over a span of about 30 minutes I had 4 or 5 episodes that lasted 30 - 45 seconds. I had a temperature at one point that reached 102.3 I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen every three hours before falling asleep for the night. On Sunday morning I still had a slight temperature (99.9), but it seemed like all my body joints ached. I ended up feeling better about 4:00 on Sunday. Reply

                                                The morning after the vaccine, the symptoms started with a stiff neck and headache on the left side including soreness at the injection site. As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.   As a school teacher, I have taken the appropriate precautions and received a Covid19 test: Results negative.

I have had two orthopedists trying to help me - had a shot of steroid in that joint and that didn&#39;t help. I have severe bursitis. The injection was given in the joint and not in the muscle which is what is causing this. I  take Motrin and Tylenol for the pain. Limited use of shoulder joint because of it. I communicated with the Health Department. have not heard a word back from anyone.

                                                I woke up at 3:10 am feeling cold and chilling. I took by temperature and it was 98.4. I normally have a temperature of 97.1 - 97.7. I take it daily multiple times. My hands were cold. When I got up and started moving around I didn&#39;t have any more chills. When I got up at 6:30 am. I just didn&#39;t feel well in general. Slight feeling of sniffles, congestion.  I would get some aches that went away in a few seconds. They were at various points in my body, knee joints, muscles, and my head. They were simply a nuisance. I felt tired all day. My blood pressure was up 15-20 points on both numbers during the day. I&#39;ve told my doctor when my blood pressure is higher, I&#39;m having more aches and pains as though I&#39;m fighting a virus. I tolerated the symptoms most of the day, letting my immune system try to work it out. My symptoms seemed worse at 5:45 pm, so I took two ibuprofen. My temperature was 98.9 at that point. The highest it&#39;s been. All my symptoms got better until 1:15 am. I woke up feeling like I was chilling, but not as bad as yesterday, so I took two more ibuprofen. I feel 50% better today and haven&#39;t taken any ibuprofen. Here is the really strange part. I had these exact symptoms and similar temperature ranges twic last year. In July and October I think. I didn&#39;t get tested last year because they were minor symptoms. They were just nuisance symptoms. I took ibuprofen right away last year.  I followed the masking guidelines, social distancing, etc. So, is it just coincidence I had similar symptoms last year two times, that I had when I getting the inactive Moderna vaccine? I had no reaction to the first shot.  I just wanted to provide the information in case it is helpful. Very strange. I expect no other symptoms in a couple of days.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

                                                My oxygen levels dropped below what they had been previously as I am recovering from Covid infection  tested positive 20 October 2020.  If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

Muscle aches and pains, joint pain, lower back pain right side, headache.  Fever broke after 24 hours.  Some continued weakness for a couple days.  Then back to mostly normal.  10 days later, mild fever returned in the evening of 2/9, and 2/10, temp of 101.  These second rounds of fever went away during the day.  And temp was between 99.8 and 101.2. My question is:  Is it normal to get a mild fever 10 days after 2nd vaccine shot?

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Jan2021, the patient tested negative for COVID-19). On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, and feeling weird/funny.

No death certificate was issued at the time of the report but the reporter believes it will list cause of death as COVID complications.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided. Based on reporter&#39;s causality the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19

I&#39;m also getting a little tingling in fingertips and toes. I have had muscle tension in upper back and shoulders, generalized irritability. It is affecting my sleep. I went to the emergency room today, and I have a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled and neurology on Wednesday. ER gave me some fluids.

Nausea and slight headache during the  night at about 3:00 AM that went away in a couple of hours. Arm pain persisted the next day. The following day the pain also involved the armpit, possibly lymph glands. Lesser pain at the injection site and arm pit areas the following day and was very slight the third day after the injection. Can?t wait for my second dose and despite the side affects will happily stand in line for my next dose.

After 5PM mainly 101 fever, tired, muscle aches, headcahes, chills, hair follicles hurting ( had this when I had COVID-19 mid-March 2020); My symptoms from the 1st shot brought back memories of how the COVID-19 virus felt, except I did not have the congestion and sinus issues.  Fever broke at 3AM morning of March 13, woke up soaking wet, entire body and hair drenched as if I stepped out of the shower, did not dry off and got into bed. Felt fatigued Day 3 but feeling a lot better, able to be more active. Today is March 19, 8 days since shot #1 and my arm at the Vaccine site is still a bit sore, redness has subsided however.  Worried post shot 2 may be worse.

Currently, 8 days after the injection, my left shoulder joint remains sore and any motion to left my left arm laterally from my side is painful; like my joint is inflamed.  There is no redness or other visible external signs or discoloration.  I can not say for certain it is linked to the Modern vaccine as I&#39;ve had left shoulder issues infrequently in the past.

The itching made sleep very difficult for the next two nights.  The itching was decreased somewhat by the use of 1% hydrocortisone cream and moreso by 10 mg of Loratidine. The severity of the urticaria has decreased somewhat over the last 3 days since onset but is definitely still present.

I put a heating pad on the bed and even though the bed and pad felt warm, the chills continued for about 10 minutes. Later in the night, my daughter came and checked my temperature. It was 105, even though I didn&#39;t feel like I had any fever. I took some Ibuprofen and my daughter put a cool damp cloth on my forehead. I never felt hot. In the morning, the area in the bed where I was sleeping was completely soaked!  My temperature was normal.

Took Advil at approximately 8:00 AM. Worked all day and at approximately 7:30 PM began having chills again and a fever of 101 deg.  temp. Took Tylenol and temperature began lowering and I went to bed. Woke up again at approximately 1:30 AM 28 January 2021 with significant sweating. Took my temp and it was near normal. No further side effects/symptoms following this event.

Pt went to ER on 3/5/2021 in early am since was having problems breathing and very nauseated.  His back and legs were still hurting.  He was given something for pain and nausea.  Blood Pressure was elevated.  They did blood work and chest X-ray with normal results.  He was observed for about an hour and then discharged since nothing was found and told him he had a reaction to the vaccine.  Pt still has constant pain in left leg and has not been able to work.  Pt has an appt w/ PCP on 3/12 for FU.

                                                A volunteer (vaccinator) who was being trained by a nurse injected the vaccine very high in the shoulder - approximately  1 inch below the acromion process. Pain in the area of the injection site and shoulder began 3 hours after the injection. Pain was exacerbated by active motion of the arm, especially abduction. The pain resolved over 48- 60 hours. There were no other symptoms from the vaccination- there was  no fever, fatigue, nausea, chills, adenopathy, etc. The concern is that the injection was clearly not in the proper location and I have questions about the efficacy of the 2nd dose that was administered and the efficacy of the overall vaccination series because of this. I contacted the Health Department and reported this. They instructed me to also submit it to Vaers.

                                                ADVERSE EVENT REPORT: MODERNA VACCINE 1 of 2 Dates: Feb. 17 to March 16, 2021  1. I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).  I had the following side effects on Feb.17, 2021: chills, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), fatigue, nausea, and swollen glands.  3. Feb 18, 2021. I had no side effects. 4. Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA. The side effects have been chills, cough, shortness of breath (oxygen saturation of 95%), and thick white and sticky phlegm. Today my neck glands and tongue are swollen. My throat, and the inside of my ears hurt. My nose is runny, like if I had a cold, and I sneezing often. My chest congestion has moved from my chest to my nose sinuses. I have no nausea today. I have no fever. My injection site does not hurt.  My Rosacea became active today.  Today, I wore an N95 mask to ensure that I did get anyone in my family sick. They all wore their N95 masks. At 6:35 PM, I had a Gulf War Illness ?crash? and was bedridden until 9:06 PM. At 9PM both my malaise and nausea were back.   11. Feb 26 to Mar 2, 2021. I had no Moderna vaccine side effects.  12. Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me. Thank you.   Very respectfully,

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Cataract (cataract surgery, left eye) on 26-Mar-2021. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: SHINGRIX in 2020.    On 27-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 28-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (painful stiffness in the injection site arm), FATIGUE (felt a little tired) and ARTHRALGIA (joint pain in the injection site arm). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) had not resolved and MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (painful stiffness in the injection site arm), FATIGUE (felt a little tired) and ARTHRALGIA (joint pain in the injection site arm) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       Treatment for the ophthalmic herpes zoster include sulfamethoxazole 160mg BID and valacyclovir 500mg 2 tablets TID. Company comment: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and recent history of cataract surgery the event eye herpes zoster is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. For the other events the causality cannot be excluded.   On 05Apr2021, his eye Dr assessed the area with shingles and thought that the shingles was most likely due to the trauma to the eye from the surgery.

Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

Four hour after injection, patient exhibited extreme bilateral pain in muscles in the thigh. I would rate the pain as 9/10.  Pain lasted 5 minutes and resolved.  An hour later the pain returned this time for more than 20 minutes.  Twenty-four hours later, same muscles are exhibiting a strong burning sensation. Patient was also somewhat dehydrated at the time.

Went to bed at 8:00 due to fatigue.  Felt nauseated.   Was hurting really bad with the joint pain that lasted until about 2:30 AM.   He woke up this morning and is feeling much better.   He did not take anything for the pain.  It attacked his joints mainly his ankles and knees and was not able to move.  His knees felt hot to the touch.

Rec&#39;d shot Saturday morning, pain started Sunday evening and ended Wednesday morning.  Pain was enough that it woke me up Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights.  I treated the pain with ice and ibuprofen, but still very painful to move and to touch.  Wednesday it got better about as quickly as it started on Sunday.  I did not do any physical activity that would have triggered such sever pain.  The only thing that was different is that I received the Moderna  vaccine.  By Thursday my knee was back to normal.

                                                History      Chief Complaint Patient presents with ? Elevated Blood Pressure ? Dizziness     multiple times a day   Patient who presents to the emergency department today for evaluation of hypertension, head pain, blurry vision, and neck pain. He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm. Currently patient states he still has a little bit of a posterior headache but it is much improved. He denies any fevers, body aches, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or swelling of the lower extremities. He has no known drug allergies.       ? ED Course: I discussed physical exam finding with patient. Apparently most of his symptoms have already resolved at this time. His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient&#39;s work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

I had no idea it was in the vaccine, although a smaller amount than I had taken before. I started experiencing severe and awful anxiety and panic that night I got the vaccine. I had other minor side effects that were expected but they went away within a day. Several days later, I began experiencing pain in both my bilateral Achilles tendons and bilateral knee pain. A physical therapist examined both and said that I was swollen. I have had both of those problems under control for a very long time. I am improving somewhat  but nearly 2 weeks later I am still having some repercussions. I am now scared and don&#39;t know if I should get the second injection done because the previous adverse symptoms were awful. Thank you.

I felt that I was extremely ill for the first 45 hours.  I ate very little and I could not bathe.  I stayed in bed, leaving only to go to the restroom.  On the 3rd day, I was much improved and I would characterize my symptoms as moderate.  I was able to get up for short periods and I was also able to bathe.  On the 4th day (today) I believe that I am symptom free with the exception of continued arm soreness at the injection sight.

This subsided in appx. 30 minutes however I suffered a very poor night?s sleep. Following day, Feb 20, 2012, I felt as though I had a very mild virus with achiness in neck and shoulders primarily with lesser discomfort in back and legs. Was a mildly fatigued with mild headache as well. Did not check temp but never felt feverish.  On 2/21/2021 I felt symptom free until evening when a slight trace of achiness returned. I slept very well that night and woke symptom free, encountering  no further reactive symptoms.

I remaining in bed off and on for about 36 hours and then worked my way back to eliminate most of the symptoms.  However, after that and continuing at this time, i continue to be achy, particularly in my joints and my hands, fingers and neck, and I find that my lower jaw seems to be moved forward when I awake in the morning.  The achiness is particularly acute when waking in the morning, particularly in my fingers..  The pain is by no means debilitating, but it is noticeable.  I would rate the pain 3 or 4 when waking and 2-3 throughout the rest of the day.     I have not sought any treatment.

                                                Patient hospitalized for fever thought to be related to 2nd dose of covid vaccine. See hospital a/p from H&amp;P.  Assessment/Plan: Fever, myalgias and headache, I think this is all secondary to his recent Covid vaccine yesterday, dose 2.  I would anticipate his symptoms should resolve over the next 24 to 48 hours.  He was started on vancomycin in the emergency room given history of MRSA.  We will continue for now, though I think less likely secondary infection.  He is on Cipro for SBP prophylaxis.  He does not seem to have significant ascites.  I think bacterial peritonitis is less likely.   End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  I spoke with individual.  Plan is to dialyze him here today.   Cirrhosis -he was evaluated by the transplant center at Hospital on February 25.  His meld was 25 at that time.   History of type 2 diabetes.  His last hemoglobin A1c&#39;s have been all 5.  Can remove that from his problem list.

                                                A little over 12 hours after getting my first Moderna shot I experienced severe joint pain in my left knee that caused my entire left leg to become so painful I could not move it at all, as if I pulled an ACL. I decided to ride it out as each day went by the pain subsided more and more to where after 3 to 4 days later the pain was about 90% gone.  I still feel a little bit of soreness on the left side of my left knee cap though.  I am mostly back to where I was before the shot.  During the first few hours of the worst pain I did experience a cold sweat also.  All in  all I am feeling pretty good now however, a bit concerned about my second dose scheduled for March 23rd though, especially considering that I have neve had a negative reaction to a any type of vaccine before and I am not allergic. Great thanks to all!

                                                Injection site tightness in the arm during the day similar to what I had from the 1st shot. No other issues after the 1st shot. The 2nd shot had the tightness, but it also had 103.2 fever started in the late evening 10:00 PM the day of the shot.  The fever broke about 5hours later without any medication. No other issues the next days or the days to follow.

This has continues to get worse and at 9pm chills, fever and dry coughing began. Saturday morning the fever and chills cleared up . The fatigue has increased, but the muscle and joint pain are lessening. Dry cough continues.

                                                Exactly 4 days after receiving the vaccine I experienced intense stiffness of muscles and joints from neck to ankles.  I struggled to get up from sitting and then could barely walk until I was moving for a short while; then it was easier to walk but with the pain of the sore muscle/joint feeling.  It felt like I had been beat up, especially in my upper torso front and back.  It stayed the same until approximately 3:00 a.m.  on the second day.  i noticed the pain, stiffness, and difficulty moving was getting better.  It gradually continued to get better for the next 24 hours until completely gone.  My calf muscles were the last to return to normal.

                                                Seen at the walk-In clinic on 3/9/2021 where he presented with complaints of right leg weakness, numbness, and tingling.  He was transferred to ER for further evaluation and management.    The symptoms (numbness in his hip and thigh) began around 1400 while he was working.  He went about his day. The symptoms progressively worsened while he was ambulating around the hardware store. In the ER, his sensation of his right leg was dulled as compared to the left. The numbness extended from his hip to his toes. Felt a pressure-like sensation in his thigh and calf.  Denies pain. Felt as though his right foot is floating 2 inches off the ground when standing with both feet on the ground. Reported his right leg is 1-2 inches shorter after a femur fracture many years ago. Nothing made his symptoms better or worse.  Did have an episode of feeling generally hot and then cold the evening prior to admission. Denied any trauma.     Denied any dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, shortness of breath, cough, chest pain, palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, blood in stools, urinary habit changes, hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, myalgias, arthralgias, recent illness, or fever.   MRI showed T2 changes on the right side of the cord down of the thoracic spine concerning for her transverse myelitis.  Patient did have Covid vaccine 7 days prior to onset of symptoms, one dose mRNA vaccine.    He is on day 3 high-dose methylprednisolone thousand milligrams IV ×3 days.  He has noticed an improvement in the pressure sensation from the knee up the thigh on the right, no longer having tingling in the right lower leg or the left foot.  He is still having numbness over the anterior right thigh.  Yesterday when he went to bear weight on the right heel, he had a sharp pain with increase in weakness.  That has since settled down.  He did have a few involuntary myoclonic movements as described yesterday.  This writer reached out on 3/22/2021 for information on his Vaccine lot number. He stated &#34;At this point I am attending physical therapy, I am walking with the aid of crutches or a walker. There is improvement in the foot and lower leg regarding the numbness, but the upper thigh is still pretty much completely numb yet.&#34;

                                                Patient presented to our facility due to progressive swelling of his LLE. Patient is an avid cyclist and reports he began training again for the spring season approx. 1 mo ago.  He had L calf tightness present for a few weeks as well as slightly painful knees which he attributed to his age and mild deconditioning over the winter.  He traveled with infrequent stops on 4/2/2021 to visit family.  He continued to have discomfort and increasing ankle pain, thus presented to ER.  LE ultrasound venous dopplers performed showing extensive DVT: L femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal veins.  CT also demonstrated acute PE w/in distal R and L main pulm artery and w/in bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulm arteries involving all the lobes.  Patient had remote history of LE DVT in 2017 after  mild bumping of leg and placed on Xarelto for 6 mo. Had genetic testing completed at that time which was negative. He has had no clotting issues since. ( Received Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on 2/3/21 and 3/3/21. Reports brain fog and fatigue approx. 20 hours after vaccination followed by the above.) Patient discharged on rivaroxaban.

                                                Pt received 1st dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 01/04/2021 in L deltoid. Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

Diarrhea is not a common health event for me.  It is not listed as one of the common side effects so I thought I should report it.  I have not been been feeling ill.  Event came on very sudden.  I had eating lunch between vaccination and diarrhea.  Only side effect from first shot was a sore shoulder for two days.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                I had COVID19 Vaccines EUA on 1/12/21 &amp; 2/9/21. Most adverse effects I had after the first shot. On the same day around 7:30 p.m. head started to burn and the rest of my body shiver. Whole body skin became super sensitive - it hurt to move sharply. I took Tylenol 1300mg and Advil LiquiGel 400mg. Temperature was up &amp; down (97 to 100.7) for 2 days. Friday 1/15 temperature became normal, but my body started to feel severe muscle twisting aches and that continue for 4 days straight. I&#39;ve continue to take Tylenol and Advil every 4-6 hours. After muscle aches subsided on Tuesday 1/19, all joints started to hurt (two days of nagging &amp; strong pain, most-knees &amp; hands). Suddenly I started to cough for no apparent reason.

Next morning very severe total arm, head and joint pains, total fatigue, mild fever, no appetite. Unable to get out of bed except once to urinate which was a painful struggle.

Been over 4 weeks now since the first vaccine. Going to see my primary care doctor on Monday the 1st to discuss 2nd shot, which is the 2nd of March. Did not do anything physical on that day and have only done daily walks since.

                                                About six hours after receiving the Covid Moderna vaccine I quickly began constant tremors that was strong enough that I could not walk or stand. I did not have a thermometer but I?m certain I had a fever. This lasted throughout the night. The following morning I was bedridden, unable to eat and had flu like symptoms. This is continued for three days now. I am slowly Beginning to gain strength but I?m still bedridden.

The site where the injection was given had bruised and is now fading and is a yellowish color.  Directly below the injection site and its bruised area is a hot feeling, itchy red rash.  Through the course of the day, the red rash has increased in size, approximately 3.5 inch in diameter.  The same day around 5:30 PM I begin to feel a pain/ache in right shoulder and up into my neck on the right side.  The pain level gains and the level of pain reaches 5 in about two hours.  The aching seems deep beneath the shoulder bone and into the spine of the neck.  The rash and pain remain to present, 2/28/2021 Sunday.  The rash maintained the same side and began to slowly disappear yesterday, 2/27/2021 Sunday late evening.  The pain was at it&#39;s worst with arm and shoulder movement but was worse, even without movement of the arm and shoulder between 2/26/2021 Friday and 2/27/2021 Saturday, even when in bed, interrupting my sleep.  On 2/27/2021 Saturday evening the red rash had noticeable fading and the pain level began to decrease.   Today 2/28/2021 the red rash is almost goin and the neck and shoulder pain is no worse than level 1.

                                                Extreme pain in the left shoulder and arm at the injection site. Unable to lift arm past height of shoulder or head without further pain. Pushing with the left hand on an object creates pain in the arm and shoulder. Resting on the elbow will also create the same pain. The pain is constant. At night I usually wake up between 1 and 3 am from the throbbing pain. According to the physician, the pain seems to mimic a rotator cuff injury, which I do not have, nor have I had. I have been taking Motrin 2 to 3x per day, and Extra Strength Tylenol during those 1 to 3 am morning wake-ups. Putting the left arm thru a shirt is a painful task. Outside of arm at injection to the touch creates pain.

                                                Starting at about 4:00 AM on March 6th (day after injection), I awoke with a slight fever (99.1) and muscle and joint ache.  By 9:50 AM my temperature had risen to 101.4 and remained above 100 until 6:00 PM.  I experienced body aches, joint aches, and moderate exhaustion.  Walking 30 feet was very tiring and I needed to return to bed.  I took two Acetaminophen at 5:00 PM.  That was the only medication that I took.  By 10:15 PM my temperature was back to normal.  During the day my oxygenation levels were about 93% where my normal level is 97&#43;.  Breathing exercises improved my oxygenation to 95%.  It should be noted that I had COVID 19 in April, 2020.  I never had a positive PCR test but since May, 2020 I have tested positive for COVID 19 antibodies on at least 6 occasions.  Several of these tests were associated with blood donations and others were simply antibody tests done separately.  My most recent antibody positive test was in late January associated with a blood donation.

On Friday 02/26/2021 I had pain in my right ankle and foot and thought it was possibly just another bruise. Saturday evening 02/26/2021 I realised it was a blood vessel popping out. On Tuesday 03/02/2021 I had an ultrasound and it was diagnosed as a &#34;superficial thrombosis&#34;. It goes from the inside of my right foot to the top of the foot. Then it can be seen on the inside of my ankle, skip a spot, and is again visible on the inside of my calf. It ends mid-calf on my right leg.

                                                Lower legs felt tired and sore., muscle pain. Progressively got worse over the month of February making it nearly impossible to bend, raise and lower myself. Saw my personal doctor on March 1st. He does not think it is vaccine related. Rans some bloodwork tests. Put me on Prednisone for 3 weeks. That did alleviate the muscle soreness/stiffness  but that seems to be starting to return now that I am no longer taking it. Have a Dr. appointment with a Rhuematologist on Friday 3/26/2021.

                                                On 3/22/2021, 7 days after I received the second shot, after supper at ~6:00 PM, I felt pain from right feet below the ankle. The pain got worse by 8:00 pm. I though I might somehow got it hurt somewhere.  I massage the pain area and place the foot and lower leg in a bucket   filled with warm water. Those did not help. I went to bed at ~8:30 pm and felt the whole right leg  very uncomfortable. The dull pain came from the foot and extended to the whole leg,  I felt the foot and leg were swelling but they were not. By 12:00 am the pain became less and totally gone by 7:00 am, I urinated four times over night and had severe sweating in the second half of the night.   I  feel alright the next day, just some kind joint/musel  uncomfortable.

Not that high I know but for me it is and gave me a very bad headache and body aches.  I did not feel good enough to try to sleep until about 1:00 am after using a heating pad and hot tea to try and chase the chills away and Ibuprofen for the aches.  My shoulder was so sore from the shot that I could not lay on my left side.  The following day I was about 50% better. No more chills but still slight fever and no appetite.  Didn&#39;t feel good enough to do anything except take a nap.  The following day I was pretty much back to normal.

Right leg buckles and gives out.  Unable to travel, or see my doctor.  The onset of my issues were very sudden and immediate, no lead-up.  In a sitting or lying down position, I am able to freely articulate and rotate my right leg without pain.  In the nine days since the onset, I have treated myself with Aleive and a heating pad for my neck.  The issues have lessened by less than 25%.        Background:  due to spinal cord injury in 1996, I have permanent damage; sensory issues on my right side [mid chest to foot], and motor issues on my left side.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

Six hours after having the Moderna vaccine on 4/23/21, I started experiencing fever which rose to over 101 over the next few hours.  Also experienced chills, muscle &amp; joint pain, headaches, slight difficulty breathing and fatigue.  Took Tylenol every 6 hours after fever started but temp at one point rose to almost 103.  Took almost 48 hours for symptoms to subside after waking up the on the morning of the 25th drenched in sweat.  The symptoms I experienced were very similar to symptoms I experienced with the virus.

                                                Onset of fever (101.3), tachycardia (131), rigors, and myalgias that lasted about 12 hours followed by 24 hours of fatigue and increased need for sleep.  Similar reactions were shared with 6 co-workers who received the vaccination at about the same time. My concern is that if this second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination is making people ill, then it is imperative that CDC and FDA advise the public what to expect and maybe how to ameliorate.  Otherwise people who become ill will tell their friends and family.  This disclosure will make members of the public disinclined to get the shot which would be a public health nightmare.  I have used this adverse report as the forum to ensure that the FDA and CDC are aware of these reactions and will consider their consequences.  Thank you.

The day after the injection started getting flu symptoms, fairly severe, fever, coughing, runny nose, no energy at all.  Felt like he had a the worst case of flu he ever had.  He is getting better, but still has some of the symptoms.  The only thing he has taken for it is Nyquil and took a Sinutab.   Did have nausea, diarrhea, everything that comes with the flu.  Sinuses are drying up, energy is coming back and able to eat again.  He did call his doctor and he recommended that he call us and report this event.  He did have to postpone a procedure that he was scheduled for on Monday.

The first shot I had a bad rash 14 days after receiving the vaccine.  This was treated with Benadryl and hydrocortisone and within two weeks, it was almost gone. Therefore, I was advised by my doctor to get the 2nd shot in the other arm.  Within 24 hours of the second shot, the same rash broke out from shoulder to elbow that happened after the first shot. In addition, at the same time, my right armpit gland became very swollen and sensitive to the touch.  Doctor advised to again use Benadryl for 48 hours and hyrdocortisone.

Myalgia and headache waned over following 24 hours. Weakness and fatigue lasted till four days after vaccine.  I was in bed for three days. I took Aleve and Tylenol and stayed well hydrated. If I had fever, I would have thought it was a severe case of flu.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

                                                The day after my second dose ( February 18th) I felt sore at injection site and slight headache/neck ache and fatigue. next day (February 20th) I noticed a tightness in chest and started checking pulse and ECG on my apple watch. Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

Around eleven that evening, severe headache; nausea; muscle aches arms &amp; legs; and most serious two seizures (spasms??) about 5 seconds apart.  I?ve only had a few muscle cramps in my life so the seizures were unusual to say the least. They started in my lower abdomen (seemed like a small band going full circle around my body) and moved incrementally up towards my shoulders.  Rapid movement upward...kinda like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. Each one was only about two seconds long but fairly violent. If I had anything in stomach, it would have been on the floor.  Everything was gone (except the sore shoulder) by five in the morning.

Benadryl was used to relieve itching and ease clothing rubbing against the pustule like areas. Appear similar to an insect bite.

                                                ?I recd the first moderna vaccine 2-13-2021 at 11 AM.  Headache, right side only, started same day at 7:30 PM, sore shoulder at vaccine site about 10:30 PM same day.  Both were gone the next morning.  I recd the second dose of the moderna vaccine 3-13-2021 at 11 AM.  By 2 PM I had a ranging head ache, again right side only.  I drove four hours to the vaccination site, hospital.  I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

Over the next two days what appeared to be muscle pain increased from minor to a more moderate muscle strain (pain maybe 2 to 3) and pain started to move to the shin - Tibia with more pronounced pain in the shin (pain 3 to 4).  Night of the third day woke up with serious pain in the shin - front of Tibia (pain 8 - constant pain, could not be relieved by massage or change of position, breathing became involuntary with heavy exhale, occasional involuntary moan when change of pressure or position).  Pain was relieved somewhat with over the counter pain med.  Pain has been 24/7 since then for almost 3 weeks.

Further into the evening and past midnight I started experiencing shortness of breath and extreme headache pain above the eyes. Extremely Sharp pain in the right arm and shoulder, felt like my arm was being aggressively yanked.  I then became panicky and decided to call a 24 Hour nurse service and describe what I was experiencing.  After spending 20 minute on the phone with the nurse she concluded that an emergency room visit was necessary but that I should contact my doctor at the beginning of the next business day.  The pain still exists.

The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

On Monday March 8, I started to feel muscle soreness and fatigue, primarily in my shoulders and other major muscles.  The soreness and fatigue grew progressively worse during the week, and peaked on Friday and Saturday, March 11 and 12.  On Sunday the 13th I felt somewhat better, with pain and muscle soreness primarily in my shoulders and large muscles in my legs.  The pain level has remained approximately the same since.  The pain is impacting my mobility.  Prior to the shot, I exercised on a regular basis but have not been able to exercise since.

Since the second vaccination I have daily pain in my arm and a headache at least every other day. The pain in my left arm is painful at times excruciating. The headache is also much concern to me. I have not been to a doctor guessing that they may not do anything for me.

                                                As a physician for over 40 years I tend not to pay attention to my symptoms if I develop the flu or a virus. I just put up with it  I received a COVID-19 Moderna vaccination on January 7. Approximately 12 hours after I started to develop adverse reactions. These of Inc. severe myalgias, fever to 102, chills, headache, severe fatigue (to the point where it is difficult to get out of bed)  Not much reaction at the injection site. Hydrogen saturation  in the 90s and pulse in the 70s.  I did contract Covid in March 2020. I was alone for two weeks. However no respiratory problems or hospitalization.  I?m currently speculating that having had covered in March has resulted in a significant immune reaction from this vaccine.  I would appreciate your input on this.  Can I expect this again when I receive my second vaccine in one month?  Thank you

After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

                                                The patient noted weakness starting in the legs on January the 19th, 10 days  after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.  The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

I was virtually unable to function.  This lasted from the night of 02/03 and continued through 02/04.  Finally 02/05 I was able to get out of bed and shakily stand. But I couldn&#39;t stay up long, as I had the aches and pains and a headache still.  Finally 02/06 I was able to get out of bed and stay out.  I hope my description describes the magnitude of my symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to survive.

                                                Neck pain near the top of the neck at the base of the skull slightly to the right of the center began around Feb 1. Began taking Ibuprofin, but it did not go away.  Thought I had muscle strain, but surprisingly there was no stiffness or loss of motion. Tried massage, heat, and cold packs with limited relief. Began interfering with sleep over the next few days. On the evening of Feb 4, I noticed a strange sensation on the right side of my tongue as if I was losing taste or feeling there. At 3 AM got out o bed due to neck pain and noticed right eye felt strange and was drooping. When I got up at 8 AM I saw eye droop and smile was only on one side of mouth. Called my doctor and was directed to an advice nurse who told me to go to the ER right away, since this could be a stroke or Bell&#39;s Palsy. Went to ER and was diagnosed as Bell&#39;s Palsy after blood tests, EKG, CT scan, and tests of limbs. Given medications and and released with prescriptions sent to CVS for prednisone and valacyclovir.

Went home and about 2 hours later he noticed when he was moving around it started to get painful just opening a door, etc.  It continually got worse, and maybe 3 hours later in the evening the pain got really bad, and it seemed to be more in his shoulder area.  Gave the shot kind of high, and the pain was real bad in the shoulder and could not raise the arm or use it much at all.  It was also a throbbing pain where he could feel his pulse with the pain in the shoulder.  It was almost like they hit a nerve.  He is still trying to get over it on day #5.  Each day it is starting to get better.  By Sunday the pain was letting up so that he could use his arm.  He is doing stretching exercises walking up the wall and it&#39;s complicated.  He has a history of shoulder surgery and had a total replacement in the right shoulder, and wonders if his pain is related to the bad shoulder and the cartilage being bad in that shoulder.  He is supposed to have surgery on it.  But the arm is better, can lift it 75%.

Chills and general body/joint aches started approx 26-30 hrs post injection.  Fever (101.2F) peaked ~ 36 hrs after 1st injection.  Mild but obvious headache ceased after 48 hrs.  No injection site rash, just soreness of the arm (like all of my previous flu vaccinations).   Second vaccination was followed with chills and peak fever of 101.4F along same time interval.  Current 02/25/21 at 2:30 pm pacific fever has ?broke? with some sweating.  Feeling much better.  I know these symptoms are positive evidence that body is geared up building the protection system for which we are vaccinated. Self-medicated with acetaminophen (500 mg) to relieve aches. Thank you!!

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

                                                I had mild Covid  March of 3020. Fully recovered. Was expecting only a sore arm from first vaccine. Next day had fire arm which progressed to muscle ache all over, headache, chills. By Thursday night had fever of between 100-100.8.  Friday felt somewhat better but still slight fever and very tired. By Saturday morning I was back to 100%. No fever, all aches gone. These were symptoms I would have expected after second dose. I have given convalescent plasma eight times, last was in November. Still showing positive for antibodies.  Not the worst  Experience overall, just unexpected.

                                                I woke up with heavy fever symptoms, sweating, chills, weakness in legs. The unexpected event included elevated resting pulse of 120, O2 level of 92 and a heavy pounding in my chest. I could feel my pulse throughout my extremities, and was short of breath.  Symptoms subsided about an hour later. The next day I experienced anticipated fever symptoms and slept all day.

Had pain in the right lower jaw below a dental implant and pain below the hip in the right ischium (in the hip with an artificial hip replacement).  The jaw pain disappeared in 2 weeks, and the hip pain still evident after 3 weeks.  X-ray of right hip revealed no abnormalities.

Pain subsided for almost a week then returned.  Same pain, same site and more.  Spasms in adjacent muscles.  Up neck, down arm, pecs and lats near area.  Hard to sleep.  Pain will wake me up at night.  Trying to take it easy, stretch it out.  Some relief after stretching  for awhile and increase range of motion for awhile.  no treatment yet.  Have used analgesics a little with little success.  So it&#39;s been 3 weeks and a day and I&#39;m still dealing with this.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

Wife heard a loud crash and found me in bathtub.  I don&#39;t recall falling but shower curtain fell down and have minor neck and back discomfort at this time.  Wife assisted me to crawl out of tub and she reported I &#34;passed out&#34; two more times for short durations as I crawled back into bed. Had profuse cold sweating episode for about 15 minutes.  Much less weakness now at 10 am, no dizziness but still a mild headache.

                                                Got shot Friday afternoon and reaction started Saturday night. Injection site had a blue coloration about 1/4 inch and began feeling like 1.5 inch of pencil was in my arm. I was feeling very warm and cold at the same time with a normal core temperature. Extreme pain on any movement of arm that caused to muscle to tense. Having a fan on me  really help my heat/cold sensation be normal.  Most of symptoms went away Sunday afternoon, pain in arm reduced and I felt lethargic but OK. Pain in arm had subsided a lot and just felt like injection pain. most range of movement pain free but it did hurt if I moved my left arm up across my chest. Monday morning  had no issues with anything and injection site had no pain on movement or touch. I could just tell I had the shot there and the discoloration was lighter.

                                                The area around my injection site became sore.   The muscles in this area of my injection are still sore today (03/02/21).  It is worse at night and I sometimes have trouble sleeping because of the pain.  I keep thinking it will get better, but so far it has not.  I do not have any trouble using the arm, but there is always a dull pain in it.

                                                Approximately 10 days after the vaccination I began to develop muscle and joint pain on my left side. two days later I started to have problems breathing and the muscle pain, all on my left side, worsened. A day or two later I developed a fever of 102 and the muscle and joint pain became worse, again all on the left side of my body. To treat the fever I took Motrin, this also helped with the headache. I also had a lose of appetite as these symptoms progressed and lost about 7 pounds. I developed a cough that persisted for about 7 days. These symptoms were intense for about three days and persisted at varying intensity for about 10 days.

Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Pneumonia.    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (unwell), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and MYALGIA (body ache). On 31-Mar-2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized for 1 day due to COVID-19. At the time of the report, COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19), MALAISE (unwell), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and MYALGIA (body ache) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 31-Mar-2021, COVID-19: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient was treated with Ibuprofen, Nyquil and Dayquil for the symptoms. Patient was discharged the next day. Patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.  Company comment: Based on the information provided including the established profile for mRNA-1273, a causal association between the event of COVID-19 and the product administration is assessed as unlikely.  Malaise is assessed as a symptom of the infection and also assessed as unlikely.  Chills, pyrexia and myalgia, although also considered as symptoms of Covid-19, are temporarily associated with the product administration and consistent with the product safety profile and thus , causality cannot be excluded.   This case was linked to MOD21-079024 (Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided including the established profile for mRNA-1273, a causal association between the event of COVID-19 and the product administration is assessed as unlikely.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     the concomitant product the patient had taken are Norvasc , vitamin D, Metoprolol , Dexamethasone , Levothyroxine, Lexapro ,Lisinopril.  the patient had certain medical history : Renal Cell Carcinoma on Chemotherapy , Hypertension , Hypothyroidism and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.  Concurrent medical conditions included Renal cell carcinoma (on chemotherapy), Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Critical illness and Penicillin allergy. Concomitant products included AMLODIPINE BESILATE (NORVASC), METOPROLOL, DEXAMETHASONE, LEVOTHYROXINE, ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE (LEXAPRO), LISINOPRIL and VITAMIN D NOS for an unknown indication.    On 24-Mar-2021 at 11:00 AM, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced FEEDING DISORDER (Poor PO intake following the vaccine). On 25-Mar-2021 at 11:00 PM,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), PYREXIA (Fever), MYALGIA (Myalgia) and FATIGUE (Fatigue). On 26-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (NSTEMI) (seriousness criteria medically significant and life threatening), SEPTIC SHOCK (Septic shock) (seriousness criteria medically significant and life threatening), RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Hypoxic respiratory) (seriousness criteria medically significant and life threatening), HYPERKALAEMIA (Hyperkalemic) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PNEUMONIA (Bilateral pneumonia) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (Acute renal failure) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 26-Mar-2021, ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (NSTEMI), SEPTIC SHOCK (Septic shock), RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Hypoxic respiratory), HYPERKALAEMIA (Hyperkalemic), PNEUMONIA (Bilateral pneumonia) and ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (Acute renal failure) outcome was unknown. At the time of the report, DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), FEEDING DISORDER (Poor PO intake following the vaccine), PYREXIA (Fever), MYALGIA (Myalgia) and FATIGUE (Fatigue) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 26-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) Severe bilateral pneumonia. On 26-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) ST depression on V2-V4. On 26-Mar-2021, Troponin: 8.496 (High) High. On 26-Mar-2021, pH body fluid: 7.12 (abnormal) Abnormal.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient expired with in hours of arrival to the ER despite full attempts at resuscitation.  Treatment for the events included resuscitation. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, although it is likely the patient&#39;s underlying critical state caused or contributed to the events.  The cause of death is not specifically reported and event of death retained separately, although likely caused by MI, septic shock, respiratory failure, or a combination of these events; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, although it is likely the patient&#39;s underlying critical state caused or contributed to the events.

I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  After about 4 days from my second COVID shot, my left leg begin to feel uncomfortable when walking.  I try and walk 3 miles every day, but began to notice left leg discomfort and slight pain from my hip to my ankle when walking.  Do not notice this discomfort when sleeping or if my leg is propped up.  Feet are both fine and my right leg is fine, no pain.   Also notice that it is harder and slower getting out of bed in the morning and I get drowsy earlier at night than I used to.  By 9 PM I feel like I want to go to bed.

                                                After my first Covid vaccine on Jan 11 I began to experience some pain and stiffness in my left hand.    In particular it was kind of cramped up and stiff when I woke up in the morning.   Two days after my second Covid vaccine on Feb 8,   those symptoms became much worse.   My hand was very stiff in the morning and I couldn&#39;t straighten my index finger except by pulling it up with my other hand.  Prior to receiving the Covid vaccines, I had never experienced these issues before.

(falling  while at the bathroom sink) I was so weak (could not stand) when I came to that I had to lie on the bathroom floor for 15 min. or so in order to get up.

Lasted almost 2 whole days, better by Sunday (felt guilty for not going to church).  SIDE NOTE, when I described my side effects to my  brother he went ballistic saying that the government is lying to us, the vaccine was not suppose to contain live virus and me getting sick was proof that it did. I explained that my symptoms were a result of my immune system gearing up for a fight once it had been given the instructions as to how it should fight the battle, but no explanation would convince him otherwise (he falls for every conspiracy theory that comes along).

                                                I had a horrid reaction to my second covid shot. I got it on Monday 3/15 and was fine Tuesday. I even walked for an hour on he beach with the dogs so I said ?this wasn?t that bad? ON THE MORNING OF 3/17. I woke up about 3 AM with a fever OF 104 and basically an inability to stand. I tried to get ofF the bed to go pee and fell to the floor from which I could not get up as I had no muscle control or ability to lift myself uo and using a small ladder t took a long time for me to be able to manage to get on my feet with my wife  assistance.  On the way to the bathroom i banged into walls almost falling again.  told me later I looked as though I had a stroke. I made it back to bed and my temp was 104.  Then 20 minutes later the process started all over again it?s me falling to the floor and not being able to get up. This time when i was finally  and my O2 at 80  heart rate 112 was able to get up after about 7 tries I again walked into walls making it to the bathroom. This whole process happened one more time but this time i took a cool shower to cleanup and get my temp down.  Got back to bed and took a Vicodin along with two Advil.  I woke up at 10 am. No fever, able to stand and walk no problem  I sure hope this is over. but tonight will tell. form Item below is checked patient died and there was no death

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

The muscle aches and pin prick sensations have awakened me repeatedly for the past two nights, resulting in poor sleep. After 2 1/2 days, the fatigue and muscle aches are mostly gone, but the itching\pin prick sensations (somewhat like the sensations one gets with a case of shingles, which I had once 25&#43; years ago, or when warming extremities after being exposed to extreme cold) are still intermittently present.

My resting heartrate went from 62 to 71-73. I felt lightly dizzy and certainly weaker than usual.  I had a headache much of the day and when I got home, I immediately went to bed I was so tired. I slept for over 10 hours but did not feel refreshed.

                                                Upon waking at about 7a.m. on 1/1/21,  I stood up and stepped with the right leg; as the left leg followed I experienced acute pain in the left hip joint and the leg buckled under weight. I hobbled/hopped to the hall as the pain moved predominately to the left calf as I leaned on the wall for support rubbing both thigh and calf and yelling to my wife.Over a few minutes, I regained mobility and have not experienced that since. I have had discomfort(sharp aching) in the left hip joint and left calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to have a numbing/tingling from the injection site down to my left elbow as well as down the left side of my leg. There&#39;s a general feeling of &#34;weakness&#34; in my upper left arm. I&#39;ve reported this to our Infection Control Nurse (who administered the vaccination) anecdotally after waiting a few weeks to see if things went away. Her advisement was to go ahead and report in to VAERS.

Later I started not feeling like myself by 9am I was worse, tired, I started having pain from shoulder, no fever, I started taking Ibuprofen, chills and headaches started. This went on until this morning 1/29/2021 and I did not go to work. This was a condensed version of the coronavirus without diarrhea and SOB.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient let me know that he had a warm sensation  from the injection site up to the left side of his neck and tightness of the left side of his neck.  I asked if he felt like his throat was closing and he said no.  At this time, I gave the patient a diphenhydramine tablet 25 mg tablet and a bottle of water and observed him.  I took the patient&#39;s blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it was 170/75. I asked if this was a normal level for him and he said when he took it last week it was 180 over something.  I continued observing the patient and took his blood pressure again in 10 minutes. It was in the same range. The patient left approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine. He said that he was feeling better.  I called the patient to follow up at 3 pm. I asked if he was feeling better. He said, &#34;I think I&#39;m ok.&#34; I asked if he was still experiencing the symptoms from earlier and he said, &#34;No, I left those symptoms in Massillon.&#34;

                                                The next day after the second dose I experienced severe fatigue. About 48 hours after the vaccine I started with muscle aches mainly in across the back and shoulder area. Also noted there was a rash on both legs (no itching and no pain, no bleeding) within a week of vaccination. That is when I decided to see dermatologist who said it would disappear in about 2 weeks.  I am not getting any new rashes so far. As a precaution I took regular Tylenol 1-2 hours after second dose to minimize any side effects.  Injection site was red and sore (more than first dose) for about 2 days.

All went well between the time I got the shot to the time I went to bed at about 10PM. I thought I had it made. At midnight I awoke with intense shivering. I absolutely couldn&#39;t stop. I wasn&#39;t cold as my body was hot. I had plenty of covers, but I was hot and shivering cold. Include a severe headache in this picture. This went on for a good hour and I finally settled down and dozed off again. This morning I have a mild headache and a really sore shoulder where I received the vaccine.

                                                Emergency pacemaker; Pain in left shoulder; missed second dose; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer regarding her husband, a 71 year old male, who received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced missed the second dose due to hospitalization, emergency pacemaker insertion and pain in shoulder .  The patient&#39;s medical history includes high blood pressure, hereditary heart disease, Fuchs Dystrophy and heart attack last year. His concomitant medications were amlodipine 5 mg tablets daily, potassium chloride and indapamide. No information on allergies.   On 15-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of Covid-19 vaccine intramuscularly on his left arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection(Lot#012LZ0A or 017LZ0A) She is not sure about the Lot number as she couldn&#39;t read the handwriting.    On 11-FEB-2021, Patient had Emergency pacemaker insertion done at the hospital, where he stayed for two more days and discharged on 14-FEB-2021. As per his wife, this event is related to his previous heart problems which are ongoing for a long time. His 2nd dose of vaccine is scheduled on 12-FEB-2021, which he missed due to his hospitalization. Doctor said &#34;forget about the shot&#34; after seeing his results in monitor. She thinks, his doctor wouldn&#39;t talk about the 2nd dose of vaccine now, so wants to wait till his follow up appointment in March and he may get his second dose in 5-6-week limit. After being discharged from the hospital, wife reports husband is &#34;starting to feel better.&#34; Sleeps a few hours and gets up and goes lays back down. Still experiencing pain in shoulder.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine was postponing of appointment until he is fine.  The outcome of the event emergency pacemaker insertion was recovered and pain in shoulder is not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of product administration for mRNA-1273. Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273 vaccine, the events of cardiac pacemaker insertion and arthralgia are assessed as unlikely related.  The patient&#39;s medical history of high blood pressure, hereditary heart disease and heart attack are risk factors for cardiac pacemaker insertion and confounds causality.

                                                Vaccine was injected into the shoulder joint causing extreme pain.  Band aid was directly over the joint.   I was not able to move the arm for 3 days.  Couldn&#39;t sleep or get dressed.  Pain gradually subsided but 6 weeks later I still have some residual stiffness.  Reported to Publix corporate office who did not take the information.  They had me call the store directly.  Evidently there is no corporate follow-up for problems.

                                                I am normally symptom free and in excellent health except for some osteoarthritis symptoms in my knee and wrist for which I receive physical therapy.  From this generally healthy state I experienced 9 days of symptoms. Nothing the first day then mild fever on days two through 4 accompanied by headache and backache. Symptoms stronger in the afternoon and evenings.  More severe backache on days 3 through 10.  Days 2 to 7 or 8 very tired.  Took hot baths to be warm all 9 days.   Was able to sleep.  Backache helped with heating pad.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

                                                I had felt a little crummy overall the afternoon of my second shot, but nothing specific aside from a slightly sore arm. The next day my legs started to feel funky, but I had a strong 4 wheel rollator and I continued on to assist my wife with getting her first shot at . By the time we got to the  elevators, after walking about two blocks the legs were feeling worse. On the way out my wife noticed me walking poorly and after about one block my legs &#34;gave out&#34; completely and I collapsed.

I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

                                                Extreme chills.   I was not cold but shook with every breath for about two hours.  Got up in middle of night and my legs would not support me, had to hold onto furniture in order to pull myself across room.  Morning, I get up and tend to lean forward when walking causing me to try and control my balance while walking at an excelerated speed.

                                                Extreme pain in lower right back and upper right neck.  Within 2 day pain progressed to lower left back and upper right neck.  Upon waking from sleep at any time during the day or evening cannot move without extreme pain.  Yesterday, 1/20/2021, I called my doctor&#39;s office and did a call.  Doctor prescribed Baclofen 10mg for lower back pain.  It has provided little relief.  I question what else can be done to alleviate the pain and, also, whether I should go for a second shot on Feb 12.  I told the Doctor it feels like a kidney infection I had in my teens but she dismissed that.

I took one 650 mg Acetaminophen at 0330 the following morning to reduce the fever and continued taking this at 6 hour intervals until 1/22 (today).  Also I had a headache, sore muscles and symptoms similar to the flu during this entire period.  During the first night just before taking the Acetaminophen my pulse was up to 104 bpm.  It went down during the following day to about 84 and is now at 72 bpm (9am/Jan22); my normal pulse is usually between 58 and 64 bpm.

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

On Thursday the knee didn&#39;t get any worse but my lower back and shoulders were sore. On Friday, there wasn&#39;t much change. On Saturday the knee seemed to stabilize and the back and shoulders were tolerable. On Sunday, my stomach was queasy. On Monday, sore joints and queasy stomach. On Tuesday, sore joints especially anything injured back in time, diarrhea started. On Wednesday upset stomach, just a piece of toast to eat, diarrhea, chills, sore joints everywhere, miserable. Thursday was the same as Wednesday plus I vomited twice in the evening with sweats and a 101.1 temperature which went back down. I was miserable. I slept well last night and feel better this morning. The diarrhea seems be abating. I feel like I&#39;ve turned the corner this morning but wanted to mention due to the vaccine shot as a possible cause.

Then I began having pain and soreness in my scalp. Tonight the pain has become a headache, and my right eyelid is very sore. The area of pain and soreness in my scalp has grown larger. I am feeling kind of fluish.  Because I had polymialgia rheumatic a several years ago. My wife and I are concerned that I have Giant  Cell Arteritis. I am praying that this is not the case, and these symptoms are a temporary  reaction to the vaccine. But it is worrisome, because GCA needs to be treated early to avoid the possibility of blindness.

On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

Dozed on and off the rest of the morning.  Low grade fever most of the rest of the day. By Sunday morning felt pretty much normal, but still weak. By Monday morning pretty much back to normal.

                                                Immediate soreness in left arm.  That evening, I felt flue like symptoms  of severe ache of upper shoulders and back . Of more concern, when I lay down for bed, I felt a heavy weight in my upper chest, making breathing painful.  Use of my CPAP machine allowed me to get some sleep.  these symptoms continues for 4 days, after which they subsided.

                                                Patient woke up at 2:00am, approximately 14 hours after dose #1. Patient states he got up and went to the bathroom, got out of the bathroom took 3-4 steps and his legs from his knees down went weak, and he went down in slow motion, could not hold himself up. He could not get back up onto his feet, so he crawled back to bed and got up into bed. Then around 5:00 got up and went to the bathroom again, and walking was hard, but he used a cane, the same thing happened again, and his legs went under him and he fell backwards and ended up on his back. He laid there for a bit and got legs straightened out and his arms had not a lot of strength from elbows down. He crawled back into bed again and about 8:00 am got up and had trouble walking and had to use a computer chair to steady himself. Then sat for a while. Had trouble getting his lower body dressed and about 10:00 am felt as if he had no strength and was going to fall again so he called his doctor. He talked to the nurse who told him to take some Tylenol and see how he was in a couple hours. He said he could get around with a walker but felt as if his legs would not hold him up. Patient states he has stiffness in his legs, but not weakness. By that night was using the walker ok, by the next morning he stated he was walking fine and did not need a cane or walker.

One week or seven days after the shot I noticed the lump had started growing in size and was now  the size of a small marble. Having no pain however, now after 23 days it has grown to approximately walnut size and is slightly painful or sensitive to touch. I have tried to schedule an appt. with my Primary Care Dr. and I finally just today have a phone appt. on 3/24 at 11:50 am.

                                                My husband got first dose of Moderna on 2/16/21 without any side effects.  He got the second dose on 3/16/21 and after 10-12 hours had fatigue, myalgias and nausea which resolved within 10-12 hours.  HOWEVER, one week after second dose, on 3/23/21, my husband took a shower and noticed shortly thereafter around 8 AM a itchy rash on face and neck.  NO rash over Vaccine Site.  Over the day the rash got more intensely red and noticed blotches over his upper chest (symmetrical oval patches just beneath each nipple region).  He took 2 Benadryl Tabs at night and in morning of 3/24 the rash has improved considerably..  The rash was macular and erythematous and never raised with no blistering.   His first dose of Moderna was on 2/16/21 and lot number was 011M20M.

                                                Waited for 30 minutes. About five minutes on the way home started getting a headache. That evening had bad stomach pains, bloated constipation, sharp pains in left shin, back pain, spinal muscle pains. On 1/10, did not eat, tried to drink fluids, still had bad gas about halfway up the spine. Both side where ribs were hurting. Today, drank a couple sips of coca cola, nothing to eat.  Took Colace, helped a little.  Dry heaving today, never vomited, still having pain in spine, gas pain comes and goes. Called pcp, had nurse call and told him to take Tylenol.

                                                On January 19, 2021 (4 days after the vaccine injection) I developed severe itching in the palms of my hands.  By the next day, January 20, 2021, I had developed severe hives bilaterally from my groin areas down to almost my knees, as well as on my buttox.  I also had severe hives in both armpits.   Both hands (palms) and wrists had become swollen and fire-engine red and the itching was maddening.  I saw a Physician who gave me an injection of Depo Medrol and a 7 day prescription of Dexamethasone, 4mg ,  take twice a day and a prescription of  Hydroxyzine HCL 25 mg, 4 times a day as needed.      The hives began to fade after 18 hours of medication and got fainter and fainter each day, along with relief from itching.   Hives were completely gone by the time I completed the 7 day cycle of Dexamethasone.   I have not had a recurrence.

                                                On the morning of the 14th I had no side effects and on the 15th I had a stiff neck on the right side of my neck which radiated pain up to my brain causing a headache. Later, I noticed that the muscles on my right side over my ribs were tightened and later the intercostal spaces of my ribs started hurting very badly and it made breathing very painful and difficult and the pain stretched around my ribs and to my back. If I drew a deep breath I would experience a sharp stabbing pain. Lying down vertically was very painful and uncomfortable. I took my temperature and it was 97.5 which is a little high for me. my blood oxygen level was 99 which was good. on the 16th I woke up and the stiff neck was gone and my headache was a little better. My temp was 98.5 which is 1.1 degrees of fever for me.

                                                Client reports symptoms of severe abdominal cramping and nausea started around  midnight following afternoon immunization with Moderna Covid vaccine.  Cramping would come and go and were severe. Client states he did what he could to put up with the pain until Monday Feb 15th. He went to local ER. Client was unable to tolerate CT contrast oral liquid (caused immediate diarrhea) so an abdominal CT scan was not completed and he was discharged. Symptoms still persist and client states he lost 16 lbs so far. He has reached out to follow up with his regular HCP- VA clinic.  He is waiting for a call from them today.

                                                Transverse myelitis with GAD enhancing lesion on MRI C3-C5. Strength was 5/5 symmetrically in the lower extremities, but he had significant weakness in the upper extremities left worse than right. Generally 4-/5 proximally on the right, 4/5 distally; left deltoid, biceps, triceps were 2-3/5, 4-/5 at the wrist and hand. Sensation is largely impaired on the right in a patchy distribution to light touch, temperature, pinprick, vibratory (impaired significantly on the right) and proprioception. Romberg testing was positive.

Neck pain that goes down my arm (R), extreme fatigue and achy. I&#39;ve lost 5lbs in 3d.&#39; MEDS UTD  History of Present Illness     &#34;I had that COVID shot Thursday (l arm).  Friday I started having cramps in my neck--base of my skull, R arm, into the base of my jaw.&#34;  Worse with laying down, sleeping on L side.  &#34;Hurt too much to get up&#34; (had wife help him up to bathroom).    Tried?  Bayer back and body only.  Tried some topical ben gay (made worse), vibration therapy.  Hot shower seemed to help.  Review of Systems     &#43; for chills, HA, diarrhea.  Worst yesterday.  Missed work yesterday.  Had been eating/drinking well until recently.    Assessment/Plan      1. Adverse reaction to vaccine T50.Z95A    2. Myalgia after COVID-19 vaccination M79.10     1.  Adverse vaccine response will be reported.  This seems to be fairly significant due to being 5d after.  2.  Will try Tyl 1000mg up to tid and Ibu 400 up to tid-qid for next 3 days--try to get dose of each at hs tonight.  Push fluids.  Prednisone 20mg/d x 5d.  Call report tomorrow on status.  3.  At this time, will likely avoid 2nd Moderna covid vax in this pt due to reaction.  4.  Note provided for off work yesterday through tomorrow.

Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

                                                The evening after the shot I had pain in the my right femur and hip. My gait was affected. The pain was  3.5 out of 5. The next 1/23 2021 my left leg developed the same problem but more severe.  My gait was severely affected. On 1/24 the right leg was better but  I could hardly put any weight on the left leg in the am hours. In the pm hours both legs got some better. On Monday 1/25 both legs were much better and both finally cleared up on 1/27.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

Symptoms lessened substantially about 15 hours after the vaccination, but continued at much lower levels for 24 hours after that.   Please note: I didn&#39;t know I needed prior vaccine information when I went for the Covid19 vaccine.  I thought it was 14&#43; days since my dose 2 pneumonia vaccine, but I later looked it up and found it had been 10 days.

                                                Initially I had the pain in the arm which I anticipated.  Several hours later I noticed that I had flu like symptons and my bones seemed to be painful.  Eventually I began having intermittent rapid heart beat.  I thought this may have been induced by tea (caffeine).  This rapid heart beat lasted until Monday (Feb. 15) I think.  As I mentioned it was intermittent.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

Monday I couldn&#39;t go in for treatment, and so Tuesday I went to the ER. I had a 100 degree fever. They did some tests. The ER doctor gave me prednisone treatments.

                                                Saturday, Marth 5th -- day after vaccination.  Upon awakening, extreme pain head-to-toe, in muscles and joints.  Severe headache (very rare for me), Hands could barely move (like severe arthritis),  Slightly elevated temperature (98.9 when my normal is 97.8).  Overall symptoms faded slightly and then returned to full strength two or three times during the day.  Unable to eat (not nauseous, just not hungry) and only drank water.  No bowel movement and very little urination during the day.  By about 18:00, headache was gone and pain was receding .  Around 21:00 started getting very cold and could not seem to get warm.  Started shaking severely from cold.  Put on sweat suit, turned on bed heater, and added blankets, then went to bed around 22:00.    Woke up Sunday morning (March 7th feeling absolutely perfect!  None of the previous day&#39;s pain was present, no temperature, no limits to hand/finger movement, and was very hungry.  Ate a normal size breakfast with no problems, urination was normal,   It was like the reaction had never happened, but my wife assured me that it had.   Other than slight constipation, I have no had any problems since.

                                                I am incensed that I was not aware the the vaccination would (could) cause the worse Rheumatoid Arthritis flare I ever had.  The morning after the injection (very painful and I am used to many injections/IVs due to the RA) I had to crawl out my bedroom.  I was unable to walk due the RA  flare.  The staff at the POD indicated this was no different that a usual flu shot. HA!  I had to get a script for Methylprednisolone to alleviate the effects.  The following day I was back to normal.  Again I feel like we (collectively) are not being truthfully being informed.  At best this vaccine is in a raw state, effective I certainly hope so.

                                                Guillain Barre syndrome; He reports that he started to experience tingling of his feet and hands about 6-7 days ago. He came to ED at that time and was given pain medication for his back pain and muscle relaxants, which has since resolved but he feels stiffness in his lower back since then. At that time he was also noted to have low potassium and sodium, reports that he was given IVF and potassium repleted. He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.

                                                He received his vaccine in the right arm and the next day it was very sore, could feed himself but that was eat.  That morning he had a temp of 99&#43; fever, and then went up to 101.4 which lasted for the 2nd day.   He had fatigue like the flu, which he just rested and slept.  He had chills 5/10, headache as well 7/10 that was with him the entire day and on the 3rd day he had minimal headache.  Had minimal muscle pain and joint pain 5/10.  Just surprised that he was affected by it, and is concerned if he&#39;s going to have the same symptoms with the 2nd vaccine.  He had COVID in October 23rd and that his symptoms were severe and he was going to have a bad time of it.  He remained severely sick for 16 hours and went to see his doctor who told him to go home and wait it out.  These symptoms were similar to but not as intense as the symptoms he had with the COVID virus.  He did not take anything for the symptoms that he had from the vaccine.  He did take some CBD oil one day and he did not take it again.  He has resolved now from the symptoms.

At the suggestion of my doctor I saw a chiropractor.  I received acupuncture which helped some what.  About one week after the second inoculation the back pain became the same as one month previously including for the first time pain in my neck, right hip and right leg.  I do not have arthritis.  I have an appointment on March 29 to see my doctor who hopefully will provide advice on how to treat this pain.

                                                BURSITIS  in right shoulder (NOT the injected left shoulder!), knees (particularly right knee), possibly in right hip.  Clearly a systemic reaction to the vaccine.  The bursitis in my right shoulder precipitated a cascade of adverse effects that became quite debilitating, and from which I am still recovering. The bursitis in my right knew made squatting difficult for about a week, but that symptom is substantially gone.  Here is the sequence in more detail: Vaccinated (Moderna) on Feb 4; went to play tennis on Feb 10; had discomfort raising my right arm (racquet arm)  when hitting my topspin backhand which has a high follow through ; decided to instead practice slice backhand. Developed acute pain next pain. Could not raise my arm ab ove shoulder for weeks now.

The brother found him  sweating profusely, it appeared that the right side of his body was stiffening up, and they started to go out to the car to go to the hospital.  He started to go limp and he collapsed and tried to revive him, they called 9-1-1 and they tried to revive him as well without success and he died.

Slight interval decrease in the patient&#39;s 2 previously identified right sided pulmonary nodules. Slight decrease in the one measurable mediastinal lymph node. The patient&#39;s other lymphadenopathy is probably also improved but difficult to measure due to the technique. Worsening airspace disease in a somewhat interstitial pattern. Pulmonary edema would be the first consideration. Infection would be the second consideration. Severe centrilobar and paraseptal emphysema with basilar predominately peripheral reticular opacities consistent with fibrotic lung disease..

(abnormal) Severe right atrial ventricular dilatation with reduced RV systolic function (&#34;D&#34; sign). Small and under-filled left ventricle with hyperdynamic systolic function, estimated LVEF is 75%. Minimal aortic valve sclerosis with no stenosis. Moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. Estimated PA systolic pressure is severely elevated (68.6 mmHg). Compared to the prior report dated 7/3/2018; there is a worsening right heart dilatation and function. There is increased mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. No significant change in estimated PA pressure.. In 2021, Heart rate: abnormal (abnormal) abnormal. In 2021, Pulmonary arterial pressure: 68.6 mmhg (High) Severely elevated. In 2021, Ultrasound scan: no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the... (Inconclusive) No evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower extremities. In 2021, White blood cell count: no leukocytosis (Inconclusive) No leukocytosis.

I spoke to some of my friends that took the vaccine the same day i took it and in general most of the friends that previously had the virus had similiar symptions again while those that never had the virus did not have any reraction to the vaccine.

At the night progressed he had muscle weakness, lip tingling, eyelid droop, loss of bowel and bladder function, moreso bladder.  He was slow in his responses, and his wife noticed that was getting weaker and could not get up from the bathroom.  She feels it was more muscle weakness than anything.    On 1/29/21 he was bad most of the day  1/30/21 he started to come out of it little and knew what she was saying.   Now today 2/8/21 he is about 93% back to his baseline.  Nothing taken, but did speak to the doctor and he at that time told him not to take the 2nd vaccine.

                                                Vaccination at 9:00am. Some discomfort but not real pain in upper arm throughout the day, but became really tired later in the day and went to bed early. Got up to use the bathroom at about 11:30pm.  Swung my legs out of bed to the floor and went to stand up but fell forward to the carpet.  I had no strength in my legs or arms.  I laid on the floor about 10 minutes and could not roll over or sit up or get up to my knees.  My wife came around and helped me get up and back on the bed.  She then helped me down the hall to the bathroom, then back to the bedroom.  She helped me back to the bathroom one other time that night.  I stayed in bed for several hours and was very week and mostly sat all day,  I regained my strength over the next three days to where I could stand and walk, although I was very fatigued.  I am now about 9 days later and feel pretty much normal but get fatigued and my balance is not normal.

                                                The day after (3/11/21) the vaccination at 9:30 PM I experienced shakes, as though very cold.  My pulse oximeter showed low blood oxygen (between 80 and 85%) and elevated heart rate (high 70&#39;s/low 80&#39;s).  [I took multiple readings to make sure the numbers were accurate.]  By 10 PM my temperature started to increase rapidly.  Max was around 101.5 to 102F.  Sweat profusely.  By about midnight the fever &#34;broke&#34; (dropped back to normal range).  This will sound odd, but I felt like I had been shown what a severe Covid-19 infection/disease would look like if I were to become seriously ill with the disease.  Felt light-headed on Friday (3/12/21).  [I had no reaction, other than some muscle soreness, from the first dose.The same day as and after the second injection I had soreness in my entire left bicep all day.  No other reactions that day.]

                                                Significant painful recurring intermittently muscle spasm on chest wall that continued until 3/15/2021. It was so strong that I initially thought I was having a heart attack. However, other symptoms associated with such an event did not occur, that is no profuse sweating, rapdid heart beat, etc. On Monday, I visted my doctor who listened to my heart and took an EKG. The EKG was normal and she felt that the spasm was associated with the Moderna shot.  I have had no further such events

                                                Initially after the second vaccine he had typical myalgias/arthralgias, especially shoulder/neck. On 3/19 he got acutely worse with severe pain both shoulders/wrists/hands. He came to ER 3/24 with symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving shoulders/wrists/hands and edema of the hands-pitting edema on dorsum of right hand. He was in such pain that he couldn&#39;t take off his shirt without assistance, couldn&#39;t bend the wrists, couldn&#39;t make a fist.   Clinically, this looked like RSP3PE and resolved within 24 hours on prednisone 20 mg bid which is tapered down today.    Patient returned to the ER today 3/24 with nausea/vomiting and that is currently being worked up. If it appears that this has anything to do with the vaccine, I will file a second report with the new symptoms.
