                                                Within 8 hours of the vaccine I was experiencing a right sided headache, sharp shooting; aches; fatigue and mucousy diarrhea. The right sided headache continued for days. On Saturday evening Jan 16th it became the worst headache of my life. Like a fool I didn&#39;t go to ER until Monday morning when I developed left handed weakness. I was visiting my son and presented to the Medical Center ER where I was diagnosed with an acute sub-dural brain bleed and airlifted to Specialized Hospital. Was admitted to the Neuro-Neurosurgery Unit.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases.

Moved to Tendonitis/Arthritis wrists, hands, fingers and Left patellar knee tendon. SLOWLY improved but did not leave, despite treatment with Aleve, until 2nd vaccine 2/5/2021. Then, same symptoms worsened and included BOT patellar tendons, nd plantar tendons. Continues to present and are very painful at night, despite 2 Aleve BID daily, and  cannot make fist or extend fingers on  both hands and cannot walk on feet without pain at MTP&#39;s. Discussed with orthopedic surgeon who assured me that I was having &#34;an immune reaction in tendons to vaccine. It should get better over time&#34;. It has not at present.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

I did not fall. I stumbled into the bathroom, still unsteady. I urinated sitting down, still feeling unsteady, head spinning. I took my blood pressure 130/70, which is normal. Was feeling steadier. Was able to walk down stairs to ground floor of home. Still not felling normal, but steady on my feet. After eating breakfast, no additional symptoms through day. I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages over the past week. When I went to bed Sat night, lying in bed I was light headed. Sunday morning same problems. I performed some vehicle maintenance and would get down on the ground. Head would start spinning, everything would return to normal once standing. At bedtime same feelings when lying down in bed. Monday morning (today) same problems.

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.

The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided. Based on reporter&#39;s causality the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19

Into the evening I started getting beyond normal reaction.  I had a very stiff shoulder joint with pain, beyond that of my existing condition.  It was severe the next day.  Saw my doctor, for the first time meet, and mentioned the reaction I got, but he said it will go away.  During the doctor visit I had elevated BP identified, which wasn&#39;t normal for me either.  That evening I had additional symptoms that included swelling at the proximal points on the thumb and index finger, this also included the wrist.  All symptoms have since subsided to normal.  No other symptoms.

                                                I am allergic to polyethylene glycol ?  it actually put me in the hospital for years ago. I had no idea it was in the vaccine, although a smaller amount than I had taken before. I started experiencing severe and awful anxiety and panic that night I got the vaccine. I had other minor side effects that were expected but they went away within a day. Several days later, I began experiencing pain in both my bilateral Achilles tendons and bilateral knee pain. A physical therapist examined both and said that I was swollen. I have had both of those problems under control for a very long time. I am improving somewhat  but nearly 2 weeks later I am still having some repercussions. I am now scared and don&#39;t know if I should get the second injection done because the previous adverse symptoms were awful. Thank you.

                                                Patient hospitalized for fever thought to be related to 2nd dose of covid vaccine. See hospital a/p from H&amp;P.  Assessment/Plan: Fever, myalgias and headache, I think this is all secondary to his recent Covid vaccine yesterday, dose 2.  I would anticipate his symptoms should resolve over the next 24 to 48 hours.  He was started on vancomycin in the emergency room given history of MRSA.  We will continue for now, though I think less likely secondary infection.  He is on Cipro for SBP prophylaxis.  He does not seem to have significant ascites.  I think bacterial peritonitis is less likely.   End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  I spoke with individual.  Plan is to dialyze him here today.   Cirrhosis -he was evaluated by the transplant center at Hospital on February 25.  His meld was 25 at that time.   History of type 2 diabetes.  His last hemoglobin A1c&#39;s have been all 5.  Can remove that from his problem list.

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

                                                Pt received 1st dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 01/04/2021 in L deltoid. Came back to clinic at 0800 on 01/06/2021 c/o excruciating pain in entire L arm radiating to neck, chest, and around his upper and lower back. States it started the evening of 01/04/2021 and progressively has gotten worse. States it woke him up at 0130 on 01/06/2021 and that he hadn&#39;t been able to get back to sleep because of the pain. Rated pain 9.5/10. No redness or s/s of infection at injection site. Some swelling present at the site. L forearm and hand were slightly erythematous, and he was unable to move arm or fingers much. RN had to assist with putting his jacket back on. States has tried ice packs, tylenol, ibuprofen, tramadol, gabapentin, and oxycodone with no relief. BP 143/93, P 77, RR 22, O2 sat 96%. Advised to call PCP and either wait until urgent care in town opens at 1100, or if he can safely drive to another city, go to urgent care there because they open at 0800. Advised if unable to drive to other city and can&#39;t wait until 1100, to go to the ER.   On 01/07/2021, called pt in the evening to follow up. Pt stated he did go to the ER in town right after coming to the clinic, where they performed an ultrasound of his arm to check for retained fluid, but his results were normal. Pt states ER advised him to try hot packs on his arm and to return if he still found no relief. Pt states the hot packs did help some, but was still experiencing pain 6/10, but that the intensity of it had worn off a little and that it was becoming more manageable

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 23 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch not provided) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Three to four days after receiving the vaccine, the left side of the patient&#39;s face was frozen. The patient was rushed to the emergency room because he thought it was a stroke. The physician confirmed that was not a stroke, and diagnosed Bells&#39; palsy. The patient reported that he spent 6 hours in the hospital and the doctor prescribed him prednisone and valacyclovir. The patient reported feeling better now.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The outcome of event, Bell&#39;s palsy, was considered recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Injection was given very close to the shoulder joint in my left arm, as a result within a few hours a very sharp pain in my shoulder caused me to be unable to lift my left arm without extreme pain, not muscle pain. By 4:00 pm I was sapped of energy. During the night I developed chills and ran a fever of 100.4 F. By Sunday morning I felt nauseous, but did not vomit. At 2:00pm 12/10/2020 my fever has lowered and the nausea has subsided, but the shoulder joint is still very sore.

                                                Two hours after receiving the vaccine on 3/4/21, he started feeling very tired and had a 100.2 temp. By evening he was feeling very cold and  not eating much. On 3/5/21 he was sleeping alot, had headache, chills and fever, no appetite, diaphoretic.  At 8pm he could not get up out of his chair and was disoriented.  Wife call an ambulance.  He was admitted for altered mental status.  Blood cultures showed streptococcus pneumoniae. He was hypoxic at 89%.  BP 171/96, pulse 85, temp 37.3C.  Chest xray showed bilteral infiltrates and a masslike density in the right lung apex. Encephalopathy, pneumonia and sepsis diagnosed. Ct of head normal.WBC count 19 and amonia 24. Wife told me he had a spinal tap on 3/9/21 and that it showed bacterial meningitis. I do not have the lab reports on that yet.  THe infection control doctor told wife he is critical.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                As a physician for over 40 years I tend not to pay attention to my symptoms if I develop the flu or a virus. I just put up with it  I received a COVID-19 Moderna vaccination on January 7. Approximately 12 hours after I started to develop adverse reactions. These of Inc. severe myalgias, fever to 102, chills, headache, severe fatigue (to the point where it is difficult to get out of bed)  Not much reaction at the injection site. Hydrogen saturation  in the 90s and pulse in the 70s.  I did contract Covid in March 2020. I was alone for two weeks. However no respiratory problems or hospitalization.  I?m currently speculating that having had covered in March has resulted in a significant immune reaction from this vaccine.  I would appreciate your input on this.  Can I expect this again when I receive my second vaccine in one month?  Thank you

                                                Staff reported that patient was found Friday morning (Jan 8) sitting at a table with his head tilted forward and unresponsive to verbal or physical stimuli. Staff lowered patient to floor and started CPR. EMS was called and continued CPR at scene, however they were not able to revive patient. Patient was pronounced dead at the scene. Staff written statements following the death of patient show that he had a fall about 1 hr. prior. It is unknown if this fall contributed to patient&#39;s death. An autopsy has been requested.

This violent shaking happened throughout the night and well into the next morning, when it began to taper off - no elevated temperature occurred, although there was a slight headache and significant fatigue with some mental fog.  I took a single dose of Tylenol

After 15 minutes he got up and looked to buy something on one of the aisle when he fell down, he was on his knees. The pharmacist got out there set him on a chair, looked for any injuries and asked him if his breathing was ok. He said everything was fine, and that he just tripped over his flip-flops. The other pharmacist called 911 while I stayed with the patient. He was fully aware of what was happening and he didn&#39;t present any signs of an allergic reaction. EMT showed up after 5 minutes and talked to him for 2 minutes, and told him he was ok to leave.

After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

The weakness progressed to the point that he was able to ambulate only with assistance.   He was seen in my neurology clinic on January 28th and his evaluation suggested an ascending, painless weakness of the legs with rapidly progressive symptoms.  He  was admitted to Hospital on the same day.  His evaluation is consistent with Guillain Barre Syndrome and he has been started on plasmapheresis to treat the condition.

After a few days, it seemed better but not back to normal use.  Around 8 - 10 days later both arms are now frozen with extreme pain as well as his hip flexors are bad. Both arms continue to freeze up where the pain and movement are extreme. Hips and legs also have heaviness feeling, cramps, and pain in LT hip flexors.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

                                                The patient was admitted for recurrent syncope that began on Friday evening 2/19. He fell twice and struck his head, knocking 2 teeth loose. He continued to feel lightheaded the next day and came to the ED and was admitted for syncope workup. His workup was negative. On discharge, patient recalled that he received his 1st Covid vaccine.  His symptoms resolved after admission. This event was likely related to his vaccination.

Concomitant product use included nifedipine and fenofibrate.  On 20-JAN-2021, approximately a week and a half or two prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 030L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  A week and a half or two later the patient stated feeling unwell, headaches, body aches, chest pain, decreased appetite and diarrhea for which patient was hospitalized on 06-FEB-2021. Since everything seemed to be fine the patient was discharged on an unknown date in FEB-2021 however, patient&#39;s family was not notified that it was a late reaction to the vaccine&#39;s first dose. Later, due to shortness of breath he was hospitalized again on 08-FEB-2021 and was diagnosed for pneumonia and was intubated on the same day. Due to COVID-19 situation patient&#39;s family could not be in the facilities and that there wasn&#39;t any follow up of the patient given to the family, so family did not have much information.  During the first hospitalization(06-FEB-2021) the patient had a blood test which showed a normal result and was tested for COVID-19 and Influenza, both were negative. During second hospitalization (08-FEB-2021) the hospital said that the patient was stable. The patient&#39;s family did not know the results of the tests conducted at the time.   The action taken with the vaccine in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia was fatal. The patient died on 14 Feb 2021  The cause of death was reported as COVID-19 related pneumonia. The autopsy was not done.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The cause of death was reported as COVID-19 related pneumonia. Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the events are assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19 pneumonia

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.

We went to ER where they administered heparin IV, kept home, did an angiogram and then quadruple bypass. We are not doing the vaccination caused his blockages.. just want to make sure it doesn&#39;t cause blood clotting which led to his angina.

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

                                                Throughout the day, January 8, 2021, I found myself short of breath and my joints were painful more that usual. My resting heartrate went from 62 to 71-73. I felt lightly dizzy and certainly weaker than usual.  I had a headache much of the day and when I got home, I immediately went to bed I was so tired. I slept for over 10 hours but did not feel refreshed.

I hobbled/hopped to the hall as the pain moved predominately to the left calf as I leaned on the wall for support rubbing both thigh and calf and yelling to my wife.Over a few minutes, I regained mobility and have not experienced that since. I have had discomfort(sharp aching) in the left hip joint and left calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to have a numbing/tingling from the injection site down to my left elbow as well as down the left side of my leg. There&#39;s a general feeling of &#34;weakness&#34; in my upper left arm. I&#39;ve reported this to our Infection Control Nurse (who administered the vaccination) anecdotally after waiting a few weeks to see if things went away. Her advisement was to go ahead and report in to VAERS.

                                                Upon waking on 1/1/21 I stepped with my right leg, as the left leg followed it buckled along with acute pain in the hip joint and along the calf. I hobbled/hopped to the hall calling out to my wife and  slid along the wall to the floor rubbing my leg and calf. After a few minutes I regained mobility and have not had that same experience. I have hadintervals of sharp aching in the hip joint and calf while sleeping on my right side. I continue to experience a numbness/tingling from the injection site to my elbow as well as along my left leg and a general weakness in my left arm. After waiting a few weeks to see if things would change,I reported it anecdotally to our Infection Control Nurse and she advised me to report to VAERS.

Was confused , trying to give me his remote to do what with I wasn&#39;t sure.  He had trouble with getting ideas across.  I wasn&#39;t sure if this was normal for him.  However, we called him this morning at 8:45 am and he was lucid, he stated that when he went home around 4 pm , his left arm , hand and face were numb.  He stated that he could not pick up his cap with his left hand.  Today he woke and feels normal.  He was lucid and able to present ideas in a normal manner.  He vaguely remembers coming back to the clinic yesterday.

                                                Emergency pacemaker; Pain in left shoulder; missed second dose; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer regarding her husband, a 71 year old male, who received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced missed the second dose due to hospitalization, emergency pacemaker insertion and pain in shoulder .  The patient&#39;s medical history includes high blood pressure, hereditary heart disease, Fuchs Dystrophy and heart attack last year. His concomitant medications were amlodipine 5 mg tablets daily, potassium chloride and indapamide. No information on allergies.   On 15-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received his first of two planned doses of Covid-19 vaccine intramuscularly on his left arm for the prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection(Lot#012LZ0A or 017LZ0A) She is not sure about the Lot number as she couldn&#39;t read the handwriting.    On 11-FEB-2021, Patient had Emergency pacemaker insertion done at the hospital, where he stayed for two more days and discharged on 14-FEB-2021. As per his wife, this event is related to his previous heart problems which are ongoing for a long time. His 2nd dose of vaccine is scheduled on 12-FEB-2021, which he missed due to his hospitalization. Doctor said &#34;forget about the shot&#34; after seeing his results in monitor. She thinks, his doctor wouldn&#39;t talk about the 2nd dose of vaccine now, so wants to wait till his follow up appointment in March and he may get his second dose in 5-6-week limit. After being discharged from the hospital, wife reports husband is &#34;starting to feel better.&#34; Sleeps a few hours and gets up and goes lays back down. Still experiencing pain in shoulder.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine was postponing of appointment until he is fine.  The outcome of the event emergency pacemaker insertion was recovered and pain in shoulder is not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of product administration for mRNA-1273. Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1273 vaccine, the events of cardiac pacemaker insertion and arthralgia are assessed as unlikely related.  The patient&#39;s medical history of high blood pressure, hereditary heart disease and heart attack are risk factors for cardiac pacemaker insertion and confounds causality.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

                                                Developed rather sudden onset of neck stiffness and pain and then subsequent occipital and then frontal headache. Over next 6 hours became exceedingly painful as to prevent sleep or finding a comfortable position to rest my head. Went to Hospital ER at 2am on 12/31/2020. Had normal CT brain scan and labs. Given IV reglan, then ativan(1 mg) then 25mg benadryl and a liter of fluids. BP was slightly elevated 150/90 (?). Had oral temp of 99.1. When ativan didnt help they gave me a dose of dilaudid and zophran and additional dose of ativan. Then sent me home with instructions to take valium 5mg tid, orphenadrine 100mg Bid, Tylenol 650mg to 1300 mg q8hr prn and lidocaine patch on neck 5%(also started in ER) q 24hrs.

I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

She was worried about an allergic reaction.  He did seem a little shaky.  They had him sit on a bench outside for fresh air.  He said this was helping.  I took his radial HR.  It was regular, 70 bpm.  I was unable to get his blood pressure due to a broken cuff.  He was feeling much better at that point.  He did eat breakfast.  He said his arm felt fine.  No rash or hives observed and no shortness of breath.   His case worker brought him some water.  We sat there for about 15 minutes.  He felt much better and the case worker said he seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.

Morning, I get up and tend to lean forward when walking causing me to try and control my balance while walking at an excelerated speed.

                                                I began feeling feverish about 12 hours after the vaccination.  Fever went above 101 deg, at times for about 24 hours.  I took one 650 mg Acetaminophen at 0330 the following morning to reduce the fever and continued taking this at 6 hour intervals until 1/22 (today).  Also I had a headache, sore muscles and symptoms similar to the flu during this entire period.  During the first night just before taking the Acetaminophen my pulse was up to 104 bpm.  It went down during the following day to about 84 and is now at 72 bpm (9am/Jan22); my normal pulse is usually between 58 and 64 bpm.

He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

Numbness travelled upwards up to the knees. Next the weakness started extending upwards to his mid thigh. Pt will not put any weight on his legs because he knows he is very unsteady.  Today he has numbness in his hands b/l. Pt had no symptoms before Tuesday. He lives at home (independent senior facility) and is coming from there. Pt woke up this morning and went from his bed to his chair and since then pt was not able to get up from the chair.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

He came to ED at that time and was given pain medication for his back pain and muscle relaxants, which has since resolved but he feels stiffness in his lower back since then. At that time he was also noted to have low potassium and sodium, reports that he was given IVF and potassium repleted. He notes that walks everyday but noticed that for the first time his legs began to give out even when he was walking short distances within his house about 6 days ago. 2 days ago he was unable to walk short distance in his house at all and began to use a rolling chair. At that time he was still able to transfer from chair to the toilet seat. On the day of presentation he started to use a wheelchair around the house (unclear where ti was obtained, no assistance at baseline). He no longer is able to transfer himself from the chair to the bed or toilet seat. Feels that his hands are beginning to feel weak as well. He cannot tell if he is at the peak of his weakness yet. Denies difficulty with swallowing, breathing or speech. No shooting pains down his legs, no change in sensation in saddle area, no loss of control of bowel or urinary movements.

I spoke to some of my friends that took the vaccine the same day i took it and in general most of the friends that previously had the virus had similiar symptions again while those that never had the virus did not have any reraction to the vaccine.
