All symptoms are slowly dissipating but do continue at this time.  No constitutional symptoms.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                On Thursday, March 11th, 2021 approximately 3:10 pm, Patient received his first dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot number: 003A21A) in his left deltoid  Patient received the Moderna Vaccine. After which he sat in the designated medical observation area for 15 minutes. Approximately five minutes later around 3:15 pm, Patient experienced syncope, fell out of his chair, hit the left side of his forehead on the ground. Due to the fall, he experienced a mild abrasion on the left side of his forehead, which led to bleeding.  The Physician?s Assistant rushed to aid Patient who was lying on the ground in a supine position. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) - Fire Department and ambulance were called immediately and approximately five minutes later EMS arrived. During the time frame prior to EMS arrival, the Physician?s Assistant asked numerous questions to Patient to assess his condition. She asked Patient if he could breathe and he responded ?yes?. She asked Patient  if he was short of breath and he responded ?no?. She asked Patient if he felt like his throat was closing and he responded ?no?. At this point, an Epinephrine pen was not used.  Patient was alert and the Orient x 4 questions were asked [(1) Who are you? (2) Where are you? (3) What is the date and time? (4) What just happened to you?]. Patient also denied head pain, neck pain, nausea or chest pain. Staff performed a limited neuro-exam and was deemed within normal limits. Patients Glasgow Coma Scale score was 15 Patient  mentioned that he has a phobia of needles and something like this has happened before when he was ?young?. Patient initially did not want an ambulance to be called. It was explained to him that it might be in his best interest to call EMS due to syncope and abrasion on his forehead due to the fall. Patient also mentioned that he only consumed two cookies and coffee for that day.  When the EMS arrived (about 5 firefighters), they interviewed him and performed a blood pressure test. His sitting blood pressure was 130/82. One of the firefighters assessed his spine and Patient denied cervical, thoracic, and lumbar tenderness or pain. The firefighter assessed Patient&#39;s glucose level, which was a bit difficult to obtain in the first initial efforts, with the glucometer reading ?error?. The firefighters eventually were able to obtain a reading on Patient&#39;s glucose and it read 86. Patient was able to stand on his own, and a second blood pressure test was performed; his standing blood pressure reading was 145/89.  EMS gave Patient gauze to address his head wound Patient initially refused to go to the hospital, but per EMS protocol, fluids needed to be administered. Patient entered the ambulance and was taken to the hospital by EMS.

                                                I received the vaccine through my employer.  7 Days after the vaccination event, my left deltoid muscle became significantly swollen, stiff and tender. There was pain when I tried to elevate the arm laterally. The site was very warm to the touch. I experienced periods of malaise and fatigue at random intervals throughout the week after which I received the vaccine. On day 8, a red rash began to appear on the vaccination site. It was slightly itchy. The area was still stiff and swollen, and painful to move past a certain angle. This night I felt especially fatigued. On day 9 I woke up to see the swelling was mostly subsided, however the rash had spread down the arm to roughly the elbow. The site was no longer warm. It was still slightly irritable. As the day is progressing (this is written on day 9), the rash is starting to fade.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

                                                Patient received the vaccine around 2:50PM; checked in around 2:46PM.  He was seated during his monitoring phase when the nurse reported that the patient was complaining about:  ? Dizziness ? Lightheadedness ? Weakness of extremities &amp; general overall weakness ? Fast heartbeat ? These were noted to be part of the signs of severe allergic list for the vaccine.    Upon assessment around 3PM, the nurse noted that the patient said he felt some of the symptoms were improving; no shortness of breath noted or facial swelling or rashes.  Patient offered juice and crackers and advised to stay and continue monitoring.  Patient compliant with plan.  Around 305PM patient reassessed and patient started complaining of increasing weakness and dizziness and racing heartbeat.  Patient also noted to have labored breathing, pale, clammy and tripoding.  Vitals taken = 101/64; 100% in room air; HR = 80; RR = 32; lung sounds clear to auscultation.   Patient kept on vital sign monitoring and noted that saturations started decreasing to 90%, then 80%, then down to 70% in a span of several minutes &#43; HR = reduced to 55.  Patient also stated he was feeling faint &amp; started feeling very weak &amp; stopped talking &amp;  having difficulty breathing.  MERT called and patient placed in a wheelchair &amp; oxygen administered.   Patient continued to look worse and not as responsive.

I then felt nauseous and threw up, and my body began to ache. 12 hours post vaccination I began to develop a fever of 99.8 with the use of acetaminophen and had severe chills / muscle aches.  The fever progresses to 101.1 about 36hours post vaccine and declined to 100.8 48 hours post vaccine. By 72 hours the fever was gone as well as all symptoms excluding fatigue and a slight headache.

                                                Headache, muscle aches, and fever reaching 101.8 started at around midnight of 1/9/2021, roughly 8 h after receiving the vaccine. The fever broke this morning (1/10/21) so a rough estimate of the time course is 32 h. The fever was also reduced with acetaminophen. The headache still persists, albeit milder. The muscle aches resolved with the fever, so a time course for that would also be 32 h.  I recently had a COVID19 infection (symptom onset was 12/25/20), but had cleared my isolation date of 1/4/21. The symptoms from my COVID19 infection (headache, muscle aches, chills) had virtually resolved by 1/8/21 before I received the vaccine.

                                                Left Axillary pain and mild swelling starting approximately 4 days after vaccination. The pain proceeded to worsen over the next week and moderate lymphadenopathy was also been noted. These lymph nodes are tender to palpation. Additionally some Parasthesias were felt down the left forearm into the hand possibly due to brachial neuritis or nerve pressure due to lymphadenopathy.   The parasthesias lasted approximately 2 days.  Lymphadenopathy is now present in the right axilla along with more severe adenopathy in the left axilla.  - PA-S2

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

                                                Became pale and lightheaded. Vision faded to almost completely black, but was remedied by lying down. After lying down I heard a static/white noise sound in my ears that progressively got louder. It hit a peak volume then slowly started to get quieter until it went away. Muscle soreness in injected arm.

No fever but intense pain in back. We believe the vaccine may have triggered a sickle cell crisis.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?
