I advised the patient to complete the CDC V-Safe form provided with his vaccine, and to contact his primary healthcare provider as soon as possible to seek guidance for assessment and treatment. Additionally, we will contact the CDC for further guidance and appropriate parties will reach out to the patient as more information becomes available.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Currently having it. I have a swollen face. Blurry vision. Difficulty standing. Shallow breaths. Headache. Chills. Body aches. 101 fever. Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

                                                Patient had parked in the COVID vaccine waiting area, and was observed to fall forward onto his steering wheel within a few minutes of parking by 2 other participants waiting in the car next to him. One of them immediately notified one of the parking lot volunteers who came and got me within 1 minute of this observation. 2 students and I came quickly to the open drivers side door and began talking to assess the situation. Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead. The nursing students brought a chair, and we elevated his legs and gave him some water to drink during the time we were monitoring his vital signs. He refused a cupcake because of the nausea, but as time progressed he gained facial color and was more comfortable in conversing. His hands had equal muscle grip and strength, visible fingernail beds were pink and his capillary refill was less than 3 seconds. Towards the end of our monitoring, he did accept some nuts and M &amp; Ms to eat. A University Safety Medical Report was completed by the appropriate safety personnel. He was fully AAO x 3 at the end of our monitoring, and stated that if he felt better he would drive to his apartment (less than 5 minutes away) but would wait for his girlfriend to get out of class if he did not feel fully capable of driving. We encouraged him to eat something light when he got home, to use cool water/warm water soaks at his shot site, exercise his arm, and to take an NSAID for pain relief the next day. We recommended that he eat something light before his second shot (which had already been scheduled), that he bring someone with him the next time, and as a precaution to wait 30 minutes following the second shot. He left at 3: 15 pm driving his car without any apparent difficulties. An online report was completed for the incident 04/20/2021.

No Medical History information was reported.    On 29-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 29-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LETHARGY (Lethargy) (seriousness criterion medically significant), MYALGIA (Soreness in left arm) (seriousness criterion medically significant), HEADACHE (Headache) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and CHILLS (Chills) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 02-Apr-2021, the patient experienced URTICARIA (It got progressively worse &amp; got hives) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and PRURITUS (Both arms started itching, mostly the left at first) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with PREDNISONE on 05-Apr-2021 at a dose of 20 milligram and PREDNISONE on 14-Apr-2021 at a dose of 10 milligram. At the time of the report, URTICARIA (It got progressively worse &amp; got hives), PRURITUS (Both arms started itching, mostly the left at first), LETHARGY (Lethargy), MYALGIA (Soreness in left arm), HEADACHE (Headache) and CHILLS (Chills) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications were reported by reporter.  On 05 Apr 2021, the patient went to the Emergency Room and was prescribed Prednisone 20 mg 2 tabs daily for four days. The hives went away after the 4th day but came right back.  On 14 Apr 2021, the patient went to the dermatologist. At that time the hives continued and were spread on quads, calves, hands and back. The dermatologist prescribed Prednisone 10mg with titrating dose over two weeks.

                                                After my second Covid-19 vaccination I immediately felt fine. There was minimal injection site tenderness. It all started to worsen approximately 8 hours after my shot. I lost the capacity to regulate temperature (not to the point of hospitalization), am experiencing muscle fatigue, have severe injection site soreness, and have a massive headache.

                                                .  He received his second Moderna vaccine on 04/15th.  He did have localized pain in his arm and the following day, had some headache and neck stiffness.  Yesterday evening around 5 o&#39; clock he developed left chest pain that has persisted.  It has waxed and waned, but not disappeared.  It reached an intensity of 7/10 prompting him to get a ride to the emergency room for evaluation.  He was found to have myocarditis, with troponin elevation to 37 ng/mL, and globally reduced ejection fraction 45%.  His care is ongoing.

Patient was not responsive and completely limp. Together we lowered him to the floor where he quickly began to regain consciousness and tried to sit up. Patient was fairly alert within 1-2 minutes. Patient was given water, ice packs for the back of his neck and forehead, and ED was called. Patient stated he was feeling much better and did not need EMS, but due to store policy they were called. Patient relayed a history of fainting after receiving tattoos, that was not notated on his form. Patient remained on floor until EMS arrived about 20 minutes later and checked on patient. Patient&#39;s heart rate and BP were taken by EMS laying down, sitting, and standing and was cleared by EMS to leave.

Approx, 10 minutes later I heard a noise and looked over at his and noticed he was started to fall out of his chair. He then became as stiff as a board and I held him in place until he came to. He was seemingly scared and not aware of his surroundings. He said that he was feeling better but was still light headed. He was given an icepack and water and took his mask off. He looked pale. He started to feel better and left approx 10 minutes after this happened. He told me that he was feeling dizzy before he passed out.

Patient reports normal postvaccination myalgias and fatigue for the last 2 days but had onset of left-sided chest pain that radiates to his upper back and is worse with deep inspiration, some positions and movement of his left upper extremity.  He denies cough, shortness of breath or rash.  He is low risk for pulmonary embolism with PERC score negative for PE.  Screening EKG showed a sinus rhythm with elevated J point in anterior-lateral leads, ? ST elevation in 1 and AVL w questionable reciprocal changes in leads 3 and AVF.  Patient went to CXR.  Clinically very low risk patient for STEMI from CAD.  ? Myocarditis or pericarditis?  No hx of stimulant use or early CAD in family.  Upon reevaluating the patient, clinically he seems to have musculoskeletal chest discomfort, worse with palpation and movement of LUE. Repeated EKG - showed more definative ST elevation through anterior and lateral leads with reciprocal changes in 2, 3, AVF.  Slight ST elevation in AVL.  ? Pericarditis vs myocarditis.     Will call cardiac alert.  Evolving EKG changes.  Discussed with ED physician and Interventional Cardiology, we agreed, patient likely has acute myocarditis clinically.  Very low risk for CAD.  Gave aspirin and heparin.  They will evaluate him.   Labs coming back... wbc 17.4, normal chemistry.  Sending off CRP, ESR.  Troponin pending.   Patient and family appreciative and understanding.   1710 - Follow up call from cardiology.  Stat echo normal wall motion.  With elevated CRP and mild trop 1.6, patient has myocarditis with pericarditis.  Dr very appreciative for the detailed history and physical.  CP free.  Holding off on cath lab.

                                                He had Moderna vaccine #2 on 5/13/2021. The day after the vaccination he had fevers and chills.  Two days after his vaccination (5/15/2021) he developed mild midsternal chest pain. This worsened and on 5/16/2021 he felt like someone was sitting on his chest. This pain was worse with deep breaths and radiated to his shoulders. He sought care at an urgent care clinic where EKG unexpectedly showed diffuse ST elevations. He was referred to the ED where he had an elevated troponin and there was concern for myocarditis.    TTE done showed a normal ejection fraction and normal heart valves.    He denies recent illnesses. He denies recent sore throats or skin infections. He works in the hospitality industry but denies known recent COVID-19 infection.    Since admission he was seen by cardiology and was started on colchicine, indomethacin, and protonix. Telemetry has been reassuring. He reports feeling much better.

                                                For the next few days after I received the second dose of the vaccine, I experienced muscle and body aces, fatigue, and a low grade fever. About 3 days after getting the vaccine I woke up at about 2 AM on the 18th with severe chest pain, the other side effects had subsided at this point. I ended up going to the ER after about a half hour of the pain not going away. They ran a Troponin blood test and foinf my levels to be high. They also tested me for Covid which came back positive. They ended up doing an ultrasound of my heart, using a catheter to take a look at my arteries, a chest xray, a CT scan, and an EKG. The final diagnosis was myocarditis of the heart. I had to stay in the hospital for a few days while my heart stabilized. I was given orders to only participate in light exercise and to take it easy for now. I have a follow up visit with the cardiologist in about a week frok now. It was also found out through testing that I may have Wolf Parkinson&#39;s white syndrome.

                                                About an hour after getting the shot, the skin on my right arm was flushing before going numb. Then my shoulder went partially numb and it&#39;s still numb/frozen as of 2:20 am 26/June/2021. Over the course of nine hours from when I got the shot, starting at around 1 hour after, I started to get symptoms, which as of right now are still here. After my skin started acting up, my blood pressure dropped and my heart was pounding extremely hard in my chest and felt tight. My muscles have been going between losing muscle tone and being locked up extremely hard. I&#39;ve been dizzy since about 3:00 pm 25/June/21, and it has progressively gotten worse to where I feel like I am going to pass out if I stand up. I have chills that make my chest tighten up and cause angina. I have been feeling  very faint since around 9:00pm. I&#39;ve had a mild headache since around 2:30pm, and have been feeling like I am falling since about 1am. Breathing takes manual effort. I have been feeling dissociated and nauseous since about 6pm and cannot remember much from after 6pm. I am not sure whether it is a medical emergency or not but I can&#39;t afford to go to the er.

                                                presented to the emergency room with symptoms of chest pain. He received Moderna covid vaccine on Tuesday and since then he has been having symptoms of myalgias and chest pain. He mentions that the chest pain is substernal, gets worse with deep breaths. It gets worse when he lays on his back.  And feels better when he sits up. He also had subjective fevers. When he presented to the emergency room he was having crushing chest discomfort with a troponin level at 10 and was referred for an emergent coronary angiography with concerns for acute coronary syndrome.  Diagnosis/Impression: Acute myocarditis after Covid vaccination: Based on positional changes and pleuritic nature of the chest pain. Given troponin level left hand and ongoing crushing chest discomfort he was emergently taken to the Cath Lab where he does not have any significant coronary artery disease or thrombotic occlusions. LV gram shows hyperdynamic LV systolic function. At this time his symptoms are consistent with myocarditis.

This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, he was noted to have severe diaphoresis, prominent pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted. His head initially fell back and head was aligned/adjusted to maintain an open airway. This provider was speaking to the pt and performed a sternal rub to elicit a response, pt remained unresponsive and with eyes closed. Pt remained in this state for approximately 10 seconds.

Around 6 pm, I started to experience lower back pain and my legs began to throb and my whole body became very sensitive to touch. I took tylenol or ibuprofen every 4 hours for the rest of the night. This went on until Thursday 4/15/21, when the dizziness and throbbing headache started. Every time I would stand up I would become off balanced and need to hold on to something. I was still experiencing the lower back pain, leg throbbing and skin sensitivity but the dizziness and headache became much more intense. Around 9:30  pm on Thursday, I felt like I was hallucinating and was experiencing euphoria along with a fever. I did not sleep the night of 4/15 into 4/16. I was sweating profusely with a throbbing headache that would cause spinning when I would stand up. Around 3 am on 4/16, I fell asleep until around 4:30 am when I woke up in a pool of my own sweat. The body aches, leg pain and skin sensitivity went away along with my fever. Throughout Friday 4/16, I had a throbbing headache and was dizzy with no relief. This continued into Sunday 4/18 when I started to feel some relief. My headache was pretty much gone but the dizziness is still very much there. I have also an experienced elevated heart rate and respirations throughout the last 5 days.

                                                * Tuesday, March 16th, I received my first Moderna shot. No immediate symptoms, felt fine. * Thursday, March 25th (9 days post-vaccination), I was sitting at my desk and experienced some kind of visual distortion (my computer monitor bounced up and down 4 times in quick succession, even though I was perfectly still). Got up from my desk and laid down, and it went away. * Tuesday, March 30th (two weeks post-vaccination), I started experiencing persistent dizziness/imbalance. It was manageable for the first couple of days, and I still went about my daily activities. * Thursday, April 1st, symptoms got noticeably worse. I had a really bad episode of vertigo/dizziness in the afternoon. This spell of bad symptoms lasted until Saturday evening/Sunday morning. I wasn?t falling down, but I would describe it as akin to being on a boat in rough seas or a plane flying through a storm. Pressure in head and ears was intense. I?ve had longstanding tinnitus, but pitch/volume definitely seemed to change somewhat. My neck was incredibly stiff, and my throat felt somewhat ?tight? (tonsils or lymph nodes in neck felt enlarged). Took ibuprofen and Benadryl on and off over next several days. * Tuesday, April 27th, symptoms are ongoing. Still having imbalance, dizziness, and non-spinning vertigo, though less severe than previously.

Symptoms persisted for several days and I eventually had to seek medical care and physical therapy. The is some speculation the vaccine was inject a little bit too high. Treatment with physical therapy has been effective for regaining my full range of motion and reducing pain.

                                                Got the shot at 12:30PM on Thursday. Started feeling fever, chills, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and slight headache at 3:10AM. Recorded temperature of 100.7 degrees with an ear thermometer. Took Tylenol, drank 32oz of cold water, put a cold wash cloth on forehead. After an hour my temperature dropped to 98.8. Felt less achy but still warm.

                                                Patient is a 22 y.o. male with no previous cardiac history, no known cardiovascular risk factors, and no significant past medical history.  2 days ago he received his second dose of the Maderna Covid vaccine.  Yesterday he reported flulike symptoms with fever to 102 degrees, generalized myalgias, and fatigue.  He awoke at 2 AM this morning with sharp somewhat diffuse substernal pain unrelated to activity, inspiration, exertion, position, without radiation or associated symptoms.  He took Tylenol which eventually caused the pain to decrease in intensity.  He called his family, discussed it with his girlfriend, did some online research, and came to the ER for evaluation where his EKG demonstrated anterior T wave abnormalities and his high-sensitivity troponin came back elevated at 16,072.  His pain is now fully resolved, he is being admitted to the hospitalist service, and cardiology consultation was requested. June 6, 2021

                                                I received the vaccine through my employer.  7 Days after the vaccination event, my left deltoid muscle became significantly swollen, stiff and tender. There was pain when I tried to elevate the arm laterally. The site was very warm to the touch. I experienced periods of malaise and fatigue at random intervals throughout the week after which I received the vaccine. On day 8, a red rash began to appear on the vaccination site. It was slightly itchy. The area was still stiff and swollen, and painful to move past a certain angle. This night I felt especially fatigued. On day 9 I woke up to see the swelling was mostly subsided, however the rash had spread down the arm to roughly the elbow. The site was no longer warm. It was still slightly irritable. As the day is progressing (this is written on day 9), the rash is starting to fade.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

Next morning, I starting feeling sick, with flu symptoms. Aching muscles, sensitive skin, mild headache, sore eyes, and in the evening, nausea. Temperature gradually rose. ~99.7 at 6pm, 100.1 at 7pm, 100.7 at 8pm, 101.7 at 9:30pm. I took some Tylenol around 7pm, and then some theraflu at 10pm.   Fell asleep at 11pm. Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.  Taking another day off from work. Temperature is currently 100.0. Taking more theraflu now, have not taken Tylenol today.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                While monitoring post-vaccination a woman yelled from her car window that ?he? fainted. Upon arrival, it was noted that a young man in the passenger seat was slumped with his head on his chest and unresponsive. It was witnessed that the passenger stiffened and started shaking as if he was having a seizure. The nurse was called. It was noted that the shaking lasted just a few seconds and he then relaxed and opened his eyes. Once the RN, received call that there was a person having a seizure, 3  nurses went to the scene.  Once RN arrived at the car the patient was awake and alert. The patient was assessed, and he was able to answer questions. History of the patient from the mother revealed that he has responded to other vaccines in the past by having a vagal response. RN noted that there were no signs of patient being postictal. Patient was alert, oriented and stated that he was feeling better. EMS arrived and assessed patient and noted that he was in no distress. Patient denied transport to ED. RN educated patient on importance of reporting this to nurse prior to next vaccination.

                                                I took the FIRST dose of the Moderna vaccine this Tuesday on the  20th of April at 11:30 AM. Around 10:00 PM Wednesday I have been feeling short of breath. This feeling has persisted throughout the entire day of Thursday and I continue to feel the same way (I think it has slightly worsened). I can breath, but I am completely unable to take a full, deep breath. I sometimes can achieve a full deep breath but it&#39;s completely at random. I find myself trying to forcefully take a deep breath but can&#39;t seem to fully fill my lungs how I normally am able to.  Additionally, my throat feels mildly swollen/sore, starting from the back of my mouth and down my esophagus. The lowest point of my esophagus at which I feel the soreness/mild swelling is near the center of my chest.  I think my shortness of breath is progressively, and slowly worsening, but its hard to tell for certain. Some of the muscles around my back are beginning to feel uncomfortable due to me constantly trying to forcefully achieve a full and deep breath.

                                                Arm soreness/aches started about 6hrs in (though injection sight was tender/sensitive to the touch pain became mostly localized around the armpit and shoulder area. Where the pectoral connects under the arm), then around 8hrs a headache and chills started. Chills and headache progressed and got significantly worse throughout the night.  By around18hrs headache had progressed to a migraine and nausea started (likely due to the migraine). Simply sitting up in bed was enough to push nausea to vomiting at which the migraine subsided for about 30min-1hr. Chills and aching arm persisted.  By 24hrs headache/migraine was nearly completely gone and chills had subsided. Arm pain persisted and got worse. Noticed around this time that there seemed to be mild swelling in the armpit. Around 48hrs in armpit area is still feels slightly swollen and causes a good bit a pain depending on how arm moves/rests. Injection sight still lightly tender. (currently the only symptom persisting)

He was seated during his monitoring phase when the nurse reported that the patient was complaining about:  ? Dizziness ? Lightheadedness ? Weakness of extremities &amp; general overall weakness ? Fast heartbeat ? These were noted to be part of the signs of severe allergic list for the vaccine.    Upon assessment around 3PM, the nurse noted that the patient said he felt some of the symptoms were improving; no shortness of breath noted or facial swelling or rashes.  Patient offered juice and crackers and advised to stay and continue monitoring.  Patient compliant with plan.  Around 305PM patient reassessed and patient started complaining of increasing weakness and dizziness and racing heartbeat.  Patient also noted to have labored breathing, pale, clammy and tripoding.  Vitals taken = 101/64; 100% in room air; HR = 80; RR = 32; lung sounds clear to auscultation.   Patient kept on vital sign monitoring and noted that saturations started decreasing to 90%, then 80%, then down to 70% in a span of several minutes &#43; HR = reduced to 55.  Patient also stated he was feeling faint &amp; started feeling very weak &amp; stopped talking &amp;  having difficulty breathing.  MERT called and patient placed in a wheelchair &amp; oxygen administered.   Patient continued to look worse and not as responsive.

I then felt nauseous and threw up, and my body began to ache. 12 hours post vaccination I began to develop a fever of 99.8 with the use of acetaminophen and had severe chills / muscle aches.  The fever progresses to 101.1 about 36hours post vaccine and declined to 100.8 48 hours post vaccine. By 72 hours the fever was gone as well as all symptoms excluding fatigue and a slight headache.

                                                Headache, muscle aches, and fever reaching 101.8 started at around midnight of 1/9/2021, roughly 8 h after receiving the vaccine. The fever broke this morning (1/10/21) so a rough estimate of the time course is 32 h. The fever was also reduced with acetaminophen. The headache still persists, albeit milder. The muscle aches resolved with the fever, so a time course for that would also be 32 h.  I recently had a COVID19 infection (symptom onset was 12/25/20), but had cleared my isolation date of 1/4/21. The symptoms from my COVID19 infection (headache, muscle aches, chills) had virtually resolved by 1/8/21 before I received the vaccine.

The pain proceeded to worsen over the next week and moderate lymphadenopathy was also been noted. These lymph nodes are tender to palpation. Additionally some Parasthesias were felt down the left forearm into the hand possibly due to brachial neuritis or nerve pressure due to lymphadenopathy.   The parasthesias lasted approximately 2 days.  Lymphadenopathy is now present in the right axilla along with more severe adenopathy in the left axilla.  - PA-S2

                                                A few hours after the injection, I started feeling severe joint and back pain. Around 5 PM is when I started feeling a tingling feeling in my hands, feet, and around the outside of my mouth. I still have a loss of feeling in my feet after returning to work today, 1/25/2021, and I was promptly sent home after informing my management. I still have some loss of feeling around the corners of my mouth, and most of the feeling has recovered in my hands.

                                                Before going to bed, I had chills. Throughout the night I woke up feeling extremely cold multiple times. In the morning I awoke sweating. My temperature in the morning was 98.2°.  Throughout the day on 03/13/21, I  was extremely sore in my hips and legs. The arm where I was administered the shot was also sore. In addition to the soreness, I felt cold throughout the day, and I had a headache until I ate around 12:00pm, but I did not have much of an appetite.

                                                At 3:15 PM, pt entered observation immediately after receiving his second dose of the Moderna CV 19 vaccine. Pt reported to the RN that he was feeling dizzy (Client reported feeling dizziness after receiving his first dose as well.).  Pt also complained of piercing headache above his left eye and pain on the right side of his neck. The pain radiated down his entire left side of his body. The pt also felt tingling in the arm he received the vaccine in.  Vitals were initiated and water was provided to the pt. Ice packs were applied to the patients forehead and nape of the neck where he felt the pain.  Vitals NOT within normal limits. O2 saturation fluctuating and blood pressure was a bit elevated.  Pt reports having a history of hypertension, but could not accurately recall having taken the medication that morning. EMS was activated at 3:35 PM because the pts O2 saturated was fluctuating dangerously and interventions were not successful in relieving the patients symptoms.  Vitals were taken approximately 10 minutes apart. Vitals were not WNL. Pt continually reported that the pain was increasing and beginning to feel unbearable. It was noted that the patient had increasingly poor circulation in the arm he received the injection. O2 was taken on the opposite arm and saturation levels appeared normal.  EMS at 4 PM. Vitals were taken, all WNL. Patient left with EMS at 4:05 PM and was transported to Hospital.

                                                On Sunday April 25th 2021, I woke up with severe chest pain that went up to the right side of my neck, as well as having shortness of breath.  I was admitted into the ER and they ran blood work, did a CT scan and x ray of My chest. When my bloodwork came back, it showed I had very elevated troponin levels. Because I was having continuous pain, I was given morphine but it didn&#39;t work. So they upped it and gave me dilaudid and that took the pain away. It was in the doctors best interest I get transported to a facility with a good cardiatric team. Upon arriving to the new facility, they further drew my blood and ran more tests. I got admitted as an in patient on the cardiatric floor. The cardiologists ordered for me to have an echocardiogram done, another CT scan with a special protocol to view my heart, and an MRI done of my heart.   After my echocardiogram and CT scan came back fine, the doctors said they&#39;d be surprised if the MRI DIDNT show something. When that result came back, it did reveal my heart was still inflamed.   After ruling out all other possibilities they concluded that the 2nd Dose of Moderna COVID vaccination I&#39;d received was the culprit behind my diagnosis. My diagnosis being, a case of myocarditis as well as a mild heart arrhythmia.   For the next several months I am kn a medication called metoprolol 25mg, 2 half tablets a day, to correct my heart arrhythmia and relieve stress from my heart as well as minimize the amount of stress I encounter each day. No heavy lifting pushing or pulling of any sort for the next 3 months.

                                                A few seconds after shot, pt became pale and immunizer asked if he was ok. His muscles tensed and shook a little and he passed out, falling slightly to the right. The technician was able to place herself between him and the floor and slowly lower down, leaning  against the wall of the pharmacy.  By this point, about 30 seconds at most had passed, and pt was awake and cognitive, but had no recollection of passing out or how he had gotten to the floor. He did know his name and where he was, but was breathing heavy.  We took his blood pressure at this point and it was 82/46 with a pulse in the 40&#39;s as well.  Pt refused ambulance and we had him continue to sit on the floor.  Patient mentioned he had this type of reaction in past to other vaccines (not stating what), though only telling us prior he had &#34;slight dizziness once&#34;.   He also stated he had not had anything to eat or drink that am so we got him a snack and some water.  Patient continued to breath deeper as we suggested and stay on the floor as we called mgmt from the store.   We took blood pressure about 10 minutes later and it had gone up to 117/71.  and then again 10 minutes later and it was 121/69.  After 30 minutes total, pt asked if he could stand and leave.  He stood with no dizziness and said he felt &#34;fine&#34;.   We called patient approximately an hour later at his residence to make sure he got home ok and patient stated he had no other symptoms at that time and continued to feel &#34;normal&#34;.

I had previously had a small cut on my toe and the doctor believes that the inflammatory response my body initiated from the vaccine exacerbated this infection.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

After lying down I heard a static/white noise sound in my ears that progressively got louder. It hit a peak volume then slowly started to get quieter until it went away. Muscle soreness in injected arm.

No fever but intense pain in back. We believe the vaccine may have triggered a sickle cell crisis.

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

                                                I woke up with pressure on my chest and pain on my left arm around the elbow. After a couple of minutes, I began to have a lot of cold sweat, and both the pressure in my chest and pain in my arm began to increase. Then I began feeling a tingling sensation on my neck/chin. After that, I felt lightheaded and decided to go to the hospital. At my arrival to the ER, I was given aspirin and heparin. I got a couple of EKGs and a chest X-Ray, as well as some blood work. I was then transferred to the medical center, where I had some more blood tests and EKGs done. I was also treated with Indocin, Lipitor and Aspirin. At around 9PM, I began feeling the pressure on my chest again, although with decreased intensity. I was given morphine and the pain went away. This event repeated at around 10AM next morning with the same outcome. After that I got an Echocardiogram, and began to be treated with Metoprolol. No other pain events happened for the rest of my stay at the hospital. On the next morning, April 26th, I was taken to an angiogram to rule out Coronary Dissection. After the test, I was discharged with a prescription for Metoprolol.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination the patient began to feel light headed. He stood up and fell back to the floor, landing in a sitting position and not striking his head. He was helped into a chair by a bystander and I was alerted to the situation. He appeared pale and diaphoretic, then he became unresponsive with his eyes up and his arms tensing up. After about 10 seconds he became responsive again. EMS had been called earlier and arrived a few minutes after this and he was evaluated and left with EMS. It was unclear if he had simply passed out or if he had a seizure. He had no previous history of seizure, though the presentation seemed somewhat atypical for just passing out.

                                                Mild Chest pain began to occur roughly a week after vaccination. Two weeks after vaccination it had processed to severe bouts of pain accompanied with dizziness and fatigue. After about a week of severe pain, the pain began to taper off and seemed to move from my chest more into my armpit and arm. A swollen and painful lymph node occurred in my left armpit roughly 2 weeks after severe pain had started. The lymph node is currently still swollen but it&#39;s getting mildly better. Chest pain is not entirely gone but it&#39;s also getting better slowly.
