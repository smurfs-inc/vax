                                                About 8pm I began t experience total body itching.  At 11pm the itching was too much to allow for sleep.  I took two Gabapintin 300mg.  At 4AM I went to sleep.  I contactedmy dermatologist.  He suggested the vaccine may have started a Grover&#39;s response.  He asked that I add Zyrtec (over the counter) to my meds.  He asked that I continue hydrating my skin with Vanicream cream.  I folllowed his advice.  The itching stopped on Sunday.  I continued with the Zyrtec but stopped the Gabapintin.   Today, Tuesday, I am having muscle tightening, especially in my legs.

I had a significant fever that lasted for 18 hours. The first night I was unable to sleep because the body soreness and pain would not allow me to get comfortable. I started taking Tylenol shortly after the symptoms started but it did little to mitigate the symptoms during the first 24 hours. By the end  second day following vaccination, symptoms were beginning to subside. On the morning of the third day, I pretty much back to normal.

                                                About 1:35 am I was experiencing acid reflux, I prepared some alka-seltzer. As I was beginning to drink it I started to feel faint, My legs started to give out, my glass dropped into the sink, and a was flat on my back on the floor. I got up and went to bed. As I lay there uncovered I began  to perspire, but that soon stopped. After 10 minutes I pulled the sheet over me and 30 minutes later I pulled the blanket over me. At about 2:30 am I was feeling normal except for the reflux. I took a full dose of alka-seltzer and have had no more problems since then. I believe the acid reflux was from eating and drinking wine that evening. I don&#39;t know of the fainting was from the vaccine or a touch of flu for one hour.

On fourth day following vaccine, woke to terrible arthritis pain in left shoulder and across back and chest. Pain continues to present but helped some by tramadol 50 mg . Not sure if it was vaccine related or if stopping anti-inflamatory meds allowed arthritis pain to resurface. Have scheduled shoulder replacement.

                                                pneumonia; Tired; Achy; Muscle weakness in left arm; Arm  was swollen; This spontaneous report was received on 10FEB2021 from a consumer which refers to a 76-year-old male patient who received the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine and experienced injection arm swelling, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.   On 15JAN2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly (Lot number: 026L20A). On 16JAN2021, the patient noted a start date for Pneumonia.  On 10FEB2021, the patient called the medical information call center and reported, &#34;he is on antibiotics for pneumonia. His 2nd question is can he delay the 2nd dose since he is suffering from pneumonia. Patient was administered 1st dose of vaccine on 15/Jan/2021 in his left non dominant arm. The lot# was provided, but expiration date is unknown. Patient experienced some expected side effects, which he is not concerned about&#34;.  The event(s) were arm swollen, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and tested positive for pneumonia 1 day after receiving the vaccine.  The action taken for Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine was reported by the patient as Tylenol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the events of fatigue, arm swelling, myalgia, muscle weakness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.

Began to ease off after 26 hours. Awakened 20 hours after shot with sense of lassitude, sluggish thinking  - like the drowsiness an antihistamine may cause.  Just felt strange almost not really present in the moment sensation.  This is still still ongoing after 30 hours but easing off significantly.  no fevers, chills, myalgias or flu feeling. no local swelling or redness at injection site. This odd feeling did not interfere with daily 10000 step walk.  Feel much improved after exercise.

This pain has continued since then for approximately six weeks now.  In addition, my right arm, hand, and fingers are swollen, and the tips of my fingers on the right hand feel slightly numb. I have been taking acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen, but still have the symptoms described above.

It was very sore when I moved them.  I did have a stiff lower back, sore when I get up and down. I did see my PCP and she put me on a topical cream and arthritis medication, but doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s related to the vaccine.  It seems like it&#39;s getting better, but I will make a move and will hurt again.

On april 8th, after lunch I had to lay down on the floor because I thought I was going to pass out. After about ten minutes &amp; breaking out in a sweat, I was ok.On saturday the 10th, I sat down for supper &amp; could only eat a few bites before I thought I was going to throw up.

                                                STARTING ON THE THIRD WEEK: SEVERE PERPETUAL LEFT-SIDE HEADACHE WITH LEFT BRAIN MODERATE CONTRACTION. NOT SURE AT FIRST BECAUSE OF SLEEPLESSNESS PROBLEM. OVER THE COUNTER COMBO TYLENOL IBUPROFEN ASPIRIN, THEN ADVIL, NOTHING WORKS AS BEFORE AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPS OVER SEVERAL DAYS. THEN OUT OF THE BLUE WHILE SITTING TWISTING MY BACK TO CHANGE POSTURE, SUDDEN SHARP PAIN AROUND THE WAIST ON THE BACK NEEDING HELP TO WALK UP TO LIE DOWN WHICH USUALLY WILL RECOVER SOON, BUT NOT THIS TIME. TRIED THAI ASAIN BALM[CREAM] RUBBING ON THE BACK WAIST PAIN AREA AND USUALLY THE BALM&#39;S MEDICINAL HERBS SMELL WILL FILL THE AIR AROUND THE BODY, BREATHING IN THE BALM AROMA USUALLY HELP FASTEN THE RECOVERY, SOMEHOW ALL ACHE/PAIN JUST STOP. SOMEHOW PERHAPS COINCIDENTLY ALL ACHE/PAIN JUST STOP FOR SEVERAL HOURS, SO DID NOT THINK IT WAS FROM THE VACCINE. AT THE END OF THE THIRD WEEK HEADACHE CAME BACK THOUGH NOT SEVERE WITH MILD BRAIN CONTRACTION THIS TIME UNTIL NOW THE FOURTH WEEK APRIL 19, 2021 AND SEEM PERPETUAL AS NO PAIN MEDICINE CAN CURE IT, JUST REDUCE THE PAIN A BIT. THAT IS WHEN I THINK IT IS FROM THE SIDE-EFFECT OF THE VACCINE, HENCE THIS REPORT. THE SECOND SHOT WILL BE THIS SATURDAY APRIL 24,2021; SHOULD I DO THE 2ND VACCINATION?  TASTE, SMELL NORMAL THROUGHOUT WITH MILD FEVER, NO ACCURATE THERMOMETER AT HOME, STILL SLEEPLESSNESS EVEN INCREASE DUE TO THE HEADACHE WITH FEW MINUTES SLEEP DURATION IN BETWEEN HERE AND THERE THROUGH DAY AND NIGHT. BY THE END OF THIS WRITING HEADACHE REDUCED MUCH MORE AND DO HOUSE CHORES FINE.

I usually walk 2-3 miles per day and my legs never relax. They remain tight at all times. I have pain in my legs when sitting and arising from a chair. The aforementioned joints ache in bed to the point that I have to roll over constantly because of pain caused by pressure. I have tried to stretch daily to loosen the muscles and joints to no avail. I never had any of these problems before. I recognize that the symptoms arose a month after my 2nd shot. After the first dose, 2/8/2021, i had leg fatigue on the forth day only. The next day I had no symptoms and none until 4/10/2021.

                                                within days the pain and weaknesses that were reported to be common became far worse and long lasting (now in my seventh week), affecting my neck, head, shoulders and legs, especially my quads. I could not turn my head left or right, I had pain shooting up the backsides of my neck into my head, had head pain, shoulder muscles pain, and severe leg pains. I initially was told by my doctor that it would go away, and it hasn&#39;t, although not as severe now in my neck or shoulders, and I have more, but limited neck turning movement. My legs are i terrible shape and cause me a LOT of pain, for which I went a couple of weeks ago to an Urgent Care place, who said I need to go to a specialist, but recommended I try taking a NASID for two weeks first regularly, to see what happens. I am nearing the end of that period, having taken ALEVE  twice a day. It has helped cut down on the pain, but the basic problems still persist. I feel like I have aged 10 or more years, although I had been healthy and vigorous before taking the 2nd Moderna shot, and I am expecting that the &#34;doctors&#34; do not know how to handle this. I am frightened.

I noticed that the injection was inserted in the top of my shoulder and not on the side. The injection hurt more than any shot I have ever had, and I have had many. I don&#39;t know if my shoulder pain was caused by the way the needle was inserted of because of some reaction. I am in excellent health and have the long term covid antibodies.

                                                By 1:30 am on 2/4/2021; patient was shaking uncontrollably.  This continued about 1 1/2 hrs. then he could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom; thus wetting himself multiple times during the night; Patient was restless for about 5 hrs. but still could not get up even with me (his spouse) trying to help.  He also could not understand how to help move his body to keep from falling out of bed (never fell out but I could not get his entire body on the bed until our daughter arrived around 9:30 am.  It took our grandson who is 6&#39;5&#34; tall &amp; 275 lbs. to help get patient up and walked him into our sunroon.  throughout the day, patient could not stand without help &amp; continued to urinate on himself.  He could, however, feed himself breakfast &amp; lunch.  At 7:30 pm grandson and daughter had to walk patient into bedroom.  patient could not walk without us telling him how and pushing his feet forward.  It took both grandson and daughter to pull him onto the bed as he collapsed when he got to the bed.  Patient slept until approximately midnight. at that time our daughter helped him to the bathroom and helped to change his underwear and tshirt which was wet from having a fever.  Afterward, patient was able to go to the bathroom by himself but was very tired.  He was able to walk outside with the help of a cane on 2/5/21 2 pm.  On 2/6/21, patient complained of his back hurting and itching.  We discovered he had shingles!  Not a full body rash but shingles on his left side around his waist.

                                                I had my (Moderna) first dose yesterday.  Within ~6 hour the soreness level of the shoulder joint (but not especially the site of the jab) zoomed up to intense.  So much so, that simply lifting my arm slow-motion to the level of my eyes caused intense pain spasms.  Last night and this morning were equally severe.  Within the last hour or so, the pain level has diminished a bit.  NOTE: I know how people rate pain is super subjective.  In my case working as a geologist in a quarry a number of years ago, I was struck and pinned by a large boulder.  The ER crew would not give me a pain killer, so that they could monitor how the Jaw of Life was working (it broke, the boulder was too heavy), so I not surprisingly passed out several times from the pain level before being extricated.  Needless to say, this compound fracture of the tibia and fibula accident was a 10 of 10 pain level.  Yesterday&#39;s CV-19 jab pain level was an 8-9 of 10.  Nothing I read before yesterday&#39;s jab, Fauci et al, prepared me for this pain level.  So, is this normal???  My POV is, I think, atypical in this matter of pain. Should I be concerned about a return to normalcy right now (today / tomorrow) as well as for the second dose??  I HOPE THAT A MEDICAL PERSON WILL RESPOND TO THIS EMAIL - NOT SOME BOILER PLATE WORDS.

                                                RN gave IM injection too high on the arm resulting in severe pain and immobility x 5 days. Patient felt pain very soon after injection and circled the needle mark of the injection site. Patient reported to public health department on day 6 after injection to ask if this was an expected reaction after a vaccine or if it was because the injection was too  high. The location that the patient marked was indeed over the shoulder and not in the deltoid muscle. The RN who gave the injection has not done patient care in 20&#43;years. The injection was co-signed by public health department staff.  Patient reports that on day 6 the pain had decreased a small amount and that strength is returning to his hand.

Under front of nose there was a weird sensation that lasted until the second day.  Felt like something was messing with nose but nothing was there that could be seen.  Now this is day 8 and there is swelling abouve my left ankle probably about 2 inches up.  The leg and elbow and nose seem to be ok.  I don&#39;t think I want to take vaccine #2 because of these effects that happened.

                                                Patient reports at least two falls following COVID vaccine.  Requiring assistance to stand up.  Legs reported as &#34;giving out&#34; resulting in falls.  Reports being shaking within 24 hours following vaccination.  Reports extreme weakness and needing to be lowered to the floor at least twice.  This is new for him.  Did not report feeling dizzy; blood sugar was reported as normal during the time.  No confusion or feeling out of it reported at the time. Ended up with abrasions.  Patient has been having bilateral leg weakness since Friday evening, patient had Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday.  Wife called Sunday at 0130 after 2nd episode of leg weakness and fall (see previous note). His first fall was Friday evening around 2030.  Saturday his wife reports that he was walking on his own without his walker but did have complaints of fatigue and decreased appetite, which she attributed to his Covid-19 vaccine. Sunday morning at 0130 was his second fall, an ambulance was called and patient refused ED after being assisted by EMS. Patient did not have any dizziness or syncope, just states that his legs were too weak and gave out. Wife states that patient has improved today, is using his walker and walking without difficulty. Yesterday she states that she pushed food and fluids due to decreased urine output. Urine output has returned to normal last night and today, appetite and fatigue have also improved.  Assessment    1. Fall from standing, initial encounter    2. Multiple abrasions    3. Adverse effect of vaccine, initial encounter    4. Generalized weakness  PT EVAL AND TREAT 5. Decreased strength, endurance, and mobility  PT EVAL AND TREAT   I suspect his falls and weakness are due to Covid-19 vaccine reaction.  I think he has more baseline weakness than he realizes- recommended PHYSICAL THERAPY for strengthening and he agrees- already planning to see them for shoulder pain.  Feeling better overall today.  Recommended getting up every 2 hours to walk around, use walker for now.  Call if more falls or continued extreme weakness.

After about 30 minutes he was able to sit up, stand and walk with a walker and assistance. generally has difficulty walking, but the concern was the rigidity and inability to bend for such a long period of time. After that he seems to be the same as he was prior to the vaccine.  Also, on 2/22/21 shortly after getting his vaccine he had a tremor in his hand (not sure which one) which stopped shortly after getting the vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

At times, I found even a small exertion like walking up a couple of flights of stairs to be exhausting. At times my head felt buzzy, although I haven&#39;t had a fever. At times I also felt fine but then would relapse. My sleep has also been erratic, although not very good normally. Arthritic joints are more painful.

                                                He received the vaccine and after 2 hours he went home and was paralyzed from the waist down.  He tried to stand up and then he passed out on the floor for about 10-15 minutes.  He went to sleep and woke up around 5 hours later.  He then tried it again and urinated on himself and he fell down on the floor, passed out without getting up until the morning.   He did call his doctor who was not available, spoke to the nurse and advised to go to the hospital.  He is weak and cannot drive so he did not go to the hospital.  He slept the rest of that day and the following day.  Then when he saw his doctor about 2 days ago, he described his reaction and told to report the reaction and that he would report it himself.  He was advised not to take the 2nd vaccination.  He is no longer having the heavy reaction, his muscles are aching and his vision is  blurred, especially on his back and the shoulder.   His doctor did do blood work at the office visit.

It was very sore for about one week.  The soreness gradually dissipated over the next week, but then began to get worse over several days.  Beginning the third week after this dose, the soreness is mainly in my shoulder.

By noon felt lethargic and slept the remainder of day. He experienced incontinence while sleeping. He had trouble walking, and could not make it to the bathroom without support. While in the bathroom he went to the floor, (did not fall), could not get up. I had him crawl on his hands and knees to the living room. It&#39;s a though his muscles went soft. Remained lethargic the remainder of the day. Did not see a doctor.  Stayed at home and waited for symptoms to pass.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   Around 8 hours after the shot, my left shoulder started to hur, when I raised my arm. Over the next few hours I grew more tired than usual with a very low-level, generalized ache. I went to sleep at 11. I woke up at 2 in quite a bit of generalized pain, left shoulder so painful I could not lie on my left side, unable to get comfortable in any position, feeling worse and worse. At 2:30 I got up, which immediately made me feel a bit better. I took an acetominophen, a half codeine acetominophen #3, and around 5 ml promethazine/codeine syrup. At around 4:00 I had some cheese and bread. At around 4:30 I was able to go back to sleep. I got up at 8:30, still achy/hurting, but distinctly better. I am writing this at 11 a.m. One other thing to note: after the shot I seemed to be having a  very odd, mild allergic reaction intermittently, when I ate some foods that I eat every day. Mostly it was a case of my hard palate itching.

                                                Had muscle and joint pain and low fever for 2 days after vaccination. Stayed in bed. 4 days after vaccination a bubble the size of 3/4 of a golf ball popped up on the tip of my left elbow, Olecranon Bursitis. The pain was minimal but I could not put the elbow on a table or the arm of a chair without sudden pain. Bubble stayed the same for 4 weeks and then slowly went down over 10 days. Elbow is still sore when hit or put on a table. Got vaccinated 2nd time in the right arm on 02/22/2021. Right knee started hurting after 4 days. Could only walk by keeping the leg straight. Went away as suddenly as it came after 4 days.

                                                At this point I am going to give you an account of my past 14 months health and how I know it is related to the covid virus.   i am sure i have had long covid  from december 2019 or january 2020 to the present based on symptoms i incurred on these dates. On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven&#39;t&#39; vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.

It was discovered he did not get his second Moderna Vaccine and it was beyond 42 days. since he had the vaccine. His first Moderna Vaccine was given on 2/11/21. On 3/30/21 the second dose of the Moderna Vaccine was given here at hospital. He began to have symptoms that at first seemed like a  normal but severe reaction to the vaccine including, fever and myalgias.  His labs showed neutropenia. He tested positive for COVID-19 on 4/3. It was determined he had Covid-19.   While this is not truly a reaction to or caused by the second vaccine we considered this was good information to make known. Patient who had one dose of Moderna vaccine contracted Covid. His symptoms are mild and he is improving. He has several comorbidities that put him at risk. We moved him to  an isolation negative pressure room and we continue to monitor.

                                                Approximately 20 hours following the injection I was suffering from extreme fatigue and fever.  Slept for twenty hours straight and then felt okay.   Almost five years ago I was diagnosed with spinal stenosis and have been pain free during that period, almost five years.  Following the second Moderna injection I experienced severe pain in my left hip and X-Ray showed acute right-sided low back pain due to spinal stenosis.  It&#39;s interested that the flair up and pain was dormant until the second dose of vaccine was administered.  I assume the vaccine triggered the flair up but it did occur quickly after the second injection.

I went straight to ER. He gave me EKG, and he sent me straight to the Operating Room. 10 minutes after I saw the doctor he started the stint and that&#39;s when the oxygen dropped to 0, They knocked me out completely and I was in surgery and that is all I remember. I had a full blown heart attack on the table, called a widow maker- means the main arteries shut down completely, and my oxygen dropped to 0. The doctor put a stint in. Since then I started taking baby aspirin and brilinta 90 mg - 2x day, both are blood thinners.  I took the 2nd Moderna shot on 5/18/21, which was advised by my doctor to wait 90 -100 day. I didn&#39;t have AE just a little swelling in the arm. I&#39;m recovered from the AE from the 1st Dose, but my arms and legs are still a little. Not able to build up the muscles to were they were.

He did not have any other proceeding illness that might be expected to cause GBS.  I do not necessarily believe the COVID vaccination he received in Jan and Feb caused his GBS.

It was in my left arm and the pain was on the same side of the shot. It was the worst pain that I have ever had. It even went down into my back. I went back to where I got the vaccine and ask the nurse about my pain in my neck and she stated that she had the exact same symptoms. I ask her what did she do and she told me to take some over the counter pain aide. It&#39;s just the side effect. She told me that it will go away. It did go away after 3 days but than it return. The pain would leave but return again and again. The next thing I did, I call Moderna and I got a doctor and I explain to him what happen and he advise me that it is one of the side effect.

                                                Received Moderna vaccine on 05/21/2021.  On 05/23/2021 upon awakening at 6 am both arms at the shoulder joints and upper arm muscles were extremely sore. I had limited movement in both arms although I received injection in left arm only.   The soreness lasted for about 2 weeks and subsided entirely by the time I was to receive my second Injection.  On 06/18/2021 I received my second  Moderna Injection and on 06/19/2021 both of my upper arms ached severely and were immobile. I couldn&#39;t lift a fork to eat or a cup of coffee.  It is now 06/23 and my upper arm muscles and shoulder joints are in excruciating pain and I still have limited movement due to sore muscles and joints. I have a Dr&#39;s. appointment tomorrow to get some relief.

                                                About 4 hours after his vaccine, the injection site starting hurting, but not bad.  He could not sleep on it at night as he felt like he was sleeping on a red hot pocker.  On Saturday he was extremely tired in the afternoon.  Had to come in from yard work as he could not function.  He also had pain in his neck and shoulders.  On Sunday he the feelings were going away, but his muscles started aching.  On Monday he felt really strange, felt like he was in a fog, and his muscles ached.  He could not get relaxed, did his normal Monday chores, laundry and house cleaning.  He then tried to relax but his muscles and nerves were very tense.  He went to bed around 9:30 on Monday, fell asleep and awoke at 2:00 AM and could not go back to sleep his muscles in his arms and legs were in spasm and his arm would jump like a shock reaction and jump off of the mattress, as well as his leg.  It was worse on the left side than the right arm.  This went on every 10-15 minutes for about 3-4 hours.  Around 4:00 AM this morning it eased off to sleep and woke up at 10 and felt better today.  He hasn&#39;t had any more of the seizure type feelings in his arms or legs.  He did speak with Moderna who told him that he was the 4th one with this reaction and to report this to us.

Took my meds at approx 0730 with small glass of water.   From 0800 until 1030 I had frequent visits to the bathroom to urinate. My backpain was more associated with my Kidneys as the frequent urinating was causing mild pain.  After 1030 I had one at aprox 1230 and did not pass any urine until aprox 1830 that evening.  I did hydrate with water during that time.  After 1830 I had no issues.

                                                Call this afternoon regarding safety of in setting of recent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine receipt.     Question related to autoimmune heparin-like thrombotic thrombocytopenia as currently in the news related to J&amp;J vaccine.  Reported incidents that led to FDA pause of J&amp;J vaccine related to arterial events with overt thrombocytopenia and PF4 antibody positive. Limited data available to suggest link to mRNA vaccines at this time but data being collected daily regarding therapies.     Reviewing chart, patient has several risk factors for VTE development (OSA, hx prostate cancer, age, PMR &#43;/- steroids; there is also a mention of unilateral edema in which patient was referred for Doppler but date of this request is unknown to writer so unable to determine if occurred prior to or after vaccine receipt. Also mention of knee pain back to 3/2021 OV with Dr. so unclear if mobility issues although participants in cardiac rehab.     Labs reviewed and mild thrombocytopenia today (148k) and 171k on 10/2020.     Naranjo score 2, suggesting possible correlation but low score overall.     Overall, given presentation and information provided, appears anticoagulation for acute PE is safe. Theoretically would consider enoxaparin 80 mg SQ BID over UFH infusion but defer to medicine.   Additional notes:  2D echo: EF wnl, impaired LV diastolic filling  bilat LE dopplers; negative for DVT  He was transitioned to eliquis RX for PE treatment Discussed AC treatment with on call cardiology, as no stents are in place that I am aware of and the patient denies placement of stents, only CABG in 1995, then stop asa/plavix and continue only with eliquis at this time  Recommend f/u with hematology/oncology in the next 2 weeks for PE management and evaluation  Recommend f/u with Cardiology in the next 2 weeks for further management  AC precautions was reviewed with the patient and his wife prior to discharge and including when to seen medical attention due to increased risk of bleeding events. They both verbalized understanding.

We are reporting this because when we mentioned the stroke to members of our church, there were at least 2 others who knew of someone in my fathers age group who also had a stroke 1 month after their 2nd covid vaccine shot. My father is currently at hospital, and is being moved to Rehab Center today. (April 28, 2021)     On Saturday, April 24th, he woke up with wobbly legs around 3am, accompanied with an odd sensation in one of his arms, and legs. He went on about his day, but felt off. He fell around 2:20pm, I was called by mom. My husband and I arrived about 10 minutes later. He was up, and walking at that point, but his speech was very slurred. We checked his blood levels (159), and went through the stroke symptoms, and drove him to Hospital, where they immediately took him in under stroke protocols. It was determined he had an acute stroke.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding) in a 78-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 014C21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Urostomy, Nephrostomy and Colostomy. Concurrent medical conditions included Lymphoma (stage 4 lymphoma cancer), Renal failure (stage 4 renal failure) and Neuropathy NOS (chemo related neuropathy).    On 23-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain), DYSPNOEA (labored breathing), ASTHENIA (very weak), RASH (got rash on both of his forearms), HEADACHE (headaches), FATIGUE (fatigue) and CHILLS (he had chills). On 27-Apr-2021, the patient experienced NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and DEHYDRATION (he was dehydrated). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MYALGIA (hurting all over). The patient was hospitalized on 28-Apr-2021 due to NEPHROSTOMY. At the time of the report, NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding), DEHYDRATION (he was dehydrated), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain), DYSPNOEA (labored breathing), ASTHENIA (very weak), RASH (got rash on both of his forearms), HEADACHE (headaches), MYALGIA (hurting all over), FATIGUE (fatigue) and CHILLS (he had chills) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. After the patient got the vaccine, he was very fatigue for a few days. He had a lot of arm pain. The doctors noticed that he got rash on both of his forearms. He complained of headaches and it was hurting all over. He was very weak and had chills. He had labored breathing. His nephrostomy was bleeding a lot in the tubes so they had to hospitalize him. He went to hospital on 27-Apr-2021 and was currently in the hospital. He had blood transfusions and he was very dehydrated. He was put on IV saline. He took Eliquis but doctors wanted to stop it because his kidneys were not in good shape.  Company comment: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He explained that he has lung issues from an injury he received as a younger man so he thought it may have been associated with that. I asked him if the pain felt muscular or internal/visceral, he said it felt muscular and noted that it really started after doing his 40 push ups for the morning, but that it has been 2 weeks since his second dose of Moderna covid-19 vaccine. I advised him to try acetaminophen for the pain and to reach out to his doctor if it does not get any better or if it worsens.

                                                Patient received second dose on 3/13/21. In mid-april, patient started experiencing numbness, tingling, parasthesias, and weakness in the lower extremity. This progressed upwards over a period of 2 months with worsening weakness. Due to the symptoms the patient fell and broke his ankle. The patient eventually could no longer walk as the weakness progressed. On MRI the patient was found to have an extensive transverse myelitis and was admitted to the hospital 06/18 for steroid treatment.

Was bedridden for 36 hours .  At about 28 hours upon recommendation from oncologist, took one Benadryl and within 2 hours started to improve.  Took 1 Benadryl every six hours for next 48 hours and was feeling better except for residual whole body weakness.  Would have been helpful to know about Benadryl before hand.  Will take Benadryl 30 minutes prior to getting 2nd shot on March 5.  Thanks.  Hope this information is helpful to others.

Moderna Dose #2:   About 7 hours post-injection I experienced a temperature (101 F peak) and mild chills, a short-term mild headache, mild muscle /joint aches, and an ache at the injection site.  These effects lasted for about 36 hours and then were gone.  I would compare them to a mild 2-day case of the flu.

Over the course of the day I alternated taking Ibuprofen (200mg) and Acetaminophen (500mg) every two hours for eight hours to drive down the temperature.  I also pushed water, and took naps.  I continued this treatment throughout the day of Feb. 19, and once on Saturday, Feb. 20.  I experienced a deep degree of lethargy beginning these days and continuing for several days later.  I did not &#34;feel like my old self&#34; until Friday, Feb. 2, eight days following the vaccination.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM on the 26th of Feb 21. At 11:PM I started to get ready for bed. Felt uneasy...wobbly. Irritating small pain the full length of my spine.  Laid down and attempted to sleep no luck. I checked my pulse...very week and uneven. Missing beats...3-small beats in a row many times. Very erratic. It was like that till 5:AM in the morning. I must have finally fallen to sleep and by the time I got up at 8:30AM...my heart beat was back to normal again. Small muscle pains now but nothing else.

                                                Within 4 hours of vaccination my arm swelled up noticeable, became very stiff and sore and made it painful to move my left arm. By 8:00pm I began to feel weak, tired and poorly. By 11:pm I had developed a fever and aches and pains in most joints and muscles which mimicked flu symptons. During the night I became chilled and found it hard to sleep from all of the discomfort. Most of these symptons were almost gone by the next night except for the swelling, which took another 2 days to go down. I have had no other symptons since then.

This has continued and my hips and muscles hurt when I walk, both of my shoulders hurt and cannot be lifted above the should without a lot of pain. My hands hurt a night along with my arms and knees.  I did not have any of these issues before the 2nd Moderna Covid shot.

                                                About 4 days after the second dose my lymph nodes near the injection site started to hurt. Over the next few days the pain got worse so that I couldn&#39;t lie on that side of my body. The symptoms progressed towards my shoulder and neck and other lymph nodes became painful. The next phase a few days later was red spots and blisters around the injection site on my chest near my neck on my left side. At the present time the blisters have mostly gone away but they&#39;ve been replaced by welts where the red spots were these are swollen and red. All of these symptoms are accompanied by fatigue and muscle pain also around my left shoulder. I have been treating it for the past 3 days with ice and am now taking an antihistamine Benadryl.

His daily back pain with activity is usually a 3 on a scale of 1-10. The pain after the vaccine was so severe he was unable to stand up or sit down without help and he rated his pain with activity as an 8. Today the pain is still an 8 with activity. He has not done any type of unusual activities that would cause the sudden increase in pain. The doctor&#39;s office has been closed due to the holiday and he is going to call the doctor&#39;s office today.

He reports sudden onset of back pain in his thoracolumbar spine which was associated with shortness of breath. He notes the pain was intermittent and sometimes positional but exacerbated with deep inspiration. Due to concern for aforementioned symptoms he presented to his PCP earlier who referred him to the ER. Subsequent workup with CT revealed right sided subsegmental PE. Etiology of PE remains elusive as patient denies recent trauma/immobilization, denies history of prior PE/VTE or coagulopathy

They then suspected the adverse reaction to the vaccine and he was checked out of the hospital.  They told him to take Tylenol.   Told him to FU with his PCP.

Four four weeks after the second Moderna Covid 19 vaccine I gained five pounds a week with no change in diet except I may have eaten less.  Finally, I was wheezing one morning .  I told a friend of mine who is also a retired Doctor.  He checked me over and told me I was retaining water and was carrying at least 15 pounds of water in my legs alone.  i was also carrying excess water in my abdomen. He took me to my doctor, but I was not allowed to be seen until they shove a stick up my nose until I gagged.  After I received the negative results I was allowed to see my doctor.  Should have never told them I wheezed.  Anyway, after seeing me x-rays were ordered and the next day my doctor contacted me.  I am retaining water, IMHO, as a result of the second Mocerna Covid 19 vaccination.    I am now on a water pill.  Weight has come down about 15 pounds in one week.  Only 7 pounds more than what it was when I received the second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  I feel I will be able to shed the rest of the water being retained as a result of the second Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Cordially, patient Wonder if I will be allowed to report this or be stopped as before.

                                                ruptured appendix; Cramps in his lower intestine; Shoulder started getting a little sore; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of APPENDICITIS PERFORATED (ruptured appendix) in an 80-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history was provided by the reporter.  Concomitant products included ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN (E.C.)), SIMVASTATIN, ALLOPURINOL and TOPIRAMATE for an unknown indication.   On 12-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Jan-2021, the patient experienced ARTHRALGIA (Shoulder started getting a little sore). On 13-Jan-2021, the patient experienced GASTROINTESTINAL PAIN (Cramps in his lower intestine). On an unknown date, the patient experienced APPENDICITIS PERFORATED (ruptured appendix) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, APPENDICITIS PERFORATED (ruptured appendix) had resolved and GASTROINTESTINAL PAIN (Cramps in his lower intestine) and ARTHRALGIA (Shoulder started getting a little sore) outcome was unknown.            The patient took Tums antacids which helped for a little while and he took milk on 14-Jan-2021. For ruptured appendix, patient  had surgery in the hospital.  Although a temporal association exists, based on the current available information,  the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine and the pathophysiology of appendicitis, the event of appendicitis perforated is assessed as unlikely related. The  event of gastrointestinal pain is in consistence with the symptoms of appendicitis perforated.  The causality of the event of arthralgia is assessed as possibly related.   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 12-Apr-2021: An event  ruptured appendix was added with treatment information.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exists, based on the current available information,  the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine and the pathophysiology of appendicitis, the event of appendicitis perforated is assessed as unlikely related.

January 22 onward-slight headaches January 26 began having severe chills. These lasted for about 4 days. They were most severe on January 29. Concurrent with chills was the onset of fatigue.  c. January 29-severe pain in hips and shoulders rendering me almost immobile. It was very difficult to get out of bed and to walk. I used a cane for support. Also the onset of diarrhea and loss of appetite. Tried extra strength Tylenol, but it did not help.  Never had a fever, respiratory symptoms, of loss of taste or smell. Had nasal Covid test of February 1 which was negative. Saw Doctor on February 4. He ordered blood tests, one of which was to check potential source of joint pain. The test was negative for that, but showed some lessening of kidney and liver function.  February 8-blood test showed considerable improvement on kidney and liver function. All symptoms except the fatigue have gone away. I did lose about 5 pounds during this reaction period.  The fatigue is improving.

The following day I started feeling like my equilibrium was out of balance. I can not even walk a straight line. The headache and soreness in my shoulder went away but I am still experiencing equilibrium issues.  This is making it hard for me to walk. It feels I have been on ship. I called in to my ARNP this morning; She and I are waiting on a return call from her.

                                                On 02/17/2021, patient received the second dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm. Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

It was an open wound which was sore and really red.  He also had a headache and continued weakness.  02/28/2021, he still had a headache and the arm was sore.  03/01/2021, felt pretty good.

He expressed that the pain started 4 days after his first Moderna Covid19 vaccine on 2/12/21 and has not subsided. He has lost range of motion and expresses that the pain shoots down to his elbow joint. Pain is surrounding the joint, area is not visibly inflamed or red. He reports that vibration massage, heat and Tylenol help. He did not have this problem with his second vaccine on the left shoulder. Could potentially be caused by SIRVA, recommended that the patient takes ibuprofen on top of his current regimen and talk to his PCP.

                                                Patient presents to ER with chest pain that is constant, achy, occasional sharp stabbing, sometimes worse with deep breath and radiates to his back for the last 2-1/2 hours.  He said it started at 10 PM.  He said he has not had anything to eat since about 5 PM and says it does not feel like heartburn. Work-up included a CT angiogram of the thorax which showed findings consistent with pericarditis.  Patient was noted to have diffuse but mild ST elevations on ECG.  Cardiac enzymes remained negative however.  Cardiology was consulted, and the patient was admitted to the hospital where he was started on colchicine and NSAIDs. Serial cardiac enzymes remained negative.  The patient&#39;s chest pain steadily improved, and by last night it had completely resolved.  He does have chronic shoulder pain due to osteoarthritis, and this is at its baseline. The patient will finish a 3-month treatment course with colchicine.  I am discharging him on as needed ibuprofen for breakthrough pain. It should be noted that the patient did have a brief period of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which resolved with 150 mg of amiodarone IV.  The patient has been continuously monitored on telemetry, and atrial fibrillation has not recurred.  After discussion with the patient and his wife, I have elected not to start the patient on aggressive anticoagulation as the period of atrial fibrillation was quite limited and occurred during an acute viral pericarditis episode.  Patient&#39;s CHA 2 DS 2 score is 4.  I recommended that he further discuss this with his primary care provider.  Recommend considering an extended Holter monitor.

Both sides of my wrist hurt. The pain was constant and moving was unbearable. Tried to use heat, cold, and vibrator to relieve the pain. Pain in the morning started as bearable but it would get worse as the day went on.

                                                Patient states that 5 days after getting the vaccine he developed severe diarrhea which has persisted. He has not been able to eat much as every time he eats he has diarrhea, sometimes to the point he can&#39;t make it to the toilet. He has not sought medical attention. Upon arrival for 2nd vaccine dose today he asked to speak with someone and it was noted he had lost 30 lbs in the last 4 weeks. He was advised to contact his regular physician immediately for complete evaluation and told this may or may not be vaccine related. Second dose was held today as precaution and once cleared by regular physician he can call us to get the 2nd dose. Patient did admit to history of &#34;bacterial infection&#34; causing diarrhea many years ago from drinking well water but doesn&#39;t drink well water currently. He also had body aches, headache after vaccine but these resolved and also complained of his hands swelling up like arthritis.

                                                Renal failure; Horrible Headaches; Body ache; A spontaneous report  was received from a consumer concerning an 83-year-old male patient, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and one week later, he had horrible headaches, body ache and hospitalized for kidney problem (Renal failure).  The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Products known to have been used by patient, with in two weeks prior to the event, included apixaban, sitagliptin, carvedilol, furosemide, glipizide.  Patient became COVID positive on 14-DEC-2020 while in the hospital and survived.  On 02-Feb-2021 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09-Feb-2021, approximately one week later, patient had horrible headache and body ache. Patient is better now but he is in the hospital because he has kidney problems (Renal failure) started on 14-Feb-2021. Patient&#39;s wife mentioned in call that this has never happened in past and she already asked MD not to give him the second dose. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was discontinued.  The outcome of the events, he had horrible headaches, body ache, were considered resolved. The outcome of the event hospitalized for kidney problem (Renal failure) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s elderly age and medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure may have been contributory for the event of renal failure.

My doctor looked at it and prescribed Z-pac antibiotic as he thought it might be infected. While the symptoms subsided a bit, they did not go away until after the antibiotic was used up. Since then I have had much loss of strength in both arms while trying to use them reaching above my head. I have to push my left arm up with my right hand to get dishes off the second shelf in the cupboard. The doctor then took blood samples and did a urine analysis but found nothing. He sent me to the ER to have a CT scan of the abdomin and IV fluids. While there they took more blood samples and found nothing. I am also having lower back pains

                                                10 days after my shot both of my shoulders became extremely sore, I could not use my arms with out feeling extreme pain. After about four hours the  pain was reduced enough so that I could continue my daily routine , however the shoulder pain continues. About a week ago my hips began to hurt  when I walk sat and stood up. The pain in hips is about half of what is in shoulder.I have taken Ibuprofen and Extra Strength Tylenol but have no felt any relief.

Left arm became inflamed, colored, pustules, swollen, blackened fingers, swollen knuckles, five days after vaccine.  Three weeks later, right arm did same thing. Patient continues to live with this condition, without pain, some minor itching, but much discomfort and embarrassment for people to see arms. He has seen multiple doctors, including primary care, dermatologist, urologist, cardiac specialist, oncology doctor, been in a rehab facility for two weeks after fall and L-1 fracture, and no one knows what it is, or what caused it. Very frustrating. Suspicious of Covid vaccination. Pt stopped taking amiodarone a couple of months ago, with no change.

                                                Admission Note: ? Weakness - Generalized     Patient reports feeling weak prior to dialysis, but demanded clinic to perform dialysis. Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.

                                                Muscle pull; A spontaneous report was received from a physician, concerning an 84-year-old patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced muscle pull.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medications included blood thinners.  On 31 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Dec 2020, on the same day of vaccine administration, the patient experienced severe pain in the arm, shoulder, and front of his chest into his back. He was taken to the emergency room (ER) where he was diagnosed with a muscle pull and was admitted to the hospital for one night. Treatment for the event included 500mg paracetamol. At the time of the report, the patient was still experiencing symptoms.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome of the event, muscle pull, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Company comment: This case concerns an 84-year-old male patient, who experienced unexpected serious event of muscle pull. The event occurred 1 days after the administration of the first and only dose of the Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273). Based on the known cause for muscle pull which is mostly due to an overstretched or torn muscle, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 administration.

Sunday he had low grade fever, nausea and vomiting, chills, and mild headache. He was feeling bad enough to call squad at 3 pm. The paramedics did evaluation and thought he was just experiencing normal side effects from vaccine and felt no need to transport to hospital so my grandpa decided to stay home and just rest. At 2 am that same night he went into cardiac arrest and was not able to be brought back

Pain in my left knee was strong but less severe than the right. I did not seek treatment, but limited walking, aided by two canes, to necessary movement. By evening the pain seemed to be lessening and through Sunday and Monday continued to diminish.  By Tuesday I was able to walk without noticeable pain.

Patient admitted for mild rhabdomyolysis after a noncardiac syncopal episode that was thought to be related to recent Covid-19 vaccination. Troponin is elevated 0.25, lactate is elevated at 5.5.  BMP shows elevation in glucose and BUN.  PT/INR is elevated.  VBG is unremarkable.  CBC shows a macrocytic hyperchromic anemia.  Patient&#39;s CK came back significant elevated likely indicating rhabdomyolysis. Admitted for cardiology consult. Patient was treated aggressively with IV fluids.  Patient had multiple reevaluations given his history of congestive heart failure. After evaluation- not sure what caused the patient to collapse, but the etiology does not appear to have been cardiac.  The patient thinks it may have been due to a reaction to the COVID vaccine.

                                                Patient presents today with his wife and son. He was recently hospitalized having developed a fever the day after his Covid vaccine 1 with associated confusion and some ataxia. He was admitted to the hospital overnight where an MRI scan suggested no acute change showing only moderate cerebral atrophy and some small vessel occlusive changes. He tested positive for Covid by PCR in the emergency department on 1/22. His oxygen saturation was stable. He did have a fever and describes falling off the toilet because of some generalized leg weakness and uncoordination. He has had some chronic left greater than right upper extremity sensory loss following prior cervical spine stenosis requiring urgent surgery in 3/2019. He has had some chronic left foot drop as well. He reports being somewhat deconditioned having spent some time in bed to the above episode but is now ambulating with a cane at home and has occupational and physical therapy in place. He has been mildly dyspneic on exertion above baseline but attributes this to some deconditioning. He did have an episode of lower dental pain with ambulation in the office that was more than usual though denies associated chest pain or pressure and has had no jaw or shoulder pain with exertion. Review of systems is negative for headache.

                                                UTI; weakness; neck pain; A spontaneous report was received  from a healthcare professional concerning an 85-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced UTI (urinary tract infection), weakness (asthenia) and neck pain.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 26-Jan-2021, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT/BATCH: 029K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and was admitted for two days for UTI, weakness, and neck pain. Treatment for the events was not reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, UTI, weakness and neck pain, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The next morning I began a bike ride and within a few blocks was having sore arms and extreme fatigue.  I went home, took my BP and it was 101/59.  On 3/07 I used a stationary bike at the gym, came home very fatigued and BP was 92/63.  On 3/08 it was 111/61 after I spent 2 hrs or so flying airplanes, my other hobby.  Today I tried a bike ride again, quickly got shoulder, arm and back pain and extreme fatigue--came home and BP was 90/59.  I ate lunch, drank a Coke for caffeine, tried to ride again and it was 104/61 after a short ride.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately 10 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 10:00 pm with severe left hip pain. His left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), and he took 2 ibuprofens then went to bed.   On 10 Jan 2021, he was still in pain with a low grade fever of 98.8 which is 1 to 2 degrees higher than normal for him. He reported using his wife&#39;s walker to ambulate and took 4 ibuprofens which helped his hip.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was still in pain, had a limp, and ran a low fever until the afternoon. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the event, low grade fever, was considered resolved on 11 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), low grade fever and limp, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events of low grade fever, gait disturbance and severe left hip pain are temporally associated with the administration of mRNA-1273 and a causal association cannot be excluded. Fever and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the product.  The event of paralysis is considered unlikely pending additional information.

                                                2 days after receiving the second moderna vaccine my father experienced a stroke. He was transported to the emergency room  medical center where he went thru a procedure to remove a clot in his left side brain. Prior to this vaccine my father was in good health and was very active and still works and owns and operates a restaurant. He has never had any problems like this before the vaccine. One day after the vaccine he was complaining about a pain on the left side of his neck area. He was doing paperwork at approx 7:40pm when he experienced the stroke. I had to call 911.  My father is currently at the medical center recovering from the incident.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Gluten intolerance and Allergy to antibiotic (nitrofurantoin mono-mcr).   On 13-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) .5 milliliter. On 14-May-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to .5 milliliter. On 14-May-2021, the patient experienced FEELING ABNORMAL (brain fog (which came and went)), WEIGHT DECREASED (weight loss (lost 20 lbs)) and ASTHENIA (very little energy). In May 2021, the patient experienced URINARY BLADDER HAEMORRHAGE (bleeding from the bladder/bleeding from his bladder lasted for a couple of weeks sporadically/ passed a blood clot) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (reaction to the nitrofurantoin mono-mcr). The patient was treated with ACETAMINOPHEN at a dose of UNK dosage form and NITROFURANTOIN at a dose of 100 mg, 1 dose. In June 2021, URINARY BLADDER HAEMORRHAGE (bleeding from the bladder/bleeding from his bladder lasted for a couple of weeks sporadically/ passed a blood clot) had resolved. At the time of the report, FEELING ABNORMAL (brain fog (which came and went)), WEIGHT DECREASED (weight loss (lost 20 lbs)), ASTHENIA (very little energy) and ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (reaction to the nitrofurantoin mono-mcr) outcome was unknown.            No relevant concomitant medications were provided. Patient  experienced the events within a week after receiving the second dose of the vaccine. Patient had visited the emergency room (ER) multiple times for the bleeding from the bladder and  tests were done.  It is stated that within a week, the patient experienced bleeding from the bladder, brain fog (which came and went), weight loss, which started shortly after second shot (lost 20 lbs), from start had very little energy (which was sporadic but had improved). This was not on 14-MAY-2021.

It was initially treated as potential gout through the Emergency Room with low dose prednisone burst. Symptoms did not improve and was later given Keflex 500mg PO Q6hr for possible cellulitis in setting of tinea pedis. First dose of vaccine was 29Jan2021.   Patient had second dose of MODERNA COVID-19 vaccine on 26Feb2021. About 48 hours after vaccination, he reported worsened swelling and redness at his left ankle (in setting of improvement since starting antibiotics). The recurrence of redness and swelling started to improve about 6 days later, where he came back to Internal medicine clinic for repeat evaluation.

                                                Got the vaccine,  had no problems at all.  He woke up the next morning on 3/24/21 with extreme pain in his legs, buttocks area, arms, and all muscles for some reason he got quite a bit of pain in his right hand and wrist.  He was spared any pain or discomfort in his left hand which is his dominant hand.  All of his limbs are very sore, and has a difficult time and having the feeling that he could not use a lot of his muscles.  He enjoys walking a couple of miles, bike riding, and push ups and he&#39;s not able to do that anymore and very limited in his mobility since his vaccine.  He now he cannot get in a car due to having difficulty lifting his legs, he has to use his hands to get his legs in the car now.  Getting up and down from a sitting position is also more difficult since the vaccine.  He found that bedrest is not what he needs and has to exercise as much as he can, and waking up in the morning is the worst part of the pain that he has, and a little bit better by moving around, and then it returns to the same in the morning.   He is not able to walk fast or as far as he used to before.  He went to the doctor for his physical and he checked him out and the blood tests which showed no inflammation but otherwise were normal other than some anemia, which they felt came from the vaccine.    Now this has caused depression for himself and his wife as they are not able to do the things that they used to be able to do, camping, vacationing and doing yard work as they used to be able to do before the vaccine.

Acute pulmonary embolism without acute cor pulmonale, unspecified pulmonary embolism type (HCC) 04/22/2021  DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: Patient is a 87 y.o. male with psoriatic arthritis, essential hypertension who presents today with right-sided chest pain.  He reports onset starting yesterday. The pain radiated around to his back into the center of his chest. Thought he had pulled a muscle was having heartburn. Taking a deep breath made the pain worse. He tried Tums but no significant relief. It was not associated with shortness breath. Denied any, lower extremity swelling or calf pain.  Today the pain was acutely worse so presented to the emergency department for evaluation. No prior DVT, PE, no FH of DVT/PE. No weight loss. No recent prolonged trip. On arrival to the emergency department his pulse was noted to be elevated to 120 but otherwise vitals unremarkable.  CT angiogram thorax had significant findings of multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli involving segmental and subsegmental vessels.  There was no evidence of right heart strain.  He was started on heparin drip and transferred to another facility for ongoing care. He was switched to Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, then 5 mg bid for 3 months.  He has not sign of any malignancy, no weigh loss. He received Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/4/21 and 4/1/21. It is conceivable that this PE could be complication of COVID-19 vaccine. He should follow up with PCP in 1 week.              CTA also showed partial visualization of gas fluid collection within the right upper quadrant, likely reflecting a duodenal diverticulum which was present on 8/20/2012 CT abdomen, incompletely assessed. There is a small hiatal hernia. PCP to follow. Discussed with wife, and with daughter over the phone.  Patient discharged home.

He had his cane, tried to use it to stop him as he felt that he was walking faster walking down a road.  He finally could not go any further and fell over on his face, didn&#39;t trip.  He was not knocked out and had no pain at that time.  People were around him walking and saw him fall over and somebody called 9-1-1.  He was taken to the hospital as his ribs were hurting and had CAT scan done that said he was okay.  He told them kiddingly that he had the vaccine, and while he was talking to them said that.  He was discharged within a couple of hours.  He thought about it and realized that maybe there was some coincidence that he fell after receiving the vaccine.  He is still having pain in his ribs and just felt that it was weird that he felt like he was walking downhill when he was not.

                                                My father died, 20 days after his 2nd vaccination. Not sure if it is related to the vaccine, but a sister reported Arthritis pain, 3 times as bad, after the 2nd vaccination and recommended I report this. My father started having severe back pain, 3 days after the second immunization. I took him for an XRay and the hospital said he had Compression Fractures of the vertebrae, but they could not tell if they were new or old, so needed to do an MRI. Said it also looked like he had a Bowel Obstruction, but I told them he had been having normal BM&#39;s up to the previous day. He lived until the 17th of April and never had another BM. They said bring him to the ER. The ER decided to do a CAT Scan, but Dad was not interested in any further treatment. He just wanted to go, so we put him on palliative care and he passed away, 20 days after the 2nd vaccination.

Within a few hours, my left hand began to tingle and my right leg felt stiff. I experienced a loss of balance that made walking difficult.  For the next 24 hours I became very fatigued. But two days after the vaccination, I have begun to regain my strength.

                                                I received a Moderna vaccine injection on January 19, 2021 at approximately 3:15 p.m.  Later that evening at about 7:40 p.m, I was suddenly hit with pain in my back like someone had hit me with a board.  The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.  We would be grateful for any information that might be helpful for us to understand my situation as it relates to others that may have had similar experiences with the Moderna serum.
