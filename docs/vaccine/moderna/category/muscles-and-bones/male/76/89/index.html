At 4AM I went to sleep.  I contactedmy dermatologist.  He suggested the vaccine may have started a Grover&#39;s response.  He asked that I add Zyrtec (over the counter) to my meds.  He asked that I continue hydrating my skin with Vanicream cream.  I folllowed his advice.  The itching stopped on Sunday.  I continued with the Zyrtec but stopped the Gabapintin.   Today, Tuesday, I am having muscle tightening, especially in my legs.

I had a significant fever that lasted for 18 hours. The first night I was unable to sleep because the body soreness and pain would not allow me to get comfortable. I started taking Tylenol shortly after the symptoms started but it did little to mitigate the symptoms during the first 24 hours. By the end  second day following vaccination, symptoms were beginning to subside. On the morning of the third day, I pretty much back to normal.

                                                Had postponed quarterly steroid shot for inflammatory arthritis and stopped Celebrex 500 mg  BID three days prior to shot to maximize response to vaccine. On fourth day following vaccine, woke to terrible arthritis pain in left shoulder and across back and chest. Pain continues to present but helped some by tramadol 50 mg . Not sure if it was vaccine related or if stopping anti-inflamatory meds allowed arthritis pain to resurface. Have scheduled shoulder replacement.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.   On 15JAN2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly (Lot number: 026L20A). On 16JAN2021, the patient noted a start date for Pneumonia.  On 10FEB2021, the patient called the medical information call center and reported, &#34;he is on antibiotics for pneumonia. His 2nd question is can he delay the 2nd dose since he is suffering from pneumonia. Patient was administered 1st dose of vaccine on 15/Jan/2021 in his left non dominant arm. The lot# was provided, but expiration date is unknown. Patient experienced some expected side effects, which he is not concerned about&#34;.  The event(s) were arm swollen, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and tested positive for pneumonia 1 day after receiving the vaccine.  The action taken for Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine was reported by the patient as Tylenol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the events of fatigue, arm swelling, myalgia, muscle weakness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.

                                                Soft tissue infection; Still having problems using his arm; Elbow was huge and swollen, moved up towards the injection site; Rendered elbow immobile; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), concerning himself, a 76 years-old male patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced soft tissue infection, knot under the skin below the elbow which has increased in size (soft tissue swelling), elbow was huge and swollen, moved up towards the injection site (joint swelling), still having problems using his arm (vaccination site movement impairment), area under his elbow was huge and swollen/moved towards injection site (joint swelling), and rendered elbow immobile (joint disorder).  The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications reported were unspecified blood thinners, unknown medications for heart and high blood pressure.  On 27 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown) intramuscular in upper right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The consumer stated that the events started from 30 Jan 2021. He noticed a knot under the skin below his elbow. The patient stated that he rubbed alcohol on the injection site in the spot on his elbow to see if it would help. The next morning, on 31 Jan 2021, the area under his elbow has increased in size, was huge and swollen, rendered elbow muscle. It had moved up towards the injection site and was about five inches long by two-three inches long. The consumer stated that he had met with urgent care via video and they think that it could be in the lymph nodes. The consumer stated that the doctor wrote him a prescription for an antibiotic to treat a soft tissue infection, but he has not picked it up yet. The consumer stated he was still having problems using his arm. Treatment medications included was ibuprofen, acetaminophen, alcohol, ice packs and hot packs.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of events, soft tissue infection, knot under the skin below the elbow which has increased in size, elbow was huge and swollen, moved up towards the injection site, still having problems using his arm, area under his elbow was huge and swollen/moved towards injection site, and rendered elbow immobile were considered as not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                felt like crap; became hot; left hand suddenly started jerking and left hand was having spasms; Vasovagal Syncope, Post Immunization Reaction; became cold; sweaty; sore arm; achy; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 77-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction (syncope vasovagal).  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Starting about 5 or 6 hours after the injection I became extremely tired and that persists through today, 7 days later. At times, I found even a small exertion like walking up a couple of flights of stairs to be exhausting. At times my head felt buzzy, although I haven&#39;t had a fever. At times I also felt fine but then would relapse. My sleep has also been erratic, although not very good normally. Arthritic joints are more painful.

He tried to stand up and then he passed out on the floor for about 10-15 minutes.  He went to sleep and woke up around 5 hours later.  He then tried it again and urinated on himself and he fell down on the floor, passed out without getting up until the morning.   He did call his doctor who was not available, spoke to the nurse and advised to go to the hospital.  He is weak and cannot drive so he did not go to the hospital.  He slept the rest of that day and the following day.  Then when he saw his doctor about 2 days ago, he described his reaction and told to report the reaction and that he would report it himself.  He was advised not to take the 2nd vaccination.  He is no longer having the heavy reaction, his muscles are aching and his vision is  blurred, especially on his back and the shoulder.   His doctor did do blood work at the office visit.

                                                At this point I am going to give you an account of my past 14 months health and how I know it is related to the covid virus.   i am sure i have had long covid  from december 2019 or january 2020 to the present based on symptoms i incurred on these dates. On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven&#39;t&#39; vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.

It was discovered he did not get his second Moderna Vaccine and it was beyond 42 days. since he had the vaccine. His first Moderna Vaccine was given on 2/11/21. On 3/30/21 the second dose of the Moderna Vaccine was given here at hospital. He began to have symptoms that at first seemed like a  normal but severe reaction to the vaccine including, fever and myalgias.  His labs showed neutropenia. He tested positive for COVID-19 on 4/3. It was determined he had Covid-19.   While this is not truly a reaction to or caused by the second vaccine we considered this was good information to make known. Patient who had one dose of Moderna vaccine contracted Covid. His symptoms are mild and he is improving. He has several comorbidities that put him at risk. We moved him to  an isolation negative pressure room and we continue to monitor.

                                                About 4 hours after his vaccine, the injection site starting hurting, but not bad.  He could not sleep on it at night as he felt like he was sleeping on a red hot pocker.  On Saturday he was extremely tired in the afternoon.  Had to come in from yard work as he could not function.  He also had pain in his neck and shoulders.  On Sunday he the feelings were going away, but his muscles started aching.  On Monday he felt really strange, felt like he was in a fog, and his muscles ached.  He could not get relaxed, did his normal Monday chores, laundry and house cleaning.  He then tried to relax but his muscles and nerves were very tense.  He went to bed around 9:30 on Monday, fell asleep and awoke at 2:00 AM and could not go back to sleep his muscles in his arms and legs were in spasm and his arm would jump like a shock reaction and jump off of the mattress, as well as his leg.  It was worse on the left side than the right arm.  This went on every 10-15 minutes for about 3-4 hours.  Around 4:00 AM this morning it eased off to sleep and woke up at 10 and felt better today.  He hasn&#39;t had any more of the seizure type feelings in his arms or legs.  He did speak with Moderna who told him that he was the 4th one with this reaction and to report this to us.

                                                Moderna Dose #1:   The only adverse event was a mild ache in my arm at the injection site.      Moderna Dose #2:   About 7 hours post-injection I experienced a temperature (101 F peak) and mild chills, a short-term mild headache, mild muscle /joint aches, and an ache at the injection site.  These effects lasted for about 36 hours and then were gone.  I would compare them to a mild 2-day case of the flu.

                                                During the early morning hours of Friday, February 19, approximately 12 hours after the vaccination, I awakened to a 102 degree temperature, chills, nausea (triggering dry heaves), strange dreams, and very weak legs.  Over the course of the day I alternated taking Ibuprofen (200mg) and Acetaminophen (500mg) every two hours for eight hours to drive down the temperature.  I also pushed water, and took naps.  I continued this treatment throughout the day of Feb. 19, and once on Saturday, Feb. 20.  I experienced a deep degree of lethargy beginning these days and continuing for several days later.  I did not &#34;feel like my old self&#34; until Friday, Feb. 2, eight days following the vaccination.

Irritating small pain the full length of my spine.  Laid down and attempted to sleep no luck. I checked my pulse...very week and uneven. Missing beats...3-small beats in a row many times. Very erratic. It was like that till 5:AM in the morning. I must have finally fallen to sleep and by the time I got up at 8:30AM...my heart beat was back to normal again. Small muscle pains now but nothing else.

                                                ruptured appendix; Cramps in his lower intestine; Shoulder started getting a little sore; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of APPENDICITIS PERFORATED (ruptured appendix) in an 80-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history was provided by the reporter.  Concomitant products included ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN (E.C.)), SIMVASTATIN, ALLOPURINOL and TOPIRAMATE for an unknown indication.   On 12-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Jan-2021, the patient experienced ARTHRALGIA (Shoulder started getting a little sore). On 13-Jan-2021, the patient experienced GASTROINTESTINAL PAIN (Cramps in his lower intestine). On an unknown date, the patient experienced APPENDICITIS PERFORATED (ruptured appendix) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, APPENDICITIS PERFORATED (ruptured appendix) had resolved and GASTROINTESTINAL PAIN (Cramps in his lower intestine) and ARTHRALGIA (Shoulder started getting a little sore) outcome was unknown.            The patient took Tums antacids which helped for a little while and he took milk on 14-Jan-2021. For ruptured appendix, patient  had surgery in the hospital.  Although a temporal association exists, based on the current available information,  the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine and the pathophysiology of appendicitis, the event of appendicitis perforated is assessed as unlikely related. The  event of gastrointestinal pain is in consistence with the symptoms of appendicitis perforated.  The causality of the event of arthralgia is assessed as possibly related.   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 12-Apr-2021: An event  ruptured appendix was added with treatment information.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exists, based on the current available information,  the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine and the pathophysiology of appendicitis, the event of appendicitis perforated is assessed as unlikely related.

                                                On 02/17/2021, patient received the second dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm. Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

                                                Renal failure; Horrible Headaches; Body ache; A spontaneous report  was received from a consumer concerning an 83-year-old male patient, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and one week later, he had horrible headaches, body ache and hospitalized for kidney problem (Renal failure).  The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Products known to have been used by patient, with in two weeks prior to the event, included apixaban, sitagliptin, carvedilol, furosemide, glipizide.  Patient became COVID positive on 14-DEC-2020 while in the hospital and survived.  On 02-Feb-2021 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09-Feb-2021, approximately one week later, patient had horrible headache and body ache. Patient is better now but he is in the hospital because he has kidney problems (Renal failure) started on 14-Feb-2021. Patient&#39;s wife mentioned in call that this has never happened in past and she already asked MD not to give him the second dose. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was discontinued.  The outcome of the events, he had horrible headaches, body ache, were considered resolved. The outcome of the event hospitalized for kidney problem (Renal failure) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s elderly age and medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure may have been contributory for the event of renal failure.

                                                Admission Note: ? Weakness - Generalized     Patient reports feeling weak prior to dialysis, but demanded clinic to perform dialysis. Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.   REASON FOR ADMISSION/ ADMISSION DIAGNOSES   Sepsis cause unclear

The pain was radiating from the center of my middle chest  outward. It became more painful to breath deeply. At about Noon I began feeling worse all over my body. Joint aches, sensitive skin and just feeling  not well. It is now 1:48 and I feel no better, but no worse. A nurse from the facility, is going to give me and my wife a Covid-19 test momentarily.

                                                Patient presents today with his wife and son. He was recently hospitalized having developed a fever the day after his Covid vaccine 1 with associated confusion and some ataxia. He was admitted to the hospital overnight where an MRI scan suggested no acute change showing only moderate cerebral atrophy and some small vessel occlusive changes. He tested positive for Covid by PCR in the emergency department on 1/22. His oxygen saturation was stable. He did have a fever and describes falling off the toilet because of some generalized leg weakness and uncoordination. He has had some chronic left greater than right upper extremity sensory loss following prior cervical spine stenosis requiring urgent surgery in 3/2019. He has had some chronic left foot drop as well. He reports being somewhat deconditioned having spent some time in bed to the above episode but is now ambulating with a cane at home and has occupational and physical therapy in place. He has been mildly dyspneic on exertion above baseline but attributes this to some deconditioning. He did have an episode of lower dental pain with ambulation in the office that was more than usual though denies associated chest pain or pressure and has had no jaw or shoulder pain with exertion. Review of systems is negative for headache.

                                                UTI; weakness; neck pain; A spontaneous report was received  from a healthcare professional concerning an 85-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced UTI (urinary tract infection), weakness (asthenia) and neck pain.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 26-Jan-2021, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT/BATCH: 029K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and was admitted for two days for UTI, weakness, and neck pain. Treatment for the events was not reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, UTI, weakness and neck pain, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately 10 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 10:00 pm with severe left hip pain. His left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), and he took 2 ibuprofens then went to bed.   On 10 Jan 2021, he was still in pain with a low grade fever of 98.8 which is 1 to 2 degrees higher than normal for him. He reported using his wife&#39;s walker to ambulate and took 4 ibuprofens which helped his hip.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was still in pain, had a limp, and ran a low fever until the afternoon. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the event, low grade fever, was considered resolved on 11 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), low grade fever and limp, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events of low grade fever, gait disturbance and severe left hip pain are temporally associated with the administration of mRNA-1273 and a causal association cannot be excluded. Fever and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the product.  The event of paralysis is considered unlikely pending additional information.

                                                2 days after receiving the second moderna vaccine my father experienced a stroke. He was transported to the emergency room  medical center where he went thru a procedure to remove a clot in his left side brain. Prior to this vaccine my father was in good health and was very active and still works and owns and operates a restaurant. He has never had any problems like this before the vaccine. One day after the vaccine he was complaining about a pain on the left side of his neck area. He was doing paperwork at approx 7:40pm when he experienced the stroke. I had to call 911.  My father is currently at the medical center recovering from the incident.

About 48 hours after vaccination, he reported worsened swelling and redness at his left ankle (in setting of improvement since starting antibiotics). The recurrence of redness and swelling started to improve about 6 days later, where he came back to Internal medicine clinic for repeat evaluation.

Within a few hours, my left hand began to tingle and my right leg felt stiff. I experienced a loss of balance that made walking difficult.  For the next 24 hours I became very fatigued. But two days after the vaccination, I have begun to regain my strength.

                                                I received a Moderna vaccine injection on January 19, 2021 at approximately 3:15 p.m.  Later that evening at about 7:40 p.m, I was suddenly hit with pain in my back like someone had hit me with a board.  The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.  We would be grateful for any information that might be helpful for us to understand my situation as it relates to others that may have had similar experiences with the Moderna serum.

He has been given Gabapentin, Norco, Tramadol, and Tylenol for pain.  He needs ice packs during the day and night.  He cannot sleep in his bed all night.  He has gotten up to sleep in a recliner.
