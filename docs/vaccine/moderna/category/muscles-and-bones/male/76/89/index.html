                                                About 8pm I began t experience total body itching.  At 11pm the itching was too much to allow for sleep.  I took two Gabapintin 300mg.  At 4AM I went to sleep.  I contactedmy dermatologist.  He suggested the vaccine may have started a Grover&#39;s response.  He asked that I add Zyrtec (over the counter) to my meds.  He asked that I continue hydrating my skin with Vanicream cream.  I folllowed his advice.  The itching stopped on Sunday.  I continued with the Zyrtec but stopped the Gabapintin.   Today, Tuesday, I am having muscle tightening, especially in my legs.

                                                I woke in the night on Monday, Feb. 1 to use the bathroom and when I stepped out of bed I felt a sharp pain in the outside ball of my right foot. I thought I had stepped on a needle. I could not step on that side of the foot as I walked without sharp pain. I immediately searched for what might be in my foot and found  nothing.  The pain continued through the night and into the morning.  My shot was in the left shoulder. I have concluded this is a neurological reaction (nerve pain) from the vaccine (Moderna). Never had this pain before.

On fourth day following vaccine, woke to terrible arthritis pain in left shoulder and across back and chest. Pain continues to present but helped some by tramadol 50 mg . Not sure if it was vaccine related or if stopping anti-inflamatory meds allowed arthritis pain to resurface. Have scheduled shoulder replacement.

                                                pneumonia; Tired; Achy; Muscle weakness in left arm; Arm  was swollen; This spontaneous report was received on 10FEB2021 from a consumer which refers to a 76-year-old male patient who received the Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine and experienced injection arm swelling, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.   On 15JAN2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly (Lot number: 026L20A). On 16JAN2021, the patient noted a start date for Pneumonia.  On 10FEB2021, the patient called the medical information call center and reported, &#34;he is on antibiotics for pneumonia. His 2nd question is can he delay the 2nd dose since he is suffering from pneumonia. Patient was administered 1st dose of vaccine on 15/Jan/2021 in his left non dominant arm. The lot# was provided, but expiration date is unknown. Patient experienced some expected side effects, which he is not concerned about&#34;.  The event(s) were arm swollen, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and tested positive for pneumonia 1 day after receiving the vaccine.  The action taken for Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine was reported by the patient as Tylenol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the events of fatigue, arm swelling, myalgia, muscle weakness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.

I usually set thermostat to 68, but got so cold last night i pushed it up to 74 and added a blanket. Around 4:00 I woke up to go to the bathroom. Problems similar to Cirpro. Did not have control over direction I was walking.. Had to rock back and forth to sit up so I could get out of bed. I estimate this was a 3-5 minute ordeal. Drank some Powerade and went back to bed. I had gone to bed just before midnight. Slept till 10:30 because maid was coming at 11. I was totally unstable. When she saw me she immediately made me sit in a recliner. Said my face was pale and my eyes were blood shot. I would have fainted within seconds.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient awoke the morning of March 5th feeling weak, fatigued, and unsteady. He went to his primary care provider 5 days later on the 10th of March, as his symptoms were not improving. He told his PCP there that the past few days he was suffering from unsteady gait, walking around like hes &#34;drunk&#34;, and bouncing off walls. It was thought his symptoms were caused by a low serum potassium value, so he was given a rx for potassium. 3 days later the patient presented to the emergency room where his problems persisted. He was still having trouble keeping balance when he walked around. One of the providers treating him reached out to neurology, who recommended that the patient be started on high dose steroids followed by a prednisone taper for tranverse myelitis, The patient was then admitted and treated at Hospital.

By the afternoon, he was so weak he could not lift himself out of the chair. Even with the help of another person, he was too weak to stand. I called for emergency help. He had a fever of 101, was vomiting, very disorientated, confused, could not understand what people were saying to him. At the hospital he continued to feel disorientated, had nausea, dizzyness, a headache, a fever of 104, was dehydrated. He was admitted to hospital and spent one night. Once home, he has begun to regain strength and other symptoms have diminished. Four days after coming home he is feeling stronger and more back to normal.

                                                At this point I am going to give you an account of my past 14 months health and how I know it is related to the covid virus.   i am sure i have had long covid  from december 2019 or january 2020 to the present based on symptoms i incurred on these dates. On my first night I ended up vomiting my guts out at 2:00 in the am. The following 2 weeks I had constant diarrhea.  At the end of those 2 weeks,  i ended up in emergency room. And this all happening when  i haven&#39;t&#39; vomited in over 30 years.  vital signs and blood work were good at the hospital and the drs were confused as to why i felt so bad. i returned home the next day where our permanent home is,  and 3 months later the covid thing surfaced. at first being thought of as a respiratory disease. then in the past months it is surfacing that it may now be considered a gastrointestinal disease that progresses to a respiratory disease. after checking the five main symptoms of long covid i discovered that i have at least 3 of the 5  common symptoms for this. Those being extreme fatigue, joint pain, and cough. In addition to the long covid symptoms, I have encountered tasting issues on and off again.  I have had many discussions with my primary care doctor, and no results or conclusive information came from my inquiries. Then on feb 12, 2021 I got my first moderna shot. About 2-3 weeks later I encountered a sharp pain in a muscle in my neck left side. Shortly thereafter I got very light headed. Then another  week later while  driving a motor home, I encountered a frightening experience with my eyes, and the neck pain and soreness was still there. My vision was very blurred and I was seeing double vision at different angles. I ended up at the medical center and was admitted for 4 days. Before I was admitted, I saw a local ophthalmologist here and he diagnosed me with a condition known as ?edema in optic nerve, inferior, consistent with optic nephropathy?. The symptom I had to get me to the doctor was I was losing eyesight in my left eye. After hd steroid treatment for 4 days, and a plethora of tests, including spinal tap, multiple mri?s, and probably over 20 blood tests (11 at one draw), I was released 3-18-2021 and still can?t see above the equator line of my left eye. And I also am extremely sensitive to light. I also have sensitivity inside my eye as best described as a soreness, especially when I try to look upwards. I have a follow up appt with the ophthalmologists that I first saw that advised me to get to the hospital. And that is on mar 26th 2021.  to mention another point of interest, my granddaughters boyfriends mother is a charge nurse at the emergency ward at the hospital, and she has said that they also have recently encountered emergency patients, who have recently received moderna, and are also having issues with eye problems. What problems in particular, I haven?t a clue at this time.  This is at the very least, extremely alarming to me, and I have no idea whether I may completely lose all function of my left eye., or not. But I adamantly feel this should be investigated by the cdc and any and all other agencies that should be involved.  I would be willing to have further discussions via phone or whatever to help you out with an investigation.

Rolled out of bed, could not stand up or hardly walk to the bathroom.  Felt very faint, had to hold onto wall.  Was very sweaty, running temperature, cold sweats.  Just kept getting worse and thought about going to the ER and then decided to put it off until talking to somebody.  Called 2-1-1 and the lady told her that it was part of the side-effects to it.  She told her to call her doctor, and they were not in on the weekend.  This morning, the doctor called and asked if she had Corona, his other doctor retired and got this one the first of January.  Took 3 months to recover from the COVID and was on antibiotics, and told her because he have antibodies.  Feeling better, still having some achiness.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

He did not have the core strength to even help him sit up. Sometime after he was assisted back on the couch around 4:30 am  he must of got back up and attempted to go to restroom because he was found on the floor with his arm and face resting on the love seat which looked as if he was trying to pull himself up. His wife found him in the morning around 11:00 am and he had been died for some time according to EMS. His death was unexpected. Even when contacting his doctors they were confused as to why he had passed away.  No autopsy was done but as of this moment he has not been cremated yet and is at Funeral Home.

                                                Currently waiting for dental work (crown removal and replacement to treat cavity).    2/18/21 Started to experience toothache (R) which got worse as the day progressed.  Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

                                                Patient is an 79 year old male who had his 2nd Moderna vaccination in his dominant right arm Thursday afternoon.  Upon awakening Friday morning, he had difficulty walking.  His legs were strong enough to hold him, but he was unstable.  He also had some numbness on the palmar surfaces of some index and middle fingers of his left hand.  His speech was somewhat garbled, but when his wife would encourage him to repeat himself, he could enunciate more clearly.  He had some nonspecific difficulty swallowing.  He attributed this all to adverse reaction to the vaccination, which would pass...  Friday mid day his wife took him to the barber, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  Later in the day on Friday they went for car ride, and on return home he was briefly nauseated and vomited.  He had no other episodes of nausea.  He had no fevers or chills.  He had no visual disturbances.  He had no other numbness or paresthesias.  He was aware of no clear weakness.  Finally today, the gait instability persisted and the numbness in the left hand, so he came to the ER for evaluation.   Patient is currently recovering in the hospital

On the evening of 06 Jan 2021, hours after vaccination, the patient began feeling chills and discomfort. Overnight he began to experience night sweats and did not sleep at all.   During the night on 07 Jan 2021, the patient experienced night sweats and had delirium. When he tried to get out of bed, he collapsed. No treatment information was provided.   On 11 Jan 2021 and 12 Jan 2021, the patient began to feel better. He no longer had night sweats or delirium. He returned to his exercise routine at about 50 percent of what he normally did although he continued to feel weak.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided, although the patient reported he was not sure if he would take the second dose.  The outcome for the events, night sweats and delirium, was considered resolved. The outcome for the events, chills, discomfort, did not sleep at all, and collapsed, was considered resolving. The event, weak, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the events, chills, discomfort, night sweats, did not sleep at all, delirium, collapsed, and weak, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine due to feeling well before the vaccine and feeling more or less disabled after receiving it.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 80-year-old, male subject with medical history of type II diabetes and diabetic neuropathy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of delirium and non-serious unexpected event of asthenia, discomfort, insomnia, fall, and night sweats, and non-serious expected event of chills. The event of discomfort, insomnia, chills and night sweats occurred 1 day; the event of delirium, and fall occurred 2 days and asthenia occurred 6 days after mRNA-1273 administration.  The subject was on metformin for diabetes ty II and gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy, Lasix and spironolactone for heart failure, omeprazole for acid reflux and Flomax for urinary retention. Treatment details not provided. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Someone watched him, concerned, because he was walking very slowly (normally has a slow gait because of leg braces and toe amputations so I don&#39;t know if it was unusually slow).  The woman saw him fall and she ran to help-administered CPR immediately-and told me he died instantly. Medics tried to resuscitate and failed to bring a pulse.  (My husband left our home around 11:15 to drop a package off at store. The store is one mile from our home. At around 12:30 a deputy came to my door and when I saw him my knees buckled.  I knew something horrible happened.

                                                On 02/17/2021, patient received the second dose of COVID-19 Moderna vaccine in the left arm. Approximately 3 days post-administration, patient developed pain, swelling and erythema of the shoulder extending to the posterior/proximal anterior sections of the arm. Patient was unable to move arm due to swelling and presented to the Medical Center Emergency Department on 02/22/2021. A CT of the extremities revealed cellulitis, myositis, and possible fasciitis without abscesses. Subsequent MRI found myositis and cellulitis without evidence of osteomyelitis. Patient began to develop erthematous blotches and an Infectious disease consult was placed. Patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and clindamycin). After cultures were obtained, patient was de-escalated to ceftriaxone. Two sets of blood cultures taken prior to antibiotics and a left arm swab showed no growth (finalized). On 02/26/2021 patient underwent incision and debridement of left arm with findings of edematous soft tissue without abscess or necrosis. On 02/28/2021 all antibiotics were discontinued per Infectious Disease provider due to lack of concern for infection.

At lunch time she made him eat something and he fell sleep again. His wife was hanging around him all day and around 7:30pm she realized that he was cold, and his neck was sweating, she couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat.

                                                Stroke.  I do not know if the vaccine was related or not, but the patient had a stroke and falls on 2/17/2021 and 2/18/2021 and was found to have two strokes.  He does have atrial fibrillation, but with the proximity to the second vaccine, I cannot tell if they are just related temporally or if there is a true risk.  Another patient at this facility had a stroke within same time frame post second Moderna vaccine, but not my patient, so I do not know if that was reported.  Due to new nature of this vaccine, I felt it important to report this event for further investigation.   Again, I am not sure if it is a true adverse reaction of the vaccine or not.

Patient became COVID positive on 14-DEC-2020 while in the hospital and survived.  On 02-Feb-2021 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09-Feb-2021, approximately one week later, patient had horrible headache and body ache. Patient is better now but he is in the hospital because he has kidney problems (Renal failure) started on 14-Feb-2021. Patient&#39;s wife mentioned in call that this has never happened in past and she already asked MD not to give him the second dose. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was discontinued.  The outcome of the events, he had horrible headaches, body ache, were considered resolved. The outcome of the event hospitalized for kidney problem (Renal failure) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s elderly age and medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure may have been contributory for the event of renal failure.

                                                Admission Note: ? Weakness - Generalized     Patient reports feeling weak prior to dialysis, but demanded clinic to perform dialysis. Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.   REASON FOR ADMISSION/ ADMISSION DIAGNOSES   Sepsis cause unclear

                                                I am a four-year resident of facility and have never experienced a serious illness or traumatic injury in all of my adult life (I turn 86 this year). So on January 23rd I received my initial shot of the Moderna vaccine, for which I experienced no reaction, whatsoever. One month later I returned to hospital for my Moderna Booster shot on Saturday, February 20. I felt a few chills that evening, with nothing to speak about, but awoke on Sunday morning feeling so ill that I could barely sit up in bed. I borrowed my wife?s walker and managed to make it to and from the bathroom, and got back to bed again, whereupon I called my son, an emergency-room physician, who told me to take two Advil tablets (or its equivalent), and welcomed me to the club. I stayed in bed through the rest of Sunday and continued to sleep and rest throughout Monday morning, only feeling well enough to get out of bed without assistance by noon on Monday, thereby missing the February meeting of the monthly meeting that had been scheduled for that morning (and for which I had regularly been a member of and had attended every meeting for over three years). My personal takeaway from all this was that ?the cure was worse than the disease.?

                                                UTI; weakness; neck pain; A spontaneous report was received  from a healthcare professional concerning an 85-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced UTI (urinary tract infection), weakness (asthenia) and neck pain.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 26-Jan-2021, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (LOT/BATCH: 029K20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and was admitted for two days for UTI, weakness, and neck pain. Treatment for the events was not reported.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, UTI, weakness and neck pain, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On 09 Jan 2021, approximately 10 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 10:00 pm with severe left hip pain. His left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), and he took 2 ibuprofens then went to bed.   On 10 Jan 2021, he was still in pain with a low grade fever of 98.8 which is 1 to 2 degrees higher than normal for him. He reported using his wife&#39;s walker to ambulate and took 4 ibuprofens which helped his hip.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was still in pain, had a limp, and ran a low fever until the afternoon. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the event, low grade fever, was considered resolved on 11 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), low grade fever and limp, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events of low grade fever, gait disturbance and severe left hip pain are temporally associated with the administration of mRNA-1273 and a causal association cannot be excluded. Fever and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the product.  The event of paralysis is considered unlikely pending additional information.

He was transported to the emergency room  medical center where he went thru a procedure to remove a clot in his left side brain. Prior to this vaccine my father was in good health and was very active and still works and owns and operates a restaurant. He has never had any problems like this before the vaccine. One day after the vaccine he was complaining about a pain on the left side of his neck area. He was doing paperwork at approx 7:40pm when he experienced the stroke. I had to call 911.  My father is currently at the medical center recovering from the incident.

I took pepcid, gas pills and additional blood pressure pill but had no relief. After EMS visit I took Tylenol and was up for hours before finally falling asleep. Awoke this morning with no cramping but still very tender in abdominal area. Additionally I had a muscle cramp in my upper thigh this morning

                                                The day after vaccine 01/14/2021, he had no strength once so ever in his body. We had to have help from a man and a women to help get him on the toilet, off the toilet, to sit him up on the couch, getting in and out of bed. He could not function on his own. It effected him mentally. Right now he couldn&#39;t even that this happened. On the 15th he seemed normal. But now like a week later his memory and strength was bad. Today he is not that bad. It seems to be coming and going with the problem mentally. I took him to the doctor today.

He has begun to have mild memory changes after suspected COVID illness (covid testing negative) in November, but daughter of patient, with whom he lives, states that his memory and orientation now significantly changed- he seems to have forgotten the last &#34;3 years&#34; of memory.  Presented to ER 1/16/21 as she checked his O2 and found him to be hypoxic in 60s. He is being treated for possible CAP with underlying perviously undiagnosed ILD vs post-covid lung changes (per pulmonology), and his energy and ability to walk have returned but memory is significantly impaired, confabulating and oriented only to self despite good oxygenation on 5L O2 by NC.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  About 8-10 hours after my wife and I first noticed that my left (vaccinated) arm was sore. Within a few hours, my left hand began to tingle and my right leg felt stiff. I experienced a loss of balance that made walking difficult.  For the next 24 hours I became very fatigued. But two days after the vaccination, I have begun to regain my strength.

                                                I did have and still have soreness of shoulder where I got the injection. That I can expect to stay. When I woke up at 1:00 am my lips and my tongue were in lots of trouble. Its hard to describe, somewhere between numbness and whatever. They sent an ambulance, they looked at it and had me move my tongue and said the area wasn&#39;t swollen so they said it would be ok sooner or later. The second day that was a little bit improved but even until now my lips are not normal. By the second day i was having a swallowing problem, the back of my throat feels like the top of my throat. Even when I swallow saliva its not good. But i am still able to eat. So lips and throat are still a problem. When I went to get the shot I was quite able to walk but not long distance. By the second day i began to have a problem in my back, I assume just muscular unless something is wrong in the vertebrate. I can barely walk now, I just shuffle one foot ahead of the other. At any moment if I move I just collapse. I&#39;m always using a cane and always have something to hold on to because I don&#39;t know the next minute I&#39;m going to go down, it is very bad.
