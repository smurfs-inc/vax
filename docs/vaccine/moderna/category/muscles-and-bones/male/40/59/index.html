Patient reports prior anaphylaxis with shortness of breath and tight airways, difficulty speaking and swallowing, and relationship to coconut ingestion few years prior.  No other known food/nut reactions.   Patient is a CNA for care at home.  Last Covid test was 2 weeks ago which was negative.  She reports she has been tested every 2 weeks routinely.    Review of Systems   Cardiovascular: Negative for chest pain and palpitations.  Gastrointestinal: Positive for abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea. Negative for vomiting.  Musculoskeletal: Positive for myalgias. Negative for arthralgias, back pain and neck pain.  Neurological: Positive for headaches. Negative for dizziness, weakness and numbness.   Physical Exam BP 126/73  | Pulse 120  | Temp 37.1 °C (98.8 °F)  | Resp 18  | Ht 1.575 m (5&#39; 2&#34;)  | Wt 68 kg (150 lb)  | SpO2 100%  | BMI 27.44 kg/m²    ED Course as of Dec 30 2340 Wed Dec 30, 2020 2128 Reevaluation: Nausea improved.  Abdominal cramping resolved.  No further diarrhea or vomiting.  Still complains of headache and muscle cramping through her upper shoulders and arm.  Will remedicate with steroid and acetaminophen  2258 Reevaluation: Patient improved.  Pain/myalgias improved.  Headache now mild and dull.  Continues with no further.nausea vomiting or diarrhea.  She would like to try fluids at this time.  Assuming toleration we will plan on discharge home.  2326 Reevaluation: Patient feels improved.  Headache essentially gone.  Taking p.o. fluids well.  Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

By 6:00 AM the chills were intense, weakness, having less coordination and depth perception issue.  Closer to 9:00-10:00 AM felt like he had the flu 10 times worse than he should have.  Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

                                                A little less than 3 hours after getting the shot, I noticed the injection site was getting very sore. Within about a half hour of first noticing it, that entire muscle was aching a lot. It?s now 4:50pm and it hurts to lift my arm, reach for anything, I can even feel it just by typing this out. I?ve also noticed I?m pretty tired, my joints feel very achey like when I have a cold, and I?m incredibly thirsty. The pain in the muscle at injection site is by far the worst symptom though. It?s extremely painful. I did not expect that since it didn?t hurt when getting the actual shot. Took my temp and it?s normal. The aching joints are far less painful than my arm, but are an issue nonetheless. Had I known this would happen beforehand, I would still get the shot, so as long as it doesn?t get a lot worse or something else haplens, all in all I?d have to say it was worth it.

                                                Initial symptoms of the first shot included injection site pain, neck soreness, and severe headache that would come and go.    The next day I was so exhausted I couldn&#39;t work for 2 days.  I barely got out of bed until about 40 hours after the shot where I was able to get out and do some gardening.   The reason I am filling this out was at right around 72 hours after the vaccine, I was laying down watching a YouTube video feeling quite relaxed.  I then experienced a tachycardia event where my heart rate went up to 120 and stayed there for about an hour.  I remained calm and was not experiencing anxiety, but the heart rate persisted.  I have had this happen before in panic attacks, but it&#39;s quite rare and I am in acute, high level stress.    Almost 2 weeks later to the day, I had another tachycardia, stronger than any I&#39;ve had my entire life that only lasted about 7 seconds, but I would estimate my heart rate jumped to over 250.   I thought I was going to go into cardiac arrest it was so jarring.  I&#39;m not sure if that one was related to the vaccine.

                                                The differences started out with a sore arm that occurred the same day as my 2nd dose which occurred the next day after my 1st dose. The morning after my 2nd dose I awoke around 8AM to a 102.1 F temperature and then took 2 extra strength Tylenol (500mg) around 8:15 AM. I felt very groggy, tired, and still had the sore arm. I felt hot and cold spells over the next 6 hour time period. I measured my temperature around 12:30 PM and it was 99.5 F, and I later took another dose of 2 Tylenol (500mg) around 2:10 PM. I was still feeling groggy and tired but the hot and cold fluctuations seemed to be abated. Around 9PM I measured my temperature again and it had  risen to 101.5F, so I took a shower then took two 200mg Advil/Ibuprophen and went to bed around 9:45 Pm . I awoke around 1AM that same night (03/25/21) and was sweating profusely in bed but was too tired to get up. I laid back down and went back too sleep. I awoke that morning around 7:50 AM feeling very sore in my muscles but no additional symptoms. My temperature was measured at 98.3F and I felt back to my normal self. No additional symptoms have presented afterwards.

                                                I began feeling soreness at the injection site started within 12 hours of receiving the vax.  The soreness progressively became worse over the next 7-9 days and was accompanied by swelling of the muscle around the injection site (peaking at about 7 days post-injection). The discomfort at times extended down my arm, but never past my elbow.  When extending my arm outwards (e.g., when reaching for something), I would feel an unusual stiffness and moderate discomfort in my arm.  As of April 12 (13 days post-vax), the swelling is largely gone, but there is still some discomfort when extending my arm outwards.  In addition, there appear to be dry patches of skin between the injection site and my armpit.  I have not sought medical treatment for these adverse reactions to date, nor do I anticipate needing to unless the discomfort becomes more intense.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

                                                Entire left arm, all the way from shoulder to the fingers swelled up to 1.5 times the normal size. The left index figure and thumb started tingling and became numb. The pain is present in the front and back of the left shoulder as well. Saw a Dr and she told me to take 4 x 200mg Motrin every 6hrs for next 4-5 days. She also gave Tylenol 3. The pain was so acute that I asked my doctor to just chop off my arm. I couldn&#39;t sleep, I couldn&#39;t stand, sit or lay down. It hurt all the time. Lost all strength in the left hand and arm.  Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help with the pain. The swelling went down quite a bit in 3 days. Motrin caused a flare up of Crohn&#39;s.   Saw another Dr 5 days later. She prescribed gebapentin, flexrel, norco, toradol, etc. It&#39;s now been almost 20 days since the injection. The pain has subsided but not completely gone. I am still unable to do much work and it hurts just to sit! I still have pain and still do not have my strength back. I am still unable to go back to work.

It got better after some stretching Ice and anti inflammatory I also noticed I could not press any weight over my head and my right scapula was winging then the pain came back about four days later. The pain was so bad I went to urgent care and was given muscle relaxers.  The pain went away after a couple days but after giving it several weeks to see if the winging and weakness in my arm went away.  When it didn&#39;t I contacted Orthopedics to have my arm looked at.  The PA and was seen by noticed the scapular winging and believes its due to damage of my long thoracic nerve.

Then on second day after taking the vaccine my left leg and lower back hurts. Since then, I am having left leg and back pain because of which I can&#39;t even stand. I have to lay down or sit all the time. When I stand, my left leg pain increases to extremely high level and starts feeling numbness on the feet.

                                                I had what I thought was &#34;normal&#34; pain at the injection site (left shoulder) initially however the pain spread from the injection site downward to my mid triceps by Saturday to Sunday afternoon. By Sunday night my shoulder mobility began to diminish (lifting the arm enough to comfortably shower was challenging). By Monday my shoulder and elbow radiated with pain originating at the injection site. By Monday afternoon I had lost virtually all mobility and strength in shoulder such that I could not raise my arm high enough to wash my left arm/hand enough to wash my hands in a kitchen sink/bathroom (which has NEVER been an issue). Since Monday, any activity that innervates the left shoulder to generate movement results in debilitating pain. By Tuesday the pain, immobility, and strengthless-ness had spread gradually to my left pectoral muscle, my left rear deltoids, my left elbow, my left forearm and slightly into my left pinky and ring fingers. Wednesday (today) all the symptoms from Tuesday are still present with the added symptom that maintaining proper posture through my left shoulder is also painful so now I&#39;m hunching on my left side.

I couldnt get out of bed: 1) Extreme heart palpitations, my heart rate monitor was reading an extremely high stress activity for 2 days post shot. 2) Very Hot and Very Cold body chill and temp swings 3) Sweating profusely, I soaked through my pajamas on 3 different occasions when I woke up from napping. 4) My pee was orange and hurt to pee. 5) My entire body hurt the worst I&#39;ve ever felt 6) All my joints were super painful, it hurt to walk and I couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain. 7) I had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had.

PCP suspected lymphatic bacterial infection &amp; prescribed Keflex 500mg t.id. for 10 days. After 10 days condition had not changed. I experienced no pain throughout the entire event, only felt tightness in skin on calf from swelling.   Bilateral ultrasound performed &amp; results negative for DVT in both legs. Final Dx is Superficial Thrombophlebitis. Treatment plan is to elevate affected left leg &amp; apply warm compress when possible &amp; wear compression stockings when standing for extended periods.

He stated in the informed consent form that he felt really dizzy on his 1st Moderna vaccine.  I administered his 2nd vaccine and told him to wait in front of the pharmacy for 30 minutes.  Approximately 30 minutes later one of the pharmacy technicians stated that the patient did not look like he was feeling well.  I imediately went out as asked how the patient felt, and he stated that he was feeling really dizzy, had fatigue land a little tingley with a mild headache, nausea and some muscle aches.  I offered to get him a wet towel and some water or anything he might like to drink.  He stated he would like some water to drink.  I asked him if he needed someone to come and get him.  He called his mother and she came to pick him up at 6:35pm.  I told him and her we would follow up with the patient tomorrow 5/19/2021 at the earliest possible time.

I was able to sleep until approximately 12:30pm and the only remaining symptoms were mild muscle aches, nausea, and severe dizziness/lightheadedness. Those symptoms remained until waking up at 8:00 Tuesday 5/18. As of 5/18, I have mild dizziness but all other reactions have stopped.

Cannot work.  -Mild shortness of breath  -Mild Chills  The last time I felt this type of pain I ended up in the hospital for 3-4 days with extremely high white cell blood counts.  While I realize the vaccine may have side-effects, I&#39;m also aware I have a weak immune system. So I&#39;m taking extra precautions in the case things get worse.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get better but I&#39;d rather say something and be safe. When I get sick I tend to go down quick and I don&#39;t have any family closeby to rely on in case of an emergency.  I&#39;m completely played out on the floor hoping it will pass.  Not an emergency now but it could turn the other way as it has before.  Sorry for any inconveniences.

                                                Discovered a large rash/hives developed on right shin within 30 minutes of vaccination.  Rash was dark reddish color initially and slightly itchy but not painful.  Generalized joint point (left wrist/arm) and nausea also began within 30 minutes of vaccination.  Went on a run later that day, much more severe fatigue than usual.  Took a couple days off of exercise to rest.  3 days later, went running again and noticed an occasional sharp pain in left knee.  The following day, left knee was in severe pain and was unable to walk normally or flex leg fully.  Very little swelling, but pain was persistent and did not resolve with painkillers (Ibuprofen).  Stopped all running activities indefinitely, and started short walks a couple days later.  After 5 days of walking, left knee blew out with excruciating pain and swelling, like a rheumatoid arthritis flare up (I never had arthritis in my life).  Now I was completely unable to walk more than a few feet without a cane and it was excruciatingly painful.  Took vicodin for pain, but still not fully effective.  Worst pain I&#39;ve ever had in my knees, completely unable to sleep or even lie down.  Any movement was horrible.  After further rest, ice, and elevation, knee swelling slowly subsided but took many weeks to improve.  Pain continued even without swelling, and is still not fully resolved today (over 2 months later).   Left knee flexiblity is still limited and I can only do short walks with mild pain, no running or hiking.  I am effectively disabled at this time.

After tossing and turning all night with no sleep I got up at 5:45 a.m. I woke with a headache that lasted for about an hour and a 1/2 it went away then came back. Also when I was sleeping at night I noticed there was pain under my armpit. When I came home to take a shower I noticed my armpit was swollen In one spot. There is a little pain at the injection site but no swelling no redness.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

Went to bed and woke up with night sweats, aches, chills, fever (persistently over 100F, topped at 101.3F) and one of the worst headaches I?ve ever had (not hyperbole, truly a monster headache). Slept for small stretches of time, maybe 45-60 mins, before waking. Condition worsened until about 6-7am. Chills persisted but worst symptom was the headache, it was inescapable pain. At 9am, took 400mg ibuprofen and was able to fall asleep.  Woke again around 10:30, soaking wet in sweat, but felt much better. Headache about 95% resolved, fever subsided (temp returned to steady 98.2).  Felt generally tired the rest of the day, but overall much better than the overnight period.

About 4-5 hours later my glands leading from the neck to my ears on both sides felt slightly swollen.   It was not painful, but noticeable - sort of how you feel when you can tell a cold is coming on.  My tongue also felt slightly swollen and a little bit of dry mouth.  symptoms disappeared   By the next day.

When I woke up at 5 Am I suffered from severe headache. Remainder of the day I had extreme digestive issues that continued over the next several days. At the conclusion of the second day I developed a fever of 101. Pinpointed severe pain developed at the base of my neck between my shoulder blades. That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

                                                Patient is a 41 y.o. male on no AC/AP with no pmhx reported presents 1/31 PM initially to Hospital for acute onset 10/10 headache refractory to 800mg motrin which started in occipital region then spread to whole head and neck, nausea and vomiting x 3. Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

                                                Delayed reaction occurred 8 hrs. after receiving vaccine. Felt as if I was injected with the Flu, based on the symptoms that arose: chills, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, fever, body aches, weakness, no appetite or desire to hydrate(every single symptom was severe) These symptoms lasted 12 hrs. I chose to go in to work, instead of taking the day off. I truly believe that because I pushed my body through this painful ordeal, it helped me to overcome this Flu-like feeling that I endured for 12 hours: 10 of those at my job. I also experienced a swelling &amp; pain in my right knee. The pain &amp; swelling is finally subsiding as I type this report 4 days after the vaccine.

                                                41yo male with history of HLD, LBP, and tobacco use who presented to care initially at the with chest pain. He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

                                                I received both doses into my left shoulder (4 weeks apart).  Approximately 1 day after receiving my 2nd dose, I noticed that my left arm was becoming increasingly weak and unstable.  I have a history of shoulder dislocations and have had my shoulder surgically repaired in 1997.  Over the course of the next 2-3 days, my shoulder continued to have range of motion issues and felt as if it could dislocate with any ill-advised movements.  I have taken extra precautions to keep my shoulder/arm close to my body to prevent any additional injury.  As of 4/12, (3 days post injection), I still have significant soreness and weakness in the shoulder.

                                                Went to ED 3/30/21  Immediately after receiving the second vaccine 2/25 he developed chest tightness and joint pain. The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

                                                I?ve been vaccinated for 2 months now. My new symptoms just started to really ramp up 3 weeks ago. Of course I had the initial symptoms of being sick for 2 and 1/2 days after my second shot?.but recently it started with leg aches and then it matriculated up into my upper body. My legs have since become less achy per say. Now it?s my upper body and mostly in my shoulders (more in the one I received the shots in), back pain, and general fatigue. Currently still dealing with the upper body ache discomfort, cold hands and feet but I noticed that I have a slight headache always and my vision has became a little blurry in one eye. The headache severity is day to day but what?s interesting now is I?m having ear ringing and sensitivity to sound. Headache seems to emulate from the back of my skull and the crown of my head. The other lingering piece is the fatigue after doing activities. I?m an active guy and recently my body gets really achy after I do anything super strenuous and I get tired. Also feeling a little shaky, some rapid heart rate, and some circulation issues in my legs and arms. Note; never experienced these issues before the Vaccine aside from the normal wear and tear of an active lifestyle.

                                                On 4/17/21 (date of vaccination) I began feeling very tired around 8:30 PM, started getting chills around 9:00 PM, and went to bed around 9:30 PM. On 4/18/21, I woke up around 6:30 AM with severe chills, temperature of 107 (infrared thermometer that is accurate), a severe headache, pain/aching in all joints and throughout my entire body. I used a cold rag to cool down, drank plenty of fluids and got my temperature down to 103 quickly. After taking Tylenol, my temperature came down to my typical 97.4. Throughout the day on Sunday, my headache would not subside (I have had a headache since, and still do), my temperature would climb a few hours after taking Tylenol, and I was awake for roughly 4 hours, total. My joints are still achy, and I now have a post-nasal drip and slight cough. My temperature returned to normal, without medication, by Monday afternoon (4/19/21).

Subsequent lab work showed an elevated white count consistent with an immune system response. At the time of this report patient is awaiting further consultation to review subsequent lab work to either exclude or diagnose patient with a possible autoimmune disorder such as lupus or MS, etc. However, current lab work results, while not conclusive, suggest the likely exclusion of those diagnoses. Upon consultation with my healthcare provider further investigation is suggested. It is unclear if the vaccine is a. the cause of original symptoms, b. if diagnosed with another condition, is the vaccine the cause or c. not related at all to the patient&#39;s illness.

                                                Within about twelve hours, I started noticing hyper sensitivity to my nerves.  Later that evening when I went to sleep and set my AC as normal,  I woke up shivering incredibly hard, and had to turn up the temperature three degrees before I was not shaking HARD.    I see a chiropractor every other day.   I could feel my joint dislocations MUCH more intensely.   My teeth were incredibly sensitive.   My muscles that were recovering from working out were in much more recovery pain than they have ever been.     The first two days were pretty intense.  I used tylenol to calm them down, but still noticed my nerves felt not sensitive, but the feeling I was getting was much more intense.   I wasn&#39;t feeling things I shouldn&#39;t, I was feeling what I expected at what seemed like a multiple of about three.    It reduced slowly over the course of a week.   After a week, I still feel like it is slightly heightened.      My first shot had similar affect, but not as bad.  I want to say it lasted 3-4 days the first time.

The pain is localized around the injection site. It is a extremely sharp pain, it feels like the muscle is dead. The only treatment I have been using is medicated topical pads.

                                                Noticed swollen lymph nodes in armpit 3 days after the 1st Moderna shot. Went for a run to get the body moving and  try and hopefully reduce the swelling. However, this instead resulted in an inflammatory reaction in the toe joints of the left foot (and to a lesser degree in the right foot) that has persisted to the present day of May 16th - almost 2 months. The inflammation may be slowly receding, but exercise rapidly brings it back.

                                                Within 24 hrs of receiving my Covid vaccination in my right shoulder I started to have joint pain there and throughout the rest of my body in other joints like my other shoulder and knees.  The joint pain in all joints except my right injection site shoulder subsided.  Almost a month later I still have significant right shoulder joint pain especially when working out at the gym.  It feels more like a joint pain than a muscle pain.  I have received injections for flu and other vaccines in both shoulders in the past and never had extended joint pain like this. I have been treating the pain with ibuprofen, heat and cold packs periodically and mostly after using it at the gym.  There is a constant pain in the shoulder now that I mostly just deal with during the day.  After the ibuprofen wears off the shoulder starts to hurt again.  I have never had any issues with my right shoulder in my life.

                                                After headaches and fatigue following the shot (within 24 hours) I began to notice slight shortness of breath 3-5 days following. I didn&#39;t give it much thought, but, roughly two weeks after my dose I began to experience severe intercostal pain and sharp pain in the lower lobe of my right lung upon inhalation. I thought this was musculoskeletal at first but after it didn&#39;t abate within days, I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with several distal pulmonary emboli.   Luckily I survived and am currently on blood thinners while trying to determine the cause of this, having no history of blood clots personally or in extended family.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: SUICIDAL IDEATION (pt. reports suicidal thoughts) and FEVER (pt. received 2nd Moderna vaccine approx 1100 yesterday approx 3-4 hours ago developed chills/fever/anxiety/visual hallucinations/generalized body aches) HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: HPI:  Patient is a 41-year-old male who presents to the emergency department from home with his wife for chief complaint of suicidal ideation, anxiety. Nursing noted him to be hyperventilating in triage. Patient states these thoughts started about 4 hours ago after he started feeling unwell.  Patient states that he got his 2nd moderna COVID vaccine at 11:00 a.m. yesterday.  This evening after trying to go to bed he started getting fevers body aches and myalgias.  He took Advil around 8:00 p.m..  After this, he started having increased thoughts of wanting to harm himself.  He states he is having &#34;hallucinations of himself cutting his arms and legs off&#34;.  He called telemedicine who told him he needs to go to the emergency department.  Patient originally did not want to wake his wife up and did not want to go in but he eventually woke his wife and she brought him here.  Patient does have a history of PTSD and depression.  He is on Cymbalta which apparently he has been taking.  He has not been able to see a counselor since the beginning of the year because of his insurance.  He does see physicians through the hospital.  he has never had to be inpatient but has had to come to the ER a few years ago for suicidal ideation. He also tells me that he quit his job yesterday because he doesn&#39;t like seeing people be mean to other people. ED Course as of May 19 0613 Wed May 19, 2021 0339 Patient is a 41-year-old male who presents to the emergency department with suicidal thoughts.  Patient has PTSD.  Suicidal thoughts started about 4 hours ago.  He did get his 2nd moderna COVID vaccine at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and now has a fever and generalized body aches and fatigue.  I do believe this is a normal immune response to the COVID vaccine.  We will give him Toradol.  Patient is very tearful and anxious.  I will give him some Ativan while we are waiting for lab work to return.  Medical social worker will have to evaluate the patient.   0521 MSW is currently talking to the patient.    0611 Medical social worker and wife felt that patient could be discharged home with the safety plan.  He will follow up with the hospital for mental health counseling services.  Patient feels much better after fever subsided.  He will continue to rotate between Motrin and Tylenol.

                                                Friday after the shot was good, just a sore arm. On Saturday I developed a fever of 101 and chills and was very tired. I felt a little better on Saturday night and Sunday morning after some Tylenol 500 mg. My fever would break then come back for a bit  By Sunday afternoon my back began to really hurt. I have some chronic back pain so didn&#39;t think too much of it just tried to massage it and stretch it out. However it just kept getting worse and the pain radiated into my chest around 9:00 PM Sunday night.  It continued to get worse until about midnight, and I  ultimately decided to go to the ER.  The tylenol helped reduce the pain by the time I got into the ER but I went in anyway because I was concerned about the intensity of the chest pain I&#39;d had earlier.  I was tested for heart enzymes and they were slightly elevated, at .12.  On this result, I was admitted to the hospital on suspicion of having suffered a heart attack.  I was put on a heparin drip and my troponin levels were tested every 3 hours.  They continued to rise to a high of .67.  More testing was done, and the cardiology department concluded that I had not suffered a heart attack due to the low troponin levels but that instead I was dealing with heart inflammation.  Every doctor and nurse there commented that there had been other patients coming in with cardiac inflammation from vaccines as well.  Due to my family history of heart issues and my own existing risks, I was moved to the hospital where I was examined in the cath lab via angiogram.  This found no blockages in my arteries, further confirming the cardiology suspicion of cardiac inflammation, and I was given a diagnosis of pericarditis and prescribed colchicine to treat the inflammation.

It affects different parts of my body each day, but the usual targets are my fingers, wrists, knees, and ankles.  Sometimes, it is a pure nerve pain.  Other times, it is paired with swelling, especially in the knees and fingers.  I&#39;ve experienced pain like this in the past, but very infrequently (once every few months at the most).  But the pain has been on a daily basis ever since late-March/early-April and still persists today.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the injection my left arm (injection site arm) became sore.  The soreness ended on January 3rd.  No treatment was needed.    On January 1st I noticed tingling  in both of my legs.   Since then it has gotten worse.  I have tingling in both legs, muscle twitching throughout both legs intermittently, muscle weakness specifically after muscle use, an abnormal skin sensitivity when wearing pants, and a consistent ache throughout my legs.  The symptoms affect me 24 hours a day and create an anxiety that I have not felt before.  It has also adversely affected my sleep.

I hurt for 4 days and spread down my arm and into my ribs.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

On 1/12/2021, upon removing shirt at approximately 4:00 PM, silver dollar sized area of induration , hotness, pain and erythema noted at injection site.  No fever was observed. Contacted ID MD at employer and informed him of the findings.  He advised it could be an immune mediated response vs. cellulitis. Went to Urgent Care site on 1/13/2021 and was dx with cellulitis and was prescribed cephalexin 500 mg PO TID x 10 days.  By 1/16/2021, induration, pain, and erythema has resolved.  Interestingly, injection site is still a bit warmer than the surrounding tissue.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

                                                I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine on January 12, 2021.  I had a headache on the night of Jan 15 so took two Tylenol pills.  I woke up with a worse headache so took two Excedrin Migraine pills in the morning.  At about 10 am I started a 10 mile run, which is not unusually long for me.  I finished before noon and when I urinated , it was almost all blood, which has never happened to me before.  I went to the emergency room.  They gave me IV fluids and took some blood tests.  My creatinine levels were abnormally high but the doctor felt I overexerted myself and was too dehydrated even though the workout was not unusually for me.  On January 18th, I developed a quite painful lump in my left armpit, that lasted about a week.  I saw my primary care physician on Jan 23rd for a follow up.  He thought the lump was a swollen lymph node from the vaccine and was not concerned.  He scheduled blood tests and an ultrasound of my kidneys, all of which came back normal. I received my second vaccine shot on Feb 9th.  I developed a headache that night and have had a headache most of the time since.  I have taken several pills of Excedrin Migraine over these few days.  I also traveled to San Diego on the 10th and did a fairly long and arduous hike up a mountain on the 11th.  Although it was intense, it?s the type of hike I do several times a year and not completely out of the ordinary.  I was also a bit dehydrated again.  I woke early morning on the 12th with another headache so I took two more Excedrin MIgraines and went back to bed.  When I awoke about 6am, I urinated blood again.  I urinated blood for several hours and have finally drank enough water to end the blood urination. I normally work out intensely several times a week and do have bouts of dehydration.  But I have never urinated blood before.  I can?t help but believe it?s no coincidence that the two times in my life I?ve urinated blood have coincided with COVID vaccine shots.  Not sure how my exercises, dehydration, and use of NSAIDs  have contributed but something is going on and it needs to be investigated.

Since this morning around 5:00 am (and after the other symptoms resolved) I have noticed an itchy, reddish rash along the inside and outside of the arm (some in the should bit mostly in the bicept and tricept area) of the arm where I received the shot. The rash is also warm to the touch.

Around 10 days after received vaccine, developed pain around rib case and a rash that resembles mild case of shingles, and that is in same location and with same symptoms as with prior bouts of shingles that I have had over the years.

                                                Woke early one morning to a large painful lump on my right forearm. The lump was painful and felt like it was causing my arm to twist. Some hours later, my entire right arm was covered with large, painful, black and purple bruising. I had never experienced anything like this in my life. I often see blood in my urine, and during this time there was an unusually large amount. I don&#39;t know how to describe the feeling of lumps moving through my body, but I could definitely feel the movement through my arms and legs.

                                                Received the first dose of Moderna vaccine at 11 a.m. March 15. About 8 p.m. March 15 started feeling tired with chills. About midnight March 16 severe chills, restlessness, headache, muscle aches, nauseous and fever of 101.  Took two extra-strength Tylenol. 3 a.m. fever broke with sweats. Headache and body ache remained, as did chills. Took two Advil when I woke up about 7 a.m. on  March 16 for a headache. But I was too tired and achy to get out of bed. The fever came back to 102 degrees. Nauseous, couldn&#39;t eat much. Headache. At 2:30 p.m. on March 16, I felt better...  I was very tired the night of March 16 and still had a minor headache and went to bed about  8 p.m. On March 17, I was back to normal with only a very minor headache and some diahreaha that morning and afternoon.  I did not take any medicine that day. On March 18 I had no symptoms at all. I am a very healthy 42-year-old adult. I would classify my reaction as significant, but not severe. I called in sick to work (and I work from home). So it was enough to take me out of a day.

                                                Wednesday night after gettting the shot, I started getting soreness in my left arm, and both shoulders and neck.  It felt like I had been in a car wreck as I was very sore and by bones had been jarred.  It went away almost exactly 24 hours after the shot around 1:30 pm on Thursday, and I felt fine until Saturday evening around 8:00 pm.  At 8:00 pm, I felt the sudden wave of heat rolling through my entire body.  It felt the same as I have had in the past when experiencing the flu.  My temperature rose and my whole body started to ache, and every moment that went by it got worse.  Around midnight my temperature was 103 degrees and I couldn?t stop writing in pain due to non stop body aches and fever.  At 9 am Sunday, my temperature had fallen to 100 and body aches subsided to only minor, but my headache was massive, and this lasted 3 days.

Symptoms began Saturday, 4/10; pt was helping her mother around her house; was not straining excessively; however, later that day had a sudden burning sensation in her lower-mid back, which has since been recurring in paroxysms.  At times it spreads into the posterior thighs but not into the feet; sometimes also spreads upward into the upper back and just below the chin.  In between attacks, there is no pain or numbness.  There has never been weakness. No urinary/bowel incontinence or saddle anesthesia; sphincter tone was normal.  NIF/FVC normal -60, 2.3L.  Paroxysmal pain controlled w/ 600mg gabapentin q8h since being hospitalized.  There has been no development or progression or symptoms, still only pain and normal neurologic and physical exam.

                                                A few days after the injection, my left wrist started to hurt as if I had sprained it. It hurt to rotate it. It felt like arthritis or something to do with my joints, but only in my left wrist. Then the pain began in my left elbow. More joint pain. Rubbing it helped alleviate the discomfort.  After about 2 weeks, the wrist pain subsided and disappeared. The elbow pain remains at the time of this submission.

He went stiff and started tipping over. I ran in and tried to keep him from falling. I guided him to the wall and down to the floor. His friend who also received the shot, came in to assist me since pt. is pretty big and was dead weight. His friend said this happens several times a day. We sat him up and waited. He then started having a seizure that lasted 3-5 seconds. Then he stated he was seeing black spots and felt weird. I called EMS and the police and EMT&#39;s took him out on a stretcher.

                                                Shortly after the 2nd shot, at the 24hr mark, I felt the normal vaccine symptoms: swelling, joint aches, headache. I got over that in a week. Simultaneously, I had an acute flareup of my gout. I thought it was just joint pain, but when the normal symptoms went away, I realized the joint pain in my legs was still present. I haven&#39;t had a gout flare up in 2 years. The pain was the worse I have ever experienced. Within 5 days, I contacted a doctor. I was given a colchicine prescription. A week later, the gout cleared up. The weird thing is I feel like it is coming and going. It is unusual because when I have a gout attack, it is something that comes and leaves for about a year. Now, the gout is coming and going which is concerning to me because I have been taking care of it and it has been under control for some time now.

Developed  symptoms that lasted all day on June 12th. HORRIBLE Headache, Fever of 100.7. Chills, body aches, stiffneck. Injection site was sore swollen warm and red. Symptoms faded on June 13th leaving me feeling weak. Developed sweats on and off on June 13th. It took 3 days for me to start feeling more like normal. Injection site took a week to get better. I used Advil to help relive symptoms but it did NOT help the headache.

                                                I received the COVID-19 Moderna shot on 1/15/21 and again on 2/12/21.  After receiving the shot I started to experience arm pain in my shoulder area where the shot was given.  I kept expecting this arm pain to subside and go away, as all the media reports have been that the arm pain is not something to worry about and that it will go away in time.  However, the arm pain has not subsided or gone away, in fact, it seems to be getting worse for me over time.  It is hard for me to lift my arm above my head, and I generally feel pain and discomfort in my left arm.  My left arm is certainly still useable to a large degree, so it isn&#39;t like it completely disabled my arm but I can still feel a discomforting feeling or sensation that something in my arm is damaged.  I think the vaccine shot did something bad to my arm because I did not have this pain/sensation prior to the shot.  When I go to put something in the microwave or generally lift my arm upwards like to put something on a shelf or anywhere eye level or above I experience the pain which is a bit of a burning sensation.  I can still lift things and pick up things but my left arm feels weak.  I really think the vaccine screwed up my arm in some manner and I&#39;m concerned it may be permanent because it isn&#39;t going away.  I am going to go talk to my primary care physician about the issue and see if I get can some physical therapy or something and have scheduled a future appointment.  But I thought the government should want to know about this in case I am not the only one experiencing such arm pain after vaccination.

                                                I have no idea if this is even where I should ask or mention this but I can&#39;t find anywhere else to do so. I just wanted to find out if there have been any reports of people having previous ailments exacerbated after getting the vaccine. I&#39;ve had various muscle or tendon issues the last 5 years and every single one of them have progressively gotten worse since the vaccine which seems odd to me. Ive had on and off gum infections in the same spot the last 4 years and I&#39;m now getting them every other week and the periodontist has no clue as to why. My previously partially torn rotator cuff is now bothering me fairly regularly when it was non-existent before. I&#39;ve had throbbing pain in my big toe for decades but it literally happened twice a year maybe and not this is the third bout I&#39;ve had with it in the last 3 months. I&#39;ve had extremely bad neck issues to the point of barely being able to move it. My knee has been an issue for years and it has gotten progressively worse as well. The last one is a wrist issue I&#39;ve had for 5 years and as long as I didn&#39;t bend it back too far was never an issue and now it&#39;s throbbing on and off on certain days and a ton more sensitive. I&#39;m aware I&#39;m 42 and things in the body just get worse as time goes on but having all this happening at the same time out of nowhere just seems a bit off to me. I&#39;ve done a little research on the mrna vaccines but have a very basic understanding of what they do. Just thought I would submit this in case it merits some inquiry about any possible connections. I&#39;m assuming since there&#39;s no going back this is just stuff I&#39;m gonna have to live with, which sucks, but I suppose maybe knowing why would make some sort of difference? I don&#39;t know. Anyways thanks for taking any time to read and possibly consider this. Have a nice day.

                                                Joint Pain, initially started primarily in pinky knuckle on Day 2 and each day progressed to additional knuckles on right hand until I could not make a fist at 4th day. Progressed to left hand and other joints (knees) by 4th day. Use of acetaminophen helped alleviate  pain and permitted more movement.   By day 6,  pain  reduced to no longer need medication. As of Today,  joints are still not back to normal still slightly tight. Injection site was sore for 5 days.

Brain fog became concern at 8 pm. Mild Difficulty navigating grocery store.  Extreme soreness has withstood 3 ibuprofen (x2 doses) and today took 1 hydrocodine in cabinet.  Brain fog has continued and not improved. Moderate forgetting.   Definitely not able to work today (Sunday) and doubt I will be able to work tomorrow. I am private practice dr. and will probably loose substantial income tomorrow. Completely NOT worth it and concerning with the brain fog. I strongly regret the second shot.  No symptoms after 1st shot.  The dose should be immediately reduced for 2nd shot. This strong of an immune response is not necessary.

                                                On Wednesday 1/27 the day after my second dose I felt a minor pinch/discomfort  on my lower leg.  I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.  On 2/5 I was able to physically see my doctor who told me that this was caused by the second dose of the moderne vaccine that I took on 1/26.

The headache lasted until around 10:00 pm CST 2-14-2021.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

I also experienced acute memory loss, I can remember events at 4 PM on day of injection but nothing until the next morning, and I have inflammation and swelling at my left knee, likely pre-patellar bursitis. There is no history of either moderate side effect. There is no obvious explanation (e.g. a fall) that explains the knee bursitis.

In fact it has gotten worse, now my arm feels week, my fingers tingle and the burning sensation radiates to my neck and left ear.  I been to the emergency room, VA clinic, and local clinic and nobody has helped me. Everyone just tells me to take ibuprofen, Tylenol, naproxen, use hot and cold compressions. Nothing has helped, If someone can call me and help me I will really appreciated.

                                                After 24 hours, I started having body aches, that night couldn&#39;t sleep I took Ibuprofen it helped, over the weekend I kept taking Ibuprofen. Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.  Moderna killed my obsession for food.  I was 268 lbs when I presented for the 1st dose of Moderna at the Robeson CRV.  Within 24 hours I was weak, cold, aching all over, and nauseous. The nausea moved over to lack of interest in food.     I&#39;ve struggled with intense craving for food non-stop for 30 years.  The cravings are gone.  By my second shot in March I was down to around 260 lbs.  Twenty days after my second shot, I am down to 252lbs.  Food is more of a necessity now rather than a constant desire.  I believe the vaccine modulated insulin/ghrelin or crossed the blood brain barrier and modulated the incessant dopamine reward signaling in the mesolimbic DA pathway when I eat food.  I reach satiety easily now.  I also have diminished need for Ativan.  I use to drink close to a gallon of water a day.  Now I have no real interest.  I might drink a couple liters a day.  To put things in perspective, before Moderna, I could eat 2 foot long Subway sandwiches, 3-6 cookies, 2-4 32 oz of soda and chips to stop my hunger for 2-3 hours.  2-3 hours later I would feel extremely hungry with a growling stomach. I could then consume 2-3 double cheeseburgers, a 20 piece nugget, 2 parfaits, and a chocolate sundae.  After Moderna, now a half a Subway sandwich and maybe a cookie are enough to last for most of the day.  The desire for food has diminished to necessity to eat and lack of interest in eating, even when my stomach is empty.  If I have a soda or sparkling water, I might have 1 or 2 and stop.  Moderna flipped some hormonal switch in my body.  It&#39;s great.  Food went from being an insatiable desire to a basic necessity.  I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.

Day 10 his legs became weak and numb, day 17 pt reports losing all sensation in legs and losing sensation in his hands and arms. Trouble throwing a ball, using a toothbrush, etc. Pt went to the ED. Pt had a normal CT scan and MRI of brain and neck. Pt stated he recently started having some intermittent issues with swallowing, feeling like there was a lump in the back of his throat. Pt states his PCP is fully aware of all of his symptoms. Pt is scheduled to see a neurologist next week. Pt notes he experienced anaphylaxis to sulfa for the first time this past summer that required the use of an epi pen. Pt states he has a lung issue but otherwise is healthy.

                                                Initial (starting next day) - I began feeling achy, which went away after about one day. For several days I was more tired than usual and &#34;passing out&#34; at night earlier than I normally go to bed.  Concerning event - beginning the evening of 19 FEB 21, I began feeling tired and achy and a fever set in. From 20-27 FEB I regularly had a fever of 102-104 degrees Fahrenheit. I went to the hospital on 21 FEB after over 24 hours with a fever and a heart rate of about 115 bpm with concern of afib. During this period (20-27 FEB) I believe my heart rate did not drop below 90 bpm and was regularly in the range of 110-115 bpm. While sleeping my heart rate was commonly in the high 90s. I did not experience afib. I lost approximately 15 lbs during that week and was unable to eat. Since then I have not been able to eat a full meal based on my eating habits prior to being vaccinated. I have continued to lose weight slowly (1-2 lbs per week), but my weight will fluctuate back up by 1-2 lbs as my bowel movements are infrequent. I am currently only eating about once per day with limited snacking. I use Ensure and my vitamins to avoid concerns of malnutrition.

However, that same day that the left shoulder pain resolved, he started to experience constant tingling paresthesias at the left digits 4-5 and the medial palm/hypothenar eminence. He was recommended physical therapy and went there for 2 weeks then went to occupational therapy who noticed some left hand weakness. He does notice some mild difficulty manipulating left digit 5.

Lots and lots of liquids from day 1; day 4 started taking minimal acetaminophen to ease pain and feelings of fever. Temperature never went above 96degrees.  Small portioned meals to get nutrients, and constant liquids to stay hydrated. This did not relieve any symptoms, until night 7 when pain started to subside. Constant stretching now to release the constricting of all my muscles and tendons over the course of side effects. Still constipated and slight nausea, still weak in strength.

                                                Patient by 5/8/21 was experiencing fever to 103, lower back pain, palpitaitons, headache, nausea, left arm and neck pain and dizziness.  He was taking Advil and Tylenol to assist with symptom managment.  Left arm and neck pain persisted.  On the morning of 5/11/21 he awoke with central chest tightness, left arm/shoulder/neck achiness, nausea and headache. During ride to hospital, he had palpitations for 30 minutes.  He arrived at  Medical Center where he was found to have a positive troponin I of 4.2 (ULN of &lt;0.045).  Echo done at that time showed EF of 59% with basal inferior, anterolateral hyokinesia, basal inferolateral hyokinesia, mid inferolateral hyokinesia, diastolic LV function normal function for age and trace mitral regurgitation.  ECG showed non diagnostic ST elevations in leads II, III, AVF.  The patient was transferred to another Medical Center  for urgent cardiac cath based on resting chest, arm and neck pain, positive troponin and wall motion abnormalities seen on echo.  Cardiac cath found normal coronary arteries that were free of disease.  Troponin I at this medical center was positive 0.31 and 0.39.  Further testing ordered is a cardiac MRI to assess for possible acute myocarditis.

I also experienced a certain mental restlessness and adrenaline rush while feeling physically tired. It went away after 3-4 days. Following the 2nd shot, I started feeling hazy and mentally restless again with physical fatigue the day after the inoculation. A week later, I had really strong stomach cramps with numbness in the entire right shoulder where I got the 2nd inoculation. Mental restlessness and physical fatigue were also common daily,

Had xray but nothing was broken. thought he had sprained ankle.  Given prednisone.  Ankle continued to be swollen for following days so we followed up with family dr. on 3-22  who sent him for ultrasound which showed an extensive blood clot - DVT.   Sent to emergency room.  Put on blood thinner shots for a week and sent to doctor on 3-24.  He did many blood tests.  He started eliquis on 3-30.  Saw doctor again on 4-13.  His blood tests had shown he has Factor 5--Leiden.  On May 11 we saw doctor again.  Remain on Eliquis.  Another ultrasound and more bloodtests show clot is chronic, but blood thinner is doing its job.  No active clotting.

                                                About 45 mins after getting the shot. I experienced a tightening of the face with hives.  It felt like the last time I got a bee sting and found out I was allergic to bees.  My neck musscles where tight but it was not enough for me to take my epi pen  I  slepped until 5-19. only awake for about 6 hours a day. When I normally sleep that much.  Then  on 5-19.  Around noon time I woke up and was able to stay awake. I was experiencing fast heart rates from time to time. Still very tired.  I was drinking about 32 ounces of water an hour.  Then on friday 5-21. The heart issues where very severe and I went to the Emergency room.  They gave me an iv bag of fluid and I felt better but still had minnor heart fast rates from time to time.  I still felt off. and had a follow up with my primary dr.  During the visit he observed high blood preasure of around 144/90.  Currently i am observation phase and purchased a blood pressure monitor. According to the over the counter blood pressure monitor .   I have been as high as 152/106  and slowly over time it has gone down to as low as 79/58. With more of an average currently holding around 122/80. The monitor has detected two irregular hearbeats with bp stat(138/82, 82bp anb 79/58, and bp 76. I will continue to monitor and report these self monitoring finding to my primary DR on 7-6. I left a message today about updates.

                                                The day folowing my first dose of the Moderna Vaccine, I began suffering from pretty severe Left Shoulder pain. I assumed that this was a normal side effect for the first day or two. Unfortunately, while the pain has subsided from what it was in the begining, I continue to have ongoing pain in my Left Shoulder. It makes sleeping on my left side difficult, and I have lost a significant amount of strength in that shoulder. Before the vaccine, I could easily do (10 - 12) push-ups without stopping. Now I can only do 1-2 becasue of the pain and weakness. I reported this condition to the pharmacy Location before receiving my second dose on June 1, 2021. The lady giving me the shot said that what I was experiencing was not common, and that she would report my symptoms and someone would be contacting me. As of 6/28/21, I have not heard from anyone, and the pain persists.

As the morning progressed, started feeling worse.  By 11:00 am, reached peak severity of side effects.  Side effects lasted from 11:00 am till I woke up the next morning.  Woke up feeling fine except shoulder was still a little sore.  Side effects were (listed by order of severity):  fatigue, body aches, feeling spaced-out.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

                                                Severe Headache within 1 hour of vaccination (01/20/21 @1330hours), followed by a slight fever within 6 hours and fatigue. Overnight, I experienced severe chills and body aches, and severe fatigue, which followed the rest of the morning (01/21/21) with general discomfort. By that early afternoon the chills subsided, and I continued to feel body aches with minimal joint pain. By 4 pm, I began to develop an itchy rash on my left wrist under my wristwatch, left hand and on my right forearm. I experience fatigue throughout the rest of the day. I used over the counter Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream to alleviate the itch.  On the Morning of 01/22/23, I woke up to a itchy rash over my torso and my hands. I continued to apply the cream and I took an OTC Benadryl allergy pill, which seems to subside the rash.  On 01/23/21, I woke up the the same  rash over my feet and overall, the rash over my torso and hands had substantially subsided.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medication included escitalopram.  On 04 Feb 2021, on the same day as the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 030L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 04 Feb 2021, a couple of hours after the vaccination, the patient couldn&#39;t feel his arm and he had no range in motion.  He also had pain in his upper shoulder area by his neck.  The reporter thought the administration was done incorrectly but she &#34;wasn&#39;t there to conform 100%.&#34;  At night on 04 Feb 2021 and 05 Feb 2021, the patient had aching in his legs &#34;as if he was getting sick.&#34;  Treatment for the events included ibuprofen which helped, and the patient was feeling better at the time of this report.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, couldn&#39;t feel arm and had no range in motion, pain in upper shoulder area by the neck, and aching in legs as if was getting sick, were considered recovering/resolving at the time of this report.  The event, thinks administration was done incorrectly, was considered recovered/resolved on 04 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44-year-old male who experienced NS unexpected events of hypoaesthesia, joint range of motion decreased, arthralgia, neck pain, product administration error, malaise, and NS expected arthralgia.  The events occurred 1 day after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-012275: US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-012263:

                                                Experienced severe pain in the right shoulder/bicep area, the opposite arm from the injection (injection was given in the left arm). Pain became worse and worse as days went on, and eventually limited what I can use the arm for. I can not raise it up past my rib cage with severe pain. After speaking with a friend who is a doctor, they mentioned Parsonage Turner Syndrome and Brachial neuritis, all the symptoms match the discriptions of those. I immediately started using a Tens unit to help stimulate the shoulder and arm area, began ice treatment and taking tylenol for the pain. The doctor in the office I work at after listening to the issue and symptoms said the same thing and started me on Gabapentin to help with the nerve pain and is going to continue to monitor the symptoms. It has been 46 days since getting the 2nd shot, and I have been at a 8 to a 9 out of 10 pain-wise almost 24/7, it has affected my ability to work and i have had to call in a few days because of the pain and being unable to use my right arm proficiently (I am right handed), it has affected my family and my ability to get things done around the house and engage my children and it has affected my ability to get a good sleep.

One week after vaccine I had blood work done and my liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were.  On 3/23 I admitted myself to ER with jaundice and vomiting.  My liver levels were normal but bilirubin was still high.  At this point I had lost 30 pounds since my shot.   I was in the hospital for 5 days where the ran UT, CT, and MRI on my abdomen with none showing issues.   Jaundice and itchiness/jaundice got progressively worse.   The hospital ran multitude of blood tests to pin point the issue and even did a liver biopsy.  No tests showed anything abnormal but biopsy isn?t back yet.  At this point 4/1/21, I am still jaundiced, extremely itchiness, lethargy and a total of 33 pounds weigh loss.

                                                Experience chest pain on right side of chest near armpit which spread across chest one week after the first vaccine shot given on January 25, 2021.  Pain was going away before the second shot. Received second shot on February 22, 2021 and had the chest pain return, extreme fatigue, headaches, rash at injection site and all over back, achy muscles mainly in upper body, dizzy spells, nausea, and abdominal pain. All these symptoms (minus nausea) continued for three weeks and some are still present (fatigue, chest pain and periodic headaches) after six weeks.   I was tested for antibodies and the results came back greater than 400, which is the max limit for the test.  The doctor has never seen results that high and we have no idea how high my antibodies actually are.   Since my symptoms seem to be slightly improving, the doctor did not recommend further treatment.  However, I am concerned as to any possible danger of antibody levels this high.

About 5 minutes down the road started having stabbing back pain shooting from the middle of the back up and down the spine.  Chest feels like someone bear hugging hard from the back.  Chest tingle and neck pain.  This has been for the day.  I turned around and went home crying because I was and am scared.  Still hurts now and it&#39;s 9pm.  No insurance and the hospital already has me in collections so I can&#39;t go.

Then all of my muscles began to ache badly &amp; by 4 pm I was suffering from on and off chills/ sweating ; this lasted all evening.  I checked my temperature &amp; only once was the temperature above 100F.   I did have some chest pain at times as well.   I drank mint tea, took tylenol at regular intervals &amp; used icy hot on the sore back and neck.    Following morning I&#39;m feeling a little better but still quite a bit of soreness but as of 7 am , the chills/hots have subsided.  I did pee a lot over night; at one point I went to the bathroom about 5-6 times within an hour to 90 minutes.

                                                Fever with distinct bone pain. A year earlier (Jan 2020) I was a bone marrow donor that required a heavy course of Filgrastim in preparation for the donation. As expected, the Filgrastim made me feel sick with a lot of bone soreness and pain, especially in my hips and legs. It lasted a few days after the donation and then was gone. Upon getting my second shot of the Moderna vaccine, the second day brought back the exactly soreness/pain that I felt under the filgrastim with distinct bone pain, especially in my legs/hips.

                                                had pain in left arm at injection site, but expected that. got sick after second dose (which is strange as I got really sick after the first one), that went away after roughly 36 hrs, however the injection site pain had radiated down the left arm. still, just assumed it&#39;d go away, no worries. woke up the second day after shot, with feeling as if id maybe slept funny, as my shoulder on the left arm had a shooting pain thru to my arm, which was numb and tingly, and my hand felt like it was asleep...total pins and needles. shook it, didnt go away. mind you, I&#39;m not a guy who thinks he&#39;s sick all the time, and is constantly at the doctor. I actually don&#39;t have a doctor, nor insurance, but I just usually ride whatever out..but this was becoming more than an annoyance. now its been three weeks or so, and the symptoms have just gotten worse. I&#39;d say I&#39;ve lost about 90% of the strength in my left hand. I can&#39;t make a fist, hold objects, pull up my pants, pick my nose, play my guitar, etc..my hand is never not buzzing with pins and needles, in a semi-claw shape, and its losing circulation as its noticeably purplish. yesterday, I called the urgent care that I use as a doctor if absolutely necessary, as I felt I had to do something. I asked if I could come down, described my symptoms, and they said all they&#39;d do is tell me to go to the ER as it sounded not good..now numbness is going down my left leg and foot is swelling.

                                                Patient  developed episode of diarrhea shortly after 1st shot in series,  this was followed by  lower extremity swelling and mild dyspnea on exertion, that quickly exacerbated after the 2nd shot on 5/15/2021,  that resulted in severe dyspnea on exertion, severe lower extremity swelling with approximately 25 lb weight gain, orthopnea and hemoptysis. Patient reported temperatures of 99.2 F to 99.8 F.   Outside CT chest abdomen pelvis angiogram showed moderate to large acute segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli with trace right heart strain and right lower lobe pulmonary infarction, moderate right pleural effusion, acute splenic vein thrombosis with extension to the proximal portal vein and associated splenic infarcts, bilateral renal infarcts, and evidence of portal hypertension. He was transferred to the Hospital for further management. Upon presentation here he was tachycardic but with stable blood pressures and requiring up to 5 L by nasal cannula. Initial laboratory studies were notable for WBC 21.0, INR 1.8, D-dimer 11653, NT pro-BNP 17684, troponins 603 to 579 to 574, CRP 127. He was started on a heparin infusion. He was admitted to the MICU for further management.   Bedside ultrasound demonstrated reduced biventricular contractility. He was given two doses of 40 mg intravenous furosemide with about 3.5 L of urine output since admission (net negative 3.1 L). His oxygen was weaned to 1 L by nasal cannula. Lower extremity venous and arterial Dopplers were negative.  Subsequent imaging  demonstrated a transperineal inferior infarct with akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior and inferior lateral walls with apical and mid ventricle akinesis secondary to a complete occluded RCA.  moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade noted.  Upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated acute DVT in the lower right IJ, innominate, subclavian and proximal axillary veins.  MRI  venogram was negative for clots, but multiple acute and subacute enhancing infarcts within all 3 vasculature distributions consistent with embolic etiology were noted.  TTE showed of mural thrombus along the septal and inferior walls of the LV apex,  severely enlarged left ventricle with EF of 20%, severe hypokinesis.    Patient was aggressively IV diuresis, with improvement in respiratory status.  Maintained on  high-intensity heparin for pulmonary emboli, DVT, and diffuse arterial and venous thrombosis.  He was bridged to warfarin.  Patient was  prescribed LifeVest for primary prevention. Started on beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor given EF.     Patient planning on discharge 6/5-6/07, outcome pending.

I got dizzy and felt weak at points. I went to the Doctor and it was also determined that I was wheezing when he checked my lungs. He prescribed me a 30 day usage of the Albuterol Sulfate pump to help with the wheezing 3x a day.I saw the doctor January 23rd.3 days after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.

Then severe rash over torso, arms, buttocks, thighs, and back consistent with what I experienced during Lyme Disease this past summer.  Raised itchy rash in large red blotches over most of body.  I didn&#39;t realize it at the time but the same (but less severe) reaction took place after the first Moderna Vaccine shot as well.  I was prescribed Doxycycline by my local Urgent Care and stayed on it for 14 days following the first dose of Moderna.  I didn&#39;t put the two things together immediately because I has gone hunting in the woods and assumed that I was bitten by another tick.  Full body rash is what caused me to go seek attention at the Urgent Care.  The symptoms following the second dose were much more severe and uncomfortable.  The rash subsided in 4-5 days without medication.

                                                Took vaccine in left arm late afternoon on Friday 2/12/21. The initial symptoms were only very painful muscle pain on the injected arm, and some mild body ache and mild chills for 2-3 days but nothing major. On Monday 2/15/21 was feeling very well and had nice workout in the morning , feeling energetic .  However, in the morning on Tuesday 2/16/21, I started having very strong abdominal cramps, feeling bloated, nausea, that was lasting for several hours and increasing in pain . After 5 hours of pain, I asked my wife to take me to Hospital. There I was diagnosed with Appendicitis after a Cat Scan. My appendix was inflamed and I had to go thru surgery that same day .

                                                I was feeling cold throughout the day, at about 9:00 pm I took a shower to try to get warmed up, I just kept getting colder and colder until I was severely shaking uncontrollably. Every muscle was so tense and I was shaking so badly I could barely walk or breathe. I went to the bedroom and got under blankets with a heater and in a few minutes the shaking diminished to where I could start breathing normal again. It took about an hour before my shakiness went away completely but I still needed to stay under the blankets and near the heater as I felt I was still cold and on the verge of getting the severe chills again. I had no fever. Next morning (as I&#39;m writing) I&#39;m still worried about getting out of bed as I still don&#39;t feel right and am scared of getting the chills like that again.

                                                After receiving my shot, I waited the half an hour. I felt a pinch in my head and tightness in shoulders and neck. Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

He was found to have extensive dural venous sinus thrombosis causing the symptoms.  He has hypothyroidism was taking levothyroxine 150 mcg daily at time of vaccination.  On admission on 4/3/2021 his TSH was found to be 12 and levothyroxine dose was increased to 175 mcg on 4/4/2021.  He has no prior history of thrombosis and the only family member with thrombosis is his mother who had DVTs associated with lung cancer.

                                                Other than typical sore arm at injection site, I began to experience massive body tremors and painful chills that started roughly 13 hours after second Moderna dose. The chills were so extreme that my abdomen tightened and caused pain that I could not relax along with jaw tightening and teeth chatter. Once in bed, I experienced severe sweating while trying to stop the chills, then massive chills when removing blankets and extreme all over body aches that caused me to toss and turn all night. I found myself fatigued and sleeping off and on until 5:30 pm (17 hours in bed) the next evening. Chills have since subsided, body aches remained- tiredness remained. Two Tylenol have mostly helped with the body aches, although they are definitely still present, even in my gut.

                                                After first dose I experienced severe L shoulder pain for 2 days. Couldn&#39;t move it well, could not sleep on it. Pain started 4h after injection.  After second dose I started experiencing L shoulder pain after 40 minutes. Pain was so severe I could not put my hand into the packet. In the evening the same day I started running temperature 101F that last 3 days non stop. I started experiencing severe chills, could not stop at times shaking! I was hot and cold every so often. I started experiencing same evening severe body ache which was constant and felt like I was squeezed by some machine. I could not sleep, I felt just terrible,  couldn&#39;t find comfortable position. My heart beat resting was 110 per minute and it stayed like that first night. My normal resting pulse is 60-70 bps. I did not have headaches or nausea. At night everything felt worse. After 3 nights temperature subsided but I was exhausted and my temperature dropped 95.9F my normal temperature is 97.88F. ( 36.6C) . Since April 2nd I have been tired and I want to sleep all the time.

                                                Soon after injection I developed soreness at injection site, and about an hour later it travelled down my arm and to my hand, with also arm stiffness.  On Monday, 4/12/2021 at 12:15am (about 6 hours after injection) I developed chills and body aches.  Throughout the night I also developed a headache, muscle aches, nausea and started sweating.  At 9am (4/12/2021) when I woke up, all the symptoms continued (chills, body aches, muscle aches, arm soreness and stiffness, headache, nausea) and also felt extreme tiredness.  My temperature at 9:15am was 100.4 degrees F.  I basically stayed in bed and slept most of the day.  I got up at 2:30pm to get something to eat and had a temperature of 101 degrees F.  After eating, which made me feel even more nauseous, I went back to bed and continued to sleep.  I woke up at 7:30pm to feed the cats.  I felt the same as I did at 2:30pm--listed above--and was up and about for 20 minutes.  I started to prepare a quick meal and fainted twice (around 8pm) within a minute from each other.  The first time I fell to my knees and the second time I felt onto my back.  I was unconscious for only a few seconds each time.  I went into bed after and placed an ice pack on my forehead.  I took my temperature after the ice pack at 8:15am and my temperature was 101.4 degrees F.   I ate soup around 8:45am and took Tylenol (1000mg) at 9:30am.  I went back to bed and slept all through the night.  This morning (4/13/2021--2 days after injection) I feel much better--only have some slight chills and arm soreness.  My temperature at 9:15am (4/13/21) was 95.7 degrees F.

                                                Noticed a feeling of pressure around bend in arm the day after vaccine.  Took off sweatshirt to find a cause unknown but noticeable spot that was not previously there.  It looks like a small blood clot.  We can provide pictures.  The pain subsided, no tingling or numbness by end of day.  Concern is mostly whether pt should take a second dose with this reaction.  Pt has severe varicose veins in his legs, not sure if its related.

                                                The next day I had a low grade headache, body aches, aching arm and tiredness.  The headache and tiredness got worse over the weekend but the arm got better.  On monday (4/5) while dealing with worse tiredness and headache I got a migraine around 3:30 pm/  tuesday(4/6) the symptoms got worse but the migraine started at about 1:00pm.  Wednesday thru Friday the migraines were so bad i could not attend work or get out of bed without a great amount of effort.  During these three days the pain in my back became more pronounced.  The pain went from the to of my skull to the belt area of my back .  The pain followed the spine mostly and spread out along my belt line.   I saw my primary doctor on Friday (4/9)and received a Toradol shot.  Many blood tests and covid tests were performed and nothing abnormal was found.  The symptoms got a little better for the next two days.  My work has a 10 days from symptoms before being allowed to come back to work so i was home until today.(4/18) I start work again tomorrow(4/19) but i still have extreme tiredenss, aches and headache.

                                                On day five after getting my first shot, I started having bad lower back pain (flu like).  I applied heat locally to relieve my symptoms. On day 7, I noticed a cluster of blisters on my back adjacent to my spine. The blisters rash spread around my waist on my right side and by day 11 I had a positive diagnosis for shingles.

                                                Pt received the vaccine on 4/16/21. Immediately upon administration, the patient felt moderate pain when the needle entered his skin. He said it just didn&#39;t feel right. When he got his first vaccine, he didn&#39;t even notice it. He noted that this second vaccine was given much further down than his first vaccine was given.  He noted that it was given approximately 7-8 cm below the acromion process. His arm was sore that day but it improved after 1 day. Then 7 days later, he had severe pain to his shoulder and upper arm. He woke up and he could not move his arm. He got up and had his son massage it and then after some time, it loosened up and he could move it.  He still has limited range of motion of his arm due to pain, his strength is decreased, the pain radiates down his arm, and the pain is impacting his work and daily activities. The pain is worse with rest.  He describes it as throbbing.

Day 2: All my muscles were in pain from head to toes.  Joint muscles in pain.   Headaches, stick neck.  102 Fever for the next 3 days Throughout the 2 weeks: Stomach pain, Rib cage pain, skin pain (burning like on fire), hives on chest, headaches, sleep issues, zero sex drive  Most of the symptoms cleared by the end of the 2 weeks. Stomach muscles and rib cage muscles for the next 6 weeks were tender.  Sex drive was also zero.  I had no interest in partaking in physical activities such as playing VR games for exercise as my torso was sore.  Finally now, it seems all my symptoms are better.  My sex drive is pretty low, but no longer zero.  I hope that improves.

                                                I broke out with Shingles on the right side of my face and woke up with soreness along with being unable to turn my head from left to right because my neck was very stiff (soar), had high fever of 102 (bumps appeared and the pain worsen). I went to the Doctor and he diagnosed me with Shingles. I was given a medication called Valtrex and also prescribe Gabapentin for nerve pain which I had to take for five weeks.

                                                For my 2nd dose vaccine, the first night I experienced seizures and was trembling a lot; also developed headaches and fatigue. I also displayed symptoms of dizziness and blacked out. I have trouble breathing and I am now diabetic. I have congestive heart failure. I cannot go outside to the heat because I black out. I am on an albuterol treatment due to coughing spasms. My arms also get stiff, and I feel when I black out, I am out for a couple of minutes. They performed lab work, EKG, stress test and I am following up with a cardiologist. My blood pressure went up to 210/178. I have to follow up with my cardiologist in two months to monitor my heart. For my 1st dose vaccine, I had two seizures the same night. I could not breathe and gurgled. I went to see my PCP who placed me on high blood pressure medications. I lost 67 pounds of fluid in my chest. I swelled up so bad that I could not put on my shoes. I did not have these problems before receiving the MODERNA vaccine, dose 1 and dose 2. I also got lab work down and found out I had type II diabetes.

I called patient back a few hours later and patient said he felt better and the chest pain went away. He later noted that it could have been his anxiety causing the pain. Patient had been taking ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and drink a lot of water for treatment. Patient did not feel is was necessary to see the doctor or emergency department.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

                                                I received my Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination at approximately 0800 am on February 10, 2021. At approximately 1800 hrs the same day, I experienced a sudden onset of muscle spasms to my lower back. I was at rest, sitting in a chair at the time of onset. The muscle spasm to my lower back was extremely intense and I had difficulty walking. This continued for about 1.5 hours. Also, during this time, I experienced cramping to the arches of both my feet. This was intermittent. I also had pain/soreness to my hips bilaterally. After approximately 1.5 hours the lower back spasms and cramping to my feet subsided.  I do not have a history of lower back issues and this is my first experience of spasms of my lower back.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

                                                Red and swollen fingers on both hands; they were sore because they were swollen. My arm was sore at the injection site. Muscle soreness when I raised my arm above my shoulder. If I was going to examine someone for a rotator cuff injury - with the arm above that is where the soreness was. Nurse practitioner took picture of my hand that first day and the next day Dr looked at it. I had these symptoms for two weeks. My fingers are still kind of sore now. I had to try a few things to get the ring off my finger but otherwise no treatment.

                                                the next day, after being vaccinated, my left shoulder muscle (deltoid), right where the vaccine was administered, I felt a bit of a discomfort. and this lasted for about 3 days. after about 3 to 4 days after being vaccinated, &#34;all&#34; my muscles started to ache a bit, and I felt a bit weak. that passed after maybe 3 to 4 days. about 4 to 5 days later, or about 10 days after being vaccinated, the outside of my left arm (where the vaccine was administered) felt strangely over sensitive; to a touch and temperature. for the most part that has subsided now. However, about 4 days ago (a little over 2 weeks after being vaccinated) my left arm feels a bit weird. the feeling is similar to a mildly pinched nerve. for instance, if you sit for sometime with an arm at a weird position, (maybe twisted), you can get a weird feeling, of a bit of a discomfort. not the one where your arm goes numb, but a bit &#34;uncomfortable&#34;. but that typically goes away after a couple of minutes after you get up and start moving your arm. Well, this is the feeling now, except that it&#39;s been like that for the past 4 days or so. However, no outside reactions, no skin discoloration, etc.  I spoke with a nurse, and she advised me to report this side effect, and to make appointment with my PCP if the symptom does not subside in the next few days.

I took Tylenol and I feel much better on 3rd day morning (Wednesday). However, on Thursday, I feel throat soaring. I took Claritin and throat soreness stopped.  On Friday, I feel little gland swelling on right side neck and on Saturday the swelling is bit more prominent. While swallowing food and drinking water, I am feeling awkward in neck.

No other pain the day of injection. Day after injection (approximately 18 hours later) the entire right arm ached; then the aching moved to the lower back and eventually both legs. Pain resolved at approximately 30 hours after injection; ache never affected left (non-injected) arm.  Minor headache seemed to be forming, but never progressed past the initial indications. Was extremely tired the day following the injection; took two naps (1-2 hours each) and slept 12 hours that night (i.e., injected Friday, tired all day Saturday and slept longer than normal Saturday night). Aside from soreness at injection point, no further signs/symptoms on Sunday (i.e., resolved around 36 hours after injection).

It has been a three weeks now and the pain is not as bad but I still have pain in my left arm and elbow plus my arm feels weaker than it was before receiving the shot.

                                                The day after the shot I began having severe abdominal pain, muscle and nerve pain, and shortness of breath. The abdominal, muscle, and nerve pain began at around 10:00am. The shortness of breath began around 2:00-3:00 in the afternoon and lasted for 30-45 mins (longer than the 20mins listed in the attending ER physician&#39;s report), at which point my wife called for an ambulance and I was taken to the emergency room of Hospital. I was prescribed diphenhydrAMINE injection 25 mg, droperidoL injection 1.25 mg, ketorolac injection 15 mg, and another pain killer by the paramedics that I do not see listed in the record.   Although not to the same degree, I have continued to have gastrointestinal cramping since the second vaccination. This is a worsening of a condition (IBS) that I had previously, but which had mostly been in remission since beginning Mirtazapine in Fall 2019 subsequent to a heart attack on 8/7/19. I am meeting with my primary physician, Droctor, on 5/10/21 and contacted, my gastroenterologist, on 5/5/21.

                                                My left shoulder and triceps feels like the shoulder is dislocated and the triceps has torn.  Pain is about an eight and is very difficult to move without pain.  Motions such as trying to stretch a spring using both hands is painful and so is a motion such as doing lat raises on a machine.

                                                Opposite (right) arm (forearm) started to have pain. It has continued all the way to the 2nd vaccination on May 13. On May 14, after 2nd shot (on left upper arm again), the right wrist started to hurt on the next day. Just seems like a strange coincidence. I can deal with it. I&#39;m hoping it goes away eventually.

The day after shot at 8:30 pm I was feeling fine. Then all of a sudden my face which is usually red turned pale white. My stomach got chills and started to sweat a lot. I could not keep my head up and was very close to passing out. My wife was scared to the point she almost called 911 for me.

With the severity the greatest at the Metacarpophalangeal joints and radiating down the finger joints to less severity at the Proximal interphalangeal joints. The swelling subsided within a two week period, but the patient is still experiencing pain in the joints as well the patient exhibits a rash across the knuckles of the left index, pointer and ring finger with the index exhibiting the most sever manifestation and the ring finger the least. In the past week the pain has radiated into the left elbow and the patient is unable to extend the elbow and make a fist without experiencing excruciating pain. On 6/12 rash symptoms began mirroring, with less severity to the right index and middle fingers joints.

                                                Within 24 hours, I began experiencing the usual symptoms associated with 2nd dose, including chills, fever, body aches, etc.  Within 72 hours, I began experiencing serious chest pain, radiating pain into back and shoulders, and numbness in left arm--all symptoms associated with a heart attack.  I was immediately taken to the emergency department where I was treated with pain killer for chest pain and given a blood thinner and IV fluids.   EKG and chest X-ray were normal.  Blood work indicated highly elevated troponin levels thereby indicating significant stress to heart muscle.  Treatment included prescribing medications including Lopressor, Lipitor, and aspirin.  Following stay in the hospital, I was released with no signs of heart complications.  I&#39;m continuing the medications for general maintenance and prevention.  Prognosis is good with no further complications and no further threat of a future heart attack based on current medical conditions.

                                                Soreness in shoulder and then progressed to cervical region.  Started having &#34;hypersensitivity&#34; in shoulder, cervical, head, and into left arm.  The hypersensitivity progessed and got worse, on 1/13 blisters started developing on left  upper shoulder region and progressed to cervical region to occiput region and into left shoulder.  Went to clinic and have shingles.  1/19 the hypersensitivity in left arm has decreased but injection site has started to be &#34;sore&#34; again.  Still having shingle type symptoms in left shoulder/cervical region.

                                                Good morning, I received my 2nd shot yesterday at approximately 9:15a.  I had no issues during the observation period.  Last night at approximately 9:45p I started to feel as if I was catching a fever due to my joints aching and bland taste in my mouth.  At approximately 10:15p I started to shiver, had a headache and had tightness in the lower left side of my back.  So I took my temperature and I had a low grade fever 99.7.  At the point I went and had a hot shower.  After that I laid on the heating pad for 30 minutes and my back tightness subsided.  I stopped shivering at roughly 11:15p but continued to have a headache and aching joints.  My temperature right now is 100.3, joints are still aching but not as bad as last night, headache and chills.  Is there anything that I can take, Advil etc?  Also, I forgot to mention the arm soreness as well but I had that on the 1st shot as well.

Tylenol and Benadryl took care of it fairly well.  Had arm pain at site of injection, like I was hit in arm with a baseball bat.  Had some gerd too but not sure if related. Tiredness started around 9 hours after the shot, but symptoms really kicked in about 12 hours after administration.  Lasted till about 46 hours after administration, at which time I woke up from overnight sleep feeling great.  Arm still sore and there might be some lingering joint pain but nothing to keep me from doing anything.

Interferes with sleep, regardless of position (&amp; unable to lie on left side).  Unable to elevate shoulder overhead into flexion or abduction d/t pain (limited to ~45 degrees).  Tenderness over lateral shoulder/SIT tendons.  Positive impingement sign.  Seems to be tendon/shoulder injury d/t faulty injection technique.  I had minimal shoulder soreness after the first injection.

It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

This did not start going down until today.  I am not intending on seeking medical attention.    I ran very high fevers that were not able to be taken down by Tylenol right away.    I was out of my head with a little confusion and delirium for a few hours.  I experienced muscle aches and fatigue. I experienced itchy and crawly feelings on my skin.

Sitting upright in a char and driving a car made the pain worse. Difficulty sleeping due to pain and having to sleep on one side. Soothed the pain temporarily with a menthol rub but the pain would not go away  Sunday, March 7: Pain (burning, stinging, aching, quaking) unbearable to the point that I stayed in bed most of the day but could not sleep. Sitting upright continued to make pain worse. Menthol rub did not make pain go away. Pain intensified throughout the day in left shoulder and neck, shoulder blade, arm, and hand.  Monday, March 8: Appointment with Dr, internal medicine specialist who is my mother&#39;s primary care physician. Dr. suspected that I may be suffering from brachial neuritis and recommended that I see a neurologist for further diagnosis. He prescribed Gabapentin (nerve pain medication) and a series of steroid medication (Prednizone) for me to take throughout the week. I asked him how long I would have to take the medication in weeks/months to come. He said as long as I am feeling the pain. That night, when I started taking the medication, the pain flared up deep in my shoulder and down my arm like a fireball!   Tuesday, March 9 - Thursday, March 11: Gabapentin was not effective with reducing extreme pain. Dr. instructed me to increase dosage as needed. A day later, he called in a prescription for -------, a pain medication that he said I could take with Gabapentin to help strengthen relief. Made appointment with Dr, neurologist with Medical Group.   Friday, March 12:  Appointment with Dr. Initial tests suggest to him that my condition could be either brachial neuritis. He ordered MRI and EMG nerve test. I asked if I would be able to drive back to home. He advised against driving at all given my medications and ongoing pain, as well as the need to arrive at a clear diagnosis. I asked him what I should do about getting the second Moderna shot. He told me that I should not get the second shot. I am scheduled to get the second shot on Friday, March 26, at a vaccination site, State University.

                                                52 hours after the injection I started to feel chills and occasional feverish ness. I was also nauseous and threw up a few times. The were also muscle aches. The symptoms were severe enough to leave me stuck in bed. The symptoms persisted for 4 days and on the night of the 4th day I suddenly developed a persistent pain in my lower back. In the morning I went to the emergency room where I tested negative for Covid and a cat scan revealed that my body going through the side effects of the vaccine knocked a centimeter sized kidney stone loose. I was prescribed anti inflammatories and anti nausea meds and told to follow up with a urologist.

                                                Post-herpetic neuralgia Severe pains alongside dermatomes, but also intramuscular. Primarily radiating across back, but also more generalized to arms, neck, and head. In line with shingles episode two years ago. Also some fever and joint pains. Onset of neuralgia came a few days after vaccination, got worse over a period of a week, and then started improving. No anti-viral therapy was used. A combination of advil and tylenol was self-administered as needed. After a period of 18 days the pains had subsided.

More significantly, on Saturday April 17th I began to experience &#34;popping&#34; sounds in my right ear. Overnight my ear began to ache a fair amount. It has subsided some since. This is my first ear ache since I was in elementary school in the 1980s and is not common to allergies. It seems clearly related to the vaccine,  This was my first shot with Moderna.

                                                12 hours after my dose (on Saturday), going to bed at 10:30 and tired, I began to feel a low-grade temperature set in, and I woke up 2 hours later during the night and was having soreness in my lower back as the most pronounced.  I had trouble sleeping through most of the night and got up twice to urinate.  I could not get comfortable enough to fall asleep - was not necessarily feeling pain, just soreness.  During the day Sunday, I tried to rest having lost sleep, and it was mainly my lower back (back strap muscles) which were experiencing soreness.  Sunday evening, I went to bed around 9:30, and I woke up around midnight having a sore neck.  It felt like I was not necessarily sore in the muscles, but I could feel my heart rate increase and my blood pumping through my neck to my brain.  I could not get comfortable at all and lost sleep.  During the day Monday, I tried to rest it off, and there was no position I could rest where I was not in pain in my neck.  It almost felt like I had some form of encephylitis.  I went to bed around 8:30 PM, exhausted.  Woke up around midnight again, and I could not get back to sleep until 4 AM.  I found a position where my head turned and my shoulder extended away was not painful.  I woke up having felt like I had strained that muscle however.

Biopsy pathology came back as vasculitis. Severe symptoms last 2 weeks and lesser symptoms continue following prescribed course of anti-inflammatories. Doctor suggested symptoms may persist until vaccine dissipates in symptoms (approx. 30 days from injection date).

I&#39;ll then feel as if I&#39;m going to throw it back up, this is every meal this occurs. At times for the past month I&#39;ve woken up around 1 to 4 am immediately throwing up, even if stomach is empty. Also a very severe case of uric acid buildup and painful GOUT in my entire left ankle joint that&#39;s had me bedridden for the last 3 weeks that started a week after my vaccination. I notice I&#39;ve also been extremely agitated, irritable, restless and not sleeping well.

                                                I experienced an increase in volume of my tinnitus perception in my left ear. My head feels stuffy and I am slightly dizzy. These symptoms have caused insomnia, nausea, rapid weight-loss, and panic attacks. Treatment has been Flonase daily, anti-inflammatory diet, no caffeine, drinking lots of water, and resting.

                                                After the vaccine, I had regular symptoms from virus that you hear people talk about.  Head aches, muscle ache and soreness, then I felt better after a few days.  Off and on I would have good days and then I would have bad days.  I felt sluggish, and would make myself get through the day.  Some days I would have headaches and others not so much until month of May following the vaccine.   My head hurt almost every day, I was in a busy time in my family owned business as well.   I made an appointment with the Doctor and of course had to wait 2 weeks to get in.  I couldn&#39;t stand it any more and my wife got me in to see Dr. at the walk in clinic.  My Blood pressure was high, he did blood work and called and admitted me to hospital.  My numbers where all messed up and they told me my kidneys where not filtering. After 3 days at Hospital I was transfered to another hospital.  There I met a Nephrologist, who did test, biopsy on my kidneys and started me on dialysis.  My Biopsy report is as follows: 1 advanced Glomerular and tubulointerstital fibrosis (Approx. 60%) 2 Focal segemental glomerular sclerosing pattern, likely secondary 3 Moderate arteriolosclerosis 4 Rare neutrophil cast, superimposed pyelonephritis can not be excluded 5 active cellular cresents are not identified in light microscopic material. This basically says that the high blood pressure is what damaged my kidneys.  I went from a healthy 48 year old with no blood pressure issues, no health issues  until I took the vaccine and with in 6 months it killed the filtration of my kidneys.  I am now on dialysis 3 days a week and on the transplant list awaiting a new kidney.

                                                Initially, I felt fatigued and my left deltoid was sore. On day three after vaccination, I had one episode of hematuria. On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

                                                Had no issues with first dose on 1/3/21. Received the second dose 2/2/21 and began to feel body aches approx 12 hours later  As the night went on the muscle aches and joint pan were so bad I couldn&#39;t sleep  I took OTC Tylenol for the pain but it barely touched it. Every joint and muscle hurt.  Now. 24 hours later from receiving the shot I&#39;m  beginning to feel a little better but muscle pain still present. No fever throughout.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

I was still a little sore in lower back the day after the shot and was tired by the end of my work day.  3rd day back to normal.

Last night, on day 8, after five&#43; days of no pain whatsoever, and through the night to today (day 9) I am again experiencing acute arm pain similar to  the worst pain I felt in the days after the injection, both at the injection site and radiating down my arm and into my shoulder.  I took Tylenol which has provided some relief, but my range of arm motion is still limited by sharp pain.

                                                I was given the flu shot on Saturday the 9th of January, 2021 and then received the COVID 19 shot on t he 10th of January, 2021.  I woke up I believe in the early morning hours a couple of days later in pain.  The pain caused me to wake up.  After that I noticed that my elbow joints, and knee joints were very sore.  I was unable to flex my arms (mainly right arm) or knees (mainly right knee) after that for approximately two weeks without feeling pain.  Extremely sore joints starting in arm/elbow joint followed by extremely sore knee joints.  Overall body aches mainly in joints.  Persists to the time of this writing

Three days after the shot, I noticed slight lymph node shooting pain on my right jaw, under ear.   I?ll be getting the second shot...it beats COVID-19 by at least a mile!

Less than 24 hours later developed chills, sweat, aches and pain.  By 30 hours after the injection I developed pain in my lower back that spread to my right ground.  In 48 hours I was now experience excruciating  pain in my groin with a constant and intolerable pain down my leg into the knee area which continued for hours.  I was unable to find a position of comfort and was taken to the ER .  I was immediately given a morphine drip which was not successful and then administered Dilaudid for the pain which was able to calm it down but not end it.  At the time of this writing (About 72 hours after 2nd injection) I am unable to stand or walk without pain in my groin and knee area.  Part of my thigh and Knee are have developed numbness and extreme discomfort.  I can finally only sit with much pain.  This Moderna Vaccine was administered through my employer.

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

In fact, it is the gentlest shot I have ever received. Later that night I felt some pain in my left arm, which increased significantly that next day. The pain last for about two days, then almost suddenly went away. The pain then moved between by arm and neck for about 12 hours before going away. There were no other symptoms that I was aware of. No fever, no fatigue, etc.   SEE ATTACHED

                                                My arm was sore for 3 days as though I had been punched really hard.  After that  my deltoid became incredibly irritated and I started having stabbing, excruciating pain in my should any time it moved.  This lasted until I went in to get a shot of local anaesthetic from my doctor  on 2/25/21.  I was taking advil, tylenol, a muscle relaxer, lydecane cream and then I got the shot of anaesthetic.  I slowly had a little bit of improvement in mobility.  13 days after my vaccine, I was no longer experiencing shooting pain in my shoulder.  It is now March 1st and I think I have regained about 70% of my  mobility in that arm.  I believe that the shot made my deltoid flex and freak out and this ended up causing bicep tendinitis.  This is also my doctor&#39;s theory.

Now the last few weeks I have arthritis in my hands and fingers, also lower back cramps, and the last few days my left knee is hurting for no reason. I take aleve and it doesn&#39;t help. I wrapped it today in ace bandage and am using a cane. I am very upset. I have done nothing and this is all since the last shot.

                                                I had a 9:15 am appointment, received the shot about 9:30 am. Shopped in store for 10-min and drove to run more errands. About 9:45 am driving, I noticed my face starting to numb on my right hand side beginning with my upper lip, around my nostril, cheek and jaw line. After an hour of numbness, I called my doctors office and spoke with a nurse. The nurse had not heard of these symptoms before and sent me to the local ER at the hospital. As we drove to the ER, I noticed my jaw muscles getting tighter, but not so over powering that it felt like it would lock up. While under observation for an an hour or so, a Physician?s Assistant did neurological exams as my symptoms looked like a potential mild stroke. I passed the exams and sent home to observe any changes. The morning of day two (today), I have strong flu like symptoms with chills, shivering, aching muscles and the skin on my back and neck have a pins and needles feeling. What?s more, I have a present ringing in my ears today.

                                                About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to develop a fever.  I understand that fever, muscle aches and head aches are possible side effects of vaccinations in general and this one in particular.  Since I had tested positive for antibodies for the third time just two weeks prior to receiving this first dose of Moderna I was anticipating some reactions similar to what I have heard people experiencing for their second shot.  What followed the initial onset of fever was the worst flu symptoms I have ever experienced in my 48 years.  Fever continued to increase reaching 103 if not higher at times and staying elevated at level for over 6 hours.  Chills to the point of convulsions.  Nausea and one time vomiting.  Fever dreams (mild hallucinations), profuse sweating, intense head aches.  Muscle aches I could barely tolerate that I felt over every inch of my body.  This continued until 10am the following morning when I took some advil and finally fell asleep to the point of being virtually unwakeable until 2:30pm.  Upon waking I was able to sit up and drink water but the muscle soreness and slight fever continued throughout the day (101 fever).   I was able to eat some toast that evening.  That night the fever returned but not as high as the previous night.  The sweating was still profuse throughout the night and the muscle aches continued  but to a lessor degree.  The following day the fever subsided though muscle soreness continued.  That evening I was able to sleep regularly and now today (three full days after vaccination) I am roughly back to myself.  I understand that reading this seems as if these symptoms fall in line with what is expected and understand to be the side effects of the vaccine.  I am here today to tell you that I thought I was dying.  I have never, ever felt so terrible ever.  It was ten times worse than having covid.  I cannot imagine  anyone who is not healthy and string making through that and I can not believe I am expected to do it again to complete my vaccination.

                                                He got the vaccine, started to get the headache within 45 minutes, ran some errands and after a couple of hours he felt like something was burning on his buttock, and noticed a really bad red rash on the left side on the left cheek from the crack outward. It was extremely hot to the touch and very sore, kind of throbbing and swollen and progressively got worse. He was just not feeling well, nauseous and dizzy and went to sleep but when he woke up it had spread to the other cheek. It looks like he got burned or scalded red/purple in color. He has no reaction on the arm itself, but only on the buttock and a blistery, blood red, leathery feeling rash/blotch on his entire buttock to both hips on both sides. It is difficult for him to sit. He also had headache, the muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea.  He did not vomit but had not eaten anything. He has had a high fever up to 103 until this morning 4/8/21 which is about 99-100.  He woke up soaking wet today. He has not been able to turn his neck, and not able to lift his arm above his waist level since the vaccine, and not able to turn his neck to the left at all. He can turn it 5-10 degrees, but right is okay. He took some Benadryl over the last 2 days for the reaction but it has not. He also has taken aspirin/Aleve for the fever. He was so sock and had no energy and could not sleep but could not keep his eyes open either, was not able to open them. He did write his doctor when the rash was only on one side, which they did not give him any advice as he was not feeling any worse at that time. He was at 101 fever throughout the day and then at night went to 102. He was hoping that the rash would be better, but actually worse as described above. He has not had any appetite, trying to drink fluids but made him nauseous, and he normally drinks water all day long. His normal temp is 97.7. He has been taking showers to try and keep his fevers down and the water hitting the rash feels like somebody is pouring scolding water on it. He did call Moderna on 4/6/21 asking if this was a reaction that anybody has reported, and he is waiting for somebody to call him back.

My face is now swollen, cut and bruised and I also have pain in my neck.I have pictures of my face after my fall and had to call out of work today Monday 4/26/2021 as a result.

                                                Joint pain in the left foot and ankle, and both wrists.  Started about 3 to 4 days after first Moderna vaccine.  Progressively worsened over the next week until I had sever pain-8 out of 10 in joints of both shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and the left foot/ankle.  Pain became debilitating and went to local medical clinic.  Ran blood tests. A week later pain worsened and went to ER.  Could barely get out of bed, walk.   ER doc put me on a tapering course of Prednisone for 12 days.  Almost complete relief of joint pain within 4 hours.  Once down to 10 mg per day the pain returned.   Had a GP telemed appointment and doc put me back on prednisone-30mg per day.  Not complete relief of pain but certainly better than nothing.

I was in a lot of pain.  I thought I was having kidney stones. I went to the doctor and did a CT scan and gave me a shot in my back for pain.  The CT scan did not show any kidney stones or liver issues.  I went back to the doctor and he diagnosed me with muscle inflammation.  I am a healthy person and the pain came out of nowhere. The pain is in the lower right hip side.   My whole right side is in pain and the left side of my body is fine and not in pain.  I had the 2nd vaccine in my right arm and whole right side of the body is affected.  On a scale, my pain is an 8/10.  I did get a prescription for the pain meds  but the it&#39;s not really helping that much.

The morning of January 12, 2021 I woke with severe muscle and joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue.  As the day progressed I developed chills to the point I could not get warm.  I also developed a low grade fever.  After taking two ibuprofen around 3p the pain subsided to an ache about my entire body by 9p, headache had subsided and I had no more chills or fever.  On the morning of January 13, 2021 I woke with a red rash going up the inside of both arms and around the outside of my upper arms and down my entire back.  As the day has progressed that rash has spread down the back of legs as well.  I did take one Benadryl with minimal effect.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

A few hours later, tongue felt numb (both sides) and noted drooling out of his mouth.  Drooling is has lessened over the day but still has tongue feeling numb.  Per report, RNs checked him at work and had symmetric face and reports no visual changes to his face.  No other facial symptoms.  Has soreness/aches and fatigue this evening and arm is sore at the injection site but that started later.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

Symptoms began approximately 24 hours after receiving the second vaccine, and gradually subsided over the following 24 hours, with only moderate diarrhea, heart palpitations, and fatigue remaining. It was by far the worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to a vaccine The only side effects after the first vaccine were moderate fatigue the evening of the vaccine and moderate arm pain.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

On second night after receiving the vaccine, I had severe headaches and alternating chills/sweats.   72hrs after the vaccine,  pain continues, although it has subsided to the point where almost full motion is possible.  Periodic severe headaches continue, although these existed before receiving the vaccine and are linked to positive COVID in Nov 2020.

At 5:00 pm, I got out of work, I went straight home because I felt so weak and my eyes got watery (didn&#39;t go to work out afterward) and I got the chills and my bones started to hurt, I went to bed and slept all - my bones were in horrific pain - especially in my back. Saturday morning, I felt the same -I took OTC med for the pain - no fever; body aches, watery eyes and I was very weak. I drank orange juice and I took some Zinc; vitamin C - and I hurt all that day - bones still achy but not quite as much. Sunday morning, I wasn&#39;t normal but better and by Sunday noon I was better; not weak anymore. On a scale from one to 10, I felt like a ten when it was bad. My injection site was sore for a good four days. I took it on a Friday but Tuesday the arm was good to go.

                                                Severe shaking to the point I could barely walk, talk, or function in general. In fact, had to end work conference call due to effects.  In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

                                                I definitely had a soreness at the injection site, more than I have had with any other shot. It definitely subsided after a couple of days. Also had joint pain in my hands, elbows, and knees, and particularly in my left knee where I have arthritis, also decreased in intensity within a few days of the shot.   About a week after the shot, my arm began to itch at the injection site, and swelling and a half-dollar sized red patch appeared, and the skin was hot to the touch. Today (2 days later), the red patch is roughly the size of a small envelope. The skin is still warm or hot to the touch and the swelling may have subsided slightly. I am not taking any antihistamines or using any topicals- just working on not scratching the area. I have read some info on the internet referring to this as &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. It is manageable, and I am NOT deterred from getting my second shot in April.

                                                On 4/27/21 at around 4:15 patient came to store to report a side effect after been immunized against Covid 19 with a Moderna vaccine on 4/25/21. The patient had a chief complaint of pain and swollen armpit . After looking into the area, I observed that the swelling looks as if he had the size of a small ball on his armpit. I Suggested to take Aleve and observe for fever and that if it gets worst see MD immediately.  Patient was grateful for consultation and will keep in touch if there?s not improvement.

                                                Approximately three hour after receiving the vaccine the patient began to hallucinate. This is not normal for the patient. Per patient caregiver; the patient is hallucinating almost constantly. He is not resting currently due to the issues. He is also having extreme weakness in the arm which he received the vaccine and has unexplained bruising on the same side of his body on his trunk. Currently he has not pursued treatment. I advised he be taken to the ER or other clinic to be checked out as this may or may not be due to the vaccine.

                                                Just like my 1st dose, this 2nd dose made my arm from my elbow to my shoulder very sore starting about 2 hours after the injection. The soreness lasted for 2-3 days, gradually lessening each day. Unlike my 1st dose, this 2nd dose made my whole body experience soreness.  It started with soreness in my neck, lower back, and elbow and knee joints around 10pm (8 hours after the injection). When I woke up the next morning, I struggled to get out of bed and had to call my employer because I couldn&#39;t work that day. It was effecting all of my muscles from my neck to my calves. On 2 occassions,  I reached for an item with my right arm (non-injection arm) and had strong cramps where the tricep and shoulder muscle meet. I had to massage the cramps out. I felt like my body had been jolted in a car crash 1-2 days before. This lasted throughout the day and I felt like the soreness, cramping and immobility started to ease up around 9-10pm, So approximately 23-24 hours after it started. The next day (2 after the injection) I hopped out of bed and felt no residual effects, as if nothing had happened the day before. Throughout the day of .muscled soreness and fatigue, I experienced NO fever, chills, or nassea.

I then began to have severe pain in both shoulders, both knees, both hips, and both elbows. The pain started on 4/10/2021, and became very severe over the course of that week. The pain started to lessen starting the week of 4/2/2021 and has seemed to improve but the right shoulder still has shooting pains when moved certain ways. My right hand is still swollen and I  cannot make a full fist. I am unable to fully bend my knees. My left elbow still has shooting pains when moved into certain positions

On 02/15/21 it got worse and could not turn my head as the neck was stiff and swollen. My neck got better after few days and the pain moved to both my biceps. They were also swollen and painful. After few days the pain was gone but I started having pain on both my thighs. They were also swollen and very painful. After few days the pain disappeared and it moved to both legs and feet. At that same time my skin was also getting inflamed and peeling off.  I could not even take a shower or bath as the skin was very sensitive and painful.  I also started developing some blisters on most parts of my body. It was diagnosed a Bullous Pemphigoid.

I could not squat and rise from squatted position due to inability to push off with left leg/knee. Intensity varied day to day but was always an issue right up to a few days before 2nd shot dose when symptoms appeared to be dissipating. After my 2nd shot, symptoms were still continuing to dissipate for about a week. After a week, all symptoms returned in full force and have still not lessened a full 6 weeks after my 2nd dose.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Diabetes and Blood pressure high (Patient was diagnosed at the hospital) on 19-Mar-2021.    On 04-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 04-Apr-2021, the patient experienced BONE PAIN (pain bone) and CHILLS (chills). On 16-May-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (started feeling short of breath), CHEST PAIN (pain in the back and chest) and BACK PAIN (pain in the back and chest). On 19-May-2021, the patient experienced CARDIAC DISORDER (heart disorder) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered). The patient was hospitalized on 19-Mar-2021 due to CARDIAC DISORDER. The patient was treated with IBUPROFEN at an unspecified dose and frequency. On 06-Apr-2021, BONE PAIN (pain bone) and CHILLS (chills) had resolved. At the time of the report, CARDIAC DISORDER (heart disorder), DYSPNOEA (started feeling short of breath), CHEST PAIN (pain in the back and chest), BACK PAIN (pain in the back and chest) and PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received medications for diabetes and high blood pressure however, drug names were not provided.  Company comment: This case concerns a 49-year-old male patient who missed the appointment to be given the second dose of the vaccine because of symptoms (Product dose omission). The other events show temporal association with the use of mRNA-1273 and, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Nausea is consistent with the product known safety profile of the product. The event of product dose omission is not applicable.

I ended up with excruciating pain that landed me in the hospital for two weeks for extreme nerve pain to the point I can?t walk, sit or stand for long periods of time. I was given heavy doses of steroids, pain meds, IV fluids and met with a neurologist did multiple MRI?s and I?m left with severe muscle spasms and tremors the Drs can?t seem to understand why They said this is not related to back issues however they did a steroid back injection hoping it would help with inflammation and I was sent home after two weeks in the hospital. I?m at home and dear if my life doesn?t turn around I will lose everything.  I was a athlete with no prior previous existing health issues and now I can?t even leave my house without serious tremors and muscle spasms I?m on medication for seizures, muscle spasms pain meds and have a jacuzz I can?t even raise my leg to get into This ALL HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER I GOT THE VACCINE!!!! 1st dose I did have a bad case of COVID in December for the record.

                                                The pt had his first Moderna covid vaccine on 3/19, and after the vaccination, he developed left upper lateral calf pain that lasted several weeks.  He then had his second Moderna covid vaccine on 4/22, with left knee pain, and again left upper lateral proximal calf pain.  He denies any chest pain, heaviness, tightness, pressure, palpitations, or dizziness.  He contacted his PCP, and he was advised to come to the ER for evaluation of a possible DVT.   This is very suspicious for a direct thrombotic side effect of the pt&#39;s Moderna vaccine.  The pt has a very high d-dimer, and we can not rule out a mid-distal thigh and left popliteal DVT, so the pt will be covered with Lovenox, and he will present to hospital tomorrow to obtain a venous duplex.  They can then, based on clot burden and his subsequent complaints on continuing lovenox bridge to warfarin or a direct acting anticoagulant.

                                                So on May 1st I woke up, I had a sore throat on just one side of my throat. I was on a flight and I got fever and chills. I was having a really hard time breathing so I went to the ER, they checked me for strep and they sent me home with Prednisone and sent me home even though the strep test was negative. I got home and had a fever at 105. I called the ER DR and the DR was gone so I stayed home. I called my PCD the next day and he contacted the specialist and the specialist said I was in imminent danger. I took two nipagin injections, my white blood cell counts were extremely low. This was middle of May maybe, I lost 20 pounds in six days in the hospital. I have been out of work since then. I have seen hematologists, ENT specialist, and several others ands all of them are puzzled.

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

                                                Starting around 1:00 in the morning, the night of receiving the vaccine, I started with the aches, joint pain, chills, and low-grade fever.  I forced myself to go to work.  I am a Registered Nurse.  The joint pain and aches increased throughout the day along with altered periods of chills and hot flashes.  Around 6 PM on the 29th is started feeling worse.   I felt like I was tachycardic.  I had my wife take my blood pressure.  My normal vitals are Pulse-50, BP 110/60.  When I took my vitals at 6:00 pm my pulse was 91 and my BP was 85/53.  Clearly an allergic reaction.  I had no difficulty breathing.  Finally, around 1:00 am on 1/30, my fever broke and my heart rate and BP returned to normal ranges.  My first vaccination was unremarkable with only a sore arm for three day.

                                                I became extremely ill about 12 hours after vaccination.   I slept about (10pm to 6:30 am) 8.5 hours, and then I  woke for work the next morning.  I felt a little off, but I thought I was ok.  I entered my shower, and then I was found unconscious on the floor of my shower by my wife about 5 minutes later.  I passed out 2 more times while attempting to stand and exit the shower.  I was extremely fatigued at this point.  I went back to bed and slept until 10 pm that night.  I woke for about 2 hours , ate  some food and drank some water and soda pop.  I then went back to sleep until 7:30 am  the next morning.   I was awake for 3 hours, and then I slept for 3 more hours.  I have been awake for about 2 hours, and I am now typing this adverse event document.   The entire time I have had temperature regulation issues, severe headache, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue.

I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

Couldn&#39;t stay on my feet longer than a couple of minutes. It got  less severe with time, but not very fast. I was able to take a walk outside again for the first time 6 days after the shot. Today, a week after the shot, my knees still hurt, and I still don&#39;t feel like I can run.

When that pain subsided during the second day after the shot, I started to get some swelling and pain in my left armpit. Discomfort was such that it interfered with my ability to sleep through that night. The following day (Day 3 after injection) the discomfort mostly subsided but still has not completely gone away. Currently on Day 6 after injection. No treatments or medications have been applied to alleviate the issue.

I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

I reported this because I think others may experience the same.

He was not due for a second Pfizer vaccine until 03/20/2021. He had two administration errors on 03/18/2021 as he was inadvertently given wrong brand - Moderna - dose was given too early by 2 days. I spoke with patient on 03/24/2021 to notify him of the two administration errors. I let him know there are no current studies for effect on interchangability of vaccines or doses given too early, but that current CDC guidance does not recommend or require any further doses and he would be considered fully immunized at this time. He reports he did well with his second dose, and only had 1-2 days of some muscle aches and mild lymphadenopathy under vaccinated arm, which resolved quickly. RN.

Patient was admitted to Hospital 4/8-4/11. Suspected to have cervical transverse myelitis.  Re-admitted 4/12 due to worsening generalized weakness, significant numbness, gait/coordination issues, and several falls. Differential diagnosis includes guillain barre syndrome vs. transverse myelitis. No MS on brain MRI. No cord lesion. Treatment included IVIG 0.5g/kg daily x 4 days, B12, 1 mg IM daily x 3 days. bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  4/7: MRI cervical spine: Small focal area of increased T2 signal within the central cervical cord at the C2 level without associated postcontrast enhancement. A demyelinating disease is leading differential consideration. 4/11: MRI brain: normal, no de-myelinating disease; MRI C-spine: severe cervical stenosis with flattening of spinal cord but no cord edema/enhancement.

                                                I felt one small tingle in my left hand (I am right-handed) and I had a funny taste in my mouth.  Later that night, after eating, I started feeling a tingling sensation in my arms and back. It seemed to get worse after I ate some oatmeal cookies cooked with flour shortly before bed. Early the next morning, the tingling developed into itchy skin on my back, shoulders, and arms.  I am not really breaking out and I am making sure to stay hydrated.  I am hypothesizing that the side effects I am experiencing may be due to consuming refined flour and refined sugars that my body cannot metabolize.  At least for now, I plan to stay away from refined sugars and flours until my 2nd dose of the Moderna shot.  Day 2: I woke up on my left side and the pinky and ring fingers on my left hand were asleep. I went back to sleep on my back and woke up with fingers on my left and right side asleep. As I got ready for work, I experienced trapezius muscle soreness.

                                                Got his vaccine, that evening he felt as if his face was on fire like a windburn.  The next morning had an incredible cold chill as soon as air hit him, bone shaking.  Then had cold chills/sweating with soaking of his groin area.  He can go to sleep with extreme chills and then wake up in a puddle of sweat.  He had a headache at first, took Tylenol and it went away.   Numbness in his foot like it&#39;s falling asleep, left hip hurting, left wrist pain.  Today both calves hurt./sore like workout burning pain.  Two days ago his father went to have bypass and was at the hospital with him, and walked painfully in but had difficulty hobbling along and was unable to walk back to his truck and had to borrow his dad&#39;s cane to be able to walk.  Yesterday he was going to cut the grass, knelt down to do something, and when trying to stand up was not able to walk due to the throbbing pain and had to use the cane again.  Also having swollen left ankle with discoloration.  The calf pain is extreme and throbbing, and the pain when he&#39;s not able to walk is in the calf.  The ankle has been swollen since Sunday, 4/18/21.  He spoke with the ICU nurse in the hospital and he told her about it and she grabbed his ankle and asked if he was sure he didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  He has not been able to shake the symptoms.  The issues with walking are intermittent, some days he can walk fine, the other days he has to use the cane.    He still continues with every day hot sweats/cold chills.  It&#39;s 74 where he is right now and has a sweatshirt on as he is cold.  Also the legs hurting, ankle swelling that he ices down at night but the swelling does not go away.  Feels like a hard knot in his ankle.   He has not sought any treatment for this at this point.

                                                First dose on 3/5/2021 received with minor issues of slight pain in injection site later, but also some tingling in injection site. SECOND DOSE on 4/2/2021 was a different story.  About 15 hours later at 3:00 am I woke up with 100.5 fever, SEVERE pain at injection site (like someone had punched me in the arm and bruised my arm), and SEVERE level 9 (out of 10) pain in all joints in my hand and two big toes.  Fibromyalgia muscular pain SEVERE level 9.  Headache, SEVERE fatigue - could not get out of bed very well.  SEVERE brain fog - I could barely think logically.  I tried taking 50mg full spectrum CBD oil to avoid taking an NSAID (I was concerned it would affect proper immune response).  At 6:29 am the fever was lower, but I could no longer take the pain, so I took 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil).  4-6 hours later took another 400mg Ibuprofen (Advil) and stayed in bed and slept several times that day.  For the next two days the severe brain fog and severe fatigue remained.  I continued to take 400mg Advil as needed.  The brain fog was so severe that if I picked up my keys (or any other object), I would immediately ?lose? them and not know where they were because I had placed them somewhere else and could not remember anything.  I stayed home for at least 72 hours due to the fatigue and the fear of driving and possibly getting in an accident.  It seems the high severity of the issues lasted 72 hours, but all of the above reported issues continued for several weeks at a lower severity - with fatigue being the worst - requiring one or two naps per day.  As of today, April 29, there is still slight pain in all hand joints and some fatigue, but there seems to be gum issues (hurting) since about April 26th.  I am brushing my teeth lightly, using ?Smart Mouth? zinc oral rinse, and sucking/chewing on a whole clove every once in a while for pain relief and for the anti-biotic properties.  I did not contact my physician because I read online that people with Fibromyalgia have worse side effects and I figured the effects would subside over time.  I have an upcoming appointment with my doctor on May 26, 2021 at which time I will report these side effects and my strong concern about any future booster shots and the severe side effects I may encounter.

Reports feeling a &#34;crook in the neck&#34; the evening of receiving the vaccine. States he woke up the next morning, 4/14/21 with a very painful L arm, couldn&#39;t lift it and no strength.  Left arm is still painful and with reduced strength as of 4/28/2021. States arm is still swollen but has improved. Patient saw his primary care provider (not at our clinic) on 4/23/2021 and was given a shot of Toradol for pain. Patient also kept existing appointments with neurosurgery and pain management for failed back surgery. Neurosurgeon advised it could be nerve injury and that it will heal over time. Told patient that nerve in arm could be in a different location due to his history as a body builder. Patient states arm is better but still painful and weak.

It settled in to all my weak spots. Today I have no pain like that in my back but right leg function and reflexes are nonfunctioning with spasms.

                                                On 4/13 Patient underwent aortic root replacement with saphenous vein graft reconstruction of the right coronary artery. He had no prior coronary disease. This operation was done for an enlarging aortic root aneurysm in the setting of Marfan syndrome. The right coronary was anomalous and needed vein extension for reimplantation. He recovered very well and was seen in our clinic on 4/23, with no unusual findings. He had a normal echo, EKG and DVT study performed.   On 4/28 he had his first Moderna COVID19 dose. on 5/1, he developed malaise, myalgias, painful lymph nodes, chills, and chest pain. He called my clinic and was instructed to go to the ER, but then felt better and didn&#39;t go. He was then found unresponsive later that afternoon and was pronounced dead on arrival of EMS.

                                                While a very sore shoulder was anticipated and experienced, I also experienced joint pain. Worse, while walking the next day, I had a &#34;hip event&#34;, where I suddenly experienced strong pain. Over the last five months, despite reduction in use and having no prior injury or weakness in that area, my condition has only worsened, to where today it is borderline severe, and has limited me to all but basic movement, and that with difficulty.

                                                About 5 days after injection i felt left lower leg swelling on the lateral side of my shin with 2 areas of point tenderness and muscle pain. The area still is sore after a lot of staying off my feet and using ice packs on the area. I do an extreme amount of walking at work and am wearing brand new running shoes so the footwear shouldn&#39;t be an issue.

                                                got the first moderna shot in right arm.   by 10 pm, it felt like my arm had been hit by a hammer at injection site.  I figured that was pretty common, and to be expected.  Sore, but, not alarming.   Then my knee joint on left leg and a bit on right leg began to ache terribly, to the point that I almost buckled on them.   The joint aches moved from a 7 pain on a scale of 10,  down to a 3, and moved to a diffuse body ache for 12 more hours.   Then, the fatigue hit.  I would wake up tired.   go to bed at 10, wake up at 7am,  fall over sideways on couch unexpectedly. and sleep for an hour or two.    It felt like i was severely fatigued.  The fatigue on a scale of 1-10 was about a 7.   It was really debilitating.   The fatigue lasted at a 7 for a full 3 weeks, then a week of 5 level,  then right at 4 week mark lifted quickly in a day.   It was very strange      The fatigue for a month was concerning to me.  I would not want to experience that again.   The shoulder pain was probably what most people experience.  Others I have spoken to have had the joint pain.   But I dont know anyone who had felt 3 weeks of fatigue.

                                                Tendonitis and shoulder weakness.  Pain persisted after initial muscle soreness faded 2-3 days after the vaccine was administered.  It has been constant for the last 6 weeks and has at times affected my sleep and has caused me to significantly reduce weight lifting exercises that I have been doing for more than 10 years.  It has also reduced my ability to do manual work &amp; projects around the house and slowing the work that i still perform.  I have started physical therapy at home using shoulder stretches and exercises.  It is not clear to me if the minor improvement is because of the therapy or because my normal activity/exercise level has been significantly reduced due to the shoulder pain.

                                                I received my second Moderna shot on Sun 05/23. Immediately following the injection I noticed that it was high on my shoulder and I showed my wife where the shot was given. I also felt a swoosh sensation down his arm when it was injected. Now I am in terrible pain and can?t move my left arm. The pain started maybe an hour after and increasingly got worst. I searched this online and learned about shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA).  It?s when the shot is delivered into the sub-deltoid bursa instead of the muscle.  I think this is what happened to him but I am not certain. I did consult with my primary care physician on Monday 05/24 and he recommended me to an orthopedic specialist.

                                                I had a significant reaction to shot 2. Fever type feelings, aches, pains, nausea, etc. I was in bed for many hours.  One of those symptoms on day 2 seemed to be a throbbing pain in my right knee and right foot. it seemed quite strange at the time.  By Tuesday morning - about 40 hours after the shot - when I felt well enough to move around I noticed that I had numbness in my right leg starting at the knee and working up the leg about 9-10 inches.  The numbness is only on the front of my leg and only in a strip about 3-4 inches wide starting about half way on the kneecap and working up the leg again about 9-10&#34;.  This numbness almost feels like the sensation after a dentists numbs the mouth for a procedure, like local anesthesia.  I just assumed it was temporary and would completely heal. It has not. I informed my primary care doctor and sent a follow up that it is continuing to manifest itself.   My leg is functioning normally and I have no other symptoms or issues - only the numbness in the leg in that one area.  Because this has gone on for so long I felt I should report it.

I was diagnosed with acute Pericarditis 8 years ago, after 4 days in the hospital and a couple of weeks of rest at home all of my symptoms had subsided and I have had no reoccurrence of this condition since.  Approximately one week after receiving my second dose of the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine I began to experience chest pain.  8 days post vaccination the chest pain was radiating into my Left shoulder and arm, I had significant pain on breathing and was extremely uncomfortable lying on my back and could not lie on my left side due to pain.   I went to the ER  on the evening of May 6th, they performed a chest x-ray, 2 EKG&#39;s as well as 2 separate blood work panels.   While I did relate my history of having pericarditis and that this pain was very similar to what I had felt before, they, of course, were more concerned on if I was having a coronary event.  The EKG and blood work showed I was not so I was simply sent home with a &#34;we don&#39;t know why your chest hurts but your are not having a heart attack.&#34;   After a follow up to a cardiologists almost 2 weeks later it was determined that it was more than likely a flare up of pericarditis but that it had subsided by that time.

                                                One week after 2nd dose noticed left ankle and calf area swollen much larger than right ankle.  Slight pain and tightness in left upper chest, upper back, and into left arm occurring often.  Symptoms have persisted for over a month.  Was checked for a blood clot in left leg but results were negative.  Seeing my doctor for additional tests, probably an echo next.  Symptoms have persisted daily since about one week after the 2nd dose.  Concerned symptoms are consistent with myocarditis.

                                                I had severe weakness, joint pain, and body aches. I could barely get myself out of bed or get up to go to the bathroom. The symptoms were reminiscent of having pneumonia. I went to the doctor that following Monday. I continued to use Tylenol.  Last month, I&#39;ve been having cognitive issues and I was blacking out. I went to the hospital and it was discovered that I had an aneurysm. I was hospitalized for 3 days. I am actually going to see a neurologist tomorrow.

The new and persistent symptom is tinnitus.  I have had incessant ringing in my ears since receiving the vaccine, something I did not previously experience.  The ringing has continued unabated since April 2021.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                My Left shoulder became red at the injection site and swollen.  I also have pain and stiffness going from the injection site all the way up to the base of my skull.  If I look down at my hands, my cell phone, the ground or even at a desk too long, the left side of my neck gets so stiff that it hurts to raise my head back up to normal height.  The muscles in my left shoulder and left side of my neck are so tight that it seems like I have been lifting weights for days.  I have not worked out in months.  Today is 1/23/21 and I still have the problem.   I also had a migraine headache for three to four days after the vaccine.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

                                                Drank fluids around 8pm followed by unusually early fatigue and somnolence 2 hours early, awoke before midnight cold, shivering, aching in larger muscles and joints from neck to ankle including shoulders, back, hips, and thighs, could not get warm wearing many layers and blankets, then headache after 3am with hot dry sore throat and awoke more short of breath than usual, eyes crusted, slightly dizzy on rising, am finding myself with poor attention this morning filling out this form incorrectly needing more corrections than usual.  The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

I was down and couldn&#39;t function. I took Ibuprofen and tylenol - and it helped with aches and pains a little but not with tiredness and overall feeling bad. I took the 3rd and 4th off but went back to work on 5th although I was sluggish. Felt a lot better on Saturday.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

                                                patient was sitting in our lobby following covid vaccination when he reported he felt a little dizzy and thought he may faint, (patient was nervous for the vaccine prior to administration), I sent someone to grab a  ice pack and a bottle of water for him and while they were retrieving the ice pack he started to seize. Patient was breathing but unresponsive, stiff, and unable to blink, talk, or move for around 2-3 minutes.  Once the seizure ended I asked patient if he had a history of seizures, his answer was, &#34;not really&#34;. He drank some of the water and sat with the ice pack for a couple minutes and said he felt better. Color returned. Patient stated he felt nerves contributed more than anything and was feeling 100% better when he left. We had dialed 911 while patient was unresponsive but once he was able to talk again he declined 911 and stated feeling much better.

The next morning 3/7 at approximately 0830, same effects as previous, but also a horrible migraine and vomiting. Took one 6ml injection Sumatriptan for migraine in opposite arm from Covid vax, no effect and no relief. 1300 hours, migraine was so intense, I advised my wife I would do a 2nd Sumatriptan injection and if it didn&#39;t work, I would need to be brought to the emergency room. 2nd injection was successful in relieving migraine approx 45 min after injection. Felt run down, but was able to go to work the next morning 3/8. Felt tired and run down on 3/8, but symptoms went away by late evening. This was surprising, since my first Covid vax dose 4 weeks prior didn&#39;t affect me as bad as this 2nd dose

I was only able to lift my arm above my head with assistance from my right arm. Eventually I was able to lift my arm without assistance and the same phenomena happened the third evening where my shoulder was frozen and immobilized.  The frozen shoulder has abated but there is still moving poi&#39;s of major swelling in the upper arm. There has been persistent but slowly abating symptoms of deep soreness, arm weakness and weak grip strength. Swelling persists in the upper front portion of left shoulder. I can not do extended tasks with the arm because it does not have strength nor stamina.

Difficulty functioning normally: walking, ascending &amp; descending stairs and simply standing in place.   Symptoms worsen at night, knees become frozen and have to be adjusted with hands.

Skin, especially face felt like extreme sunburn and that the skin on my face was going to split it was so hot. Fever.  Day after injection had fatigue and muscle joint soreness throughout the day.  In the evening of the day after injection around 6:00pm had chills and shaking so badly it hurt. The chills/shaking lasted about an hour. I continued to be sore in muscles and joints until the soreness ebbed throughout the following day.

He has chills, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, muscle pain, fever, headache.  He has not taken anything for his symptoms, just wanting to sleep.     He is allergic to the flu vaccine and he told them that before the vaccine and they assured him that he was ok to get this.  He probably will not get the 2nd vaccine.

                                                SYMPTOM 1 - Pronounced persistent vertigo 7 days after Moderna Shot #1.  Very healthy.  Never before experienced vertigo of any significance.  Degree of vertigo strong for entire first day undeniably present/persistent and varies (slightly improved, then worsens again) since day 8. Able to get through day but disturbing. Extremely healthy otherwise,  extremely athletically capable.  Nothing unusual in diet or sleep or activity or stress in recent days.  SYMPTOM 2 - Ringing ears on day 11, and increasing on day 12.  This too - never before of any significance in entire life.  Could it be related to the vertigo symptoms?  Feels like it is.  *** Please take note! *** Hard to dismiss as unrelated.  I&#39;m just one.  You have the sample data.  Seems as though auditory/balance nerves are getting a beating somehow.  This is NOT an exasperated pre-existing condition.  The shoulder soreness / tiredness - was a 1 day matter quickly resolved.  This is more insidious and persistent and debilitating.

While walking to get Advil I collapsed on the floor and was conscious but unresponsive for 15-30 seconds while my wife tried to get me to respond.  For the next hour or so I had waves of aches, nausea, dizziness, and muscle weakness.  I was then able to get back to sleep and following day, I had mild aches that subsided as the day progressed and was close to feeling normal by evening.

                                                I experienced &#34;Moderna Arm&#34; on the day following the injection, but it subsided after a couple of days. Eight days later, though, it returned (swelling/redness/milder pain) -- accompanied by swelling in my right ankle and tightness/some tingling/mild pain in my right ankle/upper calf. I suffered a blood clot for the first time in each leg in early November; the more serious of the two was in the vicinity of my upper calf in my right leg. In December, I began to experience sensations in my right ankle that were similar (albeit more intense) to what I later experienced after my vaccine; the post-vaccination symptom in my right calf was also similar (but milder) to what I had experienced from the DVT.

                                                State opened Covid vaccines to 50 and over on Mon, March 22. I immediately scheduled my appointment for a first shot at a Dept of Health site near me for Wed, March 24. I had no immediate negative side effects. When I woke on Fri, March 26 and commenced my day of remote work from home, I noticed my left eye vision was blurry. I proceeded to work that day and continued my normal activities into the weekend assuming my vision would self-correct. By Sunday, March 26, my left eye vision was still noticeably problematic so I scheduled to see an optometrist whom I had seen before. I saw him at 12:15pm on Tues, March 30. After running numerous vision tests, optometrist let me know my vision loss in the left eye seemed to be the result of a stroke that had cut blood flow in the optic nerve and damaged my vision in the lower portions of the left eye. The center and upper portions of my left eye were generally unaffected at that time. He suggested I see my primary care physician to check for vitals, such as blood pressure and do other blood work, and more importantly see a neuro ophthalmologist urgently.   The next morning, Wed, March 31 I saw my PCP, who informed me my blood pressure was normal, requested blood work, and gave me a prescription for an MRI of my brain, with and without contrast. I am 6&#39;2&#34; and I weighed at 239, about where it has been for most of last 15 years. I also complained of pain and stiffness in my front right thigh and lower right back. She said if I didn&#39;t get an appointment to see a neuro ophthalmologist that same afternoon, she recommended I go to an ER. With the help of Optometrist&#39;s office, I was able to get an appointment that day with Dr., neuro ophthalmologist at 2:15pm on Wed, March 31. His office repeated numerous vision tests and confirmed the left eye vision loss (essentially the lower half excluding the center) and diagnosed it as a NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. With this diagnosis, there was no treatment, and I scheduled a follow-up for May 12. He said that my optic nerve into my left eye would slowly reduce its swelling over the next 6 to 8 weeks and in that time, my vision could remain the same, or improve. At that point, I didn&#39;t think it would worsen, but sadly that later happened. In addition to the the first MRI that PCP prescribed, Neuro ophthalmologist prescribed a second MRI of orbits, with and without contrast. He also suggested I begin taking a low dose Aspirin daily, which I did.   The next week, the blood work revealed a very slightly elevated cholesterol reading. I was told by my PCP on April 5 that this would normally not be considered as a problematic level of high cholesterol, but should be improved or lowered. The blood tests taken at Lab on Fri, April 2 revealed a LDL Chol, Calculated as 111, whereby &lt;100 was considered desirable range. Other than that, there was nothing of concern in my blood work. The two MRIs were done on April 9 and April 20, and did not reveal findings which doctors felt would have impacted my optic nerve swelling or had caused the eye stroke. Out of precaution, I scheduled to see a cardiologist on Tues, April 13. She recommended I start taking Crestor for cholesterol, and do a series of tests which I completed on Friday, April 23 - echocardiogram; holter monitor; transesophageal echocardiogram; and ultrasound carotid bilateral. As of today, Mon, April 26 I do not know the results of the cardio work-up, but both neuro ophthalmologists I saw felt that a problem related to my heart would not have caused this stroke in my eye.   Finally, on Fri, April 23 I had a consultation with a second highly recommended neuro ophthalmologist. After a series of vision tests, she agreed with other doctor&#39;s diagnosis of NAION - non arthritic ischemic optic neuropathy. She also said there was nothing I could do to treat except wait for the next 4 or more weeks for the optic nerve swelling to go down. She also confirmed my fear which was that my left eye vision had worsened since March 31 as my vision loss was no longer limited to the lower portion of my left eye, but now included blind spots throughout the upper range of my left eye vision, making my loss of peripheral vision worse and more widespread. She said in some cases with NAION, a patient&#39;s vision could remain the same, could improve or could worsen in the 6 to 8 weeks after the event. Four weeks after the March 26 event, by April 23 my left eye vision had worsened. I still hold out hope that it can improve some in the next four weeks... My right eye vision was not affected in any way, although one risk of NAION is that there is a 20% (?) chance it may recur in the next 5 years, and if it does, it most commonly affects the other, good eye.   None of the doctors I saw directly attributed my vision loss to the Moderna vaccine taken on March 24; however, there has also not been a clear cause determined by my doctors. While most of the doctors I saw seemed to think it coincidental, none also was able to absolutely rule it out either as a cause or a trigger. Dr. suggested I follow through with this idea, which other medical professionals suggested, to submit this vaccine adverse event report. Without a doubt, this was an adverse effect and/or problem that occurred soon after (36 hours approximately) taking the first dose of the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving vaccine I broke out in a cold sweat and was dizzy. That lasted for about ten minutes. The next day I woke up to pain running from the right side of my jaw to my right ear. The injection site in my right arm was more sore than any other vaccine shot I have ever had. The glands in my neck were swollen and my right side shoulder and neck area were sore. I experienced waves of fatigue over the next four days. The pain to my ear that seemed to mimic a really bad ear infection continued for six days. I went to the minute clinic at the Pharmacy where I received the shot and was checked out. There was nothing wrong with my ear and they could not find anything wrong with me other than my glands were swollen and I had a general amount of swelling on the right side of my next going into my shoulder. While the pain in my ear has lessened some it is still there now eight days after the vaccination. I have also experienced some GI issues. I am extremely regular and do not have issue going to the bathroom. My gut was not normal and I did not have normal bowl movements for more than a week. I also have had something akin to a rash on my arms that looks like prickly heat. It seemed to me that my immune system overreacted to the vaccine. I have contended for months now that I had Covid back in March of 2020 right before the shutdown. I believe I caught it during business travel at the very beginning of March 2020. My concern is whether I should get the second Moderna shot if my immune system is already this revved up with antibodies.

I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen for symptoms.  Body aches particularly my back and legs increased.  The next day, I was very fatigued, still had body aches, also headache.  I didn&#39;t have energy to get out of bed. Also had no appetite. The next day I had same symptoms, but felt slightly better that evening.  The following day I felt quite a bit better.

Back pain was significant enough to wake me up in the early morning. The abdominal pain required that I stand up as the pain intensified while laying prone. Abdominal pain resulted in difficulty breathing (unable to take full breaths without the pain intensifying). Abdominal pain subsided after 20 minutes, but the back pain continued into the next morning.

The patient was hospitalized from 06-Mar-2021 to 31-Mar-2021 due to ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE, BULBAR PALSY, DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY, ILEUS PARALYTIC, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS, PNEUMONIA and RESPIRATORY FAILURE. At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia), DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy), BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking) outcome was unknown and ILEUS PARALYTIC (a dynamic ileus) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-Mar-2021, Electromyogram: abnormal (abnormal) consistent with demyelinating neuropathy.. On 30-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported by investigator.  Patient was presented to hospital on 3/6/21 with progressive extremity weakness, bulbar weakness, and respiratory failure attributed to AIDP s/p 5days IVIG. He had received his first Moderna COVID vaccination approximately two weeks prior to this and immediately following administration began experiencing weakness and trouble walking. EMG 3/15/21 consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. Hospitalization was  complicated by the development of adynamic ileus which is improving and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (previously requiring O2 support). Patient was also treated for pneumonia with a 5 day course of azithromycin. Once medically stable he was deemed appropriate for inpatient rehabilitation and was transferred from Hospital to rehab on 3/31/21 under care. The patient tested negative COVID-19 on 3/30, and repeat testing since also has been negative.

I had an associate call 911, then I  administered a 0.3 mg Epinephrine IM, and 50 mg of oral liquid diphenhydramine. The ambulance service arrived and transported him to the local hospital while he remained alert and oriented.

                                                2 hours after injection I felt strong pain at the injection site as expected.  10 hours after injection I felt the expected side effects of tiredness, slight headache, sore body, and slight nausea.  I went to bed.  12 hours after injection I woke up in intense pain feeling very sick.  My entire body hurt on a scale of 10 out of 10.  My neck muscles especially were so tight that it was unbearable and beyond a 10 on pain scale.  I had a headache.  I felt very nauseous like I might vomit at any moment.  My breathing became shallow.  I had chills to the point that my teeth were chattering and I was shivering uncontrollably even though it was 76 degrees inside my home.  I considered calling an ambulance, but was hoping this would pass.  There we moments I felt I might die and I left my door unlocked so EMTs could get in as I was still on the verge of calling for help.  I was unable to sleep due to the intensity of pain.  I could not eat and drank very little.  Day 2 I was still in intense pain on a scale of 10 out of 10.  I had a fever for a short time on and off.  I did not eat for two days.  I was able to take naps for one hour at a time, but then would wake up to a crushing headache and intense neck pain.  The second night I was able to sleep, although I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat.  I would go from being extremely cold to sweating heavily feeling hot.  I eventually became very hungry but was afraid to eat and was still nauseous.  On day 3, the pain scale of my symptoms went down from 10 to 6.  I felt much better.  I was able to eat and drink well.  Day 4 I was not in pain but was exhausted and depleted.  Day 5 I felt I was recovered.  Please note:  I normally have a high pain threshold and I run up mountains and am used to pain.  I also have always had flu shots with no bad symptoms.  I am pro-vaccine.  But something went horribly wrong with this 2nd Moderna vaccine shot.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose, I spiked a fever of 101, felt body aches and chills. This lasted for about 1 day. On day 3, I woke with stiff, achy and sore joints in my right hand. On day 4, these symptoms remained in my right hand and moved to my left. Over the next week, stiff joints moved into my toes. EXTREME FATIGUE and mental fogginess also developed as did blood pressure spikes. On week 2, move joints started aching including knees, elbows and shoulder. On week 3, my fingers were so sore and stiff it became difficult to use door knobs. I contacted a virtual doctor to ask for direction. He assumed in was side effects and prescribed me Diclofenance Sodium 75 mg for pain. Two days later, I went to the emergency room as the pain, fatigue and fogginess was becoming very concerning. On week 4, I was finally able to see my family doctor. He assumes it is a overactive immune response to the vaccine and prescribe Prednisone 20 mg to overcome the symptoms. The course of Prednisone has decress the severity of my symptoms but on week 5 I continue to have stiff, painful joints, mental fogginess.

                                                1. After FIRST dose, I had reaction within 30-40 seconds where I found it difficult to catch my breath, felt like I might pass out, my palms were sweating profusely, &amp; I experienced tingling in my extremities.  These symptoms resolved themselves within a few minutes, with the tingling resolving in about an hour or so.(no more noticeable reactions after that) 2. After SECOND dose, ...no immediate reaction like the first time, but arm hurt, as expected for the next couple of days.  I didn&#39;t notice any side effects until, 06/03, which was about 8-9 days later.    So I was running at about mile 4(I am a trail runner), when something just didn&#39;t feel right around my heart...some tightness, even some pain across shoulder blades.  I continued the run...turned into a run/walk.  I continued my day, with something feeling a little off and experienced some night sweats, &amp; poor sleep.  I went a couple more days and then on Sunday I went to the local Immediate Care.  They did an EKG &amp; sent me to ER.  At the ER, they did an EKG, and wanted me to stay to be monitored over nite.  At that time, I did NOT feel bad enough to stay, so I left with the agreement that I would return on Monday to do a Stress Echo on my heart.  HOWEVER, upon getting home and having a bowl of soup, I experienced what I would call my first episode.  Upon getting off the couch, my heart started beating unusually fast, it became VERY difficult to breathe, and I thought I was having a heart attack.  Long story short, I drove back to the ER, they checked me in, did another EKG, a chest X-Ray, a chest CT-Scan, admitted me overnite, where they drew blood every 4 hours, and attached me to a heart monitor for roughly 12-16 hours.  The next day they also performed a heart stress-echo.  Everything came back normal.    Since that time, I have had roughly 4-5 of those major episodes, with some smaller ones as well.  I went back to Hospital ER on 06/19/2021 with another episode that I felt was worse than the original one.  Again, they did an EKG, a chest X-Ray, various blood tests, and everything came back normal.    Amongst all of this, I have seen my Family Doctor twice, and a cardiologist once. Hospital performed a heart Calcium test, which came back with a score of six. I believe the range where medium risk of a heart attack comes in is around 100-200.  I have also been put on a Holter heart monitor, of which I have a week left of a two week assignment.  I haven&#39;t had a major episode in about a week and a half now, but I also stopped eating chocolate and given up all caffeine about a week and a half ago.  All of that said, I still have tightness in my chest, as well as just an odd feeling there. Other symptoms I am having include being light-headed, dizziness at times, and, more concerning, tingling and numbness in my extremities.  The tingling &amp; numbness are primarily in my fingers, hands, and forearms.  In addition, twice my index finger on my right hand has turned blue/purple, but ultimately returned to normal color after 24 hours or so.  Finally, It is very difficult to get sleep.  It seems my heart tries to wake me up every 2-3 hours to let me know something is not right.  I can feel an unusual feeling almost immediately after lying down.  I really can&#39;t even explain the feeling in my chest, but I have never had this feeling before, and have never had sleep issues.  In summary, I WAS a 52 year old man with no history of any heart problems, a fairly avid runner with a resting heart rate between 40 and 50, and no history of dizziness, tingling, or numbness in my extremities.  After the 2nd dos of Moderna, I now have stopped running, have a myriad of symptoms as mentioned above, and my life has been flipped on its head for a month now,....moreover, I am getting little relief.  I need help.

This spread to involve pain throughout the posterior upper arm for about 6 days before resolving. Did get moderate relief with use of ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q 8 hrs PRN. Received vaccine on 12/23/20 at 6pm.  Woke up at 5am to go to work on 12/24/20 and felt flu-like symptoms with subjective fever (did not measure), joint pain, and diffuse myalgias.  Symptoms progressed over the next three hours and culminated in about half an hour of significant rigors with uncontrolled shivering.  Ibuprofen dose of 600mg orally did help symptoms enough to allow me to finish my shift but I needed two more doses every 8 hours before symptoms resolved in 24 hrs.

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

                                                The patient had a very severe side effect profile from the second dose of vaccine:  &#34;worst I&#39;ve ever felt&#34; with myalgia, headache, fever and fatigue.  This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.   This appears to be immune mediated myocarditis from the Moderna vaccine

I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed.

Move or swallow. It lasted for three weeks until two days after the second dose of the vaccine. I was prescribed two courses of antibiotics , Cephalexin and Doxycycline ,  which only helped a little.  I had gotten an insect bite the week before vaccination. I also had a CT scan after the second dose of vaccination but the pain had gone by then.

                                                This was my 1st shot of the Moderna Covid vaccine. I was fine after the shot was made but as the evening came towards the night, I started having the chills, lots of shivering and a slight fever (99 degrees). It felt as if I was having Covid again.  I took 2 - 500 mgs of Tylenol Extra Strength as a precaution in case it got worse.  The next day I felt very tired throughout the day and at night time I didn&#39;t feel as bad as the 1st night but I felt nauseous and muscle pains everywhere so I took another 2 Tylenols, it got better then went to sleep.

Fatigue has set in and is still present.  VERY tired all the time.  All I want to do is sleep.  Dizziness all morning.  Taking about 2 to 3 hours for dizziness to go away.  But present again at intervals during the day then again the next day.  This has gone on since day two of shot.  Dry mouth.  I am drinking LOTS of water.

                                                I was woken up middle of the night with unbearable pain in my lower back on Sunday morning, 1am. There was no activity that cause the flair, and the pressure in my lower spine (just above tailbone)  felt like my lower back would burst. The shock to my spinal system each time my back seized,  caused the pain to shoot from a steady 2 straight to a 10 on the pain scale, and I was losing complete motor function temporarily. I was treated by Dr. on 5/29. I was given some pain medication and steroid injection cocktail, and a Rx  of Methylprednisolone and Cyclobenzaprine. This is helping considerably. I can function almost normally now, but even while taking the medication, I can still feel a lot of pressure. I believe I am recovering, but until I am off the medication, I will not know for certain. Please ask me for a follow-up in a month or so.

                                                At 5:30 pm.  I was unable to stand up and walk.  It attached my knee joints and leg muscles.  I took a Vicodin and 2 extra strength Tylenol  and after 1 1/2 hours I was able to walk but still with some pain and problems.   I then started to take 800 mg of Ibuprofen and 2 extra strength Tylenol  3 times a day and was able to function but with some discomfort.  Day 4 I woke up in the middle of the night and was unable to feel my arms and not able to move my hands and fingers. They were numb and Tingley.    I had to press them together and once I manually moved them they were able to move a little and then I tried to squeeze and rub them against my legs and then I was able to start to move them.   That continued until day 10 when i got a steroid pack from the Dr and took that Saturday morning around 5 am an by that afternoon or the 5th pill then majority of the symptoms where gone.  Starting day 2 everything was back to normal.   I finished my does on Wed 4/29 and everything was fine.  Then on May 2nd  in the evening the symptoms started to appear again but not as sever.  The arm and finger numbness when I&#39;m sleeping   comes back and with taking the ibuprofen and Tylenol has helped during the day along with moving them has helped but my hands feel really bruised.  I just put a call in to my Dr again to see if there is anything else we can do.

                                                This was my second dose of Moderna (there was no side effect for the first dose).  The side effects were very strong: fever, headache, and body pain (mostly my lower back), and overall weakness. It started about 12 hours after I received the shot and lasted about 30 hours.  What prompted me to file this report was the intensity of pain. It&#39;s excruciating. It&#39;s debilitating. I couldn&#39;t even stand straight. It felt worse than the flu. I have always been physically active and healthy my whole life.  I didn&#39;t go to the doctor because I knew there would be side effects (but I didn&#39;t expect it to be this powerful).

No Medical History information was reported.    On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PAROSMIA (smelled an antiseptic smell / smells a chemicals all day and night/still persisting) (seriousness criterion medically significant), SKIN ODOUR ABNORMAL (showered and still smelled it/showered and still smelled it\ band-aid smell) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and MYALGIA (Arm has minor soreness) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, PAROSMIA (smelled an antiseptic smell / smells a chemicals all day and night/still persisting) had not resolved and SKIN ODOUR ABNORMAL (showered and still smelled it/showered and still smelled it\ band-aid smell) and MYALGIA (Arm has minor soreness) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medication was reported. The treatment information was unknown.  This patient is going to continue to call Moderna until he gets a call back from the Safety department. Patient is very frustrated and bothered that Moderna has not made more information public even though millions of vaccines have been administered.  He feels he is in a rare side effect group and that this information should be taken more serious.  He has seen a specialist regarding his side effect which has not gone away after his first vaccine over 90 days ago.  He states he &#34;smells a chemical smell all day and night, it started immediately after receiving the vaccine&#34;.  This has been the worst experience for this patient and he wishes he never got the vaccine.

                                                a 52 y.o. male sent for evaluation due to symptoms which have now lasted for months and began occurring shortly after he received his second Materna vaccine.  He had his first Madrona vaccine on 3/26/2021, and his second vaccine on 4/23/2021.  Initially he noted headaches, neuralgia, chills and sweats, and just suspected these would dissipate as had been described in the media.  His headaches and neuralgia did resolve, but he continued to have significant night sweats and fatigue.  He had one episode where he passed out and struck his head.  This has not recurred for over a month.  He has had 2 episodes of vomiting bilious material these were significantly spread out.  He has noted a 20 pound weight loss and difficulty sleeping.  He does report that in the last few days his symptoms seem to have improved, and his appetite has improved as well, but he has not noticed any weight gain yet.  He did have low-grade fevers the highest being in the 101 range.  He had no visual, taste, pulmonary, genitourinary, rheumatological, or dermatological complaints.  Apart from the 2 episodes of vomiting he has had no GI issues.  His wife is present and concurs with his history.  He has had a significant work-up from his primary care provider who included an LDH in late May that was normal, CBC with differential which was benign, a Monospot which was negative, CRP that was elevated at 85 with 0-10 being the reference range, a negative ANA, negative RA, and a sedimentation rate of 42, blood cultures were performed and were negative.  Labs earlier in the month noted similar findings.  His basic metabolic panel and liver enzymes were also normal.  He was also reportedly screened for Lyme and was negative but I do not see this test result.   He denies any childhood infections of significance. The also went to a safari in 2019.  They traveled recently prior to the onset of his symptoms but he reports no known bites or scratches by ticks, insects, mosquitoes, or other animals.  No one else in the household has been sick.  He did receive the BCG vaccine as a child.  They also report a chest x-ray was performed and was benign.  He was given a 10-day course of amoxicillin and reports no significant improvement while on this.

It went on for 2-3 weeks, I was doing telehealth doctor appointments where I was told to take ibuprofen and anti-inflammatory medicines. I was not getting better from the virtual appointments; I went to my PCP he prescribed Tramadol for pain management I only take once a day as needed. I was referred to ortho. I had an X-ray done and now waiting to start physical therapy.

                                                I got the vaccine on 1/7/2021 and 3 hours later I felt a severe burning pain in my upper right quadrant . It felt like I was being squeezed in a vice and electrocuted at the same time . The pain was unreal. I also experienced a spasm in the area. The only that helped me was 30 days of steroids. The problem is still ongoing. I am taking pregabalin and baclofen for the pain and stiffness. I finally got some relief by March 2021. As of today my right side and ribs still hurt. Also my spine is very painful. My life has been ruined by this vaccine. I have been crippled by this product.

                                                About 4 hrs later a headache set in.  18hrs after first shot, lethargic, whole body sore, massive headache, could hardly get out of bed.  4-5 days after this second injection... i was almost back to normal with the exception that my right shoulder still hurt a lot when lifting, putting pressure on my arm (example, lifting myself out of bed), etc.  I am NOT referring to injection site.  Never had a problem with the injection site.  I&#39;m referring to the actual shoulder joint.    To this day... and the reason I&#39;m doing this report... I&#39;m still having serious issues with my right shoulder.  I still do not have full range/motion.  Lifting objects, trying to reach behind my back, trying to lift myself when sliding down under the covers when going to bed... all hurt.  Shoulder joint also hurts randomly throughout the day for no apparent reason and simple things like Tylenol, Aleve and Ibuprofen do not help.  Left hip is also an issue... but less than the shoulder at this time.     I have also started to have &#34;memory&#34; issues which is new.  Randomly over the past 4 weeks i have found myself driving to work or the store or somewhere else and for no apparent reason, i have this sense of being lost and it takes a minute, maybe 2 before i realize exactly where i am.  Today, i had a strange issue where i was on my cellphone at work and i made a comment to the person i was talking to, that i lost my work phone.  It was not until i hung up the phone that i realized i was on the phone!    That is not right!  That is not normal!  And that takes being a bit absent minded at times since the first shot, to a whole new level!  Prior to vaccinations... i never ever had a problem with my right shoulder or left hip.  No memory or cognizant issues either.

My left hip from the waist down into the left knee hurt a lot.  I kept joking to my wife that i need a hip replacement and a new shoulder.  4 days after first injection... i was back to normal with the exception that my right shoulder still hurt a lot when lifting, putting pressure on my arm (example, lifting myself out of bed), etc.  I also lost some motion in my right arm.  I do not have full range of motion anymore due to pain.  I also continue to have issues with my left hip with chronic pain that comes and goes, from the waist line down into the left knee.   I dont know if there will be a question about the 2nd shot.  So just in case... the 2nd dose was Moderna LOT #036C21A and was administered on 5/27/21 at about 1pm.  Same set of symptoms as the first shot... headache within 4hrs... lethargic the next morning, felt sick, could not leave bed, etc.  However... this time it lasted almost 6 days.  To this day... and the reason i&#39;m doing this report... i&#39;m still having serious issues with my right shoulder.  I still do not have full range/motion.  Lifting objects, trying to reach behind my back, trying to lift myself when sliding down under the covers when going to bed... all hurt.  Shoulder also hurts randomly throughout the day for no apparent reason.  Left hip is also an issue...   Prior to vaccinations... i never ever had a problem with my right shoulder or left hip.  I did with the left knee... but not the hip nor the right shoulder.

While having dinner on the second day, one alcoholic beverage was consumed with an immediate response of high fever ( 101.6) and body aches.  Maybe a warning not to consume alcohol would be appropriate for at least 2=3 day following Covid vaccination ?   Note ( Same reaction reported to me by co-worker after the event and after they had also consumed alcohol ).

This lasted for approximately 5 minutes. Upon getting out of bed this followed by approx. 2-3 minutes of light headedness. Joints in both elbows and wrists are sore, more so on the left side.

                                                I had Covid-19 in March/2020.  The 1st series vaccine symptoms were similar to main infection to a lesser degree.  Headache/BodyAches/On and off fevers/fatigue/right and left leg stiffness and major muscle/joint pain/on and off rapid heart rate Vaccine at 11:00am/Symptoms started around 7:00pm with tingling arm that received vaccine.  By bedtime I was suffering from chills and general body aches.  Woke up next morning with fever at 100.3, major pain/aching in both legs/general body aching and pain and headache.  The fever came and went for 24 hours.  On day two after the vaccine I woke up with no systems but was majorly fatigued.  I took 800mg of Advil every 6 hours of onset until end of symptoms.  I also had taken 2 Tylenol 2 hours before the initial vaccine.

My muscle twitching has not stopped and has spread to my legs and left hand and arms.   2.  Day 2  felt  soreness at injection site and weakness to my legs and arms that remains as of 3.14.21.   3.  Day 14 developed bad right sciatical pain that lasted 1 day and resolved on its own. 4.  Day 21 developed restless leg syndrome x 1 day and resolved on its own 5.   Day 25  developed severe body trembling  arms andl egs and severe anxiety at night, I could not sleep x 2 nights. 6.   Day 32 developed  a very faint inner tremor that I feel when I get out of bed.  I also found out I have poor balance when standing on one leg or trying to wak a straight line.  Also, my twitching muscles are more often and a little bit stronger.  My anxiety has increased greatly because I dont know why this is happening after getting the Moderna injection

                                                I tested positive for covid on 1/08/21. I had the Moderna vaccine 1st dose 4/12/21 at 8:30am. No significant immediate reaction to the vaccine. Pain worsened at the injection point, but never significant, slight headache, tired, mild flu symptoms grew through the day. At 9:30PM I experienced Fever(101.6 at around midnight after fever had broke was probably higher between 9:30PM and 11:30pm). I experienced chills and violent shaking from approximately 9:30pm to 11:30pm, as bad or worse then the original covid from January. I was unable to sleep and finally took 2 Advil 200mg each at 3:00am. Advil helped and eventually fell asleep around 3:30am. Online information suggests that the 2nd dose generally has more severe reactions. I am concerned how much worse it will be and considering not getting the 2nd dose scheduled for May 10. Tuesday April 13 I experienced slight headache, body aches and exhaustion in the afternoon. Took Nyquil  severe cold and flu Tuesday evening and sleep well. Wednesday experienced lesser symptoms. Thursday had lower back and kidney area soreness. Friday april 15 back to normal.

                                                Patient manifested with flu-like symptoms (myalgias, fatigue, cough, abdominal discomfort, shortness of breath) with high-grade fevers (TMax 103F) approximately 4-6 hours following administration of 2nd Moderna vaccine on 5/4/2021 per patient&#39;s wife. The symptoms progressively worsened to the point that he presented to an outside hospital on 5/12/2021 at which time he was found to be tachycardic and febrile (T 103.1F). Labs at that time were notable for significant thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, elevated procalcitonin. Chest imaging showed bilateral airspace disease. CT of the abdomen noted hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Labs on 5/13/2021 were notable for a markedly elevated ferritin level, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, elevated CRP, elevated transaminase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, markedly elevated CXCL-9 level, markedly elevated IL-18 level, normal natural killer cell function. Of note, while his blood and urine cultures were negative, he was found to have elevated EBV viral load on peripheral blood draw. He had a bone marrow biopsy which reportedly showed rare evidence of cells with what appeared to be erythrocytes within their cytoplasm, concerning for HLH.  Given strong clinical and serological suspicion for HLH, he was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility on 5/18/2021, his inflammatory markers were persistently elevated. He unfortunately developed worsened renal and respiratory failure, and required both hemodialysis and intubation respectively. He was continued on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, however we additionally initiated high-dose steroids as well as anakinra for treatment of HLH. Given EBV viremia, we also began rituximab therapy. He was successfully extubated, however as of 5/26/2021 remains dialysis-dependent with continued improvement in urinary output. His post-intubation course has been complicated by encephalopathy of unknown etiology. We have consulted infectious disease to proceed with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to ascertain potential CNS pathogens explaining the cause of his altered mental status. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of pathology. CNS involvement by HLH remains on our differential.

                                                I got my second shot of mederna on april 2  at about 130 pm, I got the shot and felt fine for about 4 hours at which time I got so tired and dizzy I felt like I was going to pass out, so I stopped what I was doing and went to bed. I slept for 4 hours and woke up in a pool of sweat and was so wet it was like I had just gotten out of the shower. I had the chills and felt cold in 84 Deg F, I went down stairs drank power aid and got out and set up a space heater and sat in front of it with it blowing the hot air on me but had hot and cold flashes, a mild head ach and joint stiffness and pain. I was only able to stay up for 4 hours before I was so exhausted I had to back to sleep and woke up the same way, this continued for the entire weekend. By monday morning my urine was so yellow it was almost black in color, I called my PCP office, they called me back and advised I go to the emergency room asap. I called my parents and got a ride to the hospital emergency room. I told intake what happened and sat down to be called in, they called me in 1 time then had me wait for diagnostic testing, I got vary dizzy just sitting their watching the tv. By the time they called me in for testing I told them I felt vary noxious and ended up passing out on the nurse after they took my blood. They transferred me from that chair to a bed in the blue pod, gave me nausea medication and hooked me up too 2 vary large IV bags and ran them at the same time. Then being up for 4 hours then sleeping for 4 hours and waking up wet in a pool of sweat continued for 6 days in total. the hot and cold flashes and sitting in front of a space heater went on for 12 days in total. waking up in a pool of sweat went on for about 28 - 30 days in total decreasing in severity along the course of time. The only side effect I still have is my sleep is all screwed up now. If I stay up untill 4 am I will sleep to 10;30 then wake up tired and stay in bed untill 11;30  am. if I go to bed at 2 am I wake up at 6;30 am have to use the bath room then can not go back to sleep for at least a hour then do not wake up untill 11 30 am. Normally, I used to goto bed at 2 -3 am and wake up at 9 -10 am every day.  on wednesday april 7 th, the doctors office which is part of the same group as the hospital called me to go over the results from the emergency room, but the person calling did not seem to know I had called them on monday morning or they had called me back to tell me to go to the emergency room, so I do not know how much of a help the PCP will be,  but I have proof of that in the phone call records.  MY PCP is no longer with the practice, so I had to choose a new one

Frontal headache lingered for about 10 days along with general fatigue.  Also experienced elevated hear rate on runs by &#43;20bpm compared to same runs prior to second dose.  Since the second dose dose, I?ve experienced monthly episodic frontal headaches requiring ibuprofen to treat and some issues with blood glucose levels. These events are some what transient in that they resolve within a day.  Prior to second dose, I rarely experienced headaches, NMT 1/yr and rarely requiring treatment with NASAID.

                                                I received my second dose on 4/24/21.  On 4/29/21 I had a required annual EKG.  The test indicated abnormal (inverted) T waves.  This was very uncharacteristic.  The abnormal EKG triggered a nuclear stress test and echocardiogram, conducted several weeks later.  All normal.  I&#39;m fit and active for may age and in otherwise good health.  I had an additional issue on the same date as the abnormal EKG.  Foot pain and swelling in the right foot, and four weeks later, the left foot.  The rheumatologist&#39;s diagnosis is gout with appropriate treatment plan, but tests are inconclusive.

I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

                                                Pain at injection site for about 3 days post vaccination. Slight headache for about 3 days post injection which made it hard to concentrate. Fatigue and muscle  ache for about 2 days post vaccination. Hot flashes since the vaccination and still happening. Had problem with them when I originally found out my thyroid was not properly regulated. Been on synthroid for over 3 years and only happened a few times a year since my thyroid levels have been regulated. Since vaccine they have been happening a few times a day and  also at night when sleeping. Checked my temp during episode and it is normal around 98.6 or below. Explanation of symptoms are  flushed, sweaty, HOT even when it is cold inside almost like there is an inner fire going on inside me

                                                After the vaccination  on 1/18/2021 , I had just pain at the site of injection in my left arm for the next 2   to 3 days  and headache.  Took Advil and it went away. After 3 or 4 days i started feeling very mild pain inside my arm muscles between  the injection site and my elbow  which continued till 1/25/2021.   Later this  very mild internal pain shifted  to my elbow  and   feel a mild numbing sensation in my pinky finger.  It also feels little heavy when I move my arm.  This  continues till  today as I am reporting on 1/30/2021 3:30pm.  Since it has not bothered much , I did not seek medical care, hoping this will  go away in few weeks.

On 27th - felt better; but my foot (right ball, top of foot and big toe and toe right next to big toe) started swelling up. I went to the Dr. - gave me meds for the swelling (Prednisone)(I don&#39;t have a history of gout). It went away and I was fatigued for two weeks. That went away and then got my second dose (on January 19th) my toe swelled up again and they tested it this time and it was URIC acid for gout.

But the adverse symptoms started about 5 hours in or so, i developed a cough, and dyspnea, it was tight in my chest, hard to breathe.  the cough was/is (it remains), sometimes hard and raspy, i was a bit wheezy, and I had air hunger, like i could not breathe or get air.  if i exhale to strongly i cough, if i talk to much i cough, if i sing i cough, if i inhale too deeply i cough.  I also have been very dizzy since the shot and vertigo.  I am still coughing and it is 5 days post shot.    I started developing headache and severe body pain, pain in  my spine, low back and joints.  which is expected, but i also had scalp pain and it hurt to be even touched the slightest bit on my scalp and everywhere on my body.  I had very stiff neck and eye socket pain as well.  I also feel &#34;funny&#34; in my head.  LIke dizzy, and vertigo, but also like it is wrapped in a heavy towel and my eyes feel heavy and like i can&#39;t see well.  my vision is as if it has diminshed.    5 hours after shot cough started, and the dyspnea, i started feeling chills and deep squeezing ache in my arm at jab site, and soon had fever of 100.6, over night it went to 100.8 and i felt terrible, headache, body ache, restless.  but next day fever was 102.  it remained all day, i had zero energy slept the whole day.  no appetite, did not eat anything except a scramble egg which made me nausea.  fever remained all day at 101.8. over night.  next day temp was 99.8 (my normal is 97.6) and it was 99.8 all day.  Cough was persistent and really bad with the dyspnea this whole time and i still have cough 5 days out, just giving a timeline here.  by friday, my temp was 98 but i felt extreemly fatigued.  I went and got a covid test which was negative.  i saw the chiropractor and they helped my back and headache a little bit.  went home and rested.  cough has lingered, dizzy lingers, chest tight and sob lingers.  fatigue lingers.   Cough and dyspnea are NOT signs, the sheet i got for V-safe says right on it these are NOT expected.

                                                Patient had usual post vaccination myalgias and lethargy for a few days after injection.  These resolved spontaneously.  However, about a week after vaccination he developed recurrent fevers 102°F.  He also had complaints of body aches and bilateral jaw pain.  He had extensive evaluation including laboratory testing for infectious etiologies of his fever and none was identified.  He was noted to have very high sed rate and CRP.  When no specific etiology for his fevers could be identified we decided to proceed with a short course of prednisone which did seem to help his fever and jaw pain.  After prednisone was stopped he had recurrence of fever and developed worse jaw pain and pain at the base of his neck. I examined him in clinic and found that he had a tender swollen thyroid.  I directed him to the emergency department where CT scanning of his neck confirmed evidence of thyroiditis.  TSH was undetectable and free T4 was about 2 times higher than normal.  He was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis.  However, his symptomatology seemed quite dramatic for subacute thyroiditis, and the timing in relation to his vaccination is concerning for possible adverse vaccine reaction.

                                                First symptoms to appear were noticeably sore right arm and fatigue about six hours after injection.  About eleven hours after shot I had headache, feeling of irregular body temperature, nausea, body aches..  I took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea which helped.    About 24 hours after the injection I experienced sore armpit/lymph nodes of shot arm.   All but the symptoms except the sore armpit/lymph nodes  were mostly gone within 30 hours of the shot.  The lymph nodes felt better a day or two later.

                                                after about 30 minutes, I started having a metallic taste in my mouth.  I was also experiencing soreness in left arm area.   After about an hour, the pain in my arm started to feel as though it was spreading to my left chest cavity area.  I then started to get chest pains in the left breast area to the armpit area, but not severe, just concerning.  After probably 70-80 minutes, I started feeling drowsy.  I continued to feel drowsy all evening and did not sleep well.  I woke up and could not return to sleep at 4:45am.  My normal waking time is 6:00am.  I had/have quite a bit of soreness in my arm, but nothing unbearable.  No signs of rash or inflammation around injection sight.  I am taking a sick day from work to relax and recover from loss of sleep.  The metallic taste persist, but only an annoyance and taste seems to be normal when eating or drinking.  A slight achiness in joints, but a cold front was also moving in, which can cause me to have the same effect.

I had my girlfriend look at my back she stated i had some red large pimples on my back.  The next morning I had hives on my chest between my right and left breast,  hives on my left side lats and my back area.  The hives itched burned, and were a bit painful.  I used alovera and witch hazel wipes and hydrocortisone.  As of today 3/22/21  I&#39;m feeling a little better and i have an appointment with my primary care 3/23/21.

                                                Beginning at 11:30 PM I began to experience chills. I spiked a fever throughout the night and slept very little. Beginning around 2 PM I experienced aching joints comparable to arthritis. About that time I also began to experience sinus congestion and pain Which was similar to having a significant sinus infection. By 8 AM the fever was beginning to break but the aches and sinus congestion remained, and stomach pain arose. Throughout the day, there were episodes of fever. Stomach pain resolved around noon. Congestion and aches and fever were largely resolved by 4pm, at which time two Tylenol were taken, with only occasional low fever episodes. I slept well that night and felt fine the following morning.

                                                Shot was on Friday morning. Right leg developed severe unmanageable muscular pain through upper hamstring and calf muscles; affecting ability to walk and put weight on the leg. Leg pain developed within 24 hours of shot; became increasingly more severe at 96 hours. Was taking Ibuprofen 400 mg 2x day. As a result I went to the emergency room Monday morning. Their diagnosis was muscle pain consistent with a slipped disk. The ran blood work to look at inflammation markers; one was slightly elevated. By Tuesday morning the pain had drastically receded; and by Wednesday (today) it is mostly back to normal.

This is the sickest I&#39;ve felt in decades, maybe my entire life.  Oh, and my injection site hurt too.  The night of the shot, and the day after, were the worst.  I&#39;m writing this on the morning of day 2.  Today, the fever, body aches, and joint pain are gone.  I still have a headache (but it&#39;s better than yesterday), fatigue, and injection site pain.  After my first Moderna shot, I had a slight headache and fatigue the following day, but this second shot really kicked my ass.

                                                Muscle tightness - soreness - at the arm with the injection and it was for about three and five days. Maybe about 2 weeks from vaccine -  I had some congestion (nasal congestion and sneezing) - it was odd (not allergies) and it lasted a solid with heavy heavy drainage and that lasted about two days. I had to use the Mucinex D for it. Then I had the nose bleed - it wouldn&#39;t stop bleeding in right nostril. I went to ER - Sunday, the 28th - started at 10:30 pm and after midnight on the 29th it was after 4 hours of bleeding when  I went to ED in town. The doctor said my nasal passages were really dry because of the weather. I was using a travel CPAP that doesn&#39;t have a humidifier.  They cleared a giant clot in the back of my throat - it was the size of a hamburger - it was huge. They used a nasal vasodilator - it looked like nasal spray and they did it and stopped. Vitals were stable and they sent me home. I might have one bloody nose after  - a week after and they had given me the nasal vasodilator and that stopped it. They also prescribed a nasal saline spray and I only use the CPAP with the humidifier now.

I went to an urgent care place and they put me on muscle relaxants and pain killers. That didn&#39;t help and then went to an Orthopedist last week and will start physical therapy.

Symptoms started with a sharp pain in my back left side rib area, followed later in the day by spots starting to form, then over the next 24-48 hours a medium sized band of Shingles rashes has spread to cover left torso from back to stomach area.  Soreness, pain and itching standard to Shingles have been experienced.  Pain is bearable but one or two nights made it difficult to sleep.  The shingles seem to be progressing as they should and they have stopped spreading after a week.  Just wanted to identify a possible link to the Moderna shot causing Shingles.  Maybe if enough reports come in, a recommendation for 50&#43; year olds would be to get the Shingles vaccine first then get the Covid19 shot.

                                                Had pain in my shoulder (and  neck on my left side) as soon as the shot went in. At roughly three hours after the shot, I felt I was slurring my speech (I had to make a very concerted effort to make proper sentences and not slur) and was very dizzy. I also was having a hard time with lights. For example, I was unable to look in the mirror in my bathroom as the lights above the mirror were too bright for me. At three hours after the shot, I had severe pain in my left shoulder. Overall, I felt as I had been sedated or drugged. I tried walking to the nearest convenience store to get some food and I felt I was experiencing vertigo. Several days after the vaccine I had a slight cough and sore throat. I am still experiencing a slight cough on some day sand a slight sore throat.   I had a subtle red patch in the left shoulder area a couple days after the shot. Eight or nine days after the shot, I had covid arm and had a very visible red patch on my left shoulder. I have pictures of this.  I have been feeling very tired and dizzy ever since the first shot. My glands in my neck under my jaw line are also swollen. I do not know if it is either  wise or safe for me to get the second shot, which is scheduled for this Friday as it seems that I still have not recovered from the first shot. Can my immune system really take another round of this?  There are a couple other things that I have noticed. I don&#39;t seem to be thinking very clearly and I have noticed a remarkable number of type-os and poor syntax in emails that I send at work; this is not normal for me.   Finally, after the shot, I noticed that my muscles, when doing a little exertion such as pushups, would build lactic acid quicker and more blood seemed to be delivered to my working muscles. I still have not regained my strength and tire more easierly when playing tennis or hitting against the tennis wall, for example. This is also not normal and not how I felt before the first injection.

During the 15 minute waiting period after the vaccine; he reported that his chest, back and torso felt tight and almost felt if he were having muscle spasms. We called the squad and had him sit down to rest. He said it felt better to stand and he tried relieving the discomfort by stretching his lower back.  We checked his blood pressure (131/90) and asked if he wanted a bottle of water.  He said that the feeling was beginning to fade and by the time the squad arrived; he said the felling had passed and he felt fine.

                                                Within 2 hours of dose he experienced severe leg pain and by evening had a severe case of what he thought was laryngitis. Leg pain continued to get worse until Friday and he couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Patient went to ER on Sunday morning because the pain was so severe he couldn&#39;t walk. The pain was in his knees, lower legs, ankles, and feet.  The ER doctor sent him to hospital to be admitted.  The patient was in hospital for 6 days.  The patient was given pain meds and a rheumatologist was called in and she diagnosed him with gout.  they treated him with 4 doses of Anakinra.  That medication helped.  The patient currently is in pain if he is walking around pain level between a 5-8.  The pain is less if he remains seated.  He experiences the most discomfort when standing from a seated position mostly in his knees.

                                                Note: May 24, 2021 the pharmacy that administered the COVID vaccines contacted me with some billing questions. When I mentioned my severe reactions, they told me they were filing a report upon my behalf. When done they told me it was the VAERS system and gave me a reference number (Ref-531994). I decided that not enough information would be in that report so wanted to submit myself because of my severe reaction and hospitalization. My PCP was not involved until after hospital for a follow up and I was seen by numerous doctors there, so I have no easy single POC until I dig more.

                                                Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in right lower leg.  Symptoms initially occurred about two days after feeling sick with a high fever.  Initially, the pain in the right calf muscle was thought to be a muscle or tendon strain.  On May 22nd, during a campout, there was pain along the entire right leg, but at the time I thought it was just related to lower back pain from sleeping on the ground.  On May 27 and 28th there was sharp pain at the bottom of my right foot, then on May 29th I noticed sweeling and a hard warm spot just above the inside right ankle.  I reported to a local urgent care clinic first  then was referred to Medical ER.

                                                I started to feel more and more tired kind of lethargic. I went to see my doctor after the first shot because I thought it was stress related from work. I let my doctor know I felt run down. He had some labs done to rule out anything that may be going on. He ultimately ruled everything out as fatigue. After the 2nd shot it was getting harder to sit still my back was bothering me and I was experiencing back pain. I thought it may have been related to a previous back injury from a car accident I had years ago. The tightness got more intense I went to visit my chiropractor and the pain did not get better. I went to see my rheumatologist and I did not need a cortisone shot in my knee for the first time in 3 years. I let him know that I had difficulty standing from my chair. I explained I need to push off in order to stand up. He determined I had myositis. I had an MRI completed and other labs he let me know I had polymyositis. After my first visit Dr. called in a prescription for prednisone and hydroxychloroquine. I went to see Dr. the following business. When I go down the stairs I have to hold the handrail and it is more difficult to walk upstairs.  My doctor asked me if I had recently fallen because polymyositis is normally associated with a fall. But I have not fallen as I have been working from home. I had also experienced shortness of breath which I had checked out on 6/22/2021 at Urgent Care in. They recommended I have a CTA completed to rule out PE in my lungs.

                                                54 year old male with no  known past medical history who received 2nd dose of his Moderna COVID vaccine at the end of May 2021 (unsure of actual date). The day after he received his second moderna vaccine he developed polydipsia, polyuria and substantial fatigue in addition to muscle aches, nausea, and malaise. His symptoms initially improved but then slowly worsened again, developing shortness of breath, palpitations, heat intolerance, and continued polyuria, polydipsia. Three days prior to presenting to our hospital (which was 3 weeks after his 2nd vaccine dose), pt developed worsening nausea with vomiting and substantial worsening of shortness of breath.  On admission to our hospital, he was found to be in Diabetic ketoacidosis (no prior history of Diabetes, auto-immune Diabetes labs pending) as well has having new pulmonary embolism, Atrial fibrillation with RVR, and hyperthyroidism with anti-tpo abs (other&#39;s thyroid antibodies still pending). Given the time course of his presentation, it seems to us that he developed these conditions as a complication of his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

IT FELT AS IF I WAS BEING SQUEEZED.   I DID NOT HAVE A COUGH, FEVER, OR OTHER ASSOCIATED  S/SX.  IT JUST FEELS AS MY CHEST IS IN A VICE.  ON THE 3RD,,4TH AND 5TH DAY POST VACCINE ADMINSTRATION, THE SENSATION OF CHEST SQUEEZING HAS NOT RESOLVED COMPLETELY.  THE REASON I AM REPORTING THIS OCCURRENCE IS THAT SEVERAL CO-WORKERS THAT RECEIVED THE SAME MODERNA VACCINE HAVE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.

On the morning of the 6th day, 1/21/21, I had very intense deep muscle pain in my lower back, left arm, hands and headache. About two hours after this started I started to have the very intense chills, my headache got worse and for the first time a low fever of 99 degrees. I felt like this for 2 days, couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days because of the pain. On the third day 1/24/21, it was much better and almost all gone by the fourth day, 1/25/21. Thank you

                                                Local soreness in arm for 24 hrs post 1sr injection.  At 16 days post injections, frontal and temporal headache began, lasting approx 12 hrs and then waves of severe body aches began (random location - back, neck, right lateral midfoot, knees, right radiocarpal joint), along with mild chills and mild fever (never &gt;100.0).  These symptoms would recur approx every 8 hrs for the next 4 days.  Days 3-4 of the symptoms were debilitating and I primarily remained in bed.  Today is the first day or somewhat normal.  Still feel some ache and mild fatigue.  Never lost taste or smell and never had any respiratory issues or GI issues.

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Company assessed the events to be unlikely related to company product.

Feeling a bit better now, but still winded and weak.   Still plan to get 2nd shot.

                                                Presented to ED for evaluation of generalized lower extremity weakness, falls. The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

I should add to the other that my blood pressure has elevated since the vaccine.  As part of going on medication on 3/18, it was a concern the medications would elevate my blood pressure.  I bought a wrist BP check device and it was averaging 134/95 on 3/22/2021.  On 3/23/2021, I was prescribed Losartan.  I took one pill at 7:30PM.  Today when I woke up and for most of the day the BP has been 124/77-82.  The ringing remains persistent

About 10-14 days later my shoulder was feeling better but my right wrist started to ache, approx a week later the wrist was feeling better but my right hand finger joints ached for about a week. Now, starting approx 9 May  and 2021 and ongoing, I am experiencing ringing in my ears. The ringing is still present but has subsided. I attribute all these problems as side effects from the covid vaccine.

                                                High fever (103.3) on 2/21/2021 that lasted for 6 hours and stopped with ibuprofen.  Left arm soreness persisted for 3 days and stiffness in the left shoulder became more prevalent.  During the last 3 months, range of motion in the left shoulder has decreased, general weakness in the left arm noted and now there is severe pain in the left shoulder when moved in certain positions.  Large decrease in range of motion.  Can no longer reach across my chest with severe pinching on the top of the left shoulder joint.  Can no longer swing a golf club without severe pain and swing limitations due to range of motion decrease.  I saw my primary care physician last week and he has referred me to an orthopedic doctor.  My appointment is for Monday, June 7th in Stephenville, Texas.

They have tried taking acetaminophen and ibuprofen with no significant relief. Recommended trying diclofenac gel and rest, ice, and elevation. If no significant relief in a few days, recommended going to urgent care as patient does not have a primary doctor.

They let me go and got in touch with my doctor which I got an appointment on the 29th. I am experiencing heightened senses and pain. The pain is really bad in my forearm and elbow. It feels like it is weaker than what it was. I can&#39;t lift my arms over my head. It is more intense after the vaccine was administered.

My shoulder and forearm I began to experience excruciating pain and loss of movement to my shoulder. I went to the Medical Center where they performed complete lab work, HCG, x-rays of the chest. At the hospital they told me to take Tylenol for my pain and I was discharged after 6 hours to go home.    To this day I still have left arm shoulder pain that comes and goes and gets worse on some days when performing my daily living activities.

On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced NEUROMYOPATHY (neuromuscular syndrome) (seriousness criterion medically significant), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (adverse side effect), HYPOAESTHESIA (numbness in the fingers), PYREXIA (Low grade fever), MYALGIA (Body aches) and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (specific pain at injection site). The patient was treated with IBUPROFEN (IBUPROFEN IB) (oral) at a dose of UNK dosage form. At the time of the report, NEUROMYOPATHY (neuromuscular syndrome), HYPOAESTHESIA (numbness in the fingers), PYREXIA (Low grade fever), MYALGIA (Body aches) and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (specific pain at injection site) had not resolved and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (adverse side effect) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medication was reported.  The patient reported that he got the second dose seven weeks ago and still had significant pain at injection site in the bicep muscle and right shoulder region.

                                                beginning in the evening after the shot I noticed a red area starting to appear around the injection site.  Early in the morning of June 24, approx 1:30 AM I awoke with severe joint and muscle pain over my entire body with a  pain level of 10. I had tears uncontrollably running from my eyes due to the pain. Friday June 25, the muscle and joint pain had dropped to a level of 6 to 7. and I was able to realize that I also was having a severe migraine unlike any I have ever had before. I also notice that I had been having swelling in my hands and feet, dizziness and some cognitive issues. My hands hurt enough that I was unable to make a fist.  The migraine after 4 days dropped down to a bad headache and that lasted 11 days. I still have been having off and on headaches with  them intensifying to migraines and since the shot have had a total of 12 migraine days.  My hands are still swelling and varies from day to day. It has also affected the migraines that I have suffered from and intensified them and changed the location of where I feel the pain. The Chronic Pain that I have been suffering prior to the shot that was 80% under control is now down to 40% controlled and I am having difficulty walking and being able to hold things in my hands. I am afraid that the vaccine has perinatally changed and intensified the migraines and pain issue and regret ever being pushed into receiving it.

                                                15 minutes after I had the dose, I felt chills, arthritic pain in all my joints, and lethargic.  It got progressively worse and 2 days later, I felt like my blood sugar was high and it was 507 and this was taking Metformin. So I went to the hospital. They were able to get my BS under control. the next day it was high again and they had me come back. I went to the ER 2 days in a roll. For my arthritic pain the hospital prescribed muscle relaxer. My real concern was my blood sugar being so high, but they were able to get it under control. I still have joint pain.

Also, my entire left arm looked a bit red, but no hives. It went away as quickly as it occurred. Approximately 30 minutes after that, I experienced nausea again( which was a bit more intense). It also lasted for approximately 1 minute then it quickly ceased. At 4pm (5 hours after the shot), I got a severe headache. I&#39;m not sure if that was related to the vaccine. I took acetaminophen and slept soundly through the night. The next day, I felt fine, and I have felt fine since.

As I write this I am 27 hours post receiving the shot and now I am just dealing with the lingering muscle and joint pain.

Abdominal pain came that seemed to be coming from the region of my liver and I had been having some problem with that previously (in a mild way) and the injection seemed to make this flare up more. About 4 days after injection, I went to ER and they did blood test and liver tests. And over time it seemed to resolved itself in a few days. The pain in my SI joint flared up about 24 hours after the injection - the extreme pain lasted for about 24 hours and then it slowly tapered off after a couple of days.

                                                A severe, dull ache resulted at the vaccination site yesterday several hours after vaccination and radiated down my are, up my neck, and down my back. 1000MG of Tylenal helped, but the ache remains. The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

                                                Felt fine all day after vaccination. Adverse event(s) onset around 11pm day of vaccination and lasted through 4:30pm the day following the vaccination.  Symptoms included a flushed feeling in head and face.  I experienced joint pain and muscle pain throughout the body.  I experienced a headache for most of the period.  I took Tylenol (acetaminophen) that provided relief for the headache and muscle and joint pain.  Besides that I basically slept for the period from 11pm day of vaccination through 4:30pm day after vaccination.

His primary care physician was unable to get him to evaluate, so he went to Emergency Room.  Patient states that he was given an injection at the hospital that was meant to relieve the pain.  Patient states he is still in a lot of pain after the injury.  I directed the patient to continue to seek treatment since his pain is still persisting. Patient was hesitant to seek further treatment.

                                                Looking back, I had a slow, intermittent pain in my right shoulder/arm region. It was nonspecific but mostly related when raising my arm while getting dressed/putting my shirt on. It became more frequent over the next month. This past week it seemed to be more classic like a &#34;tendonitis&#34; towards the mid-distal deltoid region.

In morning I was overcome with sweats, and was ?sick? with all these symptoms most the rest of the day ? despite taking it easy and taking Tylenol   After an early dinner Friday evening, I went to bed for the next 12 hours,  Though I woke up a few times all sweaty during that stretch, by morning I was feeling pretty normal.  So, I figure my body was under duress for  30-33 hours.  Although I didn?t feel real bad for some 12 hours after injection, I did encounter some indigestion starting a few hours after the shot.

I developed a high grade fever of 102° @ 2am minor body aches and pains, no sweating. I self administered 500 mgs. of Acetaminophen every 4 hours as needed for a total of 4 doses. The high grade fever broke 6 hours later into a low grade fever ranging from 99.7° to 100.3° minor body aches. Minor pain and discomfort at the inoculation site and arm joint. The low grade fever broke and I returned to normal temperature Monday morning at 11am.

Irregular Bowel movement, abdominal pain - come and goes, not fully recovered at time of writing. There was no constipation (in sense of difficulty to pass stool) but no bowel movement either, only pain.  Treatment: after 24 hours start taking pain killers (Tylenol night, Aleve). Hot bath helped with back pain and abdominal pain. Laxative (Bisacodyle)  helped with Bowel movement, and relieved pain - but took long time and unknown if back to normal. Now on liquid diet (water,clear  soup, tea with sugar)  to allow to rest a bit, seems more comfortable at the moment.

In the middle of the night on 4/27 I woke up due to severe pain in my right ankle, right knee and right hip.  It was a full blown Rheumatoid Arthritis flair up.  I couldn&#39;t walk, required crutches to move from room to room.  Right knee was swollen.  Right foot became numb which has not happened to me with previous flair ups.  Blood pressure was taken and running high.  Called on line doctor and she recommended going to ER.  I sent my Rheumotolgist doctor an email.  I have yet to hear back.  Symptoms began subsiding around 3pm on 4/27.  I am able to walk now without crutches.  Swelling has subsided in right knee.  Right foot is still

On D2 early a.m., severe exacerbation of gout symptoms (pain and inflammation both went from 2/10 to 8/10), sufficient to awaken me  from pain. Affected joints were left MT-P #2-5. Improved to 4/10 by D3, and 3/3 by D4 where stabilized at since (now D28).  Severe new pain at left deltoid injection site (pain 8/10) on D27 late, sufficient to awaken  me before alarm. Left arm function compromised--unable to put on t-shirt, unable to lift coffee cup, unable to lift laptop computer, unable to raise stretched arm to shoulder level.  No overt local swelling, redness, or heat. Pain was deep intramuscular, not tender to touch, elicited by firm finger pressure or any motion involving deltoid muscle contraction. Pain and arm function improved on D28 to 4/10 arm pain. Necessitated rescheduling 2nd Moderna injection set for today.

                                                This case was reported by a consumer via call center representative and described the occurrence of vaccination failure in a 58-year-old male patient who received Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis.   Co-suspect products included Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis, COVID-19 MRNA-1273 VACCINE (COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA) (batch number 040B21A, expiry date unknown) for prophylaxis and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA (batch number 002B21A, expiry date unknown) for prophylaxis.   Concurrent medical conditions included ulcerative colitis. Concomitant products included azathioprine.   On 11th June 2019, the patient received the 2nd dose of Shingrix. On 9th April 2019, the patient received the 1st dose of Shingrix. On 9th April 2021, the patient received the 2nd dose of COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. On 11th March 2021, the patient received the 1st dose of COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. In May 2021, between 1 and 2 years after receiving Shingrix and more than 2 years after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced shingles, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. On an unknown date, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria GSK medically significant), feeling unwell and decreased immune responsiveness. The patient was treated with valaciclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg were unknown and the outcome of the shingles was not recovered/not resolved and the outcome of the generalized raised red spots limbs and red spotty rash were recovering/resolving.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to Shingrix and Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: The patient self reported the case. On an unknown date, less than 3 months after the 1st dose and less than 2 months after the 2nd dose the patient experienced shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. The patient had not felt good for a few weeks and then in the last week before the reporting date he started to get symptoms.  The patient felt crappy and had shooting pain in his back on the left side and the pain shot down his leg and then he had a rash on his left leg later. His torso, back, butt, and upper thighs were stingy, burning, and he was sensitive to the touch on his skin before the rash appeared. He described it as aches and pains and a stingy, needle feeling.  The patient had a history of ulcerative colitis and he took Azathioprine during the past few years so he was unsure if his rash was related to his weak immune system or the COVID vaccine.  The patient had sent pictures of his left leg rash to his physician and they recommended him to see a dermatologist who diagnosed him with shingles after a biopsy and tests. They immediately put him on Valtrex and he claimed that things started to calm down and the rash was started to dry up.  The patient described the rash as starting off as red spots that were raised up that looked like a target with a red circle around it that would get bigger. The raised spot looked like there was fluid inside. The dot in the middle looked dark in color and the red part that had spread looked like a bruise that was resolving with the color of yellow and brown.  The patient had a few clusters of the rash on the inside and outside of his left leg and back on his calf.  It was unknown if the reporter considered the shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. The reporter consented to follow up.

                                                He got his vaccine, no reaction to much.  On Saturday the injection site was sore, and had a fever as well and slept all day and it didn&#39;t bother him.  On Sunday at 5:30 AM the site was itchy and had to scratch, the muscle soreness is reduced, but better.  The itchiness is almost unbearable he has to scratch.  He had to apply the OTC antihistamine.  It then seemed to spread and it looks like almost like a square patch and is kind of reddish in color, hot to touch and it&#39;s a little over the site of the injection and below it.  Nothing higher than the injection site itself.  It is almost went to the armpit but very itchy, 8 1/2 - 9/10 in intensity.  Then by Monday, the itchiness subsided down a little bit and the square patch of redness shrunk a little bit and had some relief.  Then he waited another day and on Tuesday the arm is completely not red, has spots here and there and has some itchiness and now today the itchiness is better and almost gone. The itch was worse than when he had the chicken pox.

He states that within a week he started having pain in his left foot that eventually moved up to just below his knee.  This included swelling.  He saw his physician, who began treating him for gout.  His also said that he felt off and insisted that his doctor checks his blood sugar, although he had no previous issues with his blood sugars.  He came back at a 241.  He is now taking allopurinol and metformin.  The pain and swelling in his left leg is subsiding now.  He did go thru one period of 4 days where he said he could not stand on his left leg.  He was due for his second shot today, 5/24/21, but chose not to out of caution, until his doctor figures out what is going on.  Also, his dietician recommended he not get the vaccine at this time

                                                Approximately one week after receiving vaccine my viral like symptoms reported to VERS thru vaccine site started to wane.  However, I have experienced increasing pain and stiffness in both hands and knees since that time.  My right hand is affected more severely than the rest with transient inability to extend middle finger of right hand do to tendon locking.  I have pain in MCP and PIP joints of both hands and weakness in grip more pronounced in right hand.   Addtionally, both knees are painful. I have been taking inccreasing amounts of tylenol and ibuprofen to stme the disccomfort that I have experienced since approximately 1 week after my second Moderna Covid 19 vaccination on 2/1/2021.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA I have sciatic and have had a rhyzotomy on my right side. On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

                                                Patient came to the emergency department on 02/02/2020 at 2:30 pm to be evaluated for possible stroke due to sudden acute numbness, weakness in right wrist and arm, but no pain. Patient has no prior history of sudden acute numbness in arm and did not report any recent injury to his arm. Neurologist evaluated patient for possible stroke and patient was unable to lift right wrist and hand. Patient was able to lift both arms overhead, lift both legs, smile normal, open and close mouth and move tongue.  Both CT Scan and MRI were normal. Neurologist and emergency medical specialist determined that patient did not have a stroke and diagnosed acute brachial plexus palsy possibly due to patient sleeping in an awkward position. Emergency specialist said it was unlikely but could not rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine, which patient had received 10 days earlier (second dose, see details above.)

                                                I had extremely burning pain on my left hip and quadricep/thigh area that started without warning. Feeling like extreme leg cramps when standing or walking. I did seek medical attention with my orthopedic doctor and had hip xrays on my left hip. She saw mild to moderate arthritis in my hip joint. I was prescribed an anti inflammatory as well as taking tylenol to supplement.  The symptoms have not subsided and I plan on following up with my medical doctor. I have had bad spasms in my hip and thigh area and swelling from the top of my thigh to my knee.

                                                Diagnosed with DVT; Leg got really swollen/swelling of the lower calf area; Sore arm; Sore arm; Pulled a muscle; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 57-years-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA -1273) and experienced events, DVT/ deep vein thrombosis, pulled a muscle/myalgia, swelling of the lower calf area(leg got really swollen)/peripheral swelling and calf pain(sore arm)/pain in extremity.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 09 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 12 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine the patient had sore arm. On an unspecified date in Jan 2021, the patient had experienced a pull in his muscle in his calf and lower calf area got swollen.

The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the event DVT, leg got really swollen, swelling of the lower calf area and calf pain were unknown at the time of this report. The event pulled a muscle is not resolved. The event sore arm which the patient experienced for both the doses got resolved on 13 Jan and 14 Jan 2021, respectively.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association a causal association between the event of sore arm and the administration of mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The evens of DVT , pulled muscle and swelling of lower calf is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Events were all attributed to muscle strain.

                                                Had usual flu symptoms before going to bed that were mild, BUT woke up around 4am with severe back ache on left side below rib cage and it hurt so much that I could barely walk.   At first, I thought it was some kind of a kink in my back, but after doing some research, I discovered that it was my spleen that got swollen and was pushing against rib cage on left side.  Symptoms continued to increase until about 9am and then began to slowly recede after this.  Today is 4/17/21 5:39pm and I still ache in this area, but it is very mild compared to symptoms I got on April 15th.

I had a cup of coffee when I came home and went to bed.  I was feeling so bad I had to get up  and take a Sumatriptan and another cup of coffee.  I laid back down for a few more hours.  I awakened later,  used the restroom  and was feeling much better than before.   Although my arm and shoulder is sore at the injection site,  I?m feeling much better.

Went for doctor visit and told him all my symptoms, He was very concerned I had a reaction to vaccine.   He prescribed prednisone 7 day pack for severe joint pain &amp; inflammation, Nurtec disintegrating tablets, meloxicam, ordered bloodwork and had follow up in 2 weeks, after two weeks symptoms were still the same very severe, he referred me to Neurologist for evaluation, she ordered MRI as a stat to be done right away,  and started me on meds for Severe Migraines and sent me to Ophthalmologist, she had a nurse get me an appointment the next day.   I saw Ophthalmologist the very next day he did workup and diagnostic testing in his office and stated I had severe swelling and inflammation in the optic nerves in both eyes, and referred me and sent records to Dr., Neuro Ophthalmologist and contacted their office to get me in right away.  I had my appointment with Dr. and she has ordered an ultrasound of my eyes by retina specialist which appointment is in June.  I have follow up with her after ultrasound is done.  Due to severe joint pain I am still having my PCP has referred me to a rheumatologist.  My pain is severe.  The vaccine has attacked my immune system.  Doctors and specialists are doing everything possible and I am still off work.  My return to work date has not been determined.

                                                Within 12-14 hours of getting the Maderna shot(1st shot), not only did I have a sore arm, but my shoulder had pain. Each day the pain got a little worse and started stretching to my chest. My chest and heart were uncomfortable. My wife was having the same symptoms so we just tried to manage through the pain. One April 28, the pain was so severe it woke me up in the middle of the night. I took some antacids and that seemed to help. The next 3 days the pain was on and off until May 1 evening, the pain was so severe and I was vomiting that we decided to go to the hospital. It was determined that I had a heart attack.

He still has pain in his shoulders to this day.

                                                For about six days I was miserable and not feeling very good. Fever,  fatigue, headaches and just felt like crap. I had a fever of 100.5 (highest) for three or four days. It broke and then it started feeling better on the 6th day. I had very sore shoulder for the first two days. I have regular side affects of medicine that affects me daily. I felt very miserable.  (This was worse symptoms than after I got  the second vaccine.) I have long term COVID - low oxygen issue - I went to Hospital - 11 liter 02 and 60% pressure. I was still dealing with low 02 during the day; I have insulin issues - still out of whack - doctors are monitoring it. My blood pressure has been up in the 200 range - they got it into the 160&#39;s or so but they are increasing the heart meds - they are doubling the heart meds (have some new ones - Metoprolol was ended - and  Carvedilol 25 mg take one tab twice a day; Mepacrine ER Osmtic - 30 mg one, twice a day now )- my heart is still unstable - electrical tachycardia is the name for it and that is affecting me. Inflammatory of the voice box caused by what they don&#39;t know - it comes and goes (the voice) -I will get it examined it soon - it is also causing Thrush - burning redness of the tongue. Monday the 19th of April - was in ER for 15 hours before they got me upstairs - admitted the 20th. (Have a previous spinal cord injury, hip injury etc. from work related.) Potassium - was taking one a day and I&#39;m taking four a day now - they are not sure why but I need to take that many  now. I am also going thru a Respiratory therapist - every couple of weeks I&#39;m going through that to strengthen my lungs.

It looks like bee stings bigger then a quarter 3 on my stomach and 3 on back. Lots of little bumps. It hurts very sensitive. I felt like my ribs and kidney were hurting but it is because of the nerves when I touch them.  This is been about a week. I am going to call my doctor. The pain is not just one spot but the whole area around them.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

                                                At 12:15 a.m. on March 09 chills and fever suddenly started. I was shivering so bad that I was having muscle spasms so bad that I had difficulty walking on my right leg (hip replacement January 2020). After taking tylenol for fever my temp had gone down to 100. Headaches started soon after the fever and muscle spasms and it lasted well into the afternoon on the 9th along with feeling cold and clammy. At about 7:00 p.m. on the 9th, the fever started going back up so I took another dose of tylenol. The fever lasted until about 4:00 a.m. on the tenth. Currently, 10:00 a.m. on the tenth I feel somewhat normal, just really tired and having muscle pain in my upper back. All things considered, the whole ordeal felt like my time when I was getting better after going through covid in December.

                                                Received first vaccine shot 9:00 am. Left shoulder. Felt fine all day. Went to bed that evening about 10 pm. Woke up at 11:15 pm with severe shivering, and was extremely cold. My temperature was 98.6. Turned my heat up to 74, added blankets to my bed, could not get warm. Finally had to add a large heat pack to my bed to alleviate shivering. My left shoulder and arm hurt. Abnormally bad sleep. Woke up this morning at 9:30am and am lethargic and very tired. I feel like I was hit by a truck.

March 20: In the evening, began to feel low level general muscle aches throughout body. March 23: Woke up with lower back muscles contracted. Very painful to move and stand up. Very difficult to walk. Could only walk very slowly and in a hunched over position. Changing positions from sitting to standing and vice versa was very painful and would take at least 7 or 8 minutes. Because of the extreme difficulty in movement and pain, went home to rest. Applied hot water bottle to lower back while lying down.  March 24: In the morning symptoms were better. Called the hospital but was told my symptoms were not a reaction to the Moderna vaccine.  March 25: Symptoms were greatly reduced. Able to walk nearly normal.

                                                Severe headache - migraine-like.   Fever of approx 101 to 102 (we don&#39;t own a thermometer because we are never sick.) Painful joints and tendons. Exhaustion (way beyond &#34;fatigue&#34;)  Symptoms began as upper arm aching at approximately 8:00.  By 11:00 a.m. feeling tired and achy with light headache and painful tendons.  Took 2 Bayer with no improvement. By 2:30,  pounding headache.  Soaked in epsom salts bath; could barely stand straight after sitting  in tub.  Went to bed with severe headache.  I walked to the store to get Advil (we don&#39;t keep that around either since we neither one are ever sick with headaches!)  By 4:00 took 2 Advil for migraine-like symptoms and light fever.  By 4:30 back in bed with &#34;burning&#34; fever (no thermometer owned for several years) to the touch.  He NEVER has a fever - maybe twice in the 38 years we&#39;ve been married.    This is completely and utterly out of character for him.  He does not have allergies, reactions to medications, flu or any such thing.  He has missed perhaps 3-4 days of work for illness in the 38 years we&#39;ve been married.  These symptoms, for him, are  severe and are clearly and detrimentally connected to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine second shot.

The following day on Tuesday my left knee area began to hurt.  It was pretty severe pain, it still today hurts somewhat.    I waited until the weekend, and that Thursday I called my primary care at Family Medicine for a Tele-Visit but I had to see another doctor who wanted me to come in on Monday.  My knee got some what better on Monday so I cancelled the appointment.  I got up this morning around 4 am to walk my puppies when I herd the talking about the J&amp;J issues which included knee, and leg issues, I&#39;m now having pain in my right lower leg above my foot.  I did call my primary care again today.

                                                Adverse reaction started at appx 2 am last night (after 5:30pm shot).   Woke up and had trouble falling back to sleep for 1-2 hrs.   Started feeling body aches in knees, legs, ankles.   Vax site on right arm was noticeably sore.    Had chills at 5:30 am when i woke up again (did not test for fever but was not sweating).   Fell back asleep until 8:30 and took 2 Advil and a 20 minute warm bath to help get rid of the chills.  Slept another hour and then got up for my normal breakfast.   Groggy all morning, but symptoms appear to be completed now at 11:45 am.     I had somewhat stronger  and longer adverse reaction after the 1st vacine on 3/21/21.   I believe the fatigue, body aches and chills lasted throughout the following day and evening.      I had 1 Negative Covid test in June last year but my son and some friends of his tested positive in appx June 2020 so it&#39;s quite possible i had asymptomatic covid at some point in the last year (which i understand from news stories my drive higher adverse reaction rates).

Patient contacted doctor&#39;s office and nurse said he needs to get better before taking the second dose. Some of these side effects he had before his shot because he has COPD already but he describes it as it is much worse now. The doctor&#39;s office set up a blood test to further investigate what it is due to. Patient didn&#39;t even have energy to move boxes while moving locations. Oxygen usually 96 or 97 now it is 92 or 94. He describes really low energy level, nauseated throughout the day a lot, fatigue, feel sleepy a lot , so out of breath and started hyperventilated but it could be from panic attack he says. He still feels these symptoms to this day. He says it goes away when wife talks and rubs his back and when he lays still. BP is little low diastolic in 60s but normally 70s. yesterday 91/62. He says it could be due to synthroid discontinuation which he stopped taking one year ago but started back the morning of 4/21/21 to see if that is what is the cause. He can not raise left arm above shoulder. Having excruciating, tear jerking pain but got his vaccine in right arm. He describes some pain is in the right shoulder.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the first night after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna.  I had a fever, chills and muscle aches, and extreme fatigue.  Those symptoms lasted approx 3 days.  Two days after the vaccination I also became extremely nauseous.  I was anticipating all of these symptoms.  On the 3rd and 4th days after the vaccine most of the symptoms disappeared but I received some new ones that I was not expecting.  I suddenly felt a large amount of despair and hopelessness.  I had suicidal thoughts.  I had panic attacks and anxiety.  I had paranoia.  I did not feel like I had long to live, or anything to live for.  By 20 Apr all of these emotional and mental side effects were completely gone.

                                                The evening of the vaccine, Wednesday, I was extremely tired.  By the next day, my right hip and right leg were throbbing.  I have not slept well since the vaccine.  By Friday, I was so sore that I visited a Chiropractor.  By Saturday, I could not stand, sit or lie down without extreme pain.  I called Dr. on his cell and he met us (my wife drove) at his clinic.  After treating me, he sent us to Urgent Care.  At the urgent care facility I received a Toradol shot and a prescription for prednisone.  Both Doctors said that this was a likely &#34;inflammatory response&#34; to the vaccine.  (continued below)

                                                Received my second shot on the late morning of yesterday (Thursday).  My arm was getting pretty sore by the time I went to bed (I could not sleep on my left side).  When I woke up, started feeling fuzzy and got the chills.  Took three 325 mg Acetaminophen in the morning.  Was running a low grade fever by lunch time (99.9 degrees) and was feeling like I had the flu.  Joints are sore, head still fuzzy, feel a little light headed when I move around too much.  Took three more 325 Acetaminophen after lunch.  No appetite, stomach feels queasy.  Tired but can&#39;t sleep.  Intend to take more acetaminophen this evening before bed.  Hopefully tomorrow my symptoms will start to go away.

I was told I was out a few minutes before the store called the ambulance. I was under observation for a few more minutes and felt dizzy again and started trembling  and losing consciousness again. I was taken to the emergency room where I had a reported heart rate of 40bpm and it took several hours before my blood pressure and heart rate normalized again. I was given IV fluids and zofran for the nausea. I maintained flu like symptoms, fatigue, muscle pain, dizziness, memory loss, and disorientation for three days after receiving the vaccination.  It took one week to get back to normal health.

The body aches all over my body and every joint hurt.  This second dose was worse than the first with the head ache and stability issues.  The symptom&#39;s were like back in Oct 2020 when I had covid19.  This time I didn&#39;t go to an urgent care like I did when I had the first Moderna covid19 vaccine since I kind of knew this would happen.

                                                My husband was sleeping the night of getting his 2nd Moderna Vaccination...  He, during his sleep, had a SEVERE Grand Mal Seizure with NOTHING leading up to it and NO PREVIOUS HISTORY WHATSOEVER of having ANY Seizures in his lifetime, nor ANY Epilepsy...  EVER! It was TERRIFYING, to me - I ran to his bedside (I happened to be in the livingroom watching television) after hearing loud grunts and a crash and came to find him convulsing, severely spewing blood and frothing at the mouth.  Grunting, convulsing, and thrashing.  Stiffening, arms and hands (both in a fist) tight and stiff in front of his chest, legs straight, rigid as a board and thrashing about spitting blood, eyes rolled back in his head.  As things began to becoming a little less severe, while waiting for the Fire Dept &amp; EMTs to arrive I felt his legs which were hit to the touch and his face was drenched in sweat! With NEVER EXPERIENCING Anything like this before, and after 30 years of marriage, I thought my husband was dying ???????? He did NOT go with the EMTs, since once he was awake and somewhat cognitive we realized he was over it for the moment and we&#39;re in a wait and see basis. He saw our GP first thing the next morning.

Friday 14 May, approximately 4 pm (over 24 hours since the vaccine) developed intense itching on the bottom of my feet and palm of the hands.  5.  Friday 14 May, 5 pm, took two Benadryl 25mg.  Had minor relief until approximately 9 pm. 6.  Friday 14 May, 11:45 pm, skin started to flare up with red rash and blister-looking spots through the wrists, arms, knees, and near the underarm.  Itch was very intense.  Took another Benadryl, making the total 3 Benadryl tabs in about 5 hours.  No relief from Benadryl. Went to Medical Center. 7.  Doctor gave me an IV of what he said was an anti-histamine and prescribed Olopatadine 5mg-- one tablet at night and one after breakfast for three days.  8.  Got home around 2 am (Sat 15 May) still had some itch but not bad enough to prevent me from sleeping. 9.  Woke up at 7 am, no itch and rash had cleared up about 60%.  10.  By 9 am on Saturday 15 May itch began again but not as intense as the day prior.  Took the morning Olopatadine.  (Waiting for Olopatadine to kick in!).

                                                after receiving the vaccine 4/20 and three weeks later I couldn&#39;t breath and called 911 and went to hospital and diagnosed with pericarditis. But the day before I felt like I had a fractured rib and it intensified that evening and I took pain medication, then the pain in the left side intensified and I could not breath it felt like a knife piercing and had to breath with very shallow breath into my upper chest and the pain was so intense.  I called 911 and they did an EKG, my heart rate went down to 30. One doctor gave me morphine to help me, they did test to check for blood clots and EKG&#39;s and blood test. I was also given Oxycodone.  Test showed that there was a virus that got into it that caused pericarditis.  I&#39;m taking Ibuprofen and anti-inflammatories to help. I&#39;m very active and never had health issues and believe this was a response to the vaccine.  First dose was given on 3/23/2021 Lot 047A21A and experienced Molluscum contagion a few days later, and this is a virus. I was prescribe a topical cream, Imiquimod a topical cream to put on it to break down the virus. Triamcinolone Acetonide cream was prescribed later and I&#39;m still taking it now and the site was oozing puss and bleeding.

I went to the ER and they gave me prednisone treatments and since then it has become a lot better. Arm movement was limited due to the pain as well. I had no other symptoms other than that. Just a week ago it was still swollen and now it is not sore to the touch anymore at least. I do have slight arthritis in that shoulder if that is need to know information.

                                                Just 2 hours after the shot, I started to break out in hives all over my body.  The hives (mistaken by ER doctors as chicken pox or herpes the same day) concentrated at my joints.  Hives also impacted my tongue and roof of mouth making it difficult to breath and eat.  Treatment was Valtrex but biopsy (result  one week later) proved that the Moderna shot caused the allergic reaction.  I was hospitalized (ER) and remained in hospital for 4 days, not including the ER visit week prior.  Given a multitude of medicines, primarily steroid treatment intravenously to reduce swelling and rash.    No change in my fingers and swelling of joints (chronic), since May 19th, I have no feeling in fingers and chronic pain (hands on fire especially at night or sitting still). Visiting a Neurologist today and a Rheumatologist on July 19th.

My abdomen started hurting and on June 12 I started having diarrhea which lasted for 2 weeks (reminder that I also started Lexapro on June 11 and started Cipro and Flagyl on June 12).  I ended up losing 15 lbs due to loss of appetite and the diarrhea.  On June 19, I had a vagal episode where I passed out while standing up. Luckily my head landing softly. I had just drank a smoothy and felt a pressure/pain in my chest. After passing out and then coming to, I vomited the smoothy and found some relief.

                                                Pain at injection site (left shoulder muscle) did not dissipate as expected.  Instead, it spread to the left shoulder joint.  Within a month, there was swelling in the left knee joint, then right shoulder, then right hip, then right knew.  Massive inflammation of major joints led to swelling, excruciating pain, severely limited range of motion, an inability to sleep for more than two hours - inflammation becomes so bad when trying to sleep, that any significant movement causes intense pain, leading to very uncomfortable wakefulness and all the problems that come with sleep deprivation.  Including severe impairment of work.  Now, three months after vaccination, the inflammation has settled primarily in both shoulder joints, leading to Adhesive Capsulitis (frozen shoulder) and less than 10% mobility without taking NSAID&#39;s, somewhat better with.  Inflammation at shoulder joints is still very active, with no end in site - and much misery.

                                                I experienced a fever of 100.4, 24 hours after the injection, accompanied by overall muscle aches, headaches, and difficulty sleeping. The fever was gone within 36 hours, but the other symptoms persisted.  My spouse, who also had Covid-19 at the same time that I did experienced the same symptoms.

I have experienced all these side effects every day for the last 10 days. Additional side effects are: Sweating profusely every night. Not being able to sleep very well nearly every night. Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

                                                After a couple of days started feeling pain in the right elbow.  I thought it would go away.  It didn&#39;t. As of today pain is still there it is not as bad but still there 27 days later.  Also my left thumb is numb and sometimes radiates to the forearm area.  I have just started taking 200 mg ibuprofen as needed.  Helps with the right elbow but no relief to the left thumb.  I am due for 2nd vaccine tomorrow!

                                                I had a significant exacerbation of my neuromuscular MS symptoms despite no subjective symptoms of fever. I did not take my temperature but did not feel feverish. I also had significant exacerbations of routine aches and pains such as chronic orthopedic aches. The pain symptoms began approximately 5 hours after the injection. The neuromuscular symptoms began approximately 14-16 hours after the injection. I took acetaminophen 1000 mg orally in the morning 24 hours after my injection and had improvement in both the pain and neuromuscular symptoms. I continued to take Acetominphen 1000mg q 8h during the day and had complete resolution of both the pain and neuromuscular symptoms with return to baseline health by 48 hours after the injection.

Then I experienced exhaustion and congestion with minor intermittent cough as if I went from the flu to having a cold.  By the end of workday Thursday, 02/25/2021, I was considerably better.  Then the rash began (02/25/2021 evening) at first it appeared upper left arm and left side of chest spreading to the right chest and arm with a lesser degree.  Rash is described as minor itching, redness, and bumps appearing as a contact dermatitis.  As of 03/05/2021, it seems on its way to resolving.

                                                On Monday, March 9th, I tested positive for the COVID antibodies and believe it was linked to an illness that I experienced last fall (COVID test was not administered at that time).  Approximately 16 hours after receiving the first injection of COVID-19 MODERNA I began to experience joint pain/stiffness, muscle soreness,  headaches, nausea, chills, sweats, malaise, heart racing, numbness to the fingers on my left hand, etc.  I became progressively worse until become bed ridden at 5:15 pm on Thursday, March 11th.  I remained bed ridden with symptoms becoming progressively worse until Friday evening, March 12th.  At that point, my condition began to improve.  I began to feel somewhat better by mid-morning on Saturday, March 13th.  My condition finally improved to ~90% by Monday, March 15th, with lingering muscle soreness and loss of feeling to the fingers on my left hand remaining.

Injection site pain peaked within a day, and was lessened by day two. However, he woke late morning fearing he had a stroke. His symptoms were primarily related to range of motion in vaccinated arm. He had difficult dressing. Exam findings consistent with adhesive capsulitis and course of physical therapy recommended.

                                                I have been diagnosed with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease and started experiencing lower back pain within 30 minutes of receiving 1st dose of Moderna vaccine. Identified reaction to healthcare provider and was instructed to notify CDC. On March 30, CDC shared with me a list of adverse reactions that would preclude an individual from receiving the 2nd dose.  The lower back pain I am experiencing was not listed.  After speaking to CDC rep it is my understanding  that I&#39;m cleared to receive the 2nd dose.

                                                I had common side effects including fever of 102.7, joint pain, body aches, headache, stomach pain  from the evening of 4/3/21 until today, 4/6/21. The fever has fluctuated from no fever to102.7, to lower grade 99.1 to 100.5 to no fever to lower grade, 99.1 over the course of that time. The reason for my VAERS report is the major rash that I developed on the evening of 4/5/21 that covers my entire back, my chest, and up to the first two inches of my neck. I contacted my physician practice right away, and recommended that I take Benadryl every few hours. This morning, the surface area of the rash remains the same as yesterday, but is a much lighter hue. Yesterday was deep red and felt very hot. Today, is more of a pinkish red. Today my back feels as if I have a bad sunburn. Clothing touching my back causes a discomfort similar to sunburn. Parts of my back also now have white dryness lines/wrinkles.

It was also in the pelvic area on the inside. I couldn&#39;t move around very much because it was painful. It lasted about two weeks and it migrated from one place to another. Mostly in my lower thigh and my knee. I consulted my doctor and she did not find anything. It just suddenly went away I have gotten the second dose of the vaccine and I did not have any of those symptoms.

Slept on and off the rest of the day with fatigue, sore body, and headache. Let up around 8pm. April 9, 2021, 7:00 am: Got up feeling much better today.

                                                24 hours after booster, experienced quite uncomfortable muscle pain and fatigue, headache, chills, and a fever between 102-103.  It quickly subsided after about 18 hours.  While it was uncomfortable during the 18 hours, it all went away in just about an hour (even the muscle cramps).  More severe than I expected, but I&#39;d do it all over again if needed.

                                                In a nutshell, patient was fine, got the first shot of the Moderna Vaccine on 3/24/21, then began to exhibit many covid-like symptoms starting around 4 hours later but 3 times nasal swap tested negative for COVID19 including before and after vaccination. Suffered with various attempts at treatments and tests for approximately a month and then was admitted to the ER at hospital on 4/28/21.  Wife (former smoker who lives in same house and has lung problems) who took the vaccine at the same time from the same lot suffered minor arm pain, aches and pains and fatigue but was fine the next day.  Patient (59) had normal blood pressure and clear lungs in good health, non-smoker, good weight, exercises regularly and strenuously, good diet, rarely gets ill. He works as a ship?s captain and engineer and has worked in boatyards for years doing physical work. Has tintinnitis and in one eye, glaucoma drops but is on no other prescription medicines. Details: March: had nasal congestion, cough and suspected bronchitis, aches and pains, no fever, PCR tested negative for COVID19, and was treated with antibiotics (azithromycin and then a run of amoxycillin), proair, advair discuss a couple of days, various vitamins/minerals, over the counter cold/flu medicines. Seemed to work with most symptoms going away prior to Marcch 24, 2021. March 24, 2021 morning: Got first shot of the Moderna Vaccine at pharmacy. Lot 045A21A at same time as spouse. That morning had no cough and felt ok. Approximately 4 hours later, patient started to cough, felt congested, felt like flu/pneumonia, trouble breathing, aches and pains especially in joints, extreme fatigue, headache, (but suffered no loss of taste or smell throughout 3/24-present) took Theraflu and went to bed early, slept well. Following days, struggled with intensifying symptoms. Felt like the vaccine gave him covid symptoms without the loss of smell/taste.  Spouse experienced minor pain at point of injection, some fatigue, aches and pains which went away by end of next day 3/25/21. Spouse had some lingering cough left over from earlier bronchitis before getting the vaccine which cough/congested breathing continued with no noticeable change. [Spouse was also not adversely impacted by the second shot of Moderna vaccine a month later.) Apr Wk1 &amp; Wk2: Increasing difficulty sleeping due to lung congestion or suddenly waking up wide awake for no reason. At end of Wk2, had some minor tremors in muscles for a couple of days. Suffered from extreme fatigue, congestion, trouble breathing, nightmares, aches and pains. Took azithromycin run then a run of amoxicillin, proair, prednisone, albuterol nebulizer, occasional Theraflu or over-the-counter cold/flu medicines, vitamins/minerals (including heavier doses of Vitamin D, Zinc, C, etc.), probiotic acidophilus, tonic water with quinine or Perrier, melatonin 10mg and magnesium 500mg at night, occasionally a Unisom sleeping pill. Started to lose appetite where rarely hungry. Would force himself to eat anyway, but occasionally vomited it up. Apr Wk3 4/13/21: Patient got another PCR covid test which was negative, chest xray, blood work done at Urgent Care. Showed some elevated liver/kidney enzymes and low red blood cell count/anemia, vague thickening of the plura, swollen lymphnode in the chest xray, no sign of cardiovascular issue. (Some yellow flags but nothing flashing red.) Dr. recommended followup tests and bloodwork and that he get GI/Cardio/pulmonary workups w/specialists. Patient continued to take antibiotics, pregnizone, albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals, and occasional cold/flu/cough medicines, etc. Added SuperB Complex. One day he had hot/cold chills for a few hours. Apr Wk4: While lungs felt clearer, still coughing and now occasionally vomiting productively or dry heaves, insomnia grew into bigger issue with hallucinations not just with nightmares but occasionally during the day where it was difficult to separate reality from dream, trouble remembering, started to feel paranoid/irrational sometimes, trouble sleeping was not due to lung congestion but more due to panic-attack like heavy breathing or sudden central chest/sternum pain (maybe from coughs), aches in joints, but biggest problem was extreme fatigue and tiring when walking up a flight of stairs, etc. Took some Tramadol occasionally for pain relief (but never with aspirin, Tylenol or cold medicine). Could be sitting comfortably watching a mellow tv program but suddenly need to breathe really heavy, hyperventilating and felt need to standup and walk around until it eased. Extreme trouble sleeping. Most comfortable position was kneeling with body bent over a pillow on the bed. [He&#39;d never had panic-attacks/heavy breathing issues before the Moderna shot and doesn&#39;t abuse substances.] Wk5: 4/24/21 feet swelled up and turned purple on the soles. Went for a walk around the block and raised feet. No longer on antibiotics or pregnizone, only taking the albuterol nebulizer, vitamins/minerals/probiotics, melatonin and a OTC cough/flu medicine before bed. Knelt for hours while trying to sleep. 4/25/21, feet more swollen with fluid and more discolored. When searched online, they looked like &#34;covid toes&#34;. Took no medicines except nebulizer and took only a couple of vitamins/calcium-vitaminD and before bed a beer, melatonin, magnesium &amp; nyquil. 4/26/21, feet less swollen and no longer purple except a small line on the side of one foot. Patient indicated he had not knelt when trying to sleep prone during night. But only got a couple of hours of sleep, nighttime hallucinations and panic-breathing attacks. Daytime inability to focus, extreme fatigue, aches and pains, quick to tire on any exertion, vomiting food or dry heaves 2 or 3 times that day, panic-like-attacks with need to heavy breathe/hyperventilate. Wheezing with occasional rattle at end. Coughs sometimes productive, sometimes not but lungs didn?t feel very congested and oxygenation/blood pressure was good. 4/27/21, went to work in morning and was able to perform but very tired. In early afternoon, came home, ate, took nyquil and nebulizer and tried to sleep. 4/28/21, felt much worse, feet and knees swollen, extreme exhaustion, felt miserable. Went to work anyway. Came home around 2pm, ate. Felt much worse so we went to the ER at Hospital. Spouse provided MMC with his medical conditions, medicines, the info on COVID IGG serology test and informed them of the chest xrays and bloodwork that had been done at the Urgent Care center 2 weeks prior. ER indicated he needed to stay overnight and they performed additional bloodwork, xrays, scans and MRIs. The ER doctor called in specialists in Nephrology and Cardiology to provide consultations.

Reached 102 and did not drop below 101 even using Tylenol or Ibuprofen. On day two fever went down but at about 36-48 hours went back up to 99.5 until finally going away after 48 hours. During the first 48 hours experienced body chills, fatigue, some nausea, body aches, some joint shooting pain randomly, headache. On days 2-3 started developing a hot red painful patch about 2 inches below the shot location. On day 4 it is light pink and almost gone, the pain has localized in one spot which seems to have some swelling under the skin (not the actual shot location).   Item 20 asks if there has been recovery.  That&#39;s not a yes/no answer as most symptoms have gone away, but the lingering pain and patch are still there, but seem to be getting better by the day.

After about 9 hours from getting the shot I got a headache that turned in to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had in my life that lasted over 30 hours. I had a fever that ranged from 101F to 103F that has lasted for more than 30 hours, I also developed severe muscle and joint pain so much so that I could only get out of bed to go to the bathroom and that was with great pain. I also have had nausea that has lasted over 36 hours. I took Tylenol (1000mg) every few hours, 4 times with out relief. I also took a Tramadol which helped a little with the pain but then my fever spiked for a few hours. I&#39;m now on day 2 of bed rest and waiting for the symptoms to subside so I can get back to my regular life.

                                                Starting within a week of my second vaccine does, I experienced generalized pain in my upper body, especially arms/shoulders. At perhaps the 10-day mark (I&#39;m not sure) I developed rashes on the right side of my face (chin, next to mouth, temple, two places near ear, one place in ear canal. They became worse and more painful as did my upper body pain. I finally went to a Walk-In Clinic on Thursday, May 27 (15 days after my second vaccine shot) and was diagnosed with shingles. I am not taking medication for it to try to speed it along, and the rash is not as painful (five days later), but my upper body is still experiencing the same symptoms as the shingles takes its course. I am reporting this at the advice of a friend because I know of at least five other people within friend circles who also came down with shingles within three weeks or less of their second vaccine dose (in my case, I think symptoms did start to appear within about a week, definitely before 10 days).  I&#39;m wondering how widespread this pattern is.

                                                So on April 19th I got the second Covid vaccine, I went to the urgent care on the following day at approx. 11:30 AM. They did an EKG they said it looked fine and they sent me on my way regardless of it hurting me real bad (my chest). When I woke up Sunday morning, there was a crushing pain in my chest. On the 25th I woke up, got dressed and went right over to the hospital. I was in so much pain I had to go back to the hospital. I was there from the 25th-29th, they said I needed to have an angiogram with a possible stint in my left artery. On the 28th they put that stint in and I left on the 29th of April in the afternoon at about 4pm. I still am not feeling right, my chest hurts not like it did then, but shortness of breath. I also have to take a blood thinner and a baby aspirin. I have new symptoms in both my arms, from my bicep to my triceps is very achy - it has never done that before. My arms are very stiff. I still have trouble taking deep breathes.

But after the Moderna shot, I had a severe flair up that has now lasted almost 2 weeks which is unusual.  My flairs up from gout come from shellfish but I had none before my flair up.  I have read that some people have a reaction to the shot and maybe the shot affected me.

                                                New lesions of venous malformation erupted approximately 1-2 weeks after first dose of Moderna COVI19 vaccine, consistent with his pre-existing lesions from congenital blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. Patient had steady small sized lesions scattered in his body (less than 10 total) prior to new eruption after receiving the vaccine. Currently more than 10 new lesions are identified, ranging from 2mm to &lt;1cm in diameter, through out his trunk and four limbs with no significant pattern. These lesions cause mild pain/tenderness. No bleeding episode. It is unknown if patient has mucosal surface lesion, but so far no symptom/sign of blood loss. Due to these findings after the vaccine, patient was advised not to receive the second dose of Moderna COVID19 vaccine.

Several weeks after, in 03/07/2021 I started to have total loss of hearing in my left ear, and ringing in both ears. I went to the ER. After going to another ear doctor I have 40 % loss of hearing in my left ear and ringing in both. I have acid reflux and I could not eat anything because I would throw up. They did an upper GI and turns out I have a small  hernia and they gave me Pantoprazole. I go back to the stomach doctor this month and to the ear doctor on October. I still have no taste or smell since 11/19/2021.

                                                Immediately after injection,  my arm was numb for more than 15 minutes. I waited 30 minutes before leaving.  After that, all seemed good.  In early April, my legs seemed heavy for a day.  The next morning, I would barely walk.  After visiting an orthopedic surgeon, I was sent to have an EMG and nerve conduction study which showed demylinatization in my legs and somewhat in my arms, especially my right arm.  I visited a neurologist who completed extensive blood work and a lumbar puncture.  The EMG, nerve conduction study, and very elevated protein in my spinal fluid confirmed Guillian Barre.  I had to undergo IVIG treatments, which helped.  I continue to suffer from effects today (July 2021), but am now able to walk better.    I support the vaccine still. It appears to be saving millions.  I just &#34;hate&#34; that I was adversely impacted by the vaccine personally.
