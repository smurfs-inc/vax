Abdominal cramping resolved.  No further diarrhea or vomiting.  Still complains of headache and muscle cramping through her upper shoulders and arm.  Will remedicate with steroid and acetaminophen  2258 Reevaluation: Patient improved.  Pain/myalgias improved.  Headache now mild and dull.  Continues with no further.nausea vomiting or diarrhea.  She would like to try fluids at this time.  Assuming toleration we will plan on discharge home.  2326 Reevaluation: Patient feels improved.  Headache essentially gone.  Taking p.o. fluids well.  Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

                                                Normally sore following the vaccine starting around 9:00 PM last night.  Had shivers, nothing terrible.  By 6:00 AM the chills were intense, weakness, having less coordination and depth perception issue.  Closer to 9:00-10:00 AM felt like he had the flu 10 times worse than he should have.  Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

                                                It has been 6 weeks since my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. For the first 3-4 days I had the usual moderate flu-like symptoms:  dizziness, headaches, fatigue, chills, soreness at vaccine siteetc.  Days 5-7 I seemed to gradually improve. On day 8 all of the symptoms returned with greater severity: this time I had a fever, the chills were much more intense, the headaches were excruciating, body and joint aches all over the place--I couldn&#39;t sleep or focus on anything cognitively taxing.  Interestingly, my brother, who was vaccinated just after me, also had more severe side effects beginning on day 8 post 2nd dose. He improved after 3-4 days, but my recovery has been much much lengthier. By day 14 I was still feeling very ill, though the fever did subside.  Sometime in the third week the pain in my arm at the vaccination site returned, then became intermittent, and still bothers me from time to time. I also started getting muscle spasms in the same exact locations that sent me to the ER after my probably bout with Covid in the spring of 2020. Thankfully these lasted only a week or so, though I began feeling muscle soreness in different parts of my body, ever changing. By the 4th week I was slightly better and down to 4 main symptoms: chills (by far the worst of the symptoms--to the point at which my skin would feel like it was being frostbitten by dry ice every time I changed sweaty clothes), occasional splitting headaches, and muscle soreness that included both the injection site on my arm and other areas.  I had other symptoms as well, fatigue and brain fog, etc, but these were present before the vaccination, though not as severe.

                                                A little less than 3 hours after getting the shot, I noticed the injection site was getting very sore. Within about a half hour of first noticing it, that entire muscle was aching a lot. It?s now 4:50pm and it hurts to lift my arm, reach for anything, I can even feel it just by typing this out. I?ve also noticed I?m pretty tired, my joints feel very achey like when I have a cold, and I?m incredibly thirsty. The pain in the muscle at injection site is by far the worst symptom though. It?s extremely painful. I did not expect that since it didn?t hurt when getting the actual shot. Took my temp and it?s normal. The aching joints are far less painful than my arm, but are an issue nonetheless. Had I known this would happen beforehand, I would still get the shot, so as long as it doesn?t get a lot worse or something else haplens, all in all I?d have to say it was worth it.

The next day I was so exhausted I couldn&#39;t work for 2 days.  I barely got out of bed until about 40 hours after the shot where I was able to get out and do some gardening.   The reason I am filling this out was at right around 72 hours after the vaccine, I was laying down watching a YouTube video feeling quite relaxed.  I then experienced a tachycardia event where my heart rate went up to 120 and stayed there for about an hour.  I remained calm and was not experiencing anxiety, but the heart rate persisted.  I have had this happen before in panic attacks, but it&#39;s quite rare and I am in acute, high level stress.    Almost 2 weeks later to the day, I had another tachycardia, stronger than any I&#39;ve had my entire life that only lasted about 7 seconds, but I would estimate my heart rate jumped to over 250.   I thought I was going to go into cardiac arrest it was so jarring.  I&#39;m not sure if that one was related to the vaccine.

                                                The differences started out with a sore arm that occurred the same day as my 2nd dose which occurred the next day after my 1st dose. The morning after my 2nd dose I awoke around 8AM to a 102.1 F temperature and then took 2 extra strength Tylenol (500mg) around 8:15 AM. I felt very groggy, tired, and still had the sore arm. I felt hot and cold spells over the next 6 hour time period. I measured my temperature around 12:30 PM and it was 99.5 F, and I later took another dose of 2 Tylenol (500mg) around 2:10 PM. I was still feeling groggy and tired but the hot and cold fluctuations seemed to be abated. Around 9PM I measured my temperature again and it had  risen to 101.5F, so I took a shower then took two 200mg Advil/Ibuprophen and went to bed around 9:45 Pm . I awoke around 1AM that same night (03/25/21) and was sweating profusely in bed but was too tired to get up. I laid back down and went back too sleep. I awoke that morning around 7:50 AM feeling very sore in my muscles but no additional symptoms. My temperature was measured at 98.3F and I felt back to my normal self. No additional symptoms have presented afterwards.

                                                On 4/8/21 awoke to intense pain in his left foot about 12 hours after receiving his 1st dose Moderna vaccine batch #038B21A. Over the next few days swelling and pain increased in the left foot moving around from the big toe, to ankle, to arch. His foot was swollen and extremely painful and he was not able to walk or put weight on the foot. On 4/18 he went to the clinic. The doctor took fluid from the big toe joint to test uric acid levels. Elevated levels of uric acid confirmed his condition to be Gout and Indomethacin was prescribed for pain and swelling. He has never had Gout or any kind of arthritis,  joint pain or foot injury prior to the Moderna vaccine. As of 4/13/21 he is still unable to walk or sleep well due to pain and swelling in the foot. He is not able to work or resume normal daily activities.

                                                What a nightmare. Moderna shot #1 caused rapid hair loss and arm soreness for a week and low grade nausea. But shot #2, holy moly...  12 hours post shot, I developed a fever, chills, violent shaking much of the night, weight loss, nausea, kept throwing up, massive migraine, heart rate racing, every cell in my body throbbing in pain, difficulty urinating, simply staying alive was exhausting. It faded a couple days after the shot, and in its place, fatigue, difficulty getting a full breath in. And now I have tinnitus--constant ear ringing. Absolute torture. And of course significantly more hair loss. So let&#39;s add anxiety and depression to the list because of this hell.   What a regret it was to get injected with this poison. Rather just keep masking and avoiding people than be stuck with these permanent, life debilitating problems.  I know it wont change anything, but I figure I&#39;d report it anyway. What a nightmare.   This crap should not be given to anyone with an autoimmune disorder.

                                                Entire left arm, all the way from shoulder to the fingers swelled up to 1.5 times the normal size. The left index figure and thumb started tingling and became numb. The pain is present in the front and back of the left shoulder as well. Saw a Dr and she told me to take 4 x 200mg Motrin every 6hrs for next 4-5 days. She also gave Tylenol 3. The pain was so acute that I asked my doctor to just chop off my arm. I couldn&#39;t sleep, I couldn&#39;t stand, sit or lay down. It hurt all the time. Lost all strength in the left hand and arm.  Motrin and Tylenol didn&#39;t help with the pain. The swelling went down quite a bit in 3 days. Motrin caused a flare up of Crohn&#39;s.   Saw another Dr 5 days later. She prescribed gebapentin, flexrel, norco, toradol, etc. It&#39;s now been almost 20 days since the injection. The pain has subsided but not completely gone. I am still unable to do much work and it hurts just to sit! I still have pain and still do not have my strength back. I am still unable to go back to work.

I couldnt get out of bed: 1) Extreme heart palpitations, my heart rate monitor was reading an extremely high stress activity for 2 days post shot. 2) Very Hot and Very Cold body chill and temp swings 3) Sweating profusely, I soaked through my pajamas on 3 different occasions when I woke up from napping. 4) My pee was orange and hurt to pee. 5) My entire body hurt the worst I&#39;ve ever felt 6) All my joints were super painful, it hurt to walk and I couldn&#39;t sleep due to the pain. 7) I had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I came home from work and around 6:30 at night I started getting cold  Chills then I would get hot.  After tossing and turning all night with no sleep I got up at 5:45 a.m. I woke with a headache that lasted for about an hour and a 1/2 it went away then came back. Also when I was sleeping at night I noticed there was pain under my armpit. When I came home to take a shower I noticed my armpit was swollen In one spot. There is a little pain at the injection site but no swelling no redness.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

                                                Approximately 12 hours post-injection developed chills (around 10:30 pm). Went to bed and woke up with night sweats, aches, chills, fever (persistently over 100F, topped at 101.3F) and one of the worst headaches I?ve ever had (not hyperbole, truly a monster headache). Slept for small stretches of time, maybe 45-60 mins, before waking. Condition worsened until about 6-7am. Chills persisted but worst symptom was the headache, it was inescapable pain. At 9am, took 400mg ibuprofen and was able to fall asleep.  Woke again around 10:30, soaking wet in sweat, but felt much better. Headache about 95% resolved, fever subsided (temp returned to steady 98.2).  Felt generally tired the rest of the day, but overall much better than the overnight period.

When I woke up at 5 Am I suffered from severe headache. Remainder of the day I had extreme digestive issues that continued over the next several days. At the conclusion of the second day I developed a fever of 101. Pinpointed severe pain developed at the base of my neck between my shoulder blades. That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

                                                Patient is a 41 y.o. male on no AC/AP with no pmhx reported presents 1/31 PM initially to Hospital for acute onset 10/10 headache refractory to 800mg motrin which started in occipital region then spread to whole head and neck, nausea and vomiting x 3. Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

                                                Delayed reaction occurred 8 hrs. after receiving vaccine. Felt as if I was injected with the Flu, based on the symptoms that arose: chills, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, fever, body aches, weakness, no appetite or desire to hydrate(every single symptom was severe) These symptoms lasted 12 hrs. I chose to go in to work, instead of taking the day off. I truly believe that because I pushed my body through this painful ordeal, it helped me to overcome this Flu-like feeling that I endured for 12 hours: 10 of those at my job. I also experienced a swelling &amp; pain in my right knee. The pain &amp; swelling is finally subsiding as I type this report 4 days after the vaccine.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the injection my left arm (injection site arm) became sore.  The soreness ended on January 3rd.  No treatment was needed.    On January 1st I noticed tingling  in both of my legs.   Since then it has gotten worse.  I have tingling in both legs, muscle twitching throughout both legs intermittently, muscle weakness specifically after muscle use, an abnormal skin sensitivity when wearing pants, and a consistent ache throughout my legs.  The symptoms affect me 24 hours a day and create an anxiety that I have not felt before.  It has also adversely affected my sleep.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

On 1/12/2021, upon removing shirt at approximately 4:00 PM, silver dollar sized area of induration , hotness, pain and erythema noted at injection site.  No fever was observed. Contacted ID MD at employer and informed him of the findings.  He advised it could be an immune mediated response vs. cellulitis. Went to Urgent Care site on 1/13/2021 and was dx with cellulitis and was prescribed cephalexin 500 mg PO TID x 10 days.  By 1/16/2021, induration, pain, and erythema has resolved.  Interestingly, injection site is still a bit warmer than the surrounding tissue.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

                                                I received my first dose of the COVID vaccine on January 12, 2021.  I had a headache on the night of Jan 15 so took two Tylenol pills.  I woke up with a worse headache so took two Excedrin Migraine pills in the morning.  At about 10 am I started a 10 mile run, which is not unusually long for me.  I finished before noon and when I urinated , it was almost all blood, which has never happened to me before.  I went to the emergency room.  They gave me IV fluids and took some blood tests.  My creatinine levels were abnormally high but the doctor felt I overexerted myself and was too dehydrated even though the workout was not unusually for me.  On January 18th, I developed a quite painful lump in my left armpit, that lasted about a week.  I saw my primary care physician on Jan 23rd for a follow up.  He thought the lump was a swollen lymph node from the vaccine and was not concerned.  He scheduled blood tests and an ultrasound of my kidneys, all of which came back normal. I received my second vaccine shot on Feb 9th.  I developed a headache that night and have had a headache most of the time since.  I have taken several pills of Excedrin Migraine over these few days.  I also traveled to San Diego on the 10th and did a fairly long and arduous hike up a mountain on the 11th.  Although it was intense, it?s the type of hike I do several times a year and not completely out of the ordinary.  I was also a bit dehydrated again.  I woke early morning on the 12th with another headache so I took two more Excedrin MIgraines and went back to bed.  When I awoke about 6am, I urinated blood again.  I urinated blood for several hours and have finally drank enough water to end the blood urination. I normally work out intensely several times a week and do have bouts of dehydration.  But I have never urinated blood before.  I can?t help but believe it?s no coincidence that the two times in my life I?ve urinated blood have coincided with COVID vaccine shots.  Not sure how my exercises, dehydration, and use of NSAIDs  have contributed but something is going on and it needs to be investigated.

Since this morning around 5:00 am (and after the other symptoms resolved) I have noticed an itchy, reddish rash along the inside and outside of the arm (some in the should bit mostly in the bicept and tricept area) of the arm where I received the shot. The rash is also warm to the touch.

                                                Woke early one morning to a large painful lump on my right forearm. The lump was painful and felt like it was causing my arm to twist. Some hours later, my entire right arm was covered with large, painful, black and purple bruising. I had never experienced anything like this in my life. I often see blood in my urine, and during this time there was an unusually large amount. I don&#39;t know how to describe the feeling of lumps moving through my body, but I could definitely feel the movement through my arms and legs.

About midnight March 16 severe chills, restlessness, headache, muscle aches, nauseous and fever of 101.  Took two extra-strength Tylenol. 3 a.m. fever broke with sweats. Headache and body ache remained, as did chills. Took two Advil when I woke up about 7 a.m. on  March 16 for a headache. But I was too tired and achy to get out of bed. The fever came back to 102 degrees. Nauseous, couldn&#39;t eat much. Headache. At 2:30 p.m. on March 16, I felt better...  I was very tired the night of March 16 and still had a minor headache and went to bed about  8 p.m. On March 17, I was back to normal with only a very minor headache and some diahreaha that morning and afternoon.  I did not take any medicine that day. On March 18 I had no symptoms at all. I am a very healthy 42-year-old adult. I would classify my reaction as significant, but not severe. I called in sick to work (and I work from home). So it was enough to take me out of a day.

Symptoms began Saturday, 4/10; pt was helping her mother around her house; was not straining excessively; however, later that day had a sudden burning sensation in her lower-mid back, which has since been recurring in paroxysms.  At times it spreads into the posterior thighs but not into the feet; sometimes also spreads upward into the upper back and just below the chin.  In between attacks, there is no pain or numbness.  There has never been weakness. No urinary/bowel incontinence or saddle anesthesia; sphincter tone was normal.  NIF/FVC normal -60, 2.3L.  Paroxysmal pain controlled w/ 600mg gabapentin q8h since being hospitalized.  There has been no development or progression or symptoms, still only pain and normal neurologic and physical exam.

Brain fog became concern at 8 pm. Mild Difficulty navigating grocery store.  Extreme soreness has withstood 3 ibuprofen (x2 doses) and today took 1 hydrocodine in cabinet.  Brain fog has continued and not improved. Moderate forgetting.   Definitely not able to work today (Sunday) and doubt I will be able to work tomorrow. I am private practice dr. and will probably loose substantial income tomorrow. Completely NOT worth it and concerning with the brain fog. I strongly regret the second shot.  No symptoms after 1st shot.  The dose should be immediately reduced for 2nd shot. This strong of an immune response is not necessary.

                                                On Wednesday 1/27 the day after my second dose I felt a minor pinch/discomfort  on my lower leg.  I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.  On 2/5 I was able to physically see my doctor who told me that this was caused by the second dose of the moderne vaccine that I took on 1/26.

                                                The next morning after injection there was some discomfort at the injection site.  At 3:30 am CST I woke with a 100.8 fever, muscle and joint aches, chills, and headache.  I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen for the fever and pain throughout the day with rest.   The symptoms cleared around 9:30 pm CST that evening.

I woke up at 05:00 am CST on 2-13-2021 with a fever of 100.8, increased pain of body aches, muscles, headache, and chills.  These symptoms lasted all day long.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

Experienced extreme fatigue from 2/13/2021 through the 2/19, that was progressively better as time went on. , Experienced general weakness, mental fogginess, and  &#34;heaviness&#34; behind eyes and in the occipital muscles. Muscle aches in legs and torso were worse in the AM and present from 2/13/21 to 2/19/21 that got progressively better further out from vaccination.

I also experienced acute memory loss, I can remember events at 4 PM on day of injection but nothing until the next morning, and I have inflammation and swelling at my left knee, likely pre-patellar bursitis. There is no history of either moderate side effect. There is no obvious explanation (e.g. a fall) that explains the knee bursitis.

                                                After an hour of  receiving the moderna covid-19 vaccine on February 20th my left arm started burning, The burning sensation hasn&#39;t stopped since I got the first dose. In fact it has gotten worse, now my arm feels week, my fingers tingle and the burning sensation radiates to my neck and left ear.  I been to the emergency room, VA clinic, and local clinic and nobody has helped me. Everyone just tells me to take ibuprofen, Tylenol, naproxen, use hot and cold compressions. Nothing has helped, If someone can call me and help me I will really appreciated.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.  Moderna killed my obsession for food.  I was 268 lbs when I presented for the 1st dose of Moderna at the Robeson CRV.  Within 24 hours I was weak, cold, aching all over, and nauseous. The nausea moved over to lack of interest in food.     I&#39;ve struggled with intense craving for food non-stop for 30 years.  The cravings are gone.  By my second shot in March I was down to around 260 lbs.  Twenty days after my second shot, I am down to 252lbs.  Food is more of a necessity now rather than a constant desire.  I believe the vaccine modulated insulin/ghrelin or crossed the blood brain barrier and modulated the incessant dopamine reward signaling in the mesolimbic DA pathway when I eat food.  I reach satiety easily now.  I also have diminished need for Ativan.  I use to drink close to a gallon of water a day.  Now I have no real interest.  I might drink a couple liters a day.  To put things in perspective, before Moderna, I could eat 2 foot long Subway sandwiches, 3-6 cookies, 2-4 32 oz of soda and chips to stop my hunger for 2-3 hours.  2-3 hours later I would feel extremely hungry with a growling stomach. I could then consume 2-3 double cheeseburgers, a 20 piece nugget, 2 parfaits, and a chocolate sundae.  After Moderna, now a half a Subway sandwich and maybe a cookie are enough to last for most of the day.  The desire for food has diminished to necessity to eat and lack of interest in eating, even when my stomach is empty.  If I have a soda or sparkling water, I might have 1 or 2 and stop.  Moderna flipped some hormonal switch in my body.  It&#39;s great.  Food went from being an insatiable desire to a basic necessity.  I&#39;ve lost 16 pounds in 1 month and 20 days without trying.

                                                Initial (starting next day) - I began feeling achy, which went away after about one day. For several days I was more tired than usual and &#34;passing out&#34; at night earlier than I normally go to bed.  Concerning event - beginning the evening of 19 FEB 21, I began feeling tired and achy and a fever set in. From 20-27 FEB I regularly had a fever of 102-104 degrees Fahrenheit. I went to the hospital on 21 FEB after over 24 hours with a fever and a heart rate of about 115 bpm with concern of afib. During this period (20-27 FEB) I believe my heart rate did not drop below 90 bpm and was regularly in the range of 110-115 bpm. While sleeping my heart rate was commonly in the high 90s. I did not experience afib. I lost approximately 15 lbs during that week and was unable to eat. Since then I have not been able to eat a full meal based on my eating habits prior to being vaccinated. I have continued to lose weight slowly (1-2 lbs per week), but my weight will fluctuate back up by 1-2 lbs as my bowel movements are infrequent. I am currently only eating about once per day with limited snacking. I use Ensure and my vitamins to avoid concerns of malnutrition.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

                                                Severe Headache within 1 hour of vaccination (01/20/21 @1330hours), followed by a slight fever within 6 hours and fatigue. Overnight, I experienced severe chills and body aches, and severe fatigue, which followed the rest of the morning (01/21/21) with general discomfort. By that early afternoon the chills subsided, and I continued to feel body aches with minimal joint pain. By 4 pm, I began to develop an itchy rash on my left wrist under my wristwatch, left hand and on my right forearm. I experience fatigue throughout the rest of the day. I used over the counter Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream to alleviate the itch.  On the Morning of 01/22/23, I woke up to a itchy rash over my torso and my hands. I continued to apply the cream and I took an OTC Benadryl allergy pill, which seems to subside the rash.  On 01/23/21, I woke up the the same  rash over my feet and overall, the rash over my torso and hands had substantially subsided.

                                                Experienced severe pain in the right shoulder/bicep area, the opposite arm from the injection (injection was given in the left arm). Pain became worse and worse as days went on, and eventually limited what I can use the arm for. I can not raise it up past my rib cage with severe pain. After speaking with a friend who is a doctor, they mentioned Parsonage Turner Syndrome and Brachial neuritis, all the symptoms match the discriptions of those. I immediately started using a Tens unit to help stimulate the shoulder and arm area, began ice treatment and taking tylenol for the pain. The doctor in the office I work at after listening to the issue and symptoms said the same thing and started me on Gabapentin to help with the nerve pain and is going to continue to monitor the symptoms. It has been 46 days since getting the 2nd shot, and I have been at a 8 to a 9 out of 10 pain-wise almost 24/7, it has affected my ability to work and i have had to call in a few days because of the pain and being unable to use my right arm proficiently (I am right handed), it has affected my family and my ability to get things done around the house and engage my children and it has affected my ability to get a good sleep.

On the first night after the vaccination I began to get body aches.  During day 2 the body aches became extreme, where getting out of bed or moving was painful.  The body aches were less severe on days 2 and 3, but are still continuing on day 4.  I was running  a fever all of day during days 2, 3, and 4.  I was throwing up on day 3.  I had GI pain and diarrhea on day 4.  I never have headaches, but have had a headache since day 2 and it is now day 5.  I have had lower back pain since day 2 and that also continues today (day 5).

One week after vaccine I had blood work done and my liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were.  On 3/23 I admitted myself to ER with jaundice and vomiting.  My liver levels were normal but bilirubin was still high.  At this point I had lost 30 pounds since my shot.   I was in the hospital for 5 days where the ran UT, CT, and MRI on my abdomen with none showing issues.   Jaundice and itchiness/jaundice got progressively worse.   The hospital ran multitude of blood tests to pin point the issue and even did a liver biopsy.  No tests showed anything abnormal but biopsy isn?t back yet.  At this point 4/1/21, I am still jaundiced, extremely itchiness, lethargy and a total of 33 pounds weigh loss.

During this time, I also became nauseated and puked several times. after these events, I had a severe headache for most of the following day and a very sore arm.

                                                I had muscle aches to the point where it felt like the chest and back were caving in at the same time. I had fast heart palpitations. I got dizzy and felt weak at points. I went to the Doctor and it was also determined that I was wheezing when he checked my lungs. He prescribed me a 30 day usage of the Albuterol Sulfate pump to help with the wheezing 3x a day.I saw the doctor January 23rd.3 days after receiving the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA.

Then severe rash over torso, arms, buttocks, thighs, and back consistent with what I experienced during Lyme Disease this past summer.  Raised itchy rash in large red blotches over most of body.  I didn&#39;t realize it at the time but the same (but less severe) reaction took place after the first Moderna Vaccine shot as well.  I was prescribed Doxycycline by my local Urgent Care and stayed on it for 14 days following the first dose of Moderna.  I didn&#39;t put the two things together immediately because I has gone hunting in the woods and assumed that I was bitten by another tick.  Full body rash is what caused me to go seek attention at the Urgent Care.  The symptoms following the second dose were much more severe and uncomfortable.  The rash subsided in 4-5 days without medication.

                                                Took vaccine in left arm late afternoon on Friday 2/12/21. The initial symptoms were only very painful muscle pain on the injected arm, and some mild body ache and mild chills for 2-3 days but nothing major. On Monday 2/15/21 was feeling very well and had nice workout in the morning , feeling energetic .  However, in the morning on Tuesday 2/16/21, I started having very strong abdominal cramps, feeling bloated, nausea, that was lasting for several hours and increasing in pain . After 5 hours of pain, I asked my wife to take me to Hospital. There I was diagnosed with Appendicitis after a Cat Scan. My appendix was inflamed and I had to go thru surgery that same day .

                                                After receiving my shot, I waited the half an hour. I felt a pinch in my head and tightness in shoulders and neck. Once I reached the parking lot I was belching ridiculously and started feeling like vomiting. Than my chest hurt.  Went back to the clinic and said I don&#39;t feel right.  They had me stand in line and wait to be re-admitted.  The nurse starting taking blood pressure and offered me water I could not swallow the tiniest amount.  My neck felt like I was being chocked. My fingers on my left arm started tingling and arm was getting slightly red and arm felt heavy. The nurse said my symptoms were happening internally.  The doctor had me remove my mask and looked at the back of my mouth. Than used a stethoscope on my chest and the back.  Asked  if I had asthma , said no. He Than requested epinephrine shot and a steroid. With in a few seconds I started feeling like I could breathe. He prescribed an epinephrine pen incase I had another episode. Two day later I had another visit online with doctor from about redness on left and right arm. Having another allergic reaction and possible site infection. Now I&#39;m taking 10 days antibiotics and allergy medicine.

                                                I was feeling cold throughout the day, at about 9:00 pm I took a shower to try to get warmed up, I just kept getting colder and colder until I was severely shaking uncontrollably. Every muscle was so tense and I was shaking so badly I could barely walk or breathe. I went to the bedroom and got under blankets with a heater and in a few minutes the shaking diminished to where I could start breathing normal again. It took about an hour before my shakiness went away completely but I still needed to stay under the blankets and near the heater as I felt I was still cold and on the verge of getting the severe chills again. I had no fever. Next morning (as I&#39;m writing) I&#39;m still worried about getting out of bed as I still don&#39;t feel right and am scared of getting the chills like that again.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

                                                I received my Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination at approximately 0800 am on February 10, 2021. At approximately 1800 hrs the same day, I experienced a sudden onset of muscle spasms to my lower back. I was at rest, sitting in a chair at the time of onset. The muscle spasm to my lower back was extremely intense and I had difficulty walking. This continued for about 1.5 hours. Also, during this time, I experienced cramping to the arches of both my feet. This was intermittent. I also had pain/soreness to my hips bilaterally. After approximately 1.5 hours the lower back spasms and cramping to my feet subsided.  I do not have a history of lower back issues and this is my first experience of spasms of my lower back.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

No other pain the day of injection. Day after injection (approximately 18 hours later) the entire right arm ached; then the aching moved to the lower back and eventually both legs. Pain resolved at approximately 30 hours after injection; ache never affected left (non-injected) arm.  Minor headache seemed to be forming, but never progressed past the initial indications. Was extremely tired the day following the injection; took two naps (1-2 hours each) and slept 12 hours that night (i.e., injected Friday, tired all day Saturday and slept longer than normal Saturday night). Aside from soreness at injection point, no further signs/symptoms on Sunday (i.e., resolved around 36 hours after injection).

                                                Good morning, I received my 2nd shot yesterday at approximately 9:15a.  I had no issues during the observation period.  Last night at approximately 9:45p I started to feel as if I was catching a fever due to my joints aching and bland taste in my mouth.  At approximately 10:15p I started to shiver, had a headache and had tightness in the lower left side of my back.  So I took my temperature and I had a low grade fever 99.7.  At the point I went and had a hot shower.  After that I laid on the heating pad for 30 minutes and my back tightness subsided.  I stopped shivering at roughly 11:15p but continued to have a headache and aching joints.  My temperature right now is 100.3, joints are still aching but not as bad as last night, headache and chills.  Is there anything that I can take, Advil etc?  Also, I forgot to mention the arm soreness as well but I had that on the 1st shot as well.

Tylenol and Benadryl took care of it fairly well.  Had arm pain at site of injection, like I was hit in arm with a baseball bat.  Had some gerd too but not sure if related. Tiredness started around 9 hours after the shot, but symptoms really kicked in about 12 hours after administration.  Lasted till about 46 hours after administration, at which time I woke up from overnight sleep feeling great.  Arm still sore and there might be some lingering joint pain but nothing to keep me from doing anything.

                                                Substantial left shoulder pain has occurred since ~1 hour after the injection.  Interferes with sleep, regardless of position (&amp; unable to lie on left side).  Unable to elevate shoulder overhead into flexion or abduction d/t pain (limited to ~45 degrees).  Tenderness over lateral shoulder/SIT tendons.  Positive impingement sign.  Seems to be tendon/shoulder injury d/t faulty injection technique.  I had minimal shoulder soreness after the first injection.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

This did not start going down until today.  I am not intending on seeking medical attention.    I ran very high fevers that were not able to be taken down by Tylenol right away.    I was out of my head with a little confusion and delirium for a few hours.  I experienced muscle aches and fatigue. I experienced itchy and crawly feelings on my skin.

Sitting upright in a char and driving a car made the pain worse. Difficulty sleeping due to pain and having to sleep on one side. Soothed the pain temporarily with a menthol rub but the pain would not go away  Sunday, March 7: Pain (burning, stinging, aching, quaking) unbearable to the point that I stayed in bed most of the day but could not sleep. Sitting upright continued to make pain worse. Menthol rub did not make pain go away. Pain intensified throughout the day in left shoulder and neck, shoulder blade, arm, and hand.  Monday, March 8: Appointment with Dr, internal medicine specialist who is my mother&#39;s primary care physician. Dr. suspected that I may be suffering from brachial neuritis and recommended that I see a neurologist for further diagnosis. He prescribed Gabapentin (nerve pain medication) and a series of steroid medication (Prednizone) for me to take throughout the week. I asked him how long I would have to take the medication in weeks/months to come. He said as long as I am feeling the pain. That night, when I started taking the medication, the pain flared up deep in my shoulder and down my arm like a fireball!   Tuesday, March 9 - Thursday, March 11: Gabapentin was not effective with reducing extreme pain. Dr. instructed me to increase dosage as needed. A day later, he called in a prescription for -------, a pain medication that he said I could take with Gabapentin to help strengthen relief. Made appointment with Dr, neurologist with Medical Group.   Friday, March 12:  Appointment with Dr. Initial tests suggest to him that my condition could be either brachial neuritis. He ordered MRI and EMG nerve test. I asked if I would be able to drive back to home. He advised against driving at all given my medications and ongoing pain, as well as the need to arrive at a clear diagnosis. I asked him what I should do about getting the second Moderna shot. He told me that I should not get the second shot. I am scheduled to get the second shot on Friday, March 26, at a vaccination site, State University.

The were also muscle aches. The symptoms were severe enough to leave me stuck in bed. The symptoms persisted for 4 days and on the night of the 4th day I suddenly developed a persistent pain in my lower back. In the morning I went to the emergency room where I tested negative for Covid and a cat scan revealed that my body going through the side effects of the vaccine knocked a centimeter sized kidney stone loose.

                                                Initially, I felt fatigued and my left deltoid was sore. On day three after vaccination, I had one episode of hematuria. On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

Received the second dose 2/2/21 and began to feel body aches approx 12 hours later  As the night went on the muscle aches and joint pan were so bad I couldn&#39;t sleep  I took OTC Tylenol for the pain but it barely touched it. Every joint and muscle hurt.  Now. 24 hours later from receiving the shot I&#39;m  beginning to feel a little better but muscle pain still present. No fever throughout.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

I was still a little sore in lower back the day after the shot and was tired by the end of my work day.  3rd day back to normal.

Last night, on day 8, after five&#43; days of no pain whatsoever, and through the night to today (day 9) I am again experiencing acute arm pain similar to  the worst pain I felt in the days after the injection, both at the injection site and radiating down my arm and into my shoulder.  I took Tylenol which has provided some relief, but my range of arm motion is still limited by sharp pain.

I woke up I believe in the early morning hours a couple of days later in pain.  The pain caused me to wake up.  After that I noticed that my elbow joints, and knee joints were very sore.  I was unable to flex my arms (mainly right arm) or knees (mainly right knee) after that for approximately two weeks without feeling pain.  Extremely sore joints starting in arm/elbow joint followed by extremely sore knee joints.  Overall body aches mainly in joints.  Persists to the time of this writing

Less than 24 hours later developed chills, sweat, aches and pain.  By 30 hours after the injection I developed pain in my lower back that spread to my right ground.  In 48 hours I was now experience excruciating  pain in my groin with a constant and intolerable pain down my leg into the knee area which continued for hours.  I was unable to find a position of comfort and was taken to the ER .  I was immediately given a morphine drip which was not successful and then administered Dilaudid for the pain which was able to calm it down but not end it.  At the time of this writing (About 72 hours after 2nd injection) I am unable to stand or walk without pain in my groin and knee area.  Part of my thigh and Knee are have developed numbness and extreme discomfort.  I can finally only sit with much pain.  This Moderna Vaccine was administered through my employer.

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

                                                I tested postive for COVID-19 on December 2, 2021.  I got my first vaccine shot on January 20, 2021. I didn&#39;t feel the shot at all. In fact, it is the gentlest shot I have ever received. Later that night I felt some pain in my left arm, which increased significantly that next day. The pain last for about two days, then almost suddenly went away. The pain then moved between by arm and neck for about 12 hours before going away. There were no other symptoms that I was aware of. No fever, no fatigue, etc.   SEE ATTACHED

                                                My arm was sore for 3 days as though I had been punched really hard.  After that  my deltoid became incredibly irritated and I started having stabbing, excruciating pain in my should any time it moved.  This lasted until I went in to get a shot of local anaesthetic from my doctor  on 2/25/21.  I was taking advil, tylenol, a muscle relaxer, lydecane cream and then I got the shot of anaesthetic.  I slowly had a little bit of improvement in mobility.  13 days after my vaccine, I was no longer experiencing shooting pain in my shoulder.  It is now March 1st and I think I have regained about 70% of my  mobility in that arm.  I believe that the shot made my deltoid flex and freak out and this ended up causing bicep tendinitis.  This is also my doctor&#39;s theory.

About 9:45 am driving, I noticed my face starting to numb on my right hand side beginning with my upper lip, around my nostril, cheek and jaw line. After an hour of numbness, I called my doctors office and spoke with a nurse. The nurse had not heard of these symptoms before and sent me to the local ER at the hospital. As we drove to the ER, I noticed my jaw muscles getting tighter, but not so over powering that it felt like it would lock up. While under observation for an an hour or so, a Physician?s Assistant did neurological exams as my symptoms looked like a potential mild stroke. I passed the exams and sent home to observe any changes. The morning of day two (today), I have strong flu like symptoms with chills, shivering, aching muscles and the skin on my back and neck have a pins and needles feeling. What?s more, I have a present ringing in my ears today.

                                                About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to develop a fever.  I understand that fever, muscle aches and head aches are possible side effects of vaccinations in general and this one in particular.  Since I had tested positive for antibodies for the third time just two weeks prior to receiving this first dose of Moderna I was anticipating some reactions similar to what I have heard people experiencing for their second shot.  What followed the initial onset of fever was the worst flu symptoms I have ever experienced in my 48 years.  Fever continued to increase reaching 103 if not higher at times and staying elevated at level for over 6 hours.  Chills to the point of convulsions.  Nausea and one time vomiting.  Fever dreams (mild hallucinations), profuse sweating, intense head aches.  Muscle aches I could barely tolerate that I felt over every inch of my body.  This continued until 10am the following morning when I took some advil and finally fell asleep to the point of being virtually unwakeable until 2:30pm.  Upon waking I was able to sit up and drink water but the muscle soreness and slight fever continued throughout the day (101 fever).   I was able to eat some toast that evening.  That night the fever returned but not as high as the previous night.  The sweating was still profuse throughout the night and the muscle aches continued  but to a lessor degree.  The following day the fever subsided though muscle soreness continued.  That evening I was able to sleep regularly and now today (three full days after vaccination) I am roughly back to myself.  I understand that reading this seems as if these symptoms fall in line with what is expected and understand to be the side effects of the vaccine.  I am here today to tell you that I thought I was dying.  I have never, ever felt so terrible ever.  It was ten times worse than having covid.  I cannot imagine  anyone who is not healthy and string making through that and I can not believe I am expected to do it again to complete my vaccination.

The morning of January 12, 2021 I woke with severe muscle and joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue.  As the day progressed I developed chills to the point I could not get warm.  I also developed a low grade fever.  After taking two ibuprofen around 3p the pain subsided to an ache about my entire body by 9p, headache had subsided and I had no more chills or fever.  On the morning of January 13, 2021 I woke with a red rash going up the inside of both arms and around the outside of my upper arms and down my entire back.  As the day has progressed that rash has spread down the back of legs as well.  I did take one Benadryl with minimal effect.

As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

Symptoms began approximately 24 hours after receiving the second vaccine, and gradually subsided over the following 24 hours, with only moderate diarrhea, heart palpitations, and fatigue remaining. It was by far the worst reaction I&#39;ve ever had to a vaccine The only side effects after the first vaccine were moderate fatigue the evening of the vaccine and moderate arm pain.

                                                On 12 FEB 2021 I received my first dosage of the Moderna COVID 19 Vaccine, Lot 016M20A. On the day of the vaccination, the pain from Psoriatic Arthritis  (primarily bi-lateral feet was low in comparison to the average level of pain over the last 7 days).  There was also discomfort in the hips which for time to time had presented with point pain at the connection of the hip to the Femur. BLUF: Most significant joint/muscoskeletal pain related to exacerbation locations for Psoriatic Arthritis that I have ever endured since receiving the injection.  Prepared for second vaccination, but fearful of PSA not being in control and dramatic escalation in discomfort in feet and hips, affecting ability to walk.  I received my vaccination at some time after 1400 hours, 12 FEB.  No issues noted until approximately 2300 hours, 12 FEB, when significant and debilitating pain was noted in multiple joints or areas affected by recent Psoriatic Arthritis exacerbations.   Initial Pain made it difficult to sleep from the 12th into the 13th due to significant discomfort. Through that first night, the pain immediately flared, bilateral feet, left and right hip and point pain at three locations on veterbrae, (lower, mid and upper back).  Pain was most pronounced in feet and left hip,  the feet (all toes seemed to throb in pain and were sensitive to touch or simple movements).  Pain in feet and left hip was a 10/10.  Left hip pain was slightly different than the point pain and seemed to radiate out from the area where it connects to the femur. 13 FEB: By 0815 on 13 FEB the pain in the right foot and right hip decreased, as well as the pain in the lower, mid and upper back but the pain in the left foot and left hip continued, slightly less strong than the night prior.  Pain level decreased to 8/10 for left foot and hip and was down to a 5/10 for the right foot and hip and a 3/10 for the areas on the back. In the evening of 13 FEB it was noted that the pain in the left hip became more generalize:d vice the specific point pain that I have witnessed off/on since SEP 2020.  Continued to note evening pain that felt like burning/tingling pain on both feet.  At this point the pain in the evenings appeared to be worse than the AM pain.   Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 It should be noted, that left shoulder discomfort from the injection never exceed 2/10 as it appeared 24 hours after the injection.  More pain in shoulder associated with mobility/rotation? I lacked the ability to simply walk through the house due to the pain throughout the past 36 hours.   14 FEB: Less discomfort in AM, but still greatest in left foot. Left Foot: 7/10 Fight foot: 4/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 3/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 4/10 PM:  Significant increase in pain at bed time. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10 15 FEB: AM: continued lessening of pain/discomfort in AM, but appeared back throughout the day, worsening at evening.  Pain in left hip was noted to be much more pronounced shooting out in multiple directions, to include causing discomfort from the rear of the hip, and when seated shooting pain in the direction of my inner thigh from the back of my hip.  Pain in feet continues to be like a burning/tingling pain in the evening, most pronounced in 2nd and 3rd toes on my left foot and big toe and little toe on my right foot.  The pain also appears to be much greater at evening than in AM. Left Foot: 9/10 Fight foot: 7/10 Left and right hips generalized pain: Left Hip 8/10 right hip 6/10 Lower, mid and upperback: 5/10-not much change-very point specific pain.. I am not witnessing fatigue or any other problems other than joint/musco skeletal pain.  I have also not been getting shooting pain in feet that has appeared from time to time which feels like someone hammering nails into individual toes or shots of violent pain, only a sustained burning/tingling pain. four days later the Psoriatic Arthritis locations continue to rage following the vaccine, most notably bilateral feet and left hip, where the pain in the hip appears to be radiating in multiple directions.

On second night after receiving the vaccine, I had severe headaches and alternating chills/sweats.   72hrs after the vaccine,  pain continues, although it has subsided to the point where almost full motion is possible.  Periodic severe headaches continue, although these existed before receiving the vaccine and are linked to positive COVID in Nov 2020.

Saturday morning, I felt the same -I took OTC med for the pain - no fever; body aches, watery eyes and I was very weak. I drank orange juice and I took some Zinc; vitamin C - and I hurt all that day - bones still achy but not quite as much. Sunday morning, I wasn&#39;t normal but better and by Sunday noon I was better; not weak anymore. On a scale from one to 10, I felt like a ten when it was bad. My injection site was sore for a good four days. I took it on a Friday but Tuesday the arm was good to go.

                                                Severe shaking to the point I could barely walk, talk, or function in general. In fact, had to end work conference call due to effects.  In desperation, I have my wife help me into a hot shower where I continued to shake violently for about 25 minutes.  My wife continued to monitor me to make sure I didn&#39;t collapse or pass out and continually ask if we should go to the ER.  However, after about 25 minutes the shaking subsided and I was left exhausted with some minor muscle pain due to shaking.  It was very difficult to breath during the incident, noticed my hands turning blue so I focused on deep breaths and staying calm to eventually stop it.

                                                I definitely had a soreness at the injection site, more than I have had with any other shot. It definitely subsided after a couple of days. Also had joint pain in my hands, elbows, and knees, and particularly in my left knee where I have arthritis, also decreased in intensity within a few days of the shot.   About a week after the shot, my arm began to itch at the injection site, and swelling and a half-dollar sized red patch appeared, and the skin was hot to the touch. Today (2 days later), the red patch is roughly the size of a small envelope. The skin is still warm or hot to the touch and the swelling may have subsided slightly. I am not taking any antihistamines or using any topicals- just working on not scratching the area. I have read some info on the internet referring to this as &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. It is manageable, and I am NOT deterred from getting my second shot in April.

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

I forced myself to go to work.  I am a Registered Nurse.  The joint pain and aches increased throughout the day along with altered periods of chills and hot flashes.  Around 6 PM on the 29th is started feeling worse.   I felt like I was tachycardic.  I had my wife take my blood pressure.  My normal vitals are Pulse-50, BP 110/60.  When I took my vitals at 6:00 pm my pulse was 91 and my BP was 85/53.  Clearly an allergic reaction.  I had no difficulty breathing.  Finally, around 1:00 am on 1/30, my fever broke and my heart rate and BP returned to normal ranges.  My first vaccination was unremarkable with only a sore arm for three day.

I felt a little off, but I thought I was ok.  I entered my shower, and then I was found unconscious on the floor of my shower by my wife about 5 minutes later.  I passed out 2 more times while attempting to stand and exit the shower.  I was extremely fatigued at this point.  I went back to bed and slept until 10 pm that night.  I woke for about 2 hours , ate  some food and drank some water and soda pop.  I then went back to sleep until 7:30 am  the next morning.   I was awake for 3 hours, and then I slept for 3 more hours.  I have been awake for about 2 hours, and I am now typing this adverse event document.   The entire time I have had temperature regulation issues, severe headache, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

Couldn&#39;t stay on my feet longer than a couple of minutes. It got  less severe with time, but not very fast. I was able to take a walk outside again for the first time 6 days after the shot. Today, a week after the shot, my knees still hurt, and I still don&#39;t feel like I can run.

When that pain subsided during the second day after the shot, I started to get some swelling and pain in my left armpit. Discomfort was such that it interfered with my ability to sleep through that night. The following day (Day 3 after injection) the discomfort mostly subsided but still has not completely gone away. Currently on Day 6 after injection. No treatments or medications have been applied to alleviate the issue.

                                                After I got the shot, on the way home, I started feeling tingling on tongue and lips; had a metallic taste. I felt like I had allergies - I was a little congested - but the next morning, 04:00 am -  I was still congested - and was still breathing short and shallow. I get to work and I&#39;m open mouth breathing - not breathing correctly. It felt like my lungs were swollen on the inside and throat was swollen on inside. Couldn&#39;t palpate and feel it but just couldn&#39;t access the lower lungs breathing-wise. Started getting dizzy and couldn&#39;t think - from 05:00 am to 09:00 am - and I decided I couldn&#39;t work anymore. I went to headquarters and I couldn&#39;t talk from lack of breathing - would have to stop just to think or just to breathe. I drove by the clinic where I was got my vaccine and decided to go in - I was so dizzy and I realized I shouldn&#39;t be driving. They told me to get up and move and I told them I couldn&#39;t breathe and I&#39;m not one to say that but they called an ambulance that took me ER. (I was a LPN at one time so I wasn&#39;t anxious.)  And they told me it was anxiety - and they kept telling me to breathe. But it wasn&#39;t an anxiety attack at all. My heartrate was normal. I was shallow breathing. They gave me a paper bag to breathe into. That&#39;s it .I was there for a couple of hours. They had told me to rest. I shouldn&#39;t have gotten out of bed that morning - my body just didn&#39;t want to move. I felt a little better after a couple of hours and people helped me from there to get home. After that, I felt better - about 4 pm or 5 pm. Second vaccine - felt flu like symptoms for three days after. I still feel a little weird - my bones hurt and I&#39;m achy. Just not feeling right. Note: When I was in the emergency room - my hands were purple. Circulation was weird.They told me my oxygen levels were fine and that I just needed to breathe. It caused carpal tunnel in my wrist - I had nerve damage on that about three weeks - I have about 80 percent nerve damage from previous and so when something irritates it  - it takes a while to recover from it but I have.  I consulted with a doctor about the reaction to first vaccine before getting the second vaccine.

He was not due for a second Pfizer vaccine until 03/20/2021. He had two administration errors on 03/18/2021 as he was inadvertently given wrong brand - Moderna - dose was given too early by 2 days. I spoke with patient on 03/24/2021 to notify him of the two administration errors. I let him know there are no current studies for effect on interchangability of vaccines or doses given too early, but that current CDC guidance does not recommend or require any further doses and he would be considered fully immunized at this time. He reports he did well with his second dose, and only had 1-2 days of some muscle aches and mild lymphadenopathy under vaccinated arm, which resolved quickly. RN.

Differential diagnosis includes guillain barre syndrome vs. transverse myelitis. No MS on brain MRI. No cord lesion. Treatment included IVIG 0.5g/kg daily x 4 days, B12, 1 mg IM daily x 3 days. bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  4/7: MRI cervical spine: Small focal area of increased T2 signal within the central cervical cord at the C2 level without associated postcontrast enhancement. A demyelinating disease is leading differential consideration. 4/11: MRI brain: normal, no de-myelinating disease; MRI C-spine: severe cervical stenosis with flattening of spinal cord but no cord edema/enhancement.

                                                On 4/13 Patient underwent aortic root replacement with saphenous vein graft reconstruction of the right coronary artery. He had no prior coronary disease. This operation was done for an enlarging aortic root aneurysm in the setting of Marfan syndrome. The right coronary was anomalous and needed vein extension for reimplantation. He recovered very well and was seen in our clinic on 4/23, with no unusual findings. He had a normal echo, EKG and DVT study performed.   On 4/28 he had his first Moderna COVID19 dose. on 5/1, he developed malaise, myalgias, painful lymph nodes, chills, and chest pain. He called my clinic and was instructed to go to the ER, but then felt better and didn&#39;t go. He was then found unresponsive later that afternoon and was pronounced dead on arrival of EMS.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                My Left shoulder became red at the injection site and swollen.  I also have pain and stiffness going from the injection site all the way up to the base of my skull.  If I look down at my hands, my cell phone, the ground or even at a desk too long, the left side of my neck gets so stiff that it hurts to raise my head back up to normal height.  The muscles in my left shoulder and left side of my neck are so tight that it seems like I have been lifting weights for days.  I have not worked out in months.  Today is 1/23/21 and I still have the problem.   I also had a migraine headache for three to four days after the vaccine.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

Patient was breathing but unresponsive, stiff, and unable to blink, talk, or move for around 2-3 minutes.  Once the seizure ended I asked patient if he had a history of seizures, his answer was, &#34;not really&#34;. He drank some of the water and sat with the ice pack for a couple minutes and said he felt better. Color returned. Patient stated he felt nerves contributed more than anything and was feeling 100% better when he left. We had dialed 911 while patient was unresponsive but once he was able to talk again he declined 911 and stated feeling much better.

                                                Slight injection site pain following morning (2/6). By late evening 2/6 approx 1830 hours, my joints ached and I got very sleepy. Generally just felt worn out. Went to bed and woke up 2/7 perfectly fine. No more fatigue or aching joints, just slight injection site pain for a couple more days.

                                                Same evening, 3/6 at about 2000 hours, got cold chills and the shakes. Felt exhausted and all muscles ached. The next morning 3/7 at approximately 0830, same effects as previous, but also a horrible migraine and vomiting. Took one 6ml injection Sumatriptan for migraine in opposite arm from Covid vax, no effect and no relief. 1300 hours, migraine was so intense, I advised my wife I would do a 2nd Sumatriptan injection and if it didn&#39;t work, I would need to be brought to the emergency room. 2nd injection was successful in relieving migraine approx 45 min after injection. Felt run down, but was able to go to work the next morning 3/8. Felt tired and run down on 3/8, but symptoms went away by late evening. This was surprising, since my first Covid vax dose 4 weeks prior didn&#39;t affect me as bad as this 2nd dose

I was only able to lift my arm above my head with assistance from my right arm. Eventually I was able to lift my arm without assistance and the same phenomena happened the third evening where my shoulder was frozen and immobilized.  The frozen shoulder has abated but there is still moving poi&#39;s of major swelling in the upper arm. There has been persistent but slowly abating symptoms of deep soreness, arm weakness and weak grip strength. Swelling persists in the upper front portion of left shoulder. I can not do extended tasks with the arm because it does not have strength nor stamina.

I also developed lower back pain and had Urinary Frequency with bad urine odor. This started 48hours after having the other symptoms. I started to take antibiotics Levaquin and tested negative for Covid-19. The urinary symptoms and other symptoms were reduced after three days. I felt like the illness was coming and going in three hour increments. I had mostly recovered by the sixth day. I got the second dose of the vaccine and had no symptoms that were similar.

I describe it as suffering some sort of trauma and it was accompanied by crushing fatigue.   Symptoms have improved but persist until today 03/29/2021: knee pain, weakness in the knees and fatigue.   Difficulty functioning normally: walking, ascending &amp; descending stairs and simply standing in place.   Symptoms worsen at night, knees become frozen and have to be adjusted with hands.

                                                SYMPTOM 1 - Pronounced persistent vertigo 7 days after Moderna Shot #1.  Very healthy.  Never before experienced vertigo of any significance.  Degree of vertigo strong for entire first day undeniably present/persistent and varies (slightly improved, then worsens again) since day 8. Able to get through day but disturbing. Extremely healthy otherwise,  extremely athletically capable.  Nothing unusual in diet or sleep or activity or stress in recent days.  SYMPTOM 2 - Ringing ears on day 11, and increasing on day 12.  This too - never before of any significance in entire life.  Could it be related to the vertigo symptoms?  Feels like it is.  *** Please take note! *** Hard to dismiss as unrelated.  I&#39;m just one.  You have the sample data.  Seems as though auditory/balance nerves are getting a beating somehow.  This is NOT an exasperated pre-existing condition.  The shoulder soreness / tiredness - was a 1 day matter quickly resolved.  This is more insidious and persistent and debilitating.

                                                I experienced &#34;Moderna Arm&#34; on the day following the injection, but it subsided after a couple of days. Eight days later, though, it returned (swelling/redness/milder pain) -- accompanied by swelling in my right ankle and tightness/some tingling/mild pain in my right ankle/upper calf. I suffered a blood clot for the first time in each leg in early November; the more serious of the two was in the vicinity of my upper calf in my right leg. In December, I began to experience sensations in my right ankle that were similar (albeit more intense) to what I later experienced after my vaccine; the post-vaccination symptom in my right calf was also similar (but milder) to what I had experienced from the DVT.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Glaucoma and Hyperlipidemia.    On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Mar-2021, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). On 15-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), ILEUS PARALYTIC (adynamic ileus) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking). The patient was hospitalized from 06-Mar-2021 to 31-Mar-2021 due to ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE, BULBAR PALSY, DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY, ILEUS PARALYTIC, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS, PNEUMONIA and RESPIRATORY FAILURE. At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia), DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy), BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking) outcome was unknown and ILEUS PARALYTIC (a dynamic ileus) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-Mar-2021, Electromyogram: abnormal (abnormal) consistent with demyelinating neuropathy.. On 30-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported by investigator.  Patient was presented to hospital on 3/6/21 with progressive extremity weakness, bulbar weakness, and respiratory failure attributed to AIDP s/p 5days IVIG. He had received his first Moderna COVID vaccination approximately two weeks prior to this and immediately following administration began experiencing weakness and trouble walking. EMG 3/15/21 consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. Hospitalization was  complicated by the development of adynamic ileus which is improving and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (previously requiring O2 support). Patient was also treated for pneumonia with a 5 day course of azithromycin. Once medically stable he was deemed appropriate for inpatient rehabilitation and was transferred from Hospital to rehab on 3/31/21 under care. The patient tested negative COVID-19 on 3/30, and repeat testing since also has been negative.

This spread to involve pain throughout the posterior upper arm for about 6 days before resolving. Did get moderate relief with use of ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q 8 hrs PRN. Received vaccine on 12/23/20 at 6pm.  Woke up at 5am to go to work on 12/24/20 and felt flu-like symptoms with subjective fever (did not measure), joint pain, and diffuse myalgias.  Symptoms progressed over the next three hours and culminated in about half an hour of significant rigors with uncontrolled shivering.  Ibuprofen dose of 600mg orally did help symptoms enough to allow me to finish my shift but I needed two more doses every 8 hours before symptoms resolved in 24 hrs.

On Jan 22 (the next day) the myalgias were almost debilitating. Ibuprofen and tylenol did help but I was rendered immobile for about 24 hours. Today I only have a sore arm and mild headache.

This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.   This appears to be immune mediated myocarditis from the Moderna vaccine

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

Move or swallow. It lasted for three weeks until two days after the second dose of the vaccine. I was prescribed two courses of antibiotics , Cephalexin and Doxycycline ,  which only helped a little.  I had gotten an insect bite the week before vaccination. I also had a CT scan after the second dose of vaccination but the pain had gone by then.

                                                This was my 1st shot of the Moderna Covid vaccine. I was fine after the shot was made but as the evening came towards the night, I started having the chills, lots of shivering and a slight fever (99 degrees). It felt as if I was having Covid again.  I took 2 - 500 mgs of Tylenol Extra Strength as a precaution in case it got worse.  The next day I felt very tired throughout the day and at night time I didn&#39;t feel as bad as the 1st night but I felt nauseous and muscle pains everywhere so I took another 2 Tylenols, it got better then went to sleep.

While having dinner on the second day, one alcoholic beverage was consumed with an immediate response of high fever ( 101.6) and body aches.  Maybe a warning not to consume alcohol would be appropriate for at least 2=3 day following Covid vaccination ?   Note ( Same reaction reported to me by co-worker after the event and after they had also consumed alcohol ).

Headache/BodyAches/On and off fevers/fatigue/right and left leg stiffness and major muscle/joint pain/on and off rapid heart rate Vaccine at 11:00am/Symptoms started around 7:00pm with tingling arm that received vaccine.  By bedtime I was suffering from chills and general body aches.  Woke up next morning with fever at 100.3, major pain/aching in both legs/general body aching and pain and headache.  The fever came and went for 24 hours.  On day two after the vaccine I woke up with no systems but was majorly fatigued.  I took 800mg of Advil every 6 hours of onset until end of symptoms.  I also had taken 2 Tylenol 2 hours before the initial vaccine.

Had to use my right hand to move my left hand. The experience was comparable to what is described as &#34;falling asleep&#34; , the exception is that there was no tingling sensation. This lasted for approximately 5 minutes. Upon getting out of bed this followed by approx. 2-3 minutes of light headedness. Joints in both elbows and wrists are sore, more so on the left side.

My muscle twitching has not stopped and has spread to my legs and left hand and arms.   2.  Day 2  felt  soreness at injection site and weakness to my legs and arms that remains as of 3.14.21.   3.  Day 14 developed bad right sciatical pain that lasted 1 day and resolved on its own. 4.  Day 21 developed restless leg syndrome x 1 day and resolved on its own 5.   Day 25  developed severe body trembling  arms andl egs and severe anxiety at night, I could not sleep x 2 nights. 6.   Day 32 developed  a very faint inner tremor that I feel when I get out of bed.  I also found out I have poor balance when standing on one leg or trying to wak a straight line.  Also, my twitching muscles are more often and a little bit stronger.  My anxiety has increased greatly because I dont know why this is happening after getting the Moderna injection

I felt weak kneed for about 2 hours afterwards, and was still wobbly knees the next day.   I also had muscle/joint aches the same day, which went away within 24 hours.  In the past 6 days, I have had reoccurring headaches, fatigue, and  this morning, had a severe enough headache to bring on nausea.   I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

Fatigue and muscle  ache for about 2 days post vaccination. Hot flashes since the vaccination and still happening. Had problem with them when I originally found out my thyroid was not properly regulated. Been on synthroid for over 3 years and only happened a few times a year since my thyroid levels have been regulated. Since vaccine they have been happening a few times a day and  also at night when sleeping. Checked my temp during episode and it is normal around 98.6 or below. Explanation of symptoms are  flushed, sweaty, HOT even when it is cold inside almost like there is an inner fire going on inside me

                                                After the vaccination  on 1/18/2021 , I had just pain at the site of injection in my left arm for the next 2   to 3 days  and headache.  Took Advil and it went away. After 3 or 4 days i started feeling very mild pain inside my arm muscles between  the injection site and my elbow  which continued till 1/25/2021.   Later this  very mild internal pain shifted  to my elbow  and   feel a mild numbing sensation in my pinky finger.  It also feels little heavy when I move my arm.  This  continues till  today as I am reporting on 1/30/2021 3:30pm.  Since it has not bothered much , I did not seek medical care, hoping this will  go away in few weeks.

                                                Patient had usual post vaccination myalgias and lethargy for a few days after injection.  These resolved spontaneously.  However, about a week after vaccination he developed recurrent fevers 102°F.  He also had complaints of body aches and bilateral jaw pain.  He had extensive evaluation including laboratory testing for infectious etiologies of his fever and none was identified.  He was noted to have very high sed rate and CRP.  When no specific etiology for his fevers could be identified we decided to proceed with a short course of prednisone which did seem to help his fever and jaw pain.  After prednisone was stopped he had recurrence of fever and developed worse jaw pain and pain at the base of his neck. I examined him in clinic and found that he had a tender swollen thyroid.  I directed him to the emergency department where CT scanning of his neck confirmed evidence of thyroiditis.  TSH was undetectable and free T4 was about 2 times higher than normal.  He was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis.  However, his symptomatology seemed quite dramatic for subacute thyroiditis, and the timing in relation to his vaccination is concerning for possible adverse vaccine reaction.

About eleven hours after shot I had headache, feeling of irregular body temperature, nausea, body aches..  I took Pepto-Bismol for the nausea which helped.    About 24 hours after the injection I experienced sore armpit/lymph nodes of shot arm.   All but the symptoms except the sore armpit/lymph nodes  were mostly gone within 30 hours of the shot.  The lymph nodes felt better a day or two later.

After about an hour, the pain in my arm started to feel as though it was spreading to my left chest cavity area.  I then started to get chest pains in the left breast area to the armpit area, but not severe, just concerning.  After probably 70-80 minutes, I started feeling drowsy.  I continued to feel drowsy all evening and did not sleep well.  I woke up and could not return to sleep at 4:45am.  My normal waking time is 6:00am.  I had/have quite a bit of soreness in my arm, but nothing unbearable.  No signs of rash or inflammation around injection sight.  I am taking a sick day from work to relax and recover from loss of sleep.  The metallic taste persist, but only an annoyance and taste seems to be normal when eating or drinking.  A slight achiness in joints, but a cold front was also moving in, which can cause me to have the same effect.

I had my girlfriend look at my back she stated i had some red large pimples on my back.  The next morning I had hives on my chest between my right and left breast,  hives on my left side lats and my back area.  The hives itched burned, and were a bit painful.  I used alovera and witch hazel wipes and hydrocortisone.  As of today 3/22/21  I&#39;m feeling a little better and i have an appointment with my primary care 3/23/21.

IT FELT AS IF I WAS BEING SQUEEZED.   I DID NOT HAVE A COUGH, FEVER, OR OTHER ASSOCIATED  S/SX.  IT JUST FEELS AS MY CHEST IS IN A VICE.  ON THE 3RD,,4TH AND 5TH DAY POST VACCINE ADMINSTRATION, THE SENSATION OF CHEST SQUEEZING HAS NOT RESOLVED COMPLETELY.  THE REASON I AM REPORTING THIS OCCURRENCE IS THAT SEVERAL CO-WORKERS THAT RECEIVED THE SAME MODERNA VACCINE HAVE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS.

On the morning of the 6th day, 1/21/21, I had very intense deep muscle pain in my lower back, left arm, hands and headache. About two hours after this started I started to have the very intense chills, my headache got worse and for the first time a low fever of 99 degrees. I felt like this for 2 days, couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days because of the pain. On the third day 1/24/21, it was much better and almost all gone by the fourth day, 1/25/21. Thank you

Body aches continued for next 3 days, with intermittent shivering/cold periods lasting several hours. Symptoms diminished slightly with ibuprofen. Feeling of being cold, off and on, lasted until day 3 after injection, and body aches diminished day 3 to a 2/10 pain/discomfort level.

                                                Local soreness in arm for 24 hrs post 1sr injection.  At 16 days post injections, frontal and temporal headache began, lasting approx 12 hrs and then waves of severe body aches began (random location - back, neck, right lateral midfoot, knees, right radiocarpal joint), along with mild chills and mild fever (never &gt;100.0).  These symptoms would recur approx every 8 hrs for the next 4 days.  Days 3-4 of the symptoms were debilitating and I primarily remained in bed.  Today is the first day or somewhat normal.  Still feel some ache and mild fatigue.  Never lost taste or smell and never had any respiratory issues or GI issues.

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.

COVID cough returned though not as bad as when I had the disease, as well as fealing weak and out of breath.  All of this lasted for about 36 hours.  Feeling a bit better now, but still winded and weak.   Still plan to get 2nd shot.

The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

                                                I woke up the morning of 3/23/2021 approximately 5am with a ringing in my left ear.  It has been constant since that time.  I should add to the other that my blood pressure has elevated since the vaccine.  As part of going on medication on 3/18, it was a concern the medications would elevate my blood pressure.  I bought a wrist BP check device and it was averaging 134/95 on 3/22/2021.  On 3/23/2021, I was prescribed Losartan.  I took one pill at 7:30PM.  Today when I woke up and for most of the day the BP has been 124/77-82.  The ringing remains persistent

                                                Approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine shot, I experienced sudden dizziness and nausea for approximately 1 minute. Also, my entire left arm looked a bit red, but no hives. It went away as quickly as it occurred. Approximately 30 minutes after that, I experienced nausea again( which was a bit more intense). It also lasted for approximately 1 minute then it quickly ceased. At 4pm (5 hours after the shot), I got a severe headache. I&#39;m not sure if that was related to the vaccine. I took acetaminophen and slept soundly through the night. The next day, I felt fine, and I have felt fine since.

On 28 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 19 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of the lymph nodes on the same side, and tender axilla. On 19 Jan 2021, the patient experienced very slight tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose of vaccine given 22 days after first dose. No treatment information was provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, and tender axilla was considered resolved on 30 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, slight tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose vaccine given 22 days apart, was considered resolved on 19 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of a 56-year-old male patient who experienced second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart (Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered) and non-serious events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area after the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot # 012L20A., expiration date-unknown).  The events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla occurred the same day after administration of the first dose of the vaccine and event of tender to touch in the pectoral area occurred on the same day after the last dose and 22 days after the first dose.  No treatment was reported, and outcome is resolved for the event of slight tender to touch in the pectoral area. The reported events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine. Hence, based on the information provided a causal association between the administration of mRNA-1273 and the reported events cannot be excluded The event of second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart is considered not applicable.

                                                22 hours later I got chills, goosebumps, I felt terrible. I felt fatigue, a headache and muscle aches and chest pain. I Went home and laid down. My temp read 102.9. Called a nurse and she was concerned because of my heart condition. come in to the hospital if the chest pain lasts longer than 5 minutes. I didn&#39;t go in because I figured I could use a nitroglycerin pill if it got too bad.  The following day I had chest pain every few hours or so. the waves of chest pain only lasted about 5 minutes a piece.

                                                Sore arm; the fatigue started 24 hours after the injection. The fatigue lasted for about five days. Abdominal pain came that seemed to be coming from the region of my liver and I had been having some problem with that previously (in a mild way) and the injection seemed to make this flare up more. About 4 days after injection, I went to ER and they did blood test and liver tests. And over time it seemed to resolved itself in a few days. The pain in my SI joint flared up about 24 hours after the injection - the extreme pain lasted for about 24 hours and then it slowly tapered off after a couple of days.

                                                A severe, dull ache resulted at the vaccination site yesterday several hours after vaccination and radiated down my are, up my neck, and down my back. 1000MG of Tylenal helped, but the ache remains. The arm is swollen, warm to the touch, and black and blue. Today I have a mild fever, some hot flashes, nausea without vomiting, body weakness, and overall muscle aching. This is the sickest I&#39;ve been in years.

                                                Looking back, I had a slow, intermittent pain in my right shoulder/arm region. It was nonspecific but mostly related when raising my arm while getting dressed/putting my shirt on. It became more frequent over the next month. This past week it seemed to be more classic like a &#34;tendonitis&#34; towards the mid-distal deltoid region.

In morning I was overcome with sweats, and was ?sick? with all these symptoms most the rest of the day ? despite taking it easy and taking Tylenol   After an early dinner Friday evening, I went to bed for the next 12 hours,  Though I woke up a few times all sweaty during that stretch, by morning I was feeling pretty normal.  So, I figure my body was under duress for  30-33 hours.  Although I didn?t feel real bad for some 12 hours after injection, I did encounter some indigestion starting a few hours after the shot.

Irregular Bowel movement, abdominal pain - come and goes, not fully recovered at time of writing. There was no constipation (in sense of difficulty to pass stool) but no bowel movement either, only pain.  Treatment: after 24 hours start taking pain killers (Tylenol night, Aleve). Hot bath helped with back pain and abdominal pain. Laxative (Bisacodyle)  helped with Bowel movement, and relieved pain - but took long time and unknown if back to normal. Now on liquid diet (water,clear  soup, tea with sugar)  to allow to rest a bit, seems more comfortable at the moment.

                                                This case was reported by a consumer via call center representative and described the occurrence of vaccination failure in a 58-year-old male patient who received Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis.   Co-suspect products included Herpes zoster (Shingrix) for prophylaxis, COVID-19 MRNA-1273 VACCINE (COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA) (batch number 040B21A, expiry date unknown) for prophylaxis and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA (batch number 002B21A, expiry date unknown) for prophylaxis.   Concurrent medical conditions included ulcerative colitis. Concomitant products included azathioprine.   On 11th June 2019, the patient received the 2nd dose of Shingrix. On 9th April 2019, the patient received the 1st dose of Shingrix. On 9th April 2021, the patient received the 2nd dose of COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. On 11th March 2021, the patient received the 1st dose of COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. In May 2021, between 1 and 2 years after receiving Shingrix and more than 2 years after receiving Shingrix, the patient experienced shingles, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. On an unknown date, the patient experienced vaccination failure (serious criteria GSK medically significant), feeling unwell and decreased immune responsiveness. The patient was treated with valaciclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex). On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg were unknown and the outcome of the shingles was not recovered/not resolved and the outcome of the generalized raised red spots limbs and red spotty rash were recovering/resolving.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to Shingrix and Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: The patient self reported the case. On an unknown date, less than 3 months after the 1st dose and less than 2 months after the 2nd dose the patient experienced shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg. The patient had not felt good for a few weeks and then in the last week before the reporting date he started to get symptoms.  The patient felt crappy and had shooting pain in his back on the left side and the pain shot down his leg and then he had a rash on his left leg later. His torso, back, butt, and upper thighs were stingy, burning, and he was sensitive to the touch on his skin before the rash appeared. He described it as aches and pains and a stingy, needle feeling.  The patient had a history of ulcerative colitis and he took Azathioprine during the past few years so he was unsure if his rash was related to his weak immune system or the COVID vaccine.  The patient had sent pictures of his left leg rash to his physician and they recommended him to see a dermatologist who diagnosed him with shingles after a biopsy and tests. They immediately put him on Valtrex and he claimed that things started to calm down and the rash was started to dry up.  The patient described the rash as starting off as red spots that were raised up that looked like a target with a red circle around it that would get bigger. The raised spot looked like there was fluid inside. The dot in the middle looked dark in color and the red part that had spread looked like a bruise that was resolving with the color of yellow and brown.  The patient had a few clusters of the rash on the inside and outside of his left leg and back on his calf.  It was unknown if the reporter considered the shingles, feeling unwell, feeling abnormal, back pain (with radiation), leg pain, generalized raised red spots limbs, red spotty rash, touch sensitivity increased, decreased immune responsiveness, stinging, pain in thigh, buttock pain, burning sensation and bruising of leg to be related to COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA and COVID-19 VACCINE MODERNA. The reporter consented to follow up.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA I have sciatic and have had a rhyzotomy on my right side. On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

                                                Patient came to the emergency department on 02/02/2020 at 2:30 pm to be evaluated for possible stroke due to sudden acute numbness, weakness in right wrist and arm, but no pain. Patient has no prior history of sudden acute numbness in arm and did not report any recent injury to his arm. Neurologist evaluated patient for possible stroke and patient was unable to lift right wrist and hand. Patient was able to lift both arms overhead, lift both legs, smile normal, open and close mouth and move tongue.  Both CT Scan and MRI were normal. Neurologist and emergency medical specialist determined that patient did not have a stroke and diagnosed acute brachial plexus palsy possibly due to patient sleeping in an awkward position. Emergency specialist said it was unlikely but could not rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine, which patient had received 10 days earlier (second dose, see details above.)

                                                I had extremely burning pain on my left hip and quadricep/thigh area that started without warning. Feeling like extreme leg cramps when standing or walking. I did seek medical attention with my orthopedic doctor and had hip xrays on my left hip. She saw mild to moderate arthritis in my hip joint. I was prescribed an anti inflammatory as well as taking tylenol to supplement.  The symptoms have not subsided and I plan on following up with my medical doctor. I have had bad spasms in my hip and thigh area and swelling from the top of my thigh to my knee.

                                                I am not sure if it the night after the vaccine or the morning after but I think I have a Shingles.  It looks like bee stings bigger then a quarter 3 on my stomach and 3 on back. Lots of little bumps. It hurts very sensitive. I felt like my ribs and kidney were hurting but it is because of the nerves when I touch them.  This is been about a week. I am going to call my doctor. The pain is not just one spot but the whole area around them.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

                                                At 12:15 a.m. on March 09 chills and fever suddenly started. I was shivering so bad that I was having muscle spasms so bad that I had difficulty walking on my right leg (hip replacement January 2020). After taking tylenol for fever my temp had gone down to 100. Headaches started soon after the fever and muscle spasms and it lasted well into the afternoon on the 9th along with feeling cold and clammy. At about 7:00 p.m. on the 9th, the fever started going back up so I took another dose of tylenol. The fever lasted until about 4:00 a.m. on the tenth. Currently, 10:00 a.m. on the tenth I feel somewhat normal, just really tired and having muscle pain in my upper back. All things considered, the whole ordeal felt like my time when I was getting better after going through covid in December.

Woke up at 11:15 pm with severe shivering, and was extremely cold. My temperature was 98.6. Turned my heat up to 74, added blankets to my bed, could not get warm. Finally had to add a large heat pack to my bed to alleviate shivering. My left shoulder and arm hurt. Abnormally bad sleep. Woke up this morning at 9:30am and am lethargic and very tired. I feel like I was hit by a truck.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA March 19: Received vaccine. Experienced only very minor muscle soreness in left arm.  March 20: In the evening, began to feel low level general muscle aches throughout body. March 23: Woke up with lower back muscles contracted. Very painful to move and stand up. Very difficult to walk. Could only walk very slowly and in a hunched over position. Changing positions from sitting to standing and vice versa was very painful and would take at least 7 or 8 minutes. Because of the extreme difficulty in movement and pain, went home to rest. Applied hot water bottle to lower back while lying down.  March 24: In the morning symptoms were better. Called the hospital but was told my symptoms were not a reaction to the Moderna vaccine.  March 25: Symptoms were greatly reduced. Able to walk nearly normal.

                                                Severe headache - migraine-like.   Fever of approx 101 to 102 (we don&#39;t own a thermometer because we are never sick.) Painful joints and tendons. Exhaustion (way beyond &#34;fatigue&#34;)  Symptoms began as upper arm aching at approximately 8:00.  By 11:00 a.m. feeling tired and achy with light headache and painful tendons.  Took 2 Bayer with no improvement. By 2:30,  pounding headache.  Soaked in epsom salts bath; could barely stand straight after sitting  in tub.  Went to bed with severe headache.  I walked to the store to get Advil (we don&#39;t keep that around either since we neither one are ever sick with headaches!)  By 4:00 took 2 Advil for migraine-like symptoms and light fever.  By 4:30 back in bed with &#34;burning&#34; fever (no thermometer owned for several years) to the touch.  He NEVER has a fever - maybe twice in the 38 years we&#39;ve been married.    This is completely and utterly out of character for him.  He does not have allergies, reactions to medications, flu or any such thing.  He has missed perhaps 3-4 days of work for illness in the 38 years we&#39;ve been married.  These symptoms, for him, are  severe and are clearly and detrimentally connected to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine second shot.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the first night after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna.  I had a fever, chills and muscle aches, and extreme fatigue.  Those symptoms lasted approx 3 days.  Two days after the vaccination I also became extremely nauseous.  I was anticipating all of these symptoms.  On the 3rd and 4th days after the vaccine most of the symptoms disappeared but I received some new ones that I was not expecting.  I suddenly felt a large amount of despair and hopelessness.  I had suicidal thoughts.  I had panic attacks and anxiety.  I had paranoia.  I did not feel like I had long to live, or anything to live for.  By 20 Apr all of these emotional and mental side effects were completely gone.

I have experienced all these side effects every day for the last 10 days. Additional side effects are: Sweating profusely every night. Not being able to sleep very well nearly every night. Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

As of today pain is still there it is not as bad but still there 27 days later.  Also my left thumb is numb and sometimes radiates to the forearm area.  I have just started taking 200 mg ibuprofen as needed.  Helps with the right elbow but no relief to the left thumb.  I am due for 2nd vaccine tomorrow!

                                                I had a significant exacerbation of my neuromuscular MS symptoms despite no subjective symptoms of fever. I did not take my temperature but did not feel feverish. I also had significant exacerbations of routine aches and pains such as chronic orthopedic aches. The pain symptoms began approximately 5 hours after the injection. The neuromuscular symptoms began approximately 14-16 hours after the injection. I took acetaminophen 1000 mg orally in the morning 24 hours after my injection and had improvement in both the pain and neuromuscular symptoms. I continued to take Acetominphen 1000mg q 8h during the day and had complete resolution of both the pain and neuromuscular symptoms with return to baseline health by 48 hours after the injection.

                                                On Monday, March 9th, I tested positive for the COVID antibodies and believe it was linked to an illness that I experienced last fall (COVID test was not administered at that time).  Approximately 16 hours after receiving the first injection of COVID-19 MODERNA I began to experience joint pain/stiffness, muscle soreness,  headaches, nausea, chills, sweats, malaise, heart racing, numbness to the fingers on my left hand, etc.  I became progressively worse until become bed ridden at 5:15 pm on Thursday, March 11th.  I remained bed ridden with symptoms becoming progressively worse until Friday evening, March 12th.  At that point, my condition began to improve.  I began to feel somewhat better by mid-morning on Saturday, March 13th.  My condition finally improved to ~90% by Monday, March 15th, with lingering muscle soreness and loss of feeling to the fingers on my left hand remaining.

                                                I have been diagnosed with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease and started experiencing lower back pain within 30 minutes of receiving 1st dose of Moderna vaccine. Identified reaction to healthcare provider and was instructed to notify CDC. On March 30, CDC shared with me a list of adverse reactions that would preclude an individual from receiving the 2nd dose.  The lower back pain I am experiencing was not listed.  After speaking to CDC rep it is my understanding  that I&#39;m cleared to receive the 2nd dose.

I had a fever that ranged from 101F to 103F that has lasted for more than 30 hours, I also developed severe muscle and joint pain so much so that I could only get out of bed to go to the bathroom and that was with great pain. I also have had nausea that has lasted over 36 hours. I took Tylenol (1000mg) every few hours, 4 times with out relief. I also took a Tramadol which helped a little with the pain but then my fever spiked for a few hours. I&#39;m now on day 2 of bed rest and waiting for the symptoms to subside so I can get back to my regular life.
