Patient reports prior anaphylaxis with shortness of breath and tight airways, difficulty speaking and swallowing, and relationship to coconut ingestion few years prior.  No other known food/nut reactions.   Patient is a CNA for care at home.  Last Covid test was 2 weeks ago which was negative.  She reports she has been tested every 2 weeks routinely.    Review of Systems   Cardiovascular: Negative for chest pain and palpitations.  Gastrointestinal: Positive for abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea. Negative for vomiting.  Musculoskeletal: Positive for myalgias. Negative for arthralgias, back pain and neck pain.  Neurological: Positive for headaches. Negative for dizziness, weakness and numbness.

Abdominal cramping resolved.  No further diarrhea or vomiting.  Still complains of headache and muscle cramping through her upper shoulders and arm.  Will remedicate with steroid and acetaminophen  2258 Reevaluation: Patient improved.  Pain/myalgias improved.  Headache now mild and dull.  Continues with no further.nausea vomiting or diarrhea.  She would like to try fluids at this time.  Assuming toleration we will plan on discharge home.  2326 Reevaluation: Patient feels improved.  Headache essentially gone.  Taking p.o. fluids well.  Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                After about 15 minutes, I began to feel lightheaded and experience a tingling in my arms/hands. I&#39;d guess it was related to the nerves in the arms, because it specifically affected my pinky and ring fingers on both hands. I was also unsteady on my feet, but did not lose consciousness. The lightheadedness and tingling continued off and on for most of the day. The tingling appeared to go away the next day, but I still experienced periodic (though rare) feelings of lightheadedness. Perhaps 2-3 time the next day (Saturday) and experienced maybe 1-2 times the following day (Sunday). I did not take Adderall on the weekend. On Monday, I did take Adderall and returned to work, where I experience some tingling again and longer bouts of lightheadedness. Again, I have not lost consciousness.

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

The symptoms got progressively worse over the next few days and on Sunday 2/28/2021 the right side of my face was completely paralyzed. I sought emergency care at Hospital Emergency Room where I was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. The doctor who treated me strongly believes that the Bells Palsy was due to the Moderna vaccine. Today (9 days post vaccine) the entire right side of my face continues to be completely paralyzed with no signs of improvement.

                                                I work at a Hospital sterilizing surgical equipment.  After I received the vaccine, the hospital staff observed me for 15 minutes to see if a reaction occurred.  I felt fine, and they told me I could go.  I was working that day (2-10:30pm) and had gotten vaccinated at the beginning of my shift.  The rest of my shift went fine.  Near the end, though, my arm began to feel sore.  Driving home, I began to feel tired.  By the time I got home, it felt like a cold was setting in.  I ate a large bowl of chicken soup to try to feel better.  I stayed up a little bit, but was feeling woozy by this point and went to bed.  Bad chills set in and I began to shake I felt so cold.  I used a heating pad to help with this.  I tried to sleep, but my head was throbbing.  The next morning, I tried to sit up in bed but my first attempt proved too difficult.  I took it slower.  I was able to sit up eventually.  Standing was also difficult.  I spent the day mostly lounging on the couch.  I slept a little better that night, but my head was still throbbing somewhat.  No chills this time.  Getting up the next morning went a little better.  I was able to sit up in bed without issue and walking around did not prove as much of a chore.

There is a little pain at the injection site but no swelling no redness.

Then that night, I woke up at 3:30 am 1/16 with severe chills, full-body aches, and high fever (although I was unable to walk to get the thermometer). During the day 1/16, as I write this, I continue to feel similar symptoms to when I was Covid positive in March 2020. Tylenol and Motrin help the symptoms to subside.

Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

No treatment was needed.    On January 1st I noticed tingling  in both of my legs.   Since then it has gotten worse.  I have tingling in both legs, muscle twitching throughout both legs intermittently, muscle weakness specifically after muscle use, an abnormal skin sensitivity when wearing pants, and a consistent ache throughout my legs.  The symptoms affect me 24 hours a day and create an anxiety that I have not felt before.  It has also adversely affected my sleep.

I woke up the morning after the vaccine with a fever, chills, muscle aches and my injection site in pain.  After one day I felt better, but my arm still hurt.  I hurt for 4 days and spread down my arm and into my ribs.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

On 1/12/2021, upon removing shirt at approximately 4:00 PM, silver dollar sized area of induration , hotness, pain and erythema noted at injection site.  No fever was observed. Contacted ID MD at employer and informed him of the findings.  He advised it could be an immune mediated response vs. cellulitis. Went to Urgent Care site on 1/13/2021 and was dx with cellulitis and was prescribed cephalexin 500 mg PO TID x 10 days.  By 1/16/2021, induration, pain, and erythema has resolved.  Interestingly, injection site is still a bit warmer than the surrounding tissue.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

My wife said it was kind of like bells palsy. Face kind of twitched a bit. Hip was numb walking was slow and I was careful as I went to the grocery store . It kind of leveled out but stayed numb all of work. I was still swollen after work.   Woke up on Sunday and my arm was hurting bad. numbness had dissipated.   ate then suddenly felt flush and hot. fetal position on the bed for a half hour then I had to drag myself to work. felt bad the first few hours but as the night went on I felt better.   I could always feel it behind my eyes. early on it felt like I was discharging a bunch of stuff from them. My body was literally numb on the left half. I could feel the middle of myself from my scalp to my toes.

Sore arm was mitigated with movement and stretching (as compared to the first dose). Other symptoms have lessened since 7am (19 hours after shot), but linger.  Ibuprofen seems to lessen, but not end eymptoms.

                                                On Wednesday 1/27 the day after my second dose I felt a minor pinch/discomfort  on my lower leg.  I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.  On 2/5 I was able to physically see my doctor who told me that this was caused by the second dose of the moderne vaccine that I took on 1/26.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

He reported he went to his primary care provider later that afternoon.  He was examined clinically and was told that the shot was administered too high up in his arm in the Gleno Humeral Joint.  He was advised to take over the counter pain medication and to call if he needs something stronger.  He was given a follow up appointment on 2/5/2021 with the provider. He was told to monitor for infection in the next 48 hours and they are hoping it did not go into the joint capsule.  Continued to have severe pain.  Went to orthopedic specialist the next day.  Admitted to hospital for pain control and steroids.  MRI of shoulder inconclusive, but think severe bursitis and being treated as such.  Discharged from hospital and resting at home.  Arm range of motion at 80%-hoping to return to work in 2 weeks (firefighter/EMT).

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medication included escitalopram.  On 04 Feb 2021, on the same day as the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 030L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 04 Feb 2021, a couple of hours after the vaccination, the patient couldn&#39;t feel his arm and he had no range in motion.  He also had pain in his upper shoulder area by his neck.  The reporter thought the administration was done incorrectly but she &#34;wasn&#39;t there to conform 100%.&#34;  At night on 04 Feb 2021 and 05 Feb 2021, the patient had aching in his legs &#34;as if he was getting sick.&#34;  Treatment for the events included ibuprofen which helped, and the patient was feeling better at the time of this report.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, couldn&#39;t feel arm and had no range in motion, pain in upper shoulder area by the neck, and aching in legs as if was getting sick, were considered recovering/resolving at the time of this report.  The event, thinks administration was done incorrectly, was considered recovered/resolved on 04 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44-year-old male who experienced NS unexpected events of hypoaesthesia, joint range of motion decreased, arthralgia, neck pain, product administration error, malaise, and NS expected arthralgia.  The events occurred 1 day after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-012275: US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-012263:

On Monday 2/15/21 was feeling very well and had nice workout in the morning , feeling energetic .  However, in the morning on Tuesday 2/16/21, I started having very strong abdominal cramps, feeling bloated, nausea, that was lasting for several hours and increasing in pain . After 5 hours of pain, I asked my wife to take me to Hospital. There I was diagnosed with Appendicitis after a Cat Scan. My appendix was inflamed and I had to go thru surgery that same day .

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

                                                AE - severe vertigo.  The effect came on suddenly (7pm) and the room started spinning.  I closed my eyes and lied back on the couch.  I could not open my eye (room stopped spinning) until 3am the next morning.  I could not stand without losing my balance until 12 noon.  Treatment - I took meclizine 25mg at 12 midnight, 2am and 7am. Outcome - vertigo stopped around 3am, equilibrium returned at 12 noon and i was able to stand and walk slowly at that time.

I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence.

                                                Started with tiredness, then arm got sore and was painful to lift. Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

The morning of January 12, 2021 I woke with severe muscle and joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue.  As the day progressed I developed chills to the point I could not get warm.  I also developed a low grade fever.  After taking two ibuprofen around 3p the pain subsided to an ache about my entire body by 9p, headache had subsided and I had no more chills or fever.  On the morning of January 13, 2021 I woke with a red rash going up the inside of both arms and around the outside of my upper arms and down my entire back.  As the day has progressed that rash has spread down the back of legs as well.  I did take one Benadryl with minimal effect.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

Did not think too much of it at first, however the area grew a little and swelled up.  Consulted with my doctor and they diagnosed Shingles.  Am currently prescribed Valtrex for shingles.

                                                Immediate mild shoulder pain that began to significantly worsen 3 hours post vaccination.  The pain/inflammation is continuing to worsen and have lost most function of my shoulder now overnight.  The injection was placed too high and anterior likely into the shoulder joint.

                                                Injection administered on 1/4/21 and was given in upper left shoulder joint opposed to the deltoid muscle. I completely removed my shirt to assure proper placement.  Common soreness to shot experienced next two days after administration, however soreness felt in shoulder joint rather than muscle. Pain re-occurred on 1/12/21 and has not been totally relieved despite the usage of anti-inflammatory medication eg. Ibuprofen 400mg,  Tylenol 500mg along with Ibuprofen for soreness. The worst pain I experience is when I go to sleep being prematurely awaken by aching and throbbing to my affected area. Again, not being any discomfort to muscle but rather left shoulder joint pain where sometimes I am discouraged from raising my left arm to my side. It does not bother me so much to raise my left arm towards my front. I have been working through my discomfort while being very careful not to aggravating it further. My concern comes from the fact that it has not completely gone away after the extended time frame and becomes more intense in the evening.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

                                                On Wednesday, February 24th I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. On Friday evening I developed joint pain and swelling in my left should blade, my right wrist and my left large toe. The pain in my shoulder and my wrist is excruciating and I have not been able to sleep properly.  I have very limited mobility and cannot grip with or use my right hand.  I started taking 200 mg of ibuprofen on Friday night with food but it did not seem to reduce the pain. Through the night that night I increased my dose to 400 mg and felt some relief in my shoulder but my hand is still very painful. My toe is uncomfortable but tolerable. I used tiger balm several times on my wrist but that did not help. I also put it on my back and it seemed to help as long as I did not move. If I moved a felt a very sharp pain under my shoulder blade.  I used ice on my hand and it only benefited briefly. I couldn&#39;t apply it at night and therefore couldn&#39;t sleep.  I am unable to move or function as I normally would due to the sharp pains in my back/shoulders and right hand. Unable to function without assistance and cannot go to work.

                                                Moderate pain at injection site immediately after injection.  This spread to involve pain throughout the posterior upper arm for about 6 days before resolving. Did get moderate relief with use of ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q 8 hrs PRN. Received vaccine on 12/23/20 at 6pm.  Woke up at 5am to go to work on 12/24/20 and felt flu-like symptoms with subjective fever (did not measure), joint pain, and diffuse myalgias.  Symptoms progressed over the next three hours and culminated in about half an hour of significant rigors with uncontrolled shivering.  Ibuprofen dose of 600mg orally did help symptoms enough to allow me to finish my shift but I needed two more doses every 8 hours before symptoms resolved in 24 hrs.

                                                The patient had a very severe side effect profile from the second dose of vaccine:  &#34;worst I&#39;ve ever felt&#34; with myalgia, headache, fever and fatigue.  This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.   This appears to be immune mediated myocarditis from the Moderna vaccine

Jan 1, 2021:  Intense head ache, muscle aches and red and swelling welt at immunization site.  Recurrent fever, excessive sweating, soaked through tshirt, polo shirt twice, extreme fatigue. Same symptoms continue until Jan 5, 2021.  Symptoms were definitely more intense than just a casual body ache or fever. It felt like my body had covid again even though i know it is not possible to catch covid again from vaccine.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

I felt weak kneed for about 2 hours afterwards, and was still wobbly knees the next day.   I also had muscle/joint aches the same day, which went away within 24 hours.  In the past 6 days, I have had reoccurring headaches, fatigue, and  this morning, had a severe enough headache to bring on nausea.   I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

                                                Patient received 2nd dose of Moderna Covid Vaccine at 1pm.  At 2:30pm he started to develop chest pain  and left side neck and arm pain.  He was admitted to the hospital for further work-up.  While in the hospital the patient had relief only from sitting up and forward.  The doctor decided to transfer the patient to another facility that had specialist.  At the next hospital it was determined that the patient had Viral Pericarditis, associated with the Covid Vaccine.

                                                At 5 days post vaccination, patient developed severe left shoulder pain, originally thought to be secondary to chronic shoulder pain and a recent fall, over the next three days it progressed to swelling, severe pain, and limited ROM. He ended up being admitted to the hospital and CT scan showed development of significant soft tissue infiltration around sternum and sternoclavicular joints. This was originally thought to be infectious, but he never developed a fever or leukocytosis and we feel this was most likely an inflammatory process. I have no idea if this was actually a vaccine side effect, but given the proximity in both time a location and the known complication of shoulder pain with the vaccine, it seems reasonable to give you the information to monitor for other similar cases.

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

On the morning of the 6th day, 1/21/21, I had very intense deep muscle pain in my lower back, left arm, hands and headache. About two hours after this started I started to have the very intense chills, my headache got worse and for the first time a low fever of 99 degrees. I felt like this for 2 days, couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days because of the pain. On the third day 1/24/21, it was much better and almost all gone by the fourth day, 1/25/21. Thank you

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included metoprolol, fish oil, vitamin B, vitamin D3, zinc, vitamin C, turmeric, sertraline, and encapsulated dried fruits and vegetables.   On 28 Dec 2020 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 19 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of the lymph nodes on the same side, and tender axilla. On 19 Jan 2021, the patient experienced very slight tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose of vaccine given 22 days after first dose. No treatment information was provided.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.   The outcome of the events, experienced sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, and tender axilla was considered resolved on 30 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, slight tender to touch in the pectoral area and second dose vaccine given 22 days apart, was considered resolved on 19 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of a 56-year-old male patient who experienced second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart (Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered) and non-serious events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area after the administration of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot # 012L20A., expiration date-unknown).  The events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla occurred the same day after administration of the first dose of the vaccine and event of tender to touch in the pectoral area occurred on the same day after the last dose and 22 days after the first dose.  No treatment was reported, and outcome is resolved for the event of slight tender to touch in the pectoral area. The reported events of sore left deltoid, swelling of lymph nodes on the same side, tender axilla, tender to touch in the pectoral area are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine. Hence, based on the information provided a causal association between the administration of mRNA-1273 and the reported events cannot be excluded The event of second dose vaccine administered 22 days apart is considered not applicable.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA I have sciatic and have had a rhyzotomy on my right side. On 15 Jan, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I began to get back and leg aches from my sciatica, but on my left side.  I immediately began my routine (exercise) and back brace which usually stop the pain. Over the next two day, the symptoms got worse to the point of extreme pain in my back and all down my left leg.  This resulted in a trip to the emergency room on 17 January.  I have since had an appointment with my pain specialist, and an MRI.  We are awaiting results from the MRI.  The pain has not lessened, and pain medication are only mildly effective. The pain being in my left side make since as the Rhyzotomy had been done on my right side.  I am concerned the vaccine may have cause tissue or nerve swelling. Pain is still intense to the point of immobility and difficulty sleeping.

                                                Patient came to the emergency department on 02/02/2020 at 2:30 pm to be evaluated for possible stroke due to sudden acute numbness, weakness in right wrist and arm, but no pain. Patient has no prior history of sudden acute numbness in arm and did not report any recent injury to his arm. Neurologist evaluated patient for possible stroke and patient was unable to lift right wrist and hand. Patient was able to lift both arms overhead, lift both legs, smile normal, open and close mouth and move tongue.  Both CT Scan and MRI were normal. Neurologist and emergency medical specialist determined that patient did not have a stroke and diagnosed acute brachial plexus palsy possibly due to patient sleeping in an awkward position. Emergency specialist said it was unlikely but could not rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction to the Moderna vaccine, which patient had received 10 days earlier (second dose, see details above.)

Son took me to ER - Medical Center - and they put me on an IV and gave me Meclizine. Kept me for obsevation for 36 hours as it was not subsiding (the vertigo). Ruled out stroke with CT scan. They sent me home with Meclizine and I&#39;m still taking it. I get Vertigo every day still.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

Is on Precedex currently to allow him to further recover.  He was using accessory muscles and poor inspiratory effort today but maintaining his oxygenation.  BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.  Nicoderm avoid tobacco.  NPO unless ammonia level is elevated.  Continue empiric antibiotics.  Last evening required to units packed RBC.  If hypotensive and or increase in anemia will rescanned.  Monitor for DTs and withdraws.  Was advised by the nursing staff patient is following orders.     Functional quadriplegic rotation every 2 hours had bed at 20-30 degrees to avoid aspiration.  Patient and his family confirm DNR status.  Long-term placement required as his stepfather is unable to care for him without assistance.  Anticipate restarting diet in a.m..  One fully alert will ascertain if this was delivered or accidental.  Drug screen was positive for both benzos and morphine.  He has been and prescribed the morphine.  The dual combination liver failure patient with depression likely ill-advised     &#34;

                                                I experienced a fever of 100.4, 24 hours after the injection, accompanied by overall muscle aches, headaches, and difficulty sleeping. The fever was gone within 36 hours, but the other symptoms persisted.  My spouse, who also had Covid-19 at the same time that I did experienced the same symptoms.

I have experienced all these side effects every day for the last 10 days. Additional side effects are: Sweating profusely every night. Not being able to sleep very well nearly every night. Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was a 59-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed Bell&#39;s palsy (facial paralysis).   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 12 Jan 2021, approximately seven days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 19 Jan 2021, the patient developed Bell&#39;s palsy. As per patient, there was loss of taste, his eyeball was not moving, he had facial pain and he could not raise right side of his lips. The patient stated that his symptoms were still on going at the time of report. Both his PCP and neurologist can not confirm this is not related to vaccine.  Treatment for the event included a seven-day course of Valtrex and Prednisone.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.  The event, Bell&#39;s palsy, was considered not recovered/not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.
