                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

                                                Approximately, 25 minutes after vaccine administration the patient verbalized feeling dizzy. He was transferred from a chair to a nearby cot with feet elevated. The ER was notified and an EpiPen was on standby. Vital signs were: BP 155/69, O2 saturation 100%, and HR 125. Vitals were rechecked 5 min later and HR came down to 76. Dizziness still persisted and he complained of his hands feeling weak but grip strength was noted to be equal bilaterally. There was no indication for EpiPen so it was not used. Patient preference was to be transported to the ER for additional follow-up. In the ER vital signs continued to be monitored and patient was given 1 liter sodium chloride 0.9% fluid bolus after which the patient reported feeling much better. Patient was discharged from the ER.

The patient&#39;s medical history included aphasia. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included diazepam, duwalpro and another, unspecified over-the-counter product.  On 15-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   That same day, according to report, the patient seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down were not working.  On 16-FEB-2021, the patient was unable to walk and could only crawl; he was just dragging his feet. He was also getting tired very quickly.     Treatment for the event included paracetamol and ibuprofen.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.    The outcome of the events, seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down, he could no longer walk and could only crawl,  just drags his feet and was also getting tired very quickly, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association, a causal association between the reported events and the administration of the mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

A couple hours after that I had lunch for about half and hour and as I got to getting up I started to feel a little dizziness and had general weakness in the knees and in joints of my thumb. Lower back pain and sweats as of me typing this in now.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

I started Experiencing the listed side effects from the morning of January 8th, 2021 to the morning of January 9th, 2021. It started with light muscle and joint pain at 8am and progressed to sever muscle and joint pain, chills, nausea, fatigue, headaches and eventually a fever averaging at 100 degrees Fahrenheit by 1-2PM the same day. These side effects were enough to leave me bedridden for most of the 8th. most side effects were gone by the morning of the 9th, the fever eventually broke by 930Am on the 9th.

                                                Moderna vaccine dose #1 received in right shoulder on 12/31/20 at 2:15PM. Injection was uneventful other than sensation of pressure. I did notice at the time, but could not fully see, that the injection appeared to be much higher on the shoulder than normal. I immediately came  home afterwards and relaxed. Approximately 2hrs later, I began experiencing extreme pain in my right shoulder. As the night progressed, the pain worsened to 10/10 with inability to move my arm. Later that night after requiring assistance to take off my shirt, I noticed that the bandaid overlying the injection site was very high, immediately below and bordering the acromion process. This was concerning but I was hopeful the pain would go away over the next few days. I took tylenol that night. I woke up multiple times during the night because the pain was so severe. When I woke up, the pain and inability to move my arm were still present. I began taking 800mg ibuprofen and 1000mg tylenol alternating Q4 throughout the next few days. The pain and disability remained so severe that I required assistance performing ADLs for  the next 4 days. On day four, with the pain not resolved and still severe despite consistent advil and tylenol use, I began having concern for shoulder injury related to vaccine administration. The next day I decided to seek an evaluation by an orthopedist. I am a physician and was unable to perform basic tasks and ADLs. I happened to have a few days off after the injection but would not have been able to work had I not. After an evaluation by the an orthopedic PA, I obtained an MRI of my right shoulder with results shown below - as I expected evidence of rotator cuff tendinopathy and subdeltoid bursitis consistent with SIRVA. As of now, I still have limited range of motion and shoulder pain on the right which has improved slightly but is far from resolved. I still have difficulty with certain ADLs including putting clothes on and off, lifting items, and tasks that require raising my right arm above my head. I am concerned with the possibility of long term and/or permanent damage after reviewing the literature. I am also concerned about how many other healthcare workers the person who gave me my vaccine may be injuring and/or causing permanent harm to.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

                                                On 12/24 I began to notice intermittent tingling along the medial edge of my left hand (in ulnar distribution). Over the next day or two I began to notice persistent weakness of the 4th and 5th digits on my left hand to abduction, adduction, flexion, and extension.  Over the weekend the weakness improved slightly, but has not improved much in the past few days.  I am also still occasionally experiencing the tingling sensation in the same distribution.

He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                About 11 days post vaccination I had noticed swelling of a left supraclavicular lymph node. The node was about the size of grape, tender to touch and caused some aching on left side of neck. Within 3 days the lymph node swelling started to subside however 11 days later, the lymph node is still swollen.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

                                                I got a muscle ache on the injection site 4-5 hours after the jabbing, and a febrile (97.4), tiredness and headache the next day of it. I took a NSAIDS tablet 3-4 hours after showing up febrile. I almost recovered with a little bit of a headache 2 days later of the injection.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna on January 19, 2021. 48 hours later upon waking from sleep patient had myalgias, arthralgia in all distributions, and  a frontal headache. Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

                                                After the standard soreness after injection lasting approx 3 days, symptoms dissipated. At around 7 days post injection, acute onset of profound redness, swelling and pain was noted to the injection site.   Now at 10 days, redness and swelling still present, however symptoms have decreased in severity. Now I have muscle twitching at the injection site as well.

It was more tender and there was moderate to sever pain in the armpit. I took some advil with minimal relief. On the 3rd day (today) the swelling seemed a littlw worse and the pain increased slightly. I contacted my plastic surgeon (since back in October 2019) because i had a procedure called miradry, which elemintes the sweat glands in my bilateral armpits. The doctor advised me to come in immeidately to the office. Upon arrival the doctor examined the area and was able to se immiedalty that is was swollen. I consented to pictures being taken. He is making an entry as well as I am and I was advised to ice the area and to take advil and to remain in contact.

I only historically had gotten a total of 4 flu vaccines. 24 hours after Moderna I had b/l dorsal foot tingling that I didn?t really pay any mind to, then by the next day it spread to L hand (4th-5th digit) overt weakness and paresthesias and a cool/numb feeling to my R thumb. Similar symptoms to L 5th toe and R great toe. As days progressed it got more diffuse and extended up to mid-calf that was very mild... eventually by day 10 it dissipated, thank god.  To add I also experienced L facial dull pain and the distal portion of my tounge felt like I burnt it (lasted 5 -7 days)

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

Symptoms started to get worse the next day of vaccination as I was hardly moving my left arm and i had to get off work early because i couldn&#39;t stand on my feet for a long time. finally on the third day symptoms started to improve.

                                                I am a board certified infectious diseases pharmacist and I have given lectures over hypersenstivites reactions. I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

Neither were effective in treating swollen lymph nodes. Tylenol was effective in testing fever and muscle soreness. Will see physician later today.

At 36 hours, pain when laying on that side or putting pressure on it. Cold chills and elevated temperature throughout second day, culminating in low grade fever that lasted one hour.  General fatigue and dehydration throughout this period as well with periodic headaches. Symptoms mostly vanished by 48hr mark.

The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

                                                Woke up on Friday morning (3/5) with severe neck pain and vertigo. Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

It seems that this pain is traveling. I&#39;ve also had several headaches. I do not get headaches. I have not been treated for these events. Still having soreness/pain in left side of neck and eye to this date. 01/12/2021.

At this time, I also had profuse cold sweats, my limbs started getting cold, I could not see or hear and had ?stars? like I was about to pass out.  My wife helped me downstairs and after some water and Tylenol, symptoms reversed themselves in about 15 minutes.  My body temperature was not recognized by the thermometer and then registered 93.4

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA Approximately 3 hours after vaccine, shoulder pain began to develop. Pain became significant, waking me in the middle of the night. The following day, I was unable to lift the arm I received the injection in no higher than about 80 degrees from my side. Pain increased despite taking OTC NSAIDS. By the second morning after vaccine administration, pain had worsened and right arm cannot be raised more than about 60 degrees without significant pain. Contacted PCP office about 12 hours after injection, they recommended NSAID dosages alternating ibuprofen and tylenol, and icing the shoulder. Pain impacts daily life activities, including caring for small children , lifting items that weigh more than a few pounds by the impacted arm, and significant difficulty reaching any object above the level of the shoulder. I have never previously experienced this kind of reaction to any other upper arm injection or vaccination.

Neck stiffness and soreness began Thursday evening.  Severe chest pains early Saturday morning (3am).  Taken to urgent care - EKG showed irregularity and high level of troponin. Transported from there to the hospital.  They did angiogram, and diagnosed me with pericarditis. The on call physician believes this was most likely caused by the second dose of the vaccine.

The following day about 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I got a pain in my lower back. I have been doing stretching,  heat, massage and OTC pain relievers. The pain in my lower back is serve, I couldn&#39;t really stand up straight. I have had to miss a few days of work. I have talked to a family friend who is a Doctor and he said it should only last for a 1-2.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

Per patient the ER doctor stated that at the covidvax clinic the medical personelle administering the vaccine may have hit a blood vessel in his shoulder where the injection was. Patient explains the bruising is still there but the pain is radiating through the armpit and into his bicep through his elbow. Patient reports that his arm is not swollen and the yellow bruise had faded.  Reports 1/8 that using hot packs and ibuprofen make the pain subside.   1/11 reports arm pain is not getting worse but the pain and discomfort are staying about the same.

EARLY Friday morning around 30 minutes after midnight - I noticed pain on my left shoulder / neck area (tenderness). I began to feel around and found a swollen lymph node at the base of my neck just inside my left collar bone. Seems to be the supraclavical lymphnodes. I also noticed tenderness under my left arm in the arm pit region. I received the injection on the left side.

                                                I was contacted by my son requesting help obtaining medical treatment following his COVID vaccination.  Per patient, immediately after being injected he had severe shoulder pain and since receiving the vaccine he has been unable to use his arm. His arm has been in a sling and he is being denied further medical evaluation. The Nurse who was present suggested he contact his family adding that the doctor injected too high.  He had the second vaccine with no adverse reaction.
