                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

                                                Approximately, 25 minutes after vaccine administration the patient verbalized feeling dizzy. He was transferred from a chair to a nearby cot with feet elevated. The ER was notified and an EpiPen was on standby. Vital signs were: BP 155/69, O2 saturation 100%, and HR 125. Vitals were rechecked 5 min later and HR came down to 76. Dizziness still persisted and he complained of his hands feeling weak but grip strength was noted to be equal bilaterally. There was no indication for EpiPen so it was not used. Patient preference was to be transported to the ER for additional follow-up. In the ER vital signs continued to be monitored and patient was given 1 liter sodium chloride 0.9% fluid bolus after which the patient reported feeling much better. Patient was discharged from the ER.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

                                                Approximately nine hours after second dose, I began to feel as if a flu was coming on. Shortly after upon falling asleep, I started getting the chills and felt as though I had a fever. Waking up in the morning, I had a painful throbbing headache. My muscles ached and I felt very fatigued. I was unable to get out of bed due to said fatigue. I felt as though I had a temperature, but did not take it at that juncture. I had no appetite. When I did manage to stand, the headache would throb and I felt nauseated. Later that evening, I had a slight fever of 100.8 degrees fahrenheit. The following morning, I felt nearly recovered, but my head would still throb when changing positions, but not with the same severity as the previous day. Headache slightly persists to this day.

                                                On  the morning of 3/3/2021 i felt a slight amount of discomfort in right armpit. The following night, 3/4/2021, muscle pain in upper back started to develop. The morning of 3/5/2021 the muscle pain had spread from upper back to neck and shoulders. The pain was severe enough to impede the ability to get dressed or drive.  I took Ibuprofen and noticed little relief, then took 1g of acetaminophen and experienced some relief. Pain persisted at same degree until the evening of  3/7/2021  where pain had started to noticeably subside. On morning of 3/8/2021,  armpit discomfort had ceased and muscle pain and been reduced to that of very slight soreness.  as on 3/10/2021 all pain had disappeared.

                                                About a week after I got the vaccine, I started feeling muscle pain in my left arm (the same arm where  got the vaccine), even though the initial muscle pain had gone away 2-3 days after I got the vaccine.  The pain seemed to be mostly around the muscle where the vaccine was injected, but sometimes spread to other nearby muscles as well. 24 hours after that, a red spot (that was hot to the touch) appeared at the bottom of the muscle, an inch or two below the actual vaccination site. The pain was mostly gone by then, but the red spot is still there. I don&#39;t know how serious this is or if/when it will go away.

I took medication for the pain but the symptoms were lessened not for much, I remained in bed until 2:30 PM on Sunday 7th. I am still weakened, fatigued and with a slight shortness of breath, I am assuming by tomorrow I will be feeling better. No regrets whatsoever.

                                                One day after my first COVID19 vaccine, I experienced chills, headache, and myalgia when I woke up that day. I took two 500mg tablets of extra strength Acetaminophen to reduce the severity of my symptoms. And two more tablets six hours later to prevent further symptom severity. When I received my second dose one month later, began experiencing the same symptoms as before. But at 10:00pm of that day. And I experienced pain and discomfort at the injection sight. These symptoms were again reduced by appropriate doses and intervals of Acetaminophen. These general symptoms and injection site symptoms continued for one more day.

By 5 pm the day after I had stomach/abdominal pain aches, nausea and fatigue. The fever started at 100. That night I woke up at least once an hour from the pain. I had to throw up. The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup. Then Tuesday woke up fatigued and mild to low abdominal and now muscle pain.

These began around 1AM approximately 9 hours after vaccination.  Side effects most strongly felt within 36 hours of receiving vaccination.  Continued fatigue, chills, night sweats and muscle pain for two additional days (Thursday 3/11, Friday 3/12) that gradually subsided over those days. Appeared to be a slight rash around the injection site for several days after. I previously had the COVID-19 virus in late March 2020.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

I started Experiencing the listed side effects from the morning of January 8th, 2021 to the morning of January 9th, 2021. It started with light muscle and joint pain at 8am and progressed to sever muscle and joint pain, chills, nausea, fatigue, headaches and eventually a fever averaging at 100 degrees Fahrenheit by 1-2PM the same day. These side effects were enough to leave me bedridden for most of the 8th. most side effects were gone by the morning of the 9th, the fever eventually broke by 930Am on the 9th.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

                                                Approx 20 hours after receiving this vaccine I began to have chills as well as muscle aches all over my body. Several times throughout the following 12-18 hours I was having heart palpitations and back spasms as well as some accompanying shortness of breathe.

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

Light headedness, soreness of my muscles, The shot location itself hurts very badly.  I do not believe it to be threatening to my long-term health in any manner but it does make me worry about taking the next dose that purportedly should be much worse.  I suffered chills the prior night and decided to file this report to help add to the information available.

About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

                                                One week and one day after receiving the Moderna vaccine my left arm, the one the vaccine was injected into, became bright red and warm to the touch. It has also become itchy on one or two occasions.  A large portion of my shoulder/arm has swollen up  over the past day and remained swollen for about 12 hours. There has also been an aching pain in my left arm pit. I have not gone into the Dr. regarding this as the symptoms appear minor and related to the vaccine.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was fine until after a few minutes.  He started to say he felt lightheaded.  He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

A single small ulcerative lesion appeared in the upper soft palate of my mouth so I went to a walk in clinic and had a strep done which was negative. D/t the ulcers appearing in my mouth I had and HIV test done which also came back negative. I had a small low grade fever and muscle aches also associated but the lesion in my mouth is what caused the major concern which slowly resolved over the next few weeks.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Down&#39;s syndrome.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 14-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him) (seriousness criterion medically significant), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds). At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him), INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds) outcome was unknown.            On 01Apr2021, he had a boil type infection near his armpit. She wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment for the doctor until two days after so in the meantime she put hot compresses which helped. The MD prescribed an antibiotic that helped and it went away. Last Thursday, maybe seven or eight days later, her son showed different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done. He was hallucinating and talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there, he was anxious, sad, scared, and having delusions and hearing voices of people talking to him. He is normally self sufficient but he went from his normal routine and she had to tell him to eat and brush his teeth which he would normally do on his own. He is also not sleeping, taking a long time to eat which is unlike him, and has lost 4 pounds. His second dose (lot# 038B21A) was yesterday 14Apr2021. She is concerned if it is related to the vaccine or the antibiotic.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna on January 19, 2021. 48 hours later upon waking from sleep patient had myalgias, arthralgia in all distributions, and  a frontal headache. Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

Towards the end of the day I felt tired, however not sure if that was from the vaccine or because I did not sleep well. Tylenol reduced symptoms and they did not greatly interfere with my day.  The following morning all side effects were gone and I was back to completely normal.

                                                Patient symptoms of chills, headache, and body aches began on Sunday 3/28, 6 days after vaccination.   One day later, on 3/29, patient started experiencing pain in the right armpit, the same shoulder where the vaccine was received.  That pain built up until Wednesday 3/31, when the arm was very swollen, purple, and rapidly loosing sensation.  The patient went to the ER.  In the ER, via ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of the right subclavian and axillary veins.  From 4/1 to 4/2 the patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure, thrombo lysis, using tPA directed by catheter to the site of the 12 cm long clot.  On 4/2, it was determined that the flow was not restored to the vein, and the radiologist informed the patient that right first rib removal would be necessary.  On 4/9, right first rib resection surgery was performed to alleviate pressure on the subclavian vein.  Patient is currently recovering on the blood thinner Eliquis.  Additional procedures for thrombo ectomy and angioplasty will follow in approximately two weeks to clear the subclavian and axillary veins.

                                                I had a little swelling at injection site on day of and night of. The following day the swelling increased and had spread to the armpit area. It was more tender and there was moderate to sever pain in the armpit. I took some advil with minimal relief. On the 3rd day (today) the swelling seemed a littlw worse and the pain increased slightly. I contacted my plastic surgeon (since back in October 2019) because i had a procedure called miradry, which elemintes the sweat glands in my bilateral armpits. The doctor advised me to come in immeidately to the office. Upon arrival the doctor examined the area and was able to se immiedalty that is was swollen. I consented to pictures being taken. He is making an entry as well as I am and I was advised to ice the area and to take advil and to remain in contact.

I only historically had gotten a total of 4 flu vaccines. 24 hours after Moderna I had b/l dorsal foot tingling that I didn?t really pay any mind to, then by the next day it spread to L hand (4th-5th digit) overt weakness and paresthesias and a cool/numb feeling to my R thumb. Similar symptoms to L 5th toe and R great toe. As days progressed it got more diffuse and extended up to mid-calf that was very mild... eventually by day 10 it dissipated, thank god.  To add I also experienced L facial dull pain and the distal portion of my tounge felt like I burnt it (lasted 5 -7 days)

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                At approximately &#43;2 hours from time of vaccine, began experiencing severe (immobilizing) RIGHT FRONT rib pain. Pain level 6 of 10. Contacted doctor&#39;s answering service at &#43;24 hours from time of vaccine to inquire about course of action. Ice was recommended. Doctor&#39;s answering service concluded rib pain to be unrelated to vaccine but rather to Cerebral Palsy and/or muscle strain from 10,000 meter indoor rowing event completed -10 hours from time of vaccine. I am very skeptical of this finding since I routinely row 10,000 meters, and average 40,000&#43; meters each week. No prior known incidents of right front rib pain.  Pain history:  &#43;2 hours, 6 of 10  &#43;24 hours, 6 of 10, unable to conduct normal activity, painful to walk/exercise  &#43;36 hours until present, 6 of 10 but decreasing slowly. Still not able to return to normal routines

States redness grew, more muscle pain, more swelling, darker red in color, generalized arm swelling and tingling in hands. No systemic symptoms: fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath: just localized to that area.  - drainage, redness, warmth to touch. Start taking zyrtec twice daily for any allergic reaction.  No need for steroids- swelling improving, declines any other systemic symptoms. Discussed topical- not interested.  Advised if having worsening- red, hot to touch, fever, chills, drainage from site, streaking redness let us know and will start on antibiotics- declines at this time.

I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

Concerned I should have taken longer time between having COVID and getting the vaccine. It was a approximately 3 days from time of being clear of isolation and any symptoms. There was no concern on the consent form of recently having COVID just a concern if you were presently positive.

However, the site of the injection on my left arm has turned red. I would say it is a red circle with a radius of 1.5-inch around the injection location. It is painful when pressed on. Also my left armpit (lymph nod) is swollen and is painful. Hopefully I won&#39;t die :/

Worst post vaccination pain I have ever had, and I have received rabies, anthrax, and yellow fever vaccinations.  Generalized fatigue and malaise from mid day of the injection through the following day.

The headache, muscle aches and extreme fatigue continued for 2 days after vaccine administration. The patient took tylenol and ibuprofen for his fever and headache symptoms. To date, he is still experiencing headaches. He will be visiting his PCP for his annual 2/26/21 and will bring up the reaction to him for further direction.

Then last night 3/10/2021 I felt a nerve time pain in my axillary space.  I know nerves can be &#34;funny&#34; at times since understanding pain science and low grade nerve information and still didn&#39;t think that was odd.  Today this morning 3/11/201 during my 545am work out I noticed around 6:15 am my delt (injection site) was very red.  Later it got itchy, and now 8:14pm swollen and starting to get warm, and the redness ring is now twice the size of my morning work out.  Pain is minimal none, just minor sorness (a 1/4th of the after day sorness from shot).  My pec area feels off.

                                                On Day 6 post vaccination, noticed slight tenderness near injection site. On Day 7 a rash developed and it was warm to the touch. On Day 8, some pain developed in addition. On Day 9, the rash grew in size and was itchy. On Day 10, it was almost cleared up. On Day 11, it appeared gone, On Day 12, the rash *re-appeared* but had grown in size. On Day 13, the rash was even bigger - had spread further down my arm. By Day 14, it had almost disppeared.  On Day 5, I noticed a swollen lymph node near my left clavicle. On Day 6, this lymph node had swelled and now there was pain. I also experienced slight discomfort under my left armpit. The pain associated with the clavicle lymph node lasted until Day 8. As of Day 14, the lymph node is still swollen.

                                                Inflammation started on the right and left sides of my neck two days after the shot. The pain was dull and lasted for about two days. The pain then moved to the middle of my back at the spine and blades of my lower back shoulders. The pain has lasted for a little over a week now and has lessened over time but is still noticeable. If I tried to sneeze or inhale deeply, this was difficult due to the discomfort I felt in my back and the sides of my neck.

Second, 7 days after vaccination, itchy and hot area of hives developed around the injection spot and slowly grew  into a 6 inch circle. Third, at the same time with the second symptom, I am having a mild sciatic pain in my right leg.  Symptom 1 has subsided, and symptoms 2 and 3 are still present, but seem to have slowed down.

I ate some oatmeal for breakfast and took 1000mg of Acetaminophen and it has not helped. Its been almost 2 hours since I took the tylenol with no result.

                                                Then this past Tuesday (03-23-2021) I went to receive the 2nd Covid-19 Moderna Vaccine at 1:00pm. I felt fine and had no adverse after this vaccination until 8:30pm the same day. At this time I started to have sever  itching and within an hour the itching was over my entire body. It was a mixture of hives and regular pruritus/itching and areas of swelling throughout my body. This lasted all through the night into Wednesday, 03-24-21. Around the same time as the itching started Tuesday night, my Spinal joints, Hip joints, shoulder joints, knee joints, wrist and ankles became severely inflamed and very painful. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst pain, at the highest I was at a 9.    On Wednesday, I went in to my Primary Care for the itching and the pain. My PCP is on vacation this week, so I saw his Colleague. Dr. visibly recognized the redness from the itching all over my body, along with the extreme pain to my joints and gave me a thorough examination. After his examination  he spoke to another physician who stepped in and also gave me an exam. Dr. advised the other Dr. and me of  his initial hesitancy  sending me home, wanting me to be observed overnight at the Hospital. After going to their Emergency Room. They gave me the choice but I truly thought it would go away over the course of the usual 24 hours post Vaccination; I also did not want to be exposed to any virus/sickness I might encounter/pick up in the Hospital due to my lowered immune system because of the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira I take bi-monthly.. I explained that I was living with my mom, and our residence is 7 minutes from the Hospital, Emergency Room.) I assured both Physicians if it got worse, my mother would take me to the ER. So instead of going to Hospital, they prescribed a Hydrocortisone Cream of  2.5% for the itching, kept me on oral Benadryl and told me to stay hydrated. Also, Dr. said if it wasn?t better and/or worse Thursday(03/25/21)to come back in for re-evaluation. Along with the medications for itching, they prescribed a dose of pain medicine: Tylenol(APAP) #4 - or Acetaminophen with 60mg of Codeine.    Yesterday - Thursday(03-25-2021) I was no better, and had to go back in to the Clinic.  I was seen by Dr., who also believed this reaction to be based on the Humira along with my immune system naturally being lowered due to the AS and RA medication. Dr. examined me, as by yesterday my hands/fingers were hurting as well and itching was not any better. He prescribed Atarax (Hydroxyzine) 50mg Cap to be taken 3 times per day for the awful Pruritis, which has caused me to scratch so badly that I?ve had some bleeding from areas on my body, near the larger joints and spine. And also changed the Tylenol #4 to every 4 hours, basically more often for the pain associated.    Adding the Hydroxyzine for the itch along with the Hydrocortisone, pain medication and time since Tuesday?s final vaccine, has helped a bit. Today, Friday, I am feeling less itchy but still having quite a bit of joint pain, but less than Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  Because of the itching and joint/spine pain I received very little sleep until last evening when I was able to rest and not itch or toss and turn from pain. Hopefully on the mend.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

                                                I am a board certified infectious diseases pharmacist and I have given lectures over hypersenstivites reactions. I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

Neither were effective in treating swollen lymph nodes. Tylenol was effective in testing fever and muscle soreness. Will see physician later today.

                                                The evening of the vaccine it started with severe fatigue and a sore throat. The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

                                                The night of the injection started with severe fatigue and a severe sore throat, the next day I woke up with a sore throat so bad I could not swallow. I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

                                                Chills and fatigue started roughly 8-9 hours after receiving vaccine. Insomnia that first night. Developed a fever early Wednesday morning, fever range 100-102 F and lasted until Thursday morning around 1000. Chills and joint aches accompanied the fever.

                                                Severe sore throat for 7 days, then chest congestion and hoarse voice for 3 days. Followed by back and neck muscle spasms causing pain at any slight movement. Telemedicine visit to doctor suggested the sore throat was something viral (not Covid), and that it should go away. Two PCR tests were negative for Covid. Muscle pain has not been addressed yet, as I cannot make an appointment until I have been symptom-free for 72 hours.

                                                Just after getting the vaccine had a sore shoulder for 2 days, then after that nothing until 8 days after getting the vaccine.  On the 26th, started feeling slight soreness in joints in muscles kind of like they were locked up, didnt think much of it, thought it was maybe from overdoing a gym workout.  The next day on the 27th, woke up and was feeling chills, along with mostly full body soreness and feeling very lethargic.  I also had a baseball sized red area on the injection site on my shoulder, it was itchy, swollen and felt very firm to the touch especially compared to other shoulder.  I also had hive like red circular welts on my back, butt, and upper legs.  Two of my fingers had spots on them that felt like blisters.  Felt very sore and tired all day.  In the evening I took 50mg benadryl to try and combat the symptoms.  When I woke up the next morning (28th) still had all the same symptoms just felt slightly better overall.  Took 50mg more benadryl and felt pretty tired and lethargic throughout the day.  In the late afternoon I have started feeling more sore again, and have a slight headache.  The hives and red area on my shoulder are still present but not as red.  So far during this time I have not had any issues with my throat and breathing, but my sternum has been super sore, more sore than any other part of my body during this time.  If i take as much air in as I can, it feels sore and hurts as I get to the last 10% of my lung capacity inhaling.

                                                Muscular pain in left shoulder and arm became very painful 24-36 hours after injection. It was difficult to sleep due to pain. This pain dissipated 48 hours after injection. Pain returned 6 days after injection, on Monday the 8th. Pain was in the lower portion of the left arm and in the calf muscle of left leg. In my opinion, this cannot be explained by any other physical activities.

                                                Strong headache first to develop followed quickly ny full body and muscle aches.  Shortly thereafter a rapidly rising fever accompanied by mild nausea and severe bout of chills.  Loss of appetite, brain fog, poor concentration.  Fever lasted from 9pm rapidly increasing to a highest measured temp (oral) of 102.9F for approximately 12 to 14 hours before gradually decreasing to under 100 roughly 36 hours after onset.  Tylenol did help slightly to control fever but did not seem to lower it.  Did nothing to reduce body aches.  Significant fatigue and soreness lasted approximately 3 days after dosage.

Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

                                                Initial side effects (24 hours) soreness in upper arm. Within 36 hours I started getting extreme light headed. Within 3 days I started having pins and needle sensation in my right arm, from my shoulder to my finger, mainly my pinky and ring finger. I progressed to my left arm and right leg.  I&#39;ve had back pain since then but not sure if it&#39;s related. The pins an needles I feel every now and then but not as bad. The light headedness has not gone away, I can&#39;t shake it.  I&#39;ve seen my Dr, he put me on an anxiety medication.  My blood work came out good. I started the anxiety meds and started seeing a Therapist , but I don&#39;t really see a difference, it&#39;s nice to see someone but not getting better. I&#39;m coming off the anxiety med because a side effect is light headedness and that&#39;s not helping me much.  I have not got the second dose and do not plan on getting it.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

On Sunday I had the same symptoms but I noticed a sharp pain in my back. By Sunday evening I started to feel pain on right side of back in the middle of my back felt like it was my ribs at first. The pain elevated as the evening went on to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand for too long or sit.

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA Approximately 3 hours after vaccine, shoulder pain began to develop. Pain became significant, waking me in the middle of the night. The following day, I was unable to lift the arm I received the injection in no higher than about 80 degrees from my side. Pain increased despite taking OTC NSAIDS. By the second morning after vaccine administration, pain had worsened and right arm cannot be raised more than about 60 degrees without significant pain. Contacted PCP office about 12 hours after injection, they recommended NSAID dosages alternating ibuprofen and tylenol, and icing the shoulder. Pain impacts daily life activities, including caring for small children , lifting items that weigh more than a few pounds by the impacted arm, and significant difficulty reaching any object above the level of the shoulder. I have never previously experienced this kind of reaction to any other upper arm injection or vaccination.

                                                Persistent (&gt; 4 weeks) right shoulder pain and weakness with certain movement of the arm/shoulder as well as a full pain at rest. This is not a report of the typical soreness after a shot.  Concern for tendonitis/shoulder injury from the shot itself or a complication thereafter.  I have been taking ibuprofen around the clock.  The normal soreness after the shot started around 12 hrs.  These subsequent pain/weakness issues continued on after that point

At the time of patient&#39;s vaccine (01/19/2021), the patient was unaware of his spouse&#39;s COVID-19 status, as they had little contact with others and thought it was a cold. Patient began having COVID-like symptoms on 01/23/2021: cough, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, muscle/body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patient has had two subsequent negative COVID-19 tests while symptomatic. Because of his symptoms, his spouse&#39;s symptoms and positive COVID status, practitioners have cautioned patient to act as if he has COVID. He is under quarantine orders per Public Health. The concern from the patient, Doctors and Public Health officials has been the patient&#39;s negative status while obviously symptomatic, and if he can pass COVID if he is symptomatic but testing negative. He has another test scheduled for Saturday 1/30/2021.

Neck stiffness and soreness began Thursday evening.  Severe chest pains early Saturday morning (3am).  Taken to urgent care - EKG showed irregularity and high level of troponin. Transported from there to the hospital.  They did angiogram, and diagnosed me with pericarditis. The on call physician believes this was most likely caused by the second dose of the vaccine.

The following day about 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I got a pain in my lower back. I have been doing stretching,  heat, massage and OTC pain relievers. The pain in my lower back is serve, I couldn&#39;t really stand up straight. I have had to miss a few days of work. I have talked to a family friend who is a Doctor and he said it should only last for a 1-2.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

                                                Patient report arm pain after receiving the covid vaccine 12/29. Patient reported to the ER on 1/6 for further evaluation regarding arm pain. Per patient the ER doctor stated that at the covidvax clinic the medical personelle administering the vaccine may have hit a blood vessel in his shoulder where the injection was. Patient explains the bruising is still there but the pain is radiating through the armpit and into his bicep through his elbow. Patient reports that his arm is not swollen and the yellow bruise had faded.  Reports 1/8 that using hot packs and ibuprofen make the pain subside.   1/11 reports arm pain is not getting worse but the pain and discomfort are staying about the same.

                                                Lower Back Spasms just a few hours after vacine was administered.  I went to bed with what I thought was just flu like syptoms like achy muscles.  But this was more then that.  Even laying in bed my back would spasm and almost take my breath away.  That night did not sleep due to the sporadic unpredictable pain when laying in bed.  Describe pain as electic shock or stabbing pain that takes your breath away it&#39;s so intense, but then goes away very quickly.  The next couple of days I was forced to stay immobile due to the pain that was sporadic in nature.  Even when laying down it spasmed.   I could barely walk for a few days.  I started taking NSAIDS to help with the pain and I became more mobile after a few days.  Work has been very difficult and spasms have not gone away even now Im still having problems and am struggling making it through the work day.  I have to lay down flat on my back as soon as I get home from work and take ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  I was absolutely fine healthy and very active person prior to the vaccine.  Just hours after getting vaccine it&#39;s almost like my joints and back were inflamed for some reason.

Note from the attached photo that I was injected high in the deltoid, approximately 1 cm below the acromion process. I&#39;m now approaching 72 hours post vaccination and am still experiencing achiness in my upper left arm and limited ROM. No fever, swelling, redness, bruising or allergic reaction. I have been taking Tylenol 500 mg 2 tabs PRN, which has helped with the pain at night. approximately 1 cm below the acromion process. Patient noted gradually increasing achiness and feeling of heaviness in left arm 4-8 hours post vaccine, was unable to sleep due to pain. On 02/10/21, patient took Tylenol 500 mg 2 tab at 05:00 and 14:00, still had difficulty raising arm. On 02/11/21, patient woke up at 02:00 with 7/10 pain in left shoulder, took Tylenol and was able to fall asleep. Patient went to work but was unable to raise left arm no more than 30 degrees from body and continued to complain of achiness. On 02/12/21, patient woke up at 04:30 with 7/10 pain in left shoulder and took Tylenol 500 mg 2 tab. At 06:20, pain is 0/10 and patient is able to raise arm 90 degrees from body but notes stiffness and heaviness. Patient sent message to primary care provider to determine possible shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA), awaiting MD response.

                                                I had a MVA on December 19 2000. After physical therapy the pain in my neck was down to a 1. Then after the 2nd dose of moderna about 15 hours after injection I woke up Sunday morning (the next day) and I could barely get out of bed from the pain in my neck. I could not move my neck and the pain was radiating down my left arm. The next day (Monday) I was feeling better and had more movement in my neck but still lots of pain. I went to the PA on Monday and got checked out. I still had strength but mobility was very little. I still have the pain and radiation down arm.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 26-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 26-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle) (seriousness criterion medically significant), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement). At the time of the report, SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) was resolving.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications taken by the patient were not provided.  The reporter reported that patient never had any allergic reactions to vaccines or medications before and had no past medical histories for vasovagal reactions. After receiving the vaccine, the patient waited in the pharmacy for 15 minutes - 20 minutes. The patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement. The patient was out of it for 15-30 seconds. The reporter stated that she called 911. The patient came to, his eyes were huge, but he was aware to self and surroundings. The emergency team came, took the patient&#39;s vitals which were stable and stated the patient likely experienced a vasovagal effect from the needle. However, the reporter thinks it was a potential seizure; more than a vasovagal response. Emergency team offered no treatment. The emergency team had encouraged the patient to follow up with a doctor but the patient did not want to make a big scene.  Emergency team offered no treatment for the patient.

                                                Moderna Covid - 19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on Wednesday January 6th. EARLY Friday morning around 30 minutes after midnight - I noticed pain on my left shoulder / neck area (tenderness). I began to feel around and found a swollen lymph node at the base of my neck just inside my left collar bone. Seems to be the supraclavical lymphnodes. I also noticed tenderness under my left arm in the arm pit region. I received the injection on the left side.

Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

                                                Experienced mild pain in right arm pit lymph node last night around 5:30PM. Woke up this morning with more pain than last night. The pain reminds me of the Small Pox inoculation I&#39;d received. I am self-reporting this morning, I will report again if/when I feel better. I will also report if I end up having to seek medical attention.

                                                pain in the left shoulder followed by weakness in the left hand, left, left deltoid and mild weakness in the left tricep.  The pain was sharp and stabbing.   Over a period of hours the left hand became weak.  He returned to work on the 19th and struggled with manual tasks with his left hand (he is a dentist). Based on his symptoms of pain followed by limb weakness, the diagnosis of brachial neuritis was clinically suspected by his PCP. On the 20th he received a steroid taper starting with 60mg daily for 4 days, then 40mg for 4 days then 20mg for 4 days and then off.  Within a day of starting steroids, the weakness improved slightly and the pain decreased.  As of January 27th he still uses tylenol for pain and has mild left hand weakness that is residual.

                                                I was contacted by my son requesting help obtaining medical treatment following his COVID vaccination.  Per patient, immediately after being injected he had severe shoulder pain and since receiving the vaccine he has been unable to use his arm. His arm has been in a sling and he is being denied further medical evaluation. The Nurse who was present suggested he contact his family adding that the doctor injected too high.  He had the second vaccine with no adverse reaction.

Initially thought it was a kidney stone, but a visit to a urologist on February 25, determined it wasn&#39;t a kidney stone. The urologist ordered some blood work and that indicated that I most likely had blood clots. Went to the ER on the 25th and had further tests that determined that I indeed did have blood clots in my lungs.

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

                                                Around 6:30 pmI began feeling chills and incredibly tired.  I became sore all over and began shaking uncontrollably because of the chills.  I went to sleep around 7pm and woke up 20 minutes laterwith the worst fever I ever had.  I was extremely hot but when I lifted the covers I would immediately get cold.  I got out of bed around 3am because I was very thirsty and completly stuffed up in my head and sinuses.  I used vicks sinex and drank water and tea.  I was very cold when i got out of bed.  I went back to bed and woke up every 30 mins or so very hot and chilly when I lifted the covers.  I finally got out of bed at 6am.  At that point I had sweated through two shirts, my sheets and comforter.  When i got out of bed I was no longer chilly.  I had a mild headache, sinus pressure and soreness throughout my neck and shoulders.  Throughout the day (April 21, 2021) I would get chills and then get hot.  I continued to havce sinus pressure and a mild headache.  I went to bed around 8:30pm and woke up at 3:00am.  when I woke up I had sweated through half my shirt.  At the time of writing (April 22, 2021 @ 6:08am) I feel slight sinus pressure, no headache and get chills and hot from time to time.

The chest tightness would persist after these events for roughly 30 mins. This activity-related chest tightness  continued to occur until the 5th day after the shot.
