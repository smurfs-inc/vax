                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

He was transferred from a chair to a nearby cot with feet elevated. The ER was notified and an EpiPen was on standby. Vital signs were: BP 155/69, O2 saturation 100%, and HR 125. Vitals were rechecked 5 min later and HR came down to 76. Dizziness still persisted and he complained of his hands feeling weak but grip strength was noted to be equal bilaterally. There was no indication for EpiPen so it was not used. Patient preference was to be transported to the ER for additional follow-up. In the ER vital signs continued to be monitored and patient was given 1 liter sodium chloride 0.9% fluid bolus after which the patient reported feeling much better. Patient was discharged from the ER.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

                                                I received the vaccine on 3/25/2021 at 5:30PM and had general soreness in the arm the injection took place. Soreness was remarkable until four days after the injection. Night of 3/30/2021 at approximately around 9:30 pm I felt soreness in the left axillary region (in my left armpit). This at first was thought to be unremarkable as I was wearing a tight shirt at the time. However, after switching to looser clothing the soreness and pain continued and now considered remarkable. The day after (3/31/21 Today of this report), I still have pain and what feels to be a swollen lymph node in the left axillary region (in my left armpit). This is sore and painful and feels palpable.

                                                Written by Doctor: April 7, 2021 2:09 p.m. DOB 2/07/1995, male, received his second dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot 019B21A) at 1:13 p.m.  He stood up and walked to the usher?s table to have his vaccine card completed.  Approximately one minute after receiving his vaccine, he had a syncopal episode falling directly backwards striking his head on the floor.  I, MD did not directly witness the fall, but everyone who witnessed the fall said that he fell completely unimpeded to the floor.  I was notified and immediately assisted the patient who was with his girlfriend.  Patient initially appeared ?out?, but almost immediately opened his eyes and asked what happened.  His skin was cool and clammy.  A pulse oximeter was placed on his finger registering 98% o2 and a pulse of 53.  I kept him lying on the floor until he was completely awake and aware of his surroundings.  At the time he said his neck was not sore, but his head was sore.  Approximately 2-3 minutes later, we were able to assist him in standing to immediately sit down in a wheelchair.  He was taken to the cot in the hallway just outside the Medical Observation where I was able to help him to stand and then lie down.  An icepack was provided to put on the back of his head, he was provided water, Gatorade, and two cookies.  Patient said that he hadn?t eaten all day and had been feeling slightly hungry prior to his vaccination.  I had patient move all extremities and asked his questions to verify that he was full awake and oriented to person, place, and time.  Patient girlfriend  stayed with patient while he ate his cookies.  I addressed my concerns about patient striking his head on the floor and the possibility of a closed head injury.  Girlfriend felt that patient was now completely back to his normal state of mind.  I had patient remain lying down for 20 minutes.  When I returned to check on him, he was sitting up and wanted to leave.  I told him that he needed to be able to walk up and down the hallway before I would feel comfortable letting him leave.  He stood up and walked halfway down the hallway before saying he was lightheaded.  I immediately went to him to lead him back to the cot, but he insisted that he needed to use the bathroom to urinate.  Both girlfriend and I stood in the doorway to assist patient if he needed, but he was able to finish urinating, then returned and sat in the wheelchair.  I spoke to both Doctors via a phone call and had spoken to someone earlier.  After letting them know that patient did not want an ambulance called, but I was going to strongly recommend he go to the nearest ER before returning home, I returned to the patient.  Vital signs at 1:53 were Pulse Ox of 98%, pulse 78, and blood pressure sitting of 140/75.  Again, I strongly recommended that girlfriend drive him to an ED for an evaluation and possible cat scan.  Patient also now had some paracervical neck pain which I also said should be evaluated.  Patient and girlfriend both insisted they didn?t want an ambulance called and girlfriend felt comfortable taking patient out of the clinic.  Patient said he was hungry, and they were going to get food first.  Girlfriend gave me her phone number (xxx)xxx-xxxx and I gave her my phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx).  I told her I was going to call her every hour to check on patient and told her to call me at any time.  I recommended acetaminophen for the headache and other vaccine symptoms but no ibuprofen because of the possible head injury.  I recommended to immediately call an ambulance or go to an ED for nausea, worsening headache, confusion, or drowsiness.  Girlfriend is not to let patient sleep longer than 30 minutes at a time.  Patient was able to walk out of the clinic easily under his own power without any assistance.  He stated he was feeling much better.

                                                Roughly 15 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop muscle aches. Within 30 minutes of the aches, they became severe. Aches were primarily located in the lower back, shoulders, hips, and calves. 30 minutes following,  I started to feel very fatigued and had labored breathing. Another 1.5 later, I developed chills and had flu like symptoms. By the afternoon, I had broken into a fever and had mild nausea. Besides the muscle aches, as one symptom onset, the others seemed to fade away. By 5:00 in the evening, (roughly 25 hours after receipt of vaccine) the symptoms quickly subsided. The only residual side-effects within the rest of a 48 hour period were soreness in the area of the injection, and mild headache.

But then yesterday started to have similar symptoms, as well as chest pressure, hurts to breathe all the way in, feels a twinge feeling on the inside. Also noticed a muscular pain as well in the same area, hurts to move down the middle of his chest. Also having pain on the right side. Symptoms are persistent, will wax and wane slightly but doesn&#39;t go away completely. Feels better when he is standing if feels better, has not noticed food triggers, no difficulty eating or swallowing. A few weeks ago also started a higher fat intake diet. No fevers or chills, no diarrhea, no rash, no sore throat, no runny nose. No known muscular injury that he can think of.&#34; May 20, 2021-- &#34;Today is feeling some decrease in symptoms, but still feels like he needs to take deep breaths. Feels like &#34;something is erratic&#34; once in a while. Not feeling increased improvement. Laying down does seem to make it worse. One time he was leaning forward and then sitting up made it worse.&#34; May 26, 2021 -- &#34;he reports that he is still feeling some chest pain, but overall is feeling better, symptoms are up and down. Feels like a &#34;tiredness&#34; in the chest wall area. The most pain is from twisting. Not worsening with acidic or greasy foods. Feels like pain is mostly in the muscle now. No SOB at all with increased exertion.&#34;

                                                Ever since receiving the vaccine, two months ago now, my left arm has had chronic pain usually radiating out from the injection site but sometimes spreading across my entire shoulder and down to my elbow. I also have quite a bit of pain depending on the motion I try to take and a fairly regular (and worsening) throbbing sensation around where the injection was. - I also regularly feel like I have no strength in my left arm/grip and it?s gotten to the point where it?s now affecting daily life.  Some days, the area around the site swells up and I feel a burning sensation instead of a painful pulsing or throbbing  Painkillers (ibuprofen) don?t seem to help very much though and sometimes I?ll wake up in the middle of the night from rolling onto my left arm and causing the pain to intensify.  I?m not sure if the pain is truly a side effect of the vaccine or if the volunteer performing the vaccine did something wrong when administering it.

                                                Approximately nine hours after second dose, I began to feel as if a flu was coming on. Shortly after upon falling asleep, I started getting the chills and felt as though I had a fever. Waking up in the morning, I had a painful throbbing headache. My muscles ached and I felt very fatigued. I was unable to get out of bed due to said fatigue. I felt as though I had a temperature, but did not take it at that juncture. I had no appetite. When I did manage to stand, the headache would throb and I felt nauseated. Later that evening, I had a slight fever of 100.8 degrees fahrenheit. The following morning, I felt nearly recovered, but my head would still throb when changing positions, but not with the same severity as the previous day. Headache slightly persists to this day.

                                                Had no symptoms prior to injection. After injection, quickly developed moderate pain at injection site that eventually became severe. Over the rest of the day, developed a severe headache, severe muscle aches (not just at injection site), severe fatigue, fever of 100.6F, moderate joint aches (not just in arm, but all over body - neck is worst), and general weakness (I almost fell walking to the bathroom and I&#39;m in decently good shape). Toward the evening, I started struggling with thermal homeostasis - I was simultaneously sweating and shivering. The combination of these was severe enough that I had extreme difficulty sleeping last night and woke up at least once an hour, getting &lt;6 hours of sleep after lying in bed for almost 12 hours. Right now (23h post vaccination), the pain at the injection site has gotten significantly less bad, but I still have a splitting headache, fever of 100.3F,  moderate fatigue/weakness, and mild muscle/joint pains across my whole body. I&#39;m unsure how much the headache this morning is from sleep deprivation.   At no point did I lose sense of smell or taste, have a sore throat, cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, or shortness of breath.

The following night, 3/4/2021, muscle pain in upper back started to develop. The morning of 3/5/2021 the muscle pain had spread from upper back to neck and shoulders. The pain was severe enough to impede the ability to get dressed or drive.  I took Ibuprofen and noticed little relief, then took 1g of acetaminophen and experienced some relief. Pain persisted at same degree until the evening of  3/7/2021  where pain had started to noticeably subside. On morning of 3/8/2021,  armpit discomfort had ceased and muscle pain and been reduced to that of very slight soreness.  as on 3/10/2021 all pain had disappeared.

                                                During my first vaccine I experienced a bruise on my arm that lasted ~3 weeks. My arm swelled (including my fingers which looked like sausages) for a few hours that night.  I also felt like I experienced slight chest congestion for a week or two after. The second vaccine (lot number listed on this form) I have a bruise that in my opinion is worse than the one from the first shot.  The bruise is still present after 1 week. I also feel slight tenderness around the joint area. I have not heard of these symptoms being advertise Will this cause joint damage? Additionally form both vaccines I experienced fever, body aches and obviously a sore arm.

                                                About a week after I got the vaccine, I started feeling muscle pain in my left arm (the same arm where  got the vaccine), even though the initial muscle pain had gone away 2-3 days after I got the vaccine.  The pain seemed to be mostly around the muscle where the vaccine was injected, but sometimes spread to other nearby muscles as well. 24 hours after that, a red spot (that was hot to the touch) appeared at the bottom of the muscle, an inch or two below the actual vaccination site. The pain was mostly gone by then, but the red spot is still there. I don&#39;t know how serious this is or if/when it will go away.

I felt like my head was going to explode, and I took ibuprofen and Tylenol. I also had a fever and excruciating pain at the injection site, this all went away within 3 days. On 05/07/2021 I woke up with a really bad headache and I was dizzy, I took ibuprofen and Tylenol and it seemed to be getting better. And finally on 05/11/2021 I woke up again with a headache and dizziness, this is the day I went to my primary care doctor and he told me that he has seen this pretty frequently with the moderna vaccine. He said that it was brain swelling and inflammation. He told me to take ibuprofen and Tylenol every 6 hours for a week and that if I was still experiencing these side effects then I can come back and he will prescribe me steroids. It has now been 3 days, and my head still hurts and doesn?t feel normal. He also told me that if I get tingling in my fingers or blurred vision to go to an emergency room right away.

They continued to get worse for several days and appeared on all parts of my body from head to toe. I noticed my feet hurt and that I was showing signs of angioedema beginning on 5/14 and peaking the next day. I also experienced joint/tendon pain in the evening of 5/16 between my legs and feet (upper ankle). I still have hives today. The hives were particularly bad in high-touch areas, near the armpits, lower arms, pelvis areas. I took Benadryl occasionally which helped but at no point did the hives go away.

                                                Starting at about 5pm on the day of vaccination, I experienced intense but expected side effects including full body muscle ache, fever, drowsiness, cold sweats, joint pain. These symptoms lasted for about 24hrs before subsiding completely by that Tuesday evening. On Thursday, 5/13, I woke up with moderate tightness in my chest that progressed over the course of 45 minutes to be severe chest pain. At that point, my wife drove me to the ER in  where I was checked in at about 8:30am. By the time I was checked in the chest pain had subsided to be just a slight discomfort, overall the chest pain had lasted for approximately 2 hours. At the ER my bloodwork was done and the initial blood samples returned an elevated Troponin I level of 5.04 ng/ml. While at the ER at the  I experienced one more incident of chest pain which lasted roughly 30 minutes and was moderately low on the pain scale. I was given multiple EKGs, X-rays, and Echocardiograms, all of which showed no abnormalities. Repeated troponin tests however showed an increase in my levels over the course of the day from 5 up to 12.6 and 13. I was placed on a heparin drip in the afternoon. By doctor recommendation I was air-lifted to later that night at 10:30pm so that further scans and a possible cardiac catheterization and CT scans. The following day, Friday, at 1am at my bloodwork was taken and troponin levels had increased to 14. I was scheduled for a CT scan, cardiac MRI, and echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of Myocarditis. By Saturday afternoon I was taken off of the heparin drip and told that they would not be able to perform any of the scheduled tests until Monday at the earliest. My most recent troponin level came back as a 9. At this point I decided to check myself out of  against medical advice since they were not able to run the necessary scans and my wife and I do not live in . I returned home to and followed up on 5/19 with a doctor at the ER at  since I was unable to find any available appointments with any cardiologists in the area for the next few weeks. My troponin levels and EKG taken at came back as normal, so I continue to follow doctor advice of bedrest and no alcohol for the next 4-6 weeks. My pulse is still elevated (roughly 85 bpm resting when it used to be at &lt;65 bpm resting) and seems to easily increase with even moderate activity such as walking in the house up to over 100 bpm.

I also experienced the common fatigue. However, at 12:13a.m on May 25th, I was woken from sleeping to what can only be described as either the most severe case of the shakes that have ever been experienced, or convulsions. I was unable to move, speak, and could hardly breathe. The effects of this lasted well over an hour and a half. It was only after what I was experiencing stopped, that I suddenly became burning hot, but did not have a fever. 98.7° was what was read at the time I started to feel hot. Since then I have experienced severe joint and knuckle pain on my left hand, still bicep soreness, pain in my left forearm, again joint and knuckle pain in my left hand, and headaches.

It felt like I could only breath in for about a second and a half without a lot of strain or coughing. It is now 10:41 AM and I still have a heavy chest and shortness of breath but it is much more manageable than before. I still can&#39;t take a full breath, but I can breath in for about 5 seconds before it feels like something is blocking me from going further. No current pain.

                                                I started to develop the following symptoms fever,  joint pain, shortness of breathe, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain by 7:00 AM on Saturday 6th, and subsequently they increased until the only thing I could to was only lay in bed, during the night the shivering awfull, there was a point when my whole body was stiff and I wasn&#39;t able to move (or at least that was my perception at that point) the fever, joint pain, shortness of breathe, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain increased and by 3 AM I was vomiting. I took medication for the pain but the symptoms were lessened not for much, I remained in bed until 2:30 PM on Sunday 7th. I am still weakened, fatigued and with a slight shortness of breath, I am assuming by tomorrow I will be feeling better. No regrets whatsoever.

Patient reports he received his first COVID vaccine (Moderna) on base on 8 Jan 2021. Was in his usual state of health. Waited 15 minutes without adverse reaction. About 35-40 minutes after vaccination while driving home, felt like his tongue was bigger inside his mouth.

Denies associated lightheadedness, syncope, shortness of breath, wheezing, cough, urticaria, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhea.  Swelling persisted 1.5-2 hours and spontaneously resolved. Did not seek medical attention. Presented to POD for second COVID vaccine dose (due 5 Feb 2021) and was turned away after mentioning his symptoms and was recommended to follow-up with the clinic. He has never experienced swelling before. Vaccines are otherwise up to date; has tolerated all other vaccines. Denies a history of anaphylaxis. Denies adverse reaction to any prior medications. Denies a history of adverse reaction to venom and latex. States gluten sensitive (bloating, diarrhea after ingestion). Denies a history of food allergies. Reports he is allergic to cats and has seasonal allergy symptoms controlled with Benadryl PRN.  Denies a history of adverse reaction to polyethylene glycol (PEG), a polysorbate, or polyoxyl 35 castor oil containing injectable or vaccine. Takes an OTC stool softener PRN containing docusate and sennosides.

                                                One day after my first COVID19 vaccine, I experienced chills, headache, and myalgia when I woke up that day. I took two 500mg tablets of extra strength Acetaminophen to reduce the severity of my symptoms. And two more tablets six hours later to prevent further symptom severity. When I received my second dose one month later, began experiencing the same symptoms as before. But at 10:00pm of that day. And I experienced pain and discomfort at the injection sight. These symptoms were again reduced by appropriate doses and intervals of Acetaminophen. These general symptoms and injection site symptoms continued for one more day.

                                                The first night after the shot I was irritable and achy, woke up fatigued. By 5 pm the day after I had stomach/abdominal pain aches, nausea and fatigue. The fever started at 100. That night I woke up at least once an hour from the pain. I had to throw up. The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup. Then Tuesday woke up fatigued and mild to low abdominal and now muscle pain.

These began around 1AM approximately 9 hours after vaccination.  Side effects most strongly felt within 36 hours of receiving vaccination.  Continued fatigue, chills, night sweats and muscle pain for two additional days (Thursday 3/11, Friday 3/12) that gradually subsided over those days. Appeared to be a slight rash around the injection site for several days after. I previously had the COVID-19 virus in late March 2020.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

Specifically my right foot, usually the ball of the foot by my big toe.   I woke up this morning with the most painful flareup I can recall. On a scale of 1-10, the pain was a 7-8. After taking two Aleve tablets and icing my foot twice the pain is a 3-4. The joint still feels swollen and the range of motion is diminished.

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine  at 2:55pm on 4/7.  An hour or two later, I started to get a sore throat.  The sore throat was very painful by the early morning of 4/8.  On 4/8 I went into a doctor to see if I had strep throat because of the level of pain and since I didn&#39;t think I could get a sore throat from the vaccine, but he said it was not strep and that it was likely just a side effect of the vaccine.  On 4/8 I also had a fever topping 101.4, fatigue (I slept a lot that day), mental fog, pain at injection site, and all-around body pain.  The sore throat lessened greatly by 4/9, so it clearly wasn&#39;t a strep infection and seems it was indeed a side effect of the vaccine.  From 4/9 through 4/11 I had general &#34;cold&#34; symptoms: runny nose, phlegmy, watery eyes, redness and pain at injection site, muscle aches, elevated temperature (not fever), and general fatigue. By 4/12, these symptoms are nearly completely gone.  Some of these symptoms seemed quite strange as side effects from the vaccine, but they started and perfectly paralleled the expected vaccine side-effects, which makes me think they were caused by the vaccine.  I have no reason to think I had another illness at the same time as when I was experiencing these side-effects.  I had had Covid-19 previously (in December 2020; I tested positive and had mild symptoms).  Perhaps having had Covid-19 already provoked these strange side-effects.

Vomiting and diarrhea began at the onset of symptoms as well. Vomiting stopped after 24 hours. Diarrhea continues to be an issue. Nausea continues through the entire period; however, the current nausea could be contributed to the lack of food over the last 2 days as well as dehydration. Aching joints also continue to be a problem mostly in the lower back area.   Treatment was bed rest for 48 hours as well as 1000mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Gatorade/Powerade was drank as could be tolerated.

                                                Felt fine all evening after the injection (6pm). Woke up feeling fine around 8am. Started feeling cold around 10am. Took temperature several times and body temperature had fallen to 94. Got back into bed with heating pad on back and feet. Temperature quickly jumped to 100. Body temperature continued to fluctuate into the evening. As evening rolled in started experiencing excruciating pain in the neck at the base of the skull and migraine like symptoms.

                                                The day after, I had the normal fever, flu-like symptoms, and my left ankle/right knee ached pretty badly. Starting Monday 05/17, my right knee was unbearably painful. If I moved it at all away from a ~30 degree angle, my entire leg lit up with the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt. Not as bad as if I put pressure on it though, that was even worse. I couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t drive, could barely get out of bed for days. I got through that with over the counter pain killers and Biofreezing the knee like crazy.  Starting Friday 05/21 I believe, my knee pain suddenly went away only to be replaced with pain in my left foot. It&#39;s not nearly as bad as the knee was, but the entire left side is in constant pain made worse with pressure. I can drive now that my right leg works fine, but still can&#39;t walk without some form of assistance. I was reporting all of this in the V-safe health checker, but it apparently doesn&#39;t care outside of 7 days. Tempted to put &#34;permanent damage&#34; for Item 21 as the result, but I&#39;m hoping this goes away soon.

Itching was low in intensity.  The injection site swelled noticeably.  I went to sleep but I woke around 4 AM with an intense headache, nausea, slightly blurred vision, and a fever. Throughout the remaining day my fever got up to 101F.  Other symptoms included muscle ache and fatigue.  The injection site began intermittently pulsating/twitching the evening of 5/20/21.  On Friday morning 5/21 the intermittent twitching spread to my left fingers.   The blurry vision, headache, and nausea gradually went away.  All symptoms were gone by morning of 5/22.  I did not take any medication throughout.

Patient observed having seizure-like contractions of his upper extremities and slight arching of his back while having this loss of consciousness.  LOC lasted less than 10 seconds.  Patient was placed on his side, and when he regained consciousness could answer all questions appropriately and without delay.  Patient was placed in a wheel chair and taken to a private observation area where vital signs could be attained.  Patient again had a LOC while being wheeled in the wheel chair to the private observation area.  Patient was placed on a gurney, supine.  Vital signs taken and patient was found to have a heart rate in the 40s and a blood pressure of 90/66.  Patient was ashen and diaphoretic.  Patient was observed for 30 minutes in the private observation area where his condition improved to normal before leaving the facility.

                                                Started the day great and went and got the 2nd dose of Moderna on 6/12/21 at 940am. I felt fine throughout the day and I started getting a little dizzy and disoriented around 5pm  and as it was explained to me it would be expected to get side effects. Later in the evening around 8pm I started to get extremely dizzy, tired, and having a low grade fever of 100.5F. I Later developed a headache and I had to go lie down for the rest of the night. As I was sleeping throughout the night and waking up multiple times shivering and being extremely cold, I was taking my temperature throughout the night and It would be climbing up from 100.5F and it reached 103.7F. At that point I wanted to get up and take some fever reducer medicines but I was unable to get out of the bed as I was very dizzy and disoriented and I was having extreme muscle and joint pains that I wasnt unable to move at all. I needed to go to the restroom and get a drink and I was unable to do that.  I had considered going to the ER but I waited it out and wouldnt go unless my temperature kept rising. I eventually tried going to the bathroom but at that point I had passed out and woke up in the morning between my bedroom and bathroom. On sunday 6/13 I was continuing to have symptoms and felt extremely ill throughout the day.  I woke up and the fever had gone away but I still had the symptoms mentioned above and also had ringing in my ears. Throughout the day I was trying to do stuff around the house but I was unable to do that and go to work. I would randomly pass out at times either on my desk or just sitting on the couch. That was throughout sunday then on monday I was feeling a lot better almost all symptoms had gone away but I was still a bit dizzy and had body aches and was unable to go to work and do basic stuff around the house. Tuesday I was mostly feeling fine but still felt a bit dizzy and disoriented and extremely fatigued but I was able to go to work. Wednesday I am feeling almost 100% normal but I do get dizzy at times and I am still extremely fatigued.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    In April 2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced VOMITING (vomiting). On an unknown date, the patient experienced BELL&#39;S PALSY (might have what looked like bells palsy on one side of his face) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (second dose appointment was scheduled for 15May2021 which he missed), NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER (neurologic spasm up and down his spine), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (serious rigid back in the middle of his back) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes along his neck/ has swollen lymph nodes). The patient was treated with CANNABIS at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, BELL&#39;S PALSY (might have what looked like bells palsy on one side of his face), PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (second dose appointment was scheduled for 15May2021 which he missed), NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDER (neurologic spasm up and down his spine), MUSCLE RIGIDITY (serious rigid back in the middle of his back) and LYMPHADENOPATHY (swollen lymph nodes along his neck/ has swollen lymph nodes) outcome was unknown and VOMITING (vomiting) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 05-May-2021, Olfactory test: negative (normal) negative but it was 24 hour test.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported. Treatment medication not reported.  This case concerns a 28-year-old male patient who received first dose of mRNA-1273 and missed second dose (missed dose.  The patient experienced additional events after first dose for which based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. vomiting is consistent with known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                Injection arm became very sore at around 1 PM, around four hours after the injection of dose two. Around 6 PM, began noticing overall body soreness and fatigue. A headache began soon after, and remained throughout the night. I barely slept because my arm and shoulder hurt so bad, and I also was sweating and shivering. I woke up many times.   At 8am on 06/24 I woke up with a severe headache and nausea. My injection arm and shoulder was very sore. My body overall ached, joints and muscles. I almost called into work but decided to go.   I took 500mg of acetaminophen at 10:25am.  At 10:30am at work, I was still very sore and noticed I was mildly disoriented. My coworkers commented on my look of fatigue.  Around 1pm, my disorientation and fatigue began to alleviate somewhat, and my headache had resolved by that time.  Currently it is 8:51pm. I worked the whole day at work, though it was difficult with the body aches and exhaustion. I have a mild headache, general fatigue and soreness, and my  injection arm is still very sore.

Pain continued throughout a 2 week period where 3 of those days were bad enough to be bed ridden. Heat rash formed after 2 weeks with red splotchy skin around injection site. Moderate to severe burning sensation in muscle different from initial reaction.  Pain subsided for another week and came back with a now worse burning pain when moving (my) left arm and rash is now currently scaly and dry with continued burning pain up to 6/24/21 one month after injection. Pain has reduced but stinging still continues and rash still present

                                                Two days after the vaccine, on Saturday morning (3/13/2021), I started to feel pain when standing and walking.  The pain was in my shins and ankles.  Throughout the weekend (3/13/2021 - 3/14/2021), the pain increased in severity, and my calves plus ankles began to swell severely.  I remember weighing myself and being around 7 pounds heavier than usual.  On Monday (3/15/2021), I was able to visit my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office for an ad-hoc/emergency appointment.  Dr. diagnosed me with &#34;bilateral feet swelling and ankle pain after he had his COVID vaccine&#34;.  She asked and acknowledged that no other change in behavior or &#34;other specific aggravating or alleviating factors&#34; would have caused this other than the COVID vaccine.  Dr. provided an &#34;AMB REF to Orthopedic Surgeon&#34;, but they were unable to see me until Thursday (3/18/2021).  Therefore, the Dr. said I should go to the Emergency Room in case of blood clotting or DVT.  I followed her advice and went immediately to the suggested ER.  I was admitted to the ER on Monday (3/15/2021) afternoon and remained there through that evening.  They performed Doppler Ultrasound, Urine Analysis (UA), Complete Blood Count (CBC), and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), with &#34;no significant findings&#34;.  DVT and Blood Clotting were ruled out after the extensive tests conducted.  The ER staff told me to elevate my legs as much as possible, and to wear compression socks up to my hips/thighs until the swelling subsided.  The ER staff also stated similarly to the Dr., that they believed this was an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccine.   On Thursday (3/18/2021), I was able to attend my appointment at the Orthopedic Clinic.  They performed &#34;B/L foot XR&#34; (x-rays), with the result of &#34;no fx noted, no degenerative changes, no other structural changes noted.&#34;  Both the attending and the Medical Student assisting said it was likely due to the COVID vaccine.  They encouraged me to continue elevating and wearing compression socks until swelling plus pain subsided.  As suggested, I had a follow-up appointment with my Primary Care Physician&#39;s Office on Tuesday (4/6/2021) with the Dr. &#34;reviewed ER records&#34; and swelling was resolved by this date.  Dr. &#34;advised to continue with the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine&#34;.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

I has been there for 2 days and is becoming less painful and slightly smaller, but is still there currently.

His whole body was in pain as well. His blood pressure was 150/90. On Wednesday, February 22 he slept at his group home apartment and complained on chills, body pain and headache. He cancelled that day his counseling session and work. He called me on Thursday still complaining of body aches and weakness. He stayed in bed till Friday February 5, 2021.  He has been taking pain killers all this time.

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day.

I do not believe it to be threatening to my long-term health in any manner but it does make me worry about taking the next dose that purportedly should be much worse.  I suffered chills the prior night and decided to file this report to help add to the information available.

I asked patient if he felt ok to move to observation area. patient said yes and stood up and walked to observation area. he sat down and I told him I would be right back. I turned around and was walking back into the pharmacy when I heard a loud crash. I turned around and patient was slumped side ways about to fall out of chair. He had fainted or had a seizure (he was very stiff, redness to face, eyes open and fixed). I ran over to him and a pharm tech and I got him to the floor immediately. He regained consciousness within 5-10 seconds after placing him on floor. he asked how long was he out. he stated he had this seizure happen before but never after a vaccine. he said he has had multiple vaccines like hepatitis b and this never happened. he states it happens when he has something done to him that causes intense pain. he said it happened after hurting his ankle or when he hit his hand in a fan. checked his BP-172/100 pulse-65.  paramedics came to check him out. BP still elevated. he walked out with paramedics.

When I went to evaluate the patient he was very warm and was breaking out in sweats. He said his vision was very blurry. The patient lost consciousness and had convulsions/lower extremity rigidity for about 30 seconds to a minute. Patient regained consciousness and did not have any more convulsions. Patient was drenched it sweat but slowly regained color and he said his vision was returning to normal. Patient did not remember losing consciousness. EMS was called during the episode and patient was taken for further evaluation by EMS.

                                                Every night since getting the vaccine around 2:00 or 3:00 AM I am woken up by intense pain and stiffness inside my left elbow joint. The vaccine was administered in my left arm. I cannot go back to sleep until I straighten my arm out and support it with my body by laying on my right side. During the day there is slight tenderness to the elbow joint, but otherwise no pain or symptoms. As of 4/12 it now feels like I have partially torn my Achilles&#39; tendon where it connects to the bottom of my heel in my left foot after trying to lightly stretch it while standing talking to someone in my office. I am fairly active outdoors and consider myself in otherwise good health so these two events post-vaccine seem very odd to me.

No change in color, not warm or cold to touch. Symptoms have persisted and are present on presentation for dose 2. Digit appears swollen over the distal joint but without discoloration, pain, or warmth/cold sensation relative to other digits/hand. Skin intact without obvious signs of infection. Patient states he presented to the Emergency Department (ED) for another complaint on 4/7/2021 and also asked them to evaluate his finger. No additional workup was done besides asking questions related to gout.

                                                on -03/25/21 I Injured my back doing an sitting dumbbell overhead press. The injury occurred while pulling the dumbbell from the ground into an overhead press position.  The injury felt muscular in nature, there was no pain after the first few minutes, I was able to complete my workout without any pain.    03/26/21 - Received Moderna Vaccine first dose  03/27/21 - Worked out again with no pain, avoided aggravating the area just in case.   03/28/21 - Woke up with debilitating back pain, unable to fully stand, dull stabbing pain shooting from lower back into hip and then into knee.   Following week I was unable to stand upright without intense pain, received Celebrex and muscle relaxers which did little to help with pain, Doctor then put me on 1 week of prednisone, an anti-inflammatory steroid which did not appear to do much.  Four hours after starting steroid use I decided to stretch my psoas muscle, despite incredible pain I managed to get it stretched out, I could walk upright with reduced pain afterwards.  For the next week the pain would gradually get better.    04/19/21 At this point pain had subsided to about 10% of pain at its worst point and has gradually gotten better, pain is almost non-existant at this point.  I noticed that my right quadriceps muscle had atrophied in comparison to my left quadricep muscle.  04/22/21  Began self-administered rehabilitation, slight increase of pain during workouts.  Noted that my right quadricep had gotten significantly weaker and had from visual inspection lost about 40% of it&#39;s muscle mass, left leg  feels hard to the touch while flexed, right leg is mushy to the touch while flexed, one month prior I could do squats of 285x8, now my right quadricep could only complete 5 reps of 15lbs on single leg extensions, my left leg could still do 40&#43; reps without failure.

After about 2 -3 minutes the patient began to respond to stimuli and answer questions. 911 had been called at the time of the event and showed up about 10 minutes later and attended to the patient. About 30 minutes from the event occurring the patient walked out with the fire department and it was suggested he went to the Emergency room to be evaluated. EKG was done at the hospital as well as a wellness exam and nothing remarkable was found. The patient has a follow-up June 1st with a neurologist

Within 24 hours of the vaccine my tounge went numb, although I couldn&#39;t taste on my tounge I can in the rest of my mouth. I also started to feel heavy fatigue, headaches and chills. These symptoms continued into the next day (22nd) with the addition of jaw tightness and ear pain. The fatigue and headache went away at the end of the day on the 22nd. When I woke up on the 23rd half my face was numb and I am unable to smile correctly, movement of my eye brows has been impared and the use of my right eyelid, as it is not able to close completely. My tounge is still numb, the persistent use of which causes muscle tightness. Yawns and other large movements of my jaw can cause the muscle under the tounge to freeze up which is painful. went to urgent care as soon as I could and was told this could be a rare side effect but they told me based on my symptoms I have bell palsy. I was prescribed acyclovir, lorazepam, and prednisone.

I?ve also had lingering chest pain that comes and goes and radiates into my arm and back. Enough to take me to the emergency room.  I am otherwise a completely healthy person and have not had issues like this until after the vaccine.

                                                The first day after I received the vaccine I experienced symptoms in guidance with all available resources. I was fatigued, my arm was sore at the sight of injection. I remember sleeping at least 12 hours.  A few days later I began to experience severe intermittent chest pain. The area under my arm was extremely tender, as were the area behind my left knee. The adverse event as stated in the report was a sudden jolt of searing pain on my left side. It lasted only a few moments and felt like it traveled from my left shoulder down to my left thigh and behind my knee. It nearly knocked me off my feet. I remained with a lingering pain in my leg and upper left back until today.  I reached out the pharmacist  who administered the vaccine about the side effects and she advised me to immediately contact my doctor&#39;s office. I visited my doctor&#39;s office yesterday (6/3/21) and he assured me I didn&#39;t have any blood clots. He advised me to use a heating pad for the pain in my leg. He also said that sometimes the lingering side effects from the vaccine may last weeks in rare cases. Those discomforts are finally starting to subside. I had no treatment outside of elevated levels of hydration, taking Tylenol and resting.

                                                Acute localized lower back pain along with localized lower abdominal pain. Difficult to explain sensations, almost like a catch in lower-mid spine, along with abdominal pain in relatively the same area.   Feels like someone kicked me square in the middle of the spine. Possibly kidney pain? Tends to come in intense waves of pain, with a lingering dull ache seperating the more intense spasms.   The abdominal pain reminds me of a bowel obstruction I had a while back, almost like someone has taken a section of my intestines with both hands and is violently stretching it apart. No diahrrea, or constipation - as far as I can tell.  Lying down or propping and supporting the back does nothing to help with the back pain. Neither does any OTC pain relievers such as Acetaminophen or Naproxen, and as a result sleep is very difficult.

                                                I got the 2nd dose on 06/06/2021 and then for a couple days after my heart was pounding and I was just tired. I felt tightening in my chest, intermittent pain in upper back. Periodically this would come in waves. My hands felt like pins and needles kind of flushed over my body. It was mainly hands and feet but I would feel it in my face and sometimes arms and legs. I did go to the ER about a week after 2nd dose (around 06/13/2021). They told me it could&#39;ve been anxiety and stress. They did an EKG, blood work, and x-ray and didn&#39;t find anything abnormal. I did f/u with PCP and I just went last week and explained symptoms there as well and they&#39;re looking into my issues. They told me today I had a high white blood cell count and that my liver has elevated enzymes. They want me to come in the middle of July to do more fasting blood work. No fever, no malaise, but I did feel tired and fatigued and nauseous. I had bad brain fog and my body felt like it wasn&#39;t mine. It was like someone took my brain and put inside someone else&#39;s body. 1 week after 2nd dose I had bad sinus pressure behind eyes like my eyes were going to burst out of skull.

The pain continued to persist and according to him it was a level 10. He did go to the physician&#39;s office to get examined and per patient, MD stated it was bursitis  and it would take time to heal. I did speak with him on 7/12/21 and he mentioned the pain is gradually getting better.

Over the weekend the weakness improved slightly, but has not improved much in the past few days.  I am also still occasionally experiencing the tingling sensation in the same distribution.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

Over the next 5 minutes: heart rate elevated, fast rate of breathing, skin clammy, facial numbness, muscle weakness (arms/hands couldn?t move/grip). Symptoms began subsiding without treatment after 10 minutes. Nurse on-site administered injection of Benadryl in right arm. Continued monitoring breath/heart rate for 5 minutes - all returned to normal. Left without additional treatment.

                                                I have pain in my left shoulder area on and around my deltoid muscle, especially when lifting my arm up (e.g., like when I am trying to put on  a T-shirt). This pain was severe for the first 3 days or so before becoming only moderate/mild pain.  The problem is that it has now been almost exactly TWO MONTHS since I had that injection, and I still have that same mild/moderate pain when lifting my arm.  I am surprised that it has not healed, and so I am reporting it.  I will note, if it matters, that I don&#39;t think they administered this second dose very correctly-- instead of the middle of my deltoid muscle, they placed the injection very high and posterior on my shoulder, almost on the acromion process(I am an RN myself, which is why I feel qualified to talk about proper IM injection technique).

                                                I for my 2nd shot on may 5th 2021 at 5pm. By 1130pm I developed a headache and pushing on my left side neck on the back side (same side I got my shot also) by 1130pm. It turned into a migraine. I took Imitrex 100mg and fell asleep and it went away. At the exact same time last night on 5/6 around 110pm a headache started caused by the same muscle ache on my left back neck. I can push on one spot and the headache gets much worse. I took 50mg Imitrex an hour ago. It&#39;s bow 457am 5/7 and the headache went right away. I&#39;m now having hot flashes and had to take my shirt off. Not sure if it&#39;s the medication or both. This is unusual for me to feel hot when it&#39;s 58F outside and 71F inside. That means something unusual is giving me headache/migraine/muscle pain in neck/hot flashes. My Imitrex never causes hot flashes. Thank you. P. S the first shot had no reaction other then soar arm. Which I have now also.

                                                Reporting primary symptoms: headache, fever, lightheadedness, elevated heart rate, arm soreness, muscle soreness, back pain, nausea, suppressed appetite, anxiety, and panic attacks. (see below for more information) Initially, felt faint and lightheaded. Stood up and the feeling worsened. Within five minutes, felt nauseated and clammy. Also, appeared pale in the face. Was given instructions to sit, close eyes, and take deep breaths. Applied a cool, wet rag to the face and neck as needed. Was anxious and may have had a panic attack triggered by the experience. Heart rate had elevated, but not to a concerning level. Within 30 minutes of initial vaccine administration, face was no longer pale and heart rate was lowering. Other symptoms mostly subsided within 90 minutes of the vaccine administration. The next morning (5/19/21), woke with a mild headache, low grade fever, some fatigue, slight nasal congestion, and very sore arm. Took Tylenol for fever and it was mostly gone by the next day (5/20/21). Felt well enough Saturday (5/22/21) morning for lots of physical activity (push-mowed lawn in humid conditions) and only had a mild headache and mild fatigue afterward. No notable symptoms on Sunday (5/23/21) morning, but had indigestion, gas pain, and some soreness (back muscle) late that night. Stayed up a little later than normal. Woke a few hours early (around 4:30 am) on Monday (5/24/21) with throbbing low-to-mid, left-side back pain and worsened indigestion and gas pain. Had anxiety that led to a panic attack. Did not feel well and tried stretching, taking Tums, deep breathing, used the bathroom, and walked around. This was helpful enough to return to sleep. Woke up again at 8:45 am and had a mild headache, some soreness in neck/shoulders, and anxiety about the situation. Took a shower, did some deep breathing, and tried to relax. Drank some caffeine at noon, but the headache was not relieved. Appetite was somewhat suppressed and was mildly lightheaded. Stomach became more unsettle by night. Stopped all caffeine intake and NSAID usage (and still no intake/usage at the time of this report). At night, anxiety over the situation worsened, so tried deep breathing, talking to others about the situation, and stretching. Panic attack occurred, but was able to manage with the aforementioned techniques. Woke the next day (5/25/21) with mild headache, muscle soreness in mid-to-upper back, shoulders, and neck, suppressed appetite, and anxiety. Was able to manage most symptoms with breathing, stretching, relaxing,  and talking through the situation. No panic attack on 5/25/21. Went to bed earlier than normal (around 9:30 pm) and woke on 5/26/21 around 9:30 am. Had similar symptoms, but appetite was more decreased and worsened anxiety. Decided to see doctor that afternoon (see item 19 for more information on testing from that visit) and was told to give more time to recover from vaccine side effects. Did not give doctor information about anxiety or panic attacks at that time.  Had a panic attack (less severe than previous) Wednesday night and managed with the aforementioned techniques. Thursday (5/27/21) morning woke with no headache and no fever, but still some soreness in neck/shoulder area, suppressed appetite, mild fatigue, and mild anxiety about the situation. No panic attack on 5/27/21. Friday (5/28/21) woke with similar symptoms and decided to visit doctor again about anxiety. Was prescribed Buspar and Zoloft. After taking Buspar (first time ever) at 2:30 pm, experienced an increased heart rate up to 160bpm and a low fever up to 100.2F. Experienced another panic attack during this time. Sought medical assistance from local ER around 3:30 pm. Was seen and monitored until discharge at about 11:45 pm. During stay, tests and levels were mostly normal except during a panic attack that was triggered after blood was drawn. Treated with Vistaril around 11:20 pm and monitored for about 20 minutes before being discharged. Anxiety was relieved after deep breathing and relaxing. Did not take Zoloft. Slept and woke on 5/29/21 with mild headache, unsettled stomach, and mild anxiety. Anxiety is more manageable so far and other symptoms were somewhat improved after eating breakfast. Currently, no plans to continue taking Buspar, but will consult doctor.

                                                I got a muscle ache on the injection site 4-5 hours after the jabbing, and a febrile (97.4), tiredness and headache the next day of it. I took a NSAIDS tablet 3-4 hours after showing up febrile. I almost recovered with a little bit of a headache 2 days later of the injection.

                                                I received it at 10am and around 2am that night I started to have a bad headache and body aches. I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

Then I had severe migraines and throwing up even though I?ve never had migraines before. This lasted about a week. Then I began to develop painful lymph nodes and got shingles, also something that has never happened before. Shingles healing right as I got second shot on March 5th and had same high fever sick reaction as first week of second shot but with diarrhea this time which I did not have the first time.

                                                One week and one day after receiving the Moderna vaccine my left arm, the one the vaccine was injected into, became bright red and warm to the touch. It has also become itchy on one or two occasions.  A large portion of my shoulder/arm has swollen up  over the past day and remained swollen for about 12 hours. There has also been an aching pain in my left arm pit. I have not gone into the Dr. regarding this as the symptoms appear minor and related to the vaccine.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was fine until after a few minutes.  He started to say he felt lightheaded.  He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

                                                A few days after the vaccine my lymph nodes in my upper cervical area high in my neck area swollen which caused me to have a sore throat. A single small ulcerative lesion appeared in the upper soft palate of my mouth so I went to a walk in clinic and had a strep done which was negative. D/t the ulcers appearing in my mouth I had and HIV test done which also came back negative. I had a small low grade fever and muscle aches also associated but the lesion in my mouth is what caused the major concern which slowly resolved over the next few weeks.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

Had body aches the next day and felt light headed. Went bed that evening and slept a good 10 hours. So by Friday felt 90% still some stiffness, but felt good to go. Later in the afternoon and early evening I noticed a rash from the face down to the pelvic emerge. It is gone in the morning.  Hearing from a relative that got the Johnson and Johnson they also got the rash, but no other side effect.

                                                On 4/12/21, nearly a week after my first dose of the vaccine, I experienced intense, sharp pains in the left side of my neck. The pain was intermittent throughout the day and didn&#39;t seem to be triggered or alleviated by any specific action, It coincided with a slightly enlarged, hard lymph node along my left external jugular vein, about two inches below my ear lobe. The pain persisted (intermittently) lasting no longer than one to three seconds each time, or in some cases pulsing on and off for 30 seconds. In total, I counted roughly a dozen of these episodes between 4/12 and 4/13. The lymph node has since decreased in size and no longer hurts.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Down&#39;s syndrome.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 14-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him) (seriousness criterion medically significant), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds). At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinating\talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there/hearing voices of people talking to him), INFECTION (boil type infection near armpit), ABNORMAL BEHAVIOUR (different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done), ANXIETY (anxious, scared), DEPRESSED MOOD (Sad), DELUSION (having delusions), INSOMNIA (not sleeping), EATING DISORDER (taking a long time to eat) and WEIGHT DECREASED (lost 4 pounds) outcome was unknown.            On 01Apr2021, he had a boil type infection near his armpit. She wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment for the doctor until two days after so in the meantime she put hot compresses which helped. The MD prescribed an antibiotic that helped and it went away. Last Thursday, maybe seven or eight days later, her son showed different behavior that was unlike anything he has ever done. He was hallucinating and talking to someone in his room that wasn&#39;t there, he was anxious, sad, scared, and having delusions and hearing voices of people talking to him. He is normally self sufficient but he went from his normal routine and she had to tell him to eat and brush his teeth which he would normally do on his own. He is also not sleeping, taking a long time to eat which is unlike him, and has lost 4 pounds. His second dose (lot# 038B21A) was yesterday 14Apr2021. She is concerned if it is related to the vaccine or the antibiotic.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) solution for injection for Crohn&#39;s disease.    Concurrent medical conditions included Crohn&#39;s disease (moderate to severe).   On 14-Oct-2020, the patient started ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) (Subcutaneous) dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand maul seizure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (vision changes) and NECK PAIN (Feelings of pressure at the back of his neck radiating to right side of his head). At the time of the report, GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand maul seizure) had resolved and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (vision changes) and NECK PAIN (Feelings of pressure at the back of his neck radiating to right side of his head) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient had a seizure three days after his first Moderna Covid vaccine and was hospitalized.  CT scan was negative.  The reporter&#39;s causality for co-suspect drug, adalimumab, was not provided.  Concomitant product use was not provided. No treatment information was provided.  This case concerns an adult male, with PMH of Crohn&#39;s disease, hospitalized with a serious unexpected event of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (grand mal seizure), and nonserious unexpected visual impairment and neck pain. Event onset with unknown latency after first dose mRNA-1273. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an adult male, with PMH of Crohn&#39;s disease, hospitalized with a serious unexpected event of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (grand mal seizure), and nonserious unexpected visual impairment and neck pain.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Vaccine on 05/12/2021 I started having chills. This progressed through the night with a fever reaching 104.2F. After taking 750mg of acetaminophen the fever reduced to around 102F. The fever persisted at 102F accompanied by heavy perspiration for approximately 40 hours with 750mg of acetaminophen being taken every 6 hours. For about 10 more hours the fever stayed around 100F with chills and constant perspiration until dehydration set in. Nausea limited the amount of water that could be consumed ultimately resulting in mild dehydration. After fever broke I continue to have headaches through filling out this form along with sharp pains in my lower left leg on the front of the leg. I also have a lot of pain in the upper right glute as if I had been hit my something quite hard. For about 48 hours while these symptoms occurred I remained in bed and tried to drink water. I spoke with the pharmacist who administered the vaccine today and she advised me to report my symptoms right away and to follow up with my doctor on Tuesday or Wednesday if my symptoms persist.

As I went through the day, I noticed that it started to swell under my arm. As the days went on it got continually worse. On Sunday night, in hopes to get the swelling down used Ice &amp; Heat to try and combat the swelling. It did not work. Today 5/25 the swelling is still there along w pain.

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 31-year-old white male who previously healthy, he works with a maintenance crew, he was in his usual state of health last week, he did receive his 2nd dose of the COVID-19 Moderna vaccine on Thursday.  Over the next 24-48 hours he began experiencing myalgias malaise and fatigue, he self treated with ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed.  He felt a little bit better on Sunday and went to assist in picking up a brush more.  During the process he became  short of breath as well as midsternal chest discomfort. He presented to the ED.    Evaluation found a CRP of 112, elevated troponins and a  leukocytosis of approximately 20,000 along with elevated neutrophils.  His influenza a and influenza B testing have been negative and his SARS COVID the PCR was negative.  Given his elevated troponins, he was started on IV heparin and admitted for further evaluation.   On admission to the floor, he was chest pain free. We were concerned for potential myo/pericarditis given his history and laboratory study findings. Cardiac MRI was performed which suggested active myocarditis with biventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 34%, RVEF 37%). Given his new LV dysfunction he was started on low dose lisinopril and metoprolol succinate.  It is unclear whether this is atypical viral myocarditis or whether it potentially could be vaccine related, the MRI is consistent with that of myocarditis. We did not proceed with cardiac biopsy unless since there was no evidence for clinical decompensation, unstable heart rhythm or other worrisome features. He will plan to follow up with Dr. 1 week post hospitalization with repeat echocardiography and blood work.  If at that time there are any signs of instability we would proceed with more aggressive workup at that time.    Infectious disease was consulted who recommended infectious work up including serology testing for: parvovirus IgG and IgM was positive, Herpes Virus type 6, EBV, CMV (undetected) adenovirus, enterovirus (negative) and HIV (negative) .    He does not have any family history of cardiomyopathy.  There is no family history of sudden cardiac death, he states that his family has been quite healthy from a cardiac standpoint he was previously healthy before this episode.

The license partner had received the report from FDA VAERS.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia) in a 31-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Irritable bowel syndrome. Concomitant products included ALBUMIN HUMAN (ALBUTEIN), CLONAZEPAM and MULTIVITAMINS [VITAMINS NOS] for an unknown indication.   On 05-Feb-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 05-Feb-2021, the patient experienced HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FREQUENT BOWEL MOVEMENTS (Frequent bowel movements), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in extremity), PAIN (Pain), the first episode of CHILLS (Chills), FATIGUE (Fatigue), HEADACHE (Headache) and INJECTION SITE PAIN (Injection site pain). On an unknown date, the patient experienced the second episode of CHILLS (Chills) and MYALGIA (Body aches). At the time of the report, HAEMATOCHEZIA (Haematochezia), FREQUENT BOWEL MOVEMENTS (Frequent bowel movements), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (Pain in extremity), PAIN (Pain), FATIGUE (Fatigue), HEADACHE (Headache) and INJECTION SITE PAIN (Injection site pain) had not resolved and last episode of CHILLS (Chills) and MYALGIA (Body aches) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Additional concomitant medications include Neotironine.  On the day of the vaccination, arm hurt pretty badly. It lasted about 3 days. pretty much had the same symptoms as the first dose: chills, body aches. headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue. It lasted for about 3-4 days. Now, He experienced bloody stools with first dose and it never really resolved before. He got the second dose and noticed increased the frequency, made it a little worse after the second dose. They were not so frequent anymore. Patient still have blood in stool at least 2 times a week.  No treatment information was provided.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  a discrepancy on onset date of PT haematochezia exists in the SD.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below. No Medical History information was reported.    On an unknown date, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced MYOCARDITIS (myocarditis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), CHEST PAIN (chest pain) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and MYALGIA (myalgia). The patient was hospitalized from sometime in 2021 to sometime in 2021 due to CHEST PAIN, DYSPNOEA and MYOCARDITIS. The patient was treated with ACETAMINOPHEN for Adverse event, at a dose of UNK dosage form. At the time of the report, MYOCARDITIS (myocarditis) was resolving and DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath), CHEST PAIN (chest pain), PYREXIA (fever), CHILLS (chills) and MYALGIA (myalgia) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, C-reactive protein: high (High) 14 (Values are expressed as the multiple of the upper limit of normal for each laboratory&#39;s reference range). On an unknown date, Ejection fraction: abnormal (abnormal) 34%, generalized hypokinesis. On an unknown date, Electrocardiogram: normal (normal) normal left ventricular function. On an unknown date, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) Patchy subepicardial and midmyocardial delayed enhancement. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) negative. On an unknown date, Troponin: high (High) Baseline 39.5 (Values are expressed as the multiple of the upper limit of normal for each laboratory&#39;s reference range) and high (High) peak 46 (Values are expressed as the multiple of the upper limit of normal for each laboratory&#39;s reference range).

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna on January 19, 2021. 48 hours later upon waking from sleep patient had myalgias, arthralgia in all distributions, and  a frontal headache. Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EAU. The following day at 3AM I woke up with chills, a mild fever of 100.0, a headache, and back pain.  Towards the end of the day I felt tired, however not sure if that was from the vaccine or because I did not sleep well. Tylenol reduced symptoms and they did not greatly interfere with my day.  The following morning all side effects were gone and I was back to completely normal.

The pain then progressed to the right neck and supraclavicular area. He felt throbbing , sore, numbness as well and &#34;shocks&#34;. Over the next view days the pain was shooting down his triceps and numbness and tingling and then numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers. No muscle weakness and no fever or chills. No systemic symptoms. He complained of the tingling numbness and a sense of swelling--all down the right arm in the c6-7 distribution. On April first his wife noted a vesicular rash on the right side of his neck with a few lesions on the right upper back. He was not responding to NSAIDs, ice or heat, immobilization, so at this point the clinical diagnosis of shingles/varicella zoster was made and Valtrex 1000 mg tid was started.

                                                I was released from quarantine from my Covid-19 infection 5 days prior to getting the first Moderna vaccine in the morning. By the evening, I felt sicker than I ever have in my entire life. I was shaking uncontrollably, had a fever, extreme chills, and a pounding headache and muscle aches. I didn&#39;t sleep that night and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until noon the next day. I am still lethargic today and seemed to have lost my sense of smell.   My Covid-19 symptoms from the 2 weeks prior were extremely mild and the vaccine experience was 1,000x worse. Something isn&#39;t right and I am questioning whether I should get the second shot.

I can typically wrap my hand around my feet easily (i.e., touch my toes).  However, I had leg tightness so strong I could barely make it to my shins.   I went to work. Had chills, malaise,  pain at the injection site, and continued intense leg pain until I took an acetaminophen (500mg) at 2:00 p.m. on April 9.   Hip and butt tightness continued for the rest of April 9 and through part of April 10.   Redness and pain at the injection site continued until April 12.

He is also experiencing numbness and tingling down that arm. The injection site is clearly in the center of the deltoid, and not too high. Today he started experiencing blurred/halo vision, as well as quite a lot of dizziness.  He also said he was experiencing tightness in his jaw. We sent him home from work today. He was going to lay down.

                                                Muscle pain, headache and hard time focusing on daily activities appeared 7 hours after that shot and didn&#39;t go away for nearly 24 hours.  On April 17th, two days after the shot I discovered a large bump (around 4-6 mm) under my skin on my lower neck, on the left side, close to the shoulder. I called a doctor and was advised to observe the bump for a week and schedule an in-person appointment with my doctor if the bump doesn&#39;t go away. The doctor said that it&#39;s most likely a lymph node.

I went back to sleep on and off until getting up at 17h after, at which point I could move the injected arm forward but not backward/outward. At 18h after, I took 1 capsule of Ibuprofen. By 22h after, I had regained full muscle range, with still some pain when moving it backward/outward.

                                                After about 2 hours, I felt a pull in my shoulder which led to excruciating pain throughout my shoulder and arm. I couldn?t sleep, so I contacted a dr online at 6 in the morning. I was able to see my doctor later that day, and she said the vaccine was injection too high (in my shoulder) opposed to in the deltoid muscle. I am now taking oral steroids and have an orthopedic appointment tomorrow.

                                                First shot (on 03/27/2021 at 12:30 PM) resulted in fatigue and pain/soreness at injection site.  Fatigue started within 1 hour of injection but was only on 03/27/2021 and did not return in subsequent days.  Pain/soreness at injection site started within 1 hour of injection but was steadily decreasing until gone on 03/30/2021.  Second shot (on 04/24/2021 at 12:00 PM) resulted in fatigue, pain/soreness at injection site, and moderate flu-like symptoms.  Fatigue started within 1 hour of injection and was gone by 5:00 PM 04/25/2021.  Pain/soreness at injection site started within 1 hour of injection and lasted until 04/28/2021 (steadily decreasing each day since injection).  Flu-like symptoms started in the evening of 04/24/2021 and peaked at 9 AM (wake-up time) on 04/25/2021 until 5 PM 04/25/2021.  Flu-like symptoms included muscle pain, chills, elevated temperature (did not break 100 degrees), headache, fatigue, and general malaise.  These symptoms peaked in intensity around 1PM on 04/25/2021.  1000mg Tylenol taken at 9PM and 3PM seemed to help with symptoms.  Fell asleep at 3:30 PM and woke at 5PM with virtually no feeling of symptoms (other than pain/soreness at injection site).

He showed photos of his arm with a circle around what appeared to be an injection in the front part of the deltoid muscle area. Patient related that he visited FNP (noted in this report) for evaluation within a few days of the shot. Per patient history, he declined imaging or other scans and elected to treat symptomatically using Naproxen.

                                                The evening of Wednesday I began feeling chest pressure/discomfort and slight difficulty breathing. The same on Thursday, but a little worse. Friday morning at 4:30am I awoke from intense pain and pressure in my chest, difficulty breathing, and back/shoulder/neck pain. I went to the ER at 7:30 in the morning. Had tests taken, was given colchicine to help with the pain, and it did help lower the pain level a little bit. By Noon the pain was tolerable enough that I could go home. I was told to take ibuprofen to manage the pain. I took a nap but awoke at 2:30pm, this time with even more intense pain, my back/neck/shoulder muscles convulsing/twitching from pain and from being in a state of involuntary clenching as well as chest pain/pressure and difficulty breathing. I went back to the ER and after several more tests, an ECG gave the doctors cause to worry about the health of my heart (they were concerned I may be having a heart attack or heart failure). They kept me overnight and after taking more blood tests and ECG tests were able to diagnose me with Pericarditis on Saturday morning. I was prescribed colchicine, which I am to take twice a day for three months and ibuprofen to manage the pain.

I had to leave work the following day because it felt like a constant dead arm. It gradually got better of the next week but I lost motion and its alot weaker than it use to be. Please have somebody contact me on this. I will have to go to the doctor before long and id like to talk to you guys first.

                                                Moderna EUA - Patient who is nonverbal and  received his second COVID vaccine today reportedly developed evidence of discomfort by closing his eyes, gritting his teeth and trying to lay down within 15 minutes of his injection.  This had not occurred w/ his first injection on 4/19/2021.   A medical assistant reported seeing distended right neck and right arm veins, and his family member reported seeing urticaria.  Vitals per MA were bp 97/59, pulse 102, pulse ox 96% on room air.  Upon my arrival, there were no visible distended neck or arm veins, and patient was seated comfortably, upright in the backseat of his family member&#39;s vehicle.  There were horizontal linear indentations across his right neck, as though he had been resting his head against the back of his seat, or a seat belt may have been rubbing on it (but seat belt would have been on wrong side).  He was in no respiratory distress.  There were no visible urticaria.  BP was 115/69, pulse 92.  Lungs were clear to auscultation and cardiovascular exam revealed mild tachycardia, regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  He had received 10 mg of Benadryl through his G tube just as I arrived.    I recommended that patient be observed for 15 more minutes and patient went home without further incident, to go to ER if developed respiratory distress.

History notable for Moderna COVID-19 vaccination 4 days prior (that would be 4/27/21) with subsequent development of fever, myalgias, sore throat. Then on 4/30/21 developed acute onset of shortness of breath and chest pain. Seen at ED. Exam and work-up revealed elevated troponin, unremarkable CTA of chest, EKG with diffuse slight ST changes. Patient was subsequently admitted to hospital for possible myocarditis. Per consult - Differential diagnosis includes pericarditis, myocarditis, acute coronary syndrome. Later in the day (~1530), had worsening chest pain and ST elevated noted on EKG. Pt did disclose at that time that he used cocaine about 8 days earlier. Pt transferred to Hospital for treatment of STEMI. Note: covid-19 vaccine info is pt reported, unable to access any Immunization records for this patient. Place where pt received vaccine is also unknown.

(not sure if this was a side effect or just a shock response to foreign matterials entering the body)  localized soreness in arm for a few days. worse second day than first.  chemical taste in mouth resembling isopropyl alcohol for about an hour or so, starting about 30 minutes after recieving vaccine, i assume this was just some of the sterilizing agent entering the body and getting circulated.  mild head fog in the days following the shot, this seems to have mostly gone away and i cant say with certainty if it is a side effect or was caused by some other factor such as stress.  mood disturbance / depression starting the day of the shot, this one might be completely unrelated, I attended a funeral of a family friend on that day which seems a reasonably likely cause for such, im just listing it because I want to be concise with my reporting of what Ive been experiencing.  mild headache behind the temple on the right side of my head, and behind both eyes.  heightened reaction to concrete allergy, not sure what exactly in concrete/cement i am allegric too possible nickel or chromates as pomphlox seems to fit the description, this has been recurrent for years but after recieving the vaccine a ring of hives formed on my left hand and my feet were the most broken out theyve ever been, i worked with cement 1 day after recieving the shot.  a relatively consistent feeling of coldness, since getting the shot ive felt abnormally cold, sometimes feeling the need for wearing a coat in 80&#43; degree weather. this is completely abnormal, typically i could wear a tshirt in 50°F weather and a hooded sweatshirt would suffice down into the 20s.  persistent joint pain in almost every joint of my body and the surrounding muscles, feels like it may be in the cartilidge or connective tissue, occasional pains had been experienced before and considered a normal part of life, but this has been relatively constant like an inflammatory response.  sleep cycle disturbance, normally i had abnormal sleeping habbits where being awake for 24&#43; hours at a time wasnt particularly uncommon (oddly this one seemingly gets worse when i stop drinking caffinated drinks), and it was impossible for me to get to sleep prior to like 2-3 am most nights followed by  sleeping for around 4-10 hours a night on average. however since recieving the shot ive been sleeping a lot more than this and at strange times (for me) like the middle of the afternoon.  fever/constant headache on the side the injection was recieved on has set in after about 2weeks and has been terrible, ive had to take ibuprophen for two days just to function, mild visual hallucinations have also occured in the past couple days mostly spatial distortions where the depth perception isnt working properly, and framerate issues where objects in motion leave a trail momentarily.

I felt like I could barely breathe. My neck was hurting and I kept having to sleep. I&#39;ve been super lethargic, and I get pain whenever I inhale or have to swallow something. It feels either like my lung is full of fluid or being squeezed.

                                                About three or four days after I got the vaccine I just got really extreme pain on my upper back near my shoulder blades and upper neck. It just came out of nowhere and its kind of been ongoing since. I started developing a rash as well.  My doctor had me come in immediately to make sure I didn&#39;t have meningitis. They gave me muscle relaxers and referred me to physical therapy.  It kind of went away but I&#39;ve been dealing with a lot of upper back pain since the vaccine. I&#39;m pretty active and walk about 13,000 steps a day. I wasn&#39;t being very active at all around that time. A couple of days after the vaccine I had sleep paralysis and couldn&#39;t get out of bed. That&#39;s when I developed the back pain around time.

It was more tender and there was moderate to sever pain in the armpit. I took some advil with minimal relief. On the 3rd day (today) the swelling seemed a littlw worse and the pain increased slightly. I contacted my plastic surgeon (since back in October 2019) because i had a procedure called miradry, which elemintes the sweat glands in my bilateral armpits. The doctor advised me to come in immeidately to the office. Upon arrival the doctor examined the area and was able to se immiedalty that is was swollen. I consented to pictures being taken. He is making an entry as well as I am and I was advised to ice the area and to take advil and to remain in contact.

I only historically had gotten a total of 4 flu vaccines. 24 hours after Moderna I had b/l dorsal foot tingling that I didn?t really pay any mind to, then by the next day it spread to L hand (4th-5th digit) overt weakness and paresthesias and a cool/numb feeling to my R thumb. Similar symptoms to L 5th toe and R great toe. As days progressed it got more diffuse and extended up to mid-calf that was very mild... eventually by day 10 it dissipated, thank god.  To add I also experienced L facial dull pain and the distal portion of my tounge felt like I burnt it (lasted 5 -7 days)

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

                                                At approximately &#43;2 hours from time of vaccine, began experiencing severe (immobilizing) RIGHT FRONT rib pain. Pain level 6 of 10. Contacted doctor&#39;s answering service at &#43;24 hours from time of vaccine to inquire about course of action. Ice was recommended. Doctor&#39;s answering service concluded rib pain to be unrelated to vaccine but rather to Cerebral Palsy and/or muscle strain from 10,000 meter indoor rowing event completed -10 hours from time of vaccine. I am very skeptical of this finding since I routinely row 10,000 meters, and average 40,000&#43; meters each week. No prior known incidents of right front rib pain.  Pain history:  &#43;2 hours, 6 of 10  &#43;24 hours, 6 of 10, unable to conduct normal activity, painful to walk/exercise  &#43;36 hours until present, 6 of 10 but decreasing slowly. Still not able to return to normal routines

States redness grew, more muscle pain, more swelling, darker red in color, generalized arm swelling and tingling in hands. No systemic symptoms: fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath: just localized to that area.  - drainage, redness, warmth to touch. Start taking zyrtec twice daily for any allergic reaction.  No need for steroids- swelling improving, declines any other systemic symptoms. Discussed topical- not interested.  Advised if having worsening- red, hot to touch, fever, chills, drainage from site, streaking redness let us know and will start on antibiotics- declines at this time.

After second shot, I developed the usual thing of arm soreness, fever, chills, joint pain and generalized body aches as well as GI symptoms. All symptoms went away in two days except that I have had persistent symptoms of cramping abdominal pain, on/off nausea, bloating. I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

Early in 2020, I was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection. The severity of the symptoms from the vaccine were just as intense as the infection; however, the duration was significantly shorter.

He presented to Emergency department and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy.  The ED was not concerned that he had received the vaccine 4 weeks earlier and dismissed it as a coincidence.     Family and I decided it would be a good idea to report here just in case there is a pattern with other people.

It&#39;s been about five days, and it seems to have gone down / that pain has largely subsided. Additionally, both upper arms feel &#34;heavy&#34; and my hands are weak. It&#39;s not as easy to make a fist. It&#39;s hard to describe, but my arms just feel a little weaker.

Concerned I should have taken longer time between having COVID and getting the vaccine. It was a approximately 3 days from time of being clear of isolation and any symptoms. There was no concern on the consent form of recently having COVID just a concern if you were presently positive.

However, the site of the injection on my left arm has turned red. I would say it is a red circle with a radius of 1.5-inch around the injection location. It is painful when pressed on. Also my left armpit (lymph nod) is swollen and is painful. Hopefully I won&#39;t die :/

It took almost 3 days before I was able to truly use the extremity again.  Ever since I have had loss of strength and sharp pain in the shoulder joint with movement.

                                                I had noticed a minimal pain in my pec, but then a pump or DOMS sensation, almost minimal grade strain, thought nothing of it, just &#34;that&#39;s odd&#34;.  Then last night 3/10/2021 I felt a nerve time pain in my axillary space.  I know nerves can be &#34;funny&#34; at times since understanding pain science and low grade nerve information and still didn&#39;t think that was odd.  Today this morning 3/11/201 during my 545am work out I noticed around 6:15 am my delt (injection site) was very red.  Later it got itchy, and now 8:14pm swollen and starting to get warm, and the redness ring is now twice the size of my morning work out.  Pain is minimal none, just minor sorness (a 1/4th of the after day sorness from shot).  My pec area feels off.

On Day 8, some pain developed in addition. On Day 9, the rash grew in size and was itchy. On Day 10, it was almost cleared up. On Day 11, it appeared gone, On Day 12, the rash *re-appeared* but had grown in size. On Day 13, the rash was even bigger - had spread further down my arm. By Day 14, it had almost disppeared.  On Day 5, I noticed a swollen lymph node near my left clavicle. On Day 6, this lymph node had swelled and now there was pain. I also experienced slight discomfort under my left armpit. The pain associated with the clavicle lymph node lasted until Day 8. As of Day 14, the lymph node is still swollen.

The pain then moved to the middle of my back at the spine and blades of my lower back shoulders. The pain has lasted for a little over a week now and has lessened over time but is still noticeable. If I tried to sneeze or inhale deeply, this was difficult due to the discomfort I felt in my back and the sides of my neck.

                                                I had three symptoms: First, 4 days after the injection, the glands in my armpit were swollen and painful. It was a mild pain that lasted 3 days. Second, 7 days after vaccination, itchy and hot area of hives developed around the injection spot and slowly grew  into a 6 inch circle. Third, at the same time with the second symptom, I am having a mild sciatic pain in my right leg.  Symptom 1 has subsided, and symptoms 2 and 3 are still present, but seem to have slowed down.

                                                Within 20 minutes of receiving shot, I started having warm rushing sensations on left calf. Over the next few days it traveled to my foot and left arm. Also started developing tingling, pins and needles sensations, numbness and weakness in left leg, foot, forearm and hand. Have experienced prolonged periods of time with muscle spasms in left calf sometimes up to 2 days in length.  A combination of all of these symptoms happen daily. Have had muscle fatigue in right arm and neck at different times Have developed a metallic taste in mouth over the last 2 weeks. After the first 5 days developed extreme mental fatigue and grogginess that lasted 7 days and can sometimes reappear.

Pain radiating to testicles.  Entire body aching.  Couldn&#39;t find comfortable position to sit/stand/walk.   Worse than any illness I&#39;ve had, but without the brain fog Within next 48 hours: Armpit swollen on right arm (same as vaccine arm).  Pain in head persisting.  Pain behind ears.  Dizzy/lightheaded feeling. Third Day after vaccine: Armpit is still swollen.  Headache persists.  Ache in muscles and joints seem to be re-emerging.  But, overall, I&#39;m fine and can work today. Note: Pollen count high - and I typically do get headaches from pollen - so, headaches could be attributable to pollen, but timing is suspicious.

                                                Side effects started after 4 minutes of the shot. I started with nausea, followed by shortness of breathe as well as heart pacing at a faster rate. The feeling was uncomfortable, so I stood up to walk around. After 15 seconds, I felt very nauseous as weak. Hey went to sit back down, but felled while trying to sit. I was able to sit back up and started to shake/shiver and sweat heavily. This happen for over 15 minutes, than it felt as it was coming and going.(the side effects) for the next 40 minutes, I felt very weak and stiff in the left arm.  After another 20 minutes, I started to feel better/normal. My arm started to feel less stiff.  Waited another hour and half total before discharged from the clinic.

Symptoms began on 4/6 as dry eye (due to the left eye not blinking properly) with facial paralysis evident on 4/7. This continued to get progressively worse until full left-sided facial paralysis and diagnosis of Bell&#39;s palsy on 4/8. Began a 7-day course of prednisone and valacyclovir on 4/8. The onset of symptoms was accompanied by neck pain for a few days prior. To date, there has been some improvement but not back to normal yet. No prior medical history of Bell&#39;s palsy or any other facial paralysis.

Minor ache on injection site with none of the symptoms below) Rash at injection site: Significant slightly elevated  red rash on triceps and deltoid near injection site that lasted from onset at 2:30 ( 14 hours after injection)  until reporting time  4 day. Minor soreness. Condition improving. Fever/Chills/Loss of Appetite: At 2:30 am (14 hours after injection) heart rate went to above 100 BPM (sometime 110-130&#43;)and started to slowly improve to 80 BPM in the morning 8am -- measured using Amazon halo heart rate sensor. While I did not measure temp until 7PM Friday the next day (101.8) during the 1st night I felt very hot and had chills.  Estimate temperature was 103-104. Difficult to sleep (0-2 hours of sleep first night). At 2pm Friday I thought I had recovered but a few hours later I entered another more mild cycle (80-95 bpm). Was able to sleep. I drank two electrolyte (generic Pedialyte from pharmacy) one after injection and the second the next day and was hydrated the full day. I took 1 generic ibuprofen the night of first symptoms at 2:30 am and a second the following night at 11pm.  Aches: Aches were onset on Saturday morning (day 2) in the back neck muscles.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

                                                Then this past Tuesday (03-23-2021) I went to receive the 2nd Covid-19 Moderna Vaccine at 1:00pm. I felt fine and had no adverse after this vaccination until 8:30pm the same day. At this time I started to have sever  itching and within an hour the itching was over my entire body. It was a mixture of hives and regular pruritus/itching and areas of swelling throughout my body. This lasted all through the night into Wednesday, 03-24-21. Around the same time as the itching started Tuesday night, my Spinal joints, Hip joints, shoulder joints, knee joints, wrist and ankles became severely inflamed and very painful. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst pain, at the highest I was at a 9.    On Wednesday, I went in to my Primary Care for the itching and the pain. My PCP is on vacation this week, so I saw his Colleague. Dr. visibly recognized the redness from the itching all over my body, along with the extreme pain to my joints and gave me a thorough examination. After his examination  he spoke to another physician who stepped in and also gave me an exam. Dr. advised the other Dr. and me of  his initial hesitancy  sending me home, wanting me to be observed overnight at the Hospital. After going to their Emergency Room. They gave me the choice but I truly thought it would go away over the course of the usual 24 hours post Vaccination; I also did not want to be exposed to any virus/sickness I might encounter/pick up in the Hospital due to my lowered immune system because of the rheumatoid arthritis injection Humira I take bi-monthly.. I explained that I was living with my mom, and our residence is 7 minutes from the Hospital, Emergency Room.) I assured both Physicians if it got worse, my mother would take me to the ER. So instead of going to Hospital, they prescribed a Hydrocortisone Cream of  2.5% for the itching, kept me on oral Benadryl and told me to stay hydrated. Also, Dr. said if it wasn?t better and/or worse Thursday(03/25/21)to come back in for re-evaluation. Along with the medications for itching, they prescribed a dose of pain medicine: Tylenol(APAP) #4 - or Acetaminophen with 60mg of Codeine.    Yesterday - Thursday(03-25-2021) I was no better, and had to go back in to the Clinic.  I was seen by Dr., who also believed this reaction to be based on the Humira along with my immune system naturally being lowered due to the AS and RA medication. Dr. examined me, as by yesterday my hands/fingers were hurting as well and itching was not any better. He prescribed Atarax (Hydroxyzine) 50mg Cap to be taken 3 times per day for the awful Pruritis, which has caused me to scratch so badly that I?ve had some bleeding from areas on my body, near the larger joints and spine. And also changed the Tylenol #4 to every 4 hours, basically more often for the pain associated.    Adding the Hydroxyzine for the itch along with the Hydrocortisone, pain medication and time since Tuesday?s final vaccine, has helped a bit. Today, Friday, I am feeling less itchy but still having quite a bit of joint pain, but less than Wednesday or Thursday of this week.  Because of the itching and joint/spine pain I received very little sleep until last evening when I was able to rest and not itch or toss and turn from pain. Hopefully on the mend.

                                                Upon waking up the morning after vaccination (about 15 hours after), I felt tired and the arm I recieved the injection in ached. The tired feeling and ache in my arm continued throughout the entire day. The following day (03/11/2021) I woke up (around 5:00am) with body aches and a headache that intensified until about 2:00pm, when body aches and headache subsided quickly. I felt tired the rest of the day.   03/12/2021 while not diagnosed by a doctor, I also recieved a penile yeast infection after having intercourse with my girlfriend. It cleared up within a week using a 2% miconazole nitrate cream. Not sure if this is related to the vaccine, but a similar thing happened after my second dose (will be reported in an additional report).

This occurred a few min after a warm shower and upon entering bed for sleep. Preceding episode my skin felt sensitive to the touch, to the point it was uncomfortable to use a wash poof during shower. The episode lasted at its highest intensity for 2-3 min, after peak it lasted for 20 min total. I was unable to get up during the peak to grab warm clothing or a blanket. I had no control over my body mobility.

From the moment I got it, it felt like my arm was going to fall off.  I got progressively worse throughout evening and woke up at some point last night with chills.  Definitely broke a fever, but it has come back throughout the day.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

In January 2021, the patient experienced FACIAL DISCOMFORT (facial pressure), TINNITUS (tinnitus) and HEADACHE (headaches). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MENIERE&#39;S DISEASE (Meniere&#39;s Disease) (seriousness criterion medically significant), EAR INFECTION (ear infection) and AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER (Autoimmune response to the vaccine). At the time of the report, MENIERE&#39;S DISEASE (Meniere&#39;s Disease), FACIAL DISCOMFORT (facial pressure), EAR INFECTION (ear infection) and AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER (Autoimmune response to the vaccine) outcome was unknown and TINNITUS (tinnitus) and HEADACHE (headaches) had not resolved.            On unknown date, the patient was given antibiotics for a possible ear infection and the ears, nose and throat (ENT) physician put the patient on prednisone.  On unknown date, the patient was seen by a neurologist for the persistent headaches and tinnitus and was told by the doctor the patient had an autoimmune response to the vaccine that was affected the nerves.  This case concerns a 35-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of Meniere&#39;s disease, and nonserious unexpected autoimmune disorder, tinnitus, ear infection, facial discomfort, and expected headache.

                                                1h after the vaccination, I had the usual arm pain which lasted for a few days and then completely cleared away (next day I also had fever 37.5-38 C, fatigue, and muscle pain).  However, 8 days after the vaccination, on Friday 30th of April 2021, I woke up in pain: my arm was hurting again and this time I could not find a position on how to keep my arm and not feel pain. I eventually fell asleep but the arm pain at injection site persisted for days. Today (5th of May), five days after the second I still feel some discomfort in the shot area which sometimes goes above the pain threshold.   I did read about people having delayed arm pain, especially with the Moderna vaccine, which is a some kind of delayed antibody reaction. But I did not read about people having both just-after-shot pain and delayed pain and I do not know if I should take the second dose while my arm still hurts from the first does (I have my second shot in 2 weeks). Should I wait for no pain? Should I do it in the other arm? Could you please advise?  Probably nothing, but just to mention everything I know: one contributing factor could be that I went to the gym the previous day of receiving the vaccine and worked my shoulders - I was already a bit sore when I got the vaccine.

These lasted until Sunday. Monday I started feeling very tired, very week, and still sore in my arms and a little in my legs. I took aleeve. Tuesday I still felt lingering soreness but no headache. I started feeling anxiety towards the end of my workday. At around 4pm I started to feel my legs quivering as if I had just run several miles and my muscles were week. This gave me anxiety as I was still working and assisting clients. at around 4:15 I started feeling like I was going to break out in hives around my neck area, which does sometimes happen to me. I got home and around 7pm I took a Zyrtec, but by that point hives started forming on my neck and head. I felt my lip start to swell. I woke up at about 3am on Wednesday to find both of my lips swollen and I took a Benadryl and went back to bed. I woke up at about 7am and my eyes were both swollen almost completely shut and my lips were swollen. I could feel itchiness from incoming hives around my neck and shoulders. I took two Benadryl and rested all day. The swelling mostly went down by the end of the day and I continued to nurse the Benadryl. I saw my doctor on the 15th. He advised how to proceed and prepare  with the second dose and referred me to an allergist.

                                                Continuing peripheral neuropathy. On 4/21 I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine in my right arm and within two minutes had a vasovagal reaction?tingling in my underarm, flush feeling face and stiffness and tingling in my upper lips.  That mostly subsided within 30 minutes as the dull arm pain set in.  Over the next 7 days my arm pain intensified some and moved up my shoulder and down my triceps and into my elbow. 4/28 I awoke with numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle finger of my shot (right) arm in addition to the arm pain and neck and shoulder muscle tightness. 5/8 Arm pain and finger numbness still present, I did some yard work that exacerbated the arm pain, and at this point it was the first day I recognized the pain as a specific intense nerve pain from my shoulder, down my triceps, across my forearm and into my pointer and middle fingers. From this point on the nerve pain and finger numbness/tingling persisted and included intermittent cold forearm/fingers. 5/11 Met with my primary physician who diagnosed me with cervical radiculopathy (C7). Prescribed physical therapy, prednisone and flexeril. 5/12 Had a massage w/aroma therapy, cryotherapy, and cupping. Provided some relaxation, but no change in nerve pain or symptoms. 5/14 First day of PT; neck and arms stretches, neck traction and nerve glides 5/17 Completed Medrol dose pack, steroids seemingly had no effect. Flexeril at night helped relax neck and shoulder muscles a bit. 5/20 (Today) Still have numbness and tingling in my pointer and middle fingers with specific nerve pain down my triceps, elbow, across forearm and into my two fingers that intensifies with activity and at night.  Intermittent cold sensation in right hand, underarm inflammation and tenderness, and general weakness of right hand and arm.

Felt like it was over until today, May 24th (9 days from 2nd injection). I woke up at 5 am this morning not feeling well-rested. I felt body aches, exhaustion, coughing, chest was on fire and my fever got up to 102.5F. Acetaminophen took the fever back down to 100F. I still feel drained and have muscle aches with back pain.

                                                I woke up the next morning feeling a general muscle soreness throughout my body.  I was also experiencing mild chills and mild dizziness.  I took a 1000mg dose of acetaminophen and a 400mg dose of ibuprofen about an hour after I got up and rested for several hours.  The symptoms started to dissipate at around 1pm but the soreness slightly persisted throughout the day.  Symptoms were gone the next day.

First noticed apart from expected muscle soreness when lifting a water bottle with opposite are that received shot was difficult and painful in the brachioradialis and surrounding area, top of forearms middle to near elbow. All other associated soreness after shot subsided within 24 to 30 hours. Muscle soreness in these muscle groups have persisted through today and continue to do so. Lifting or moving objects that use these muscles is difficult or painful, and causes fatigue rapidly. Soreness not present prior to second injection, and would have been noticeable.

                                                Around an hour or so after the shot, I had mild face numbness. I noticed this with the first dose as well, but in both cases, it went away. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the onset of a migraine as I get migraines from time to time and I did have headaches/migraines with both doses. Around 12 hours or so after getting the second shot, I had flu-like symptoms (headache, nausea, aches, mild fever). I couldn&#39;t focus and vomited water/stomach bile a couple of times. After around 12 hours of feeling flu-like, I started to feel better and could eat simple food again (Corn Chex, chicken broth). I also had soreness in the arm near the injection site. I can&#39;t remember if I had neck pain or not. After the 12 hours or so of the flu-like symptoms, I quickly recovered. I would have reported this via VAMS, but felt so bad during the first 24 hours after getting the second dose, that I was late to registering my second dose in the VAMS system and the system would not let me retroactively report my symptoms. This is why I am submitting this VAERS report in case that it is helpful.

At first I was just feeling tired but then I started shaking uncontrollably and muscles in my neck and back were spazzing out.  I lost all control of my body and fell over, convulsing for an unknown amount of time.  I apparently foamed and/or drooled all over myself.  I woke out of this effect around 3:30 AM.  This was Friday/Saturday.  Its Monday now.  I still cannot stand straight and cannot create complex thoughts in my mind.  I had a hard time perceiving colors for the first day and a half to two days after the seizure or stroke I suffered.  I still have a migraine that feels like an elephant is sitting inside my skull.  I still cannot perform complicated thoughts nor can I do complicated things with my hands because of a lack of motor skills.  I successfully pulled every muscle in my back and neck and cannot stand upright.  I&#39;m 35 and now need a cane.  Its already been 3 days and things really have not changed.  Won&#39;t catch me lining up for a booster shot.  NO THANK YOU.  I did not seek medical attention because lets face it the healthcare system is a joke I would have needed a ride to a hospital, increasing my odds of getting the virus, to have them hold me as long as they can to stab me and poke me and take samples, give me no results, and a humungo bill.  I will die before I go to a hospital ever again because the amounts of testing I required at the time would have covered back and neck and brain scans of various types and those tests are stupid expensive and 99% of the time I&#39;ve ever got one they said oh I&#39;m sorry we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong go see my friend who is a specialist blah blah blah and its the &#34;doctor-go-round&#34; where you blow all your money on morons that only care about lining their pockets.

                                                After receiving the first dose I went through the typical symptoms that were mentioned.  I had muscle aches, tiredness, and soreness.  That lasted about a day and was back to normal in two days.  On the 5th day after getting my shot I woke up to extreme pain in my left shoulder (dose 1 injection site).  I could pinpoint exactly where the needle must have gone in, because that area was the most painful.  I had full mobility of the shoulder but moving it would increase the pain substantially.  This extreme pain lasted about two weeks.  It took about a month for the constant pain to go away.  I now experience days where I can feel tightness and light pain in the shoulder at the point of injection.  It is nothing serious and usually goes away overnight.  This occurs at least once every few weeks.

                                                I received the vaccine on 6/25 at 10am. By 5pm I had severe body aches and a fever temperature of 100.8. That night I suffered from severe insomnia along with severe shaking, body aches and a 102 degree fever. I took extra strength Tylenol and used cold packs to attempt to reduce my fevers. The symptoms and 102 fever lasted throughout 6/26 at several times I contemplated going to the emergency room since the fever was high. My body aches were so bad and my entire body was tightening up causing extreme muscle and joint soreness. During the early morning hours of 6/27 my fever finally broke and I began sweating profusely. I would sweat and have a hot flash like event occur throughout the day. I also felt very foggy and my energy levels were extremely low. I did not feel better until 6/28. For the record I had already had the covid virus and my last blood work up (approx 3 months prior) from my physician showed high levels of antibodies.

The fever subsided in a day. But, the testicular pain did not go. Particularly, pain in the left side of the groin with a feeling that my left testicle might explode. It is not a constantly strong. There is a dull ache that suddenly becomes strong. It spreads into hip and leg. I was waiting for it to subside. It has not subsided. The pain got severe. I consulted my primary care physician in June. I was very shy to talk about testicle pain. So, I was waiting for it to go  He prescribed antibiotics. Even after the antibiotic course for a week, the pain did not subside. I was then referred to have both ultrasound and X-ray

I noticed itching at the injection site a little more than 72 hours s/p injection with some minor itching. This progressed over the next 20 - 40 minutes to severe itching with large erythematous rash to the the left axillary region, then shoulder,  and chest. Then hives developed pretty aggressively to majority of body including neck, back, inner thighs, and bilateral legs. The next morning I woke up to severe myalgias feeling like I was hit by a truck with soreness this resolved after roughly 24 hrs. Pain worse in buttocks, quadriceps, and sharp left lower mandible pain.  On 01/02 around 7:30 pm took Hydrocorticone 100 mg PO x 1 and 50 mg of diphenhydramine q4h and the allergic reaction resolved over the next several hours.  Still having upper torso itching going on 3 days after allergic reaction and 6 days after injection. Continued diphenhydramine 25 mg twice daily keeps the itching tolerable.

                                                The evening of the vaccine it started with severe fatigue and a sore throat. The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

Two PCR tests were negative for Covid. Muscle pain has not been addressed yet, as I cannot make an appointment until I have been symptom-free for 72 hours.

                                                Just after getting the vaccine had a sore shoulder for 2 days, then after that nothing until 8 days after getting the vaccine.  On the 26th, started feeling slight soreness in joints in muscles kind of like they were locked up, didnt think much of it, thought it was maybe from overdoing a gym workout.  The next day on the 27th, woke up and was feeling chills, along with mostly full body soreness and feeling very lethargic.  I also had a baseball sized red area on the injection site on my shoulder, it was itchy, swollen and felt very firm to the touch especially compared to other shoulder.  I also had hive like red circular welts on my back, butt, and upper legs.  Two of my fingers had spots on them that felt like blisters.  Felt very sore and tired all day.  In the evening I took 50mg benadryl to try and combat the symptoms.  When I woke up the next morning (28th) still had all the same symptoms just felt slightly better overall.  Took 50mg more benadryl and felt pretty tired and lethargic throughout the day.  In the late afternoon I have started feeling more sore again, and have a slight headache.  The hives and red area on my shoulder are still present but not as red.  So far during this time I have not had any issues with my throat and breathing, but my sternum has been super sore, more sore than any other part of my body during this time.  If i take as much air in as I can, it feels sore and hurts as I get to the last 10% of my lung capacity inhaling.

This pain dissipated 48 hours after injection. Pain returned 6 days after injection, on Monday the 8th. Pain was in the lower portion of the left arm and in the calf muscle of left leg. In my opinion, this cannot be explained by any other physical activities.

                                                Strong headache first to develop followed quickly ny full body and muscle aches.  Shortly thereafter a rapidly rising fever accompanied by mild nausea and severe bout of chills.  Loss of appetite, brain fog, poor concentration.  Fever lasted from 9pm rapidly increasing to a highest measured temp (oral) of 102.9F for approximately 12 to 14 hours before gradually decreasing to under 100 roughly 36 hours after onset.  Tylenol did help slightly to control fever but did not seem to lower it.  Did nothing to reduce body aches.  Significant fatigue and soreness lasted approximately 3 days after dosage.

                                                Woke up on Friday morning (3/5) with severe neck pain and vertigo. Tried to walk to bathroom and was falling over to the right side and felt very nauseous. Starting throwing up. Arrived at ER around9:30AM and was diagnosed with vertigo and discharged a few hours later. He slept most of the day but woke up for a few minutes to take medicine on Friday evening and told me his vision was blurry. He went back to sleep and slept until Saturday (3/6) morning around 9:30. He told me his vision was still really blurry so we went back to the ER. They did an MRI and MRA and saw that he had two strokes. The strokes have affected his vision and he still has blurry vision and is not able to see well peripherally.

                                                Initial side effects (24 hours) soreness in upper arm. Within 36 hours I started getting extreme light headed. Within 3 days I started having pins and needle sensation in my right arm, from my shoulder to my finger, mainly my pinky and ring finger. I progressed to my left arm and right leg.  I&#39;ve had back pain since then but not sure if it&#39;s related. The pins an needles I feel every now and then but not as bad. The light headedness has not gone away, I can&#39;t shake it.  I&#39;ve seen my Dr, he put me on an anxiety medication.  My blood work came out good. I started the anxiety meds and started seeing a Therapist , but I don&#39;t really see a difference, it&#39;s nice to see someone but not getting better. I&#39;m coming off the anxiety med because a side effect is light headedness and that&#39;s not helping me much.  I have not got the second dose and do not plan on getting it.

                                                Muscle cramping below sternum into the back around 1:00 AM in 3/20/21. The pain made me restless and never stopped, like a permanent cramp. Attempting a foam roller to stretch my muscle and release some pin to no luck. I considered going to the ER because of the pain not subsiding.   Around 2:30 AM I started throwing up, which lasted off an on for about a hour.   I returned to bed around 3:30 AM with the muscle tightness still happening. Around 4:00 I began having chills and my muscle started to relax. By 5:00 AM I was sleeping. No ongoing effective expect fatigue, and my throat was sore from throwing up.

Saw ENT listed in form and the diagnosed me with the same.  Ringing of the ears are constant and not gone away.

These were localized to one spot in the muscle and not soreness overall.  The pain would pulsate and relax and was maybe a 2-3 out 10 scale.  At worst maybe a 5.  Enough to notice it for sure. This lasted for about a week.  Same pain returned a few days later and similarly went away.  A few days following that,  similar but different pain returned and localized to abdomen and ribcage largely.  From there, the pain continued and was/is present in numerous areas of the body (abdomen, legs, arms, chest, back).  Pain is both muscular in feeling but also feeling &#34;under skin&#34; in some ways.  Pain is better with sleep and increasingly worse during the day.    I have never felt like this before, even with rheumatoid arthritis which has been solely impacting hands.

                                                I believe I experienced multiple symptoms as a result of my vaccine. My experience matches exactly as described in the article.  ON 4/1/21 at approximately 4pm I awoke from a nap experiencing acute vertigo, nausea and headache. I also was experiencing fever and chills. I began treating with excedrine but did not have an effect. The vertigo was very acute, my eyes were skipping and I was unable to walk. Nause was so intense that any attempt to leave my bed resulted in vomiting. I was unable to eat and could barely drink for the first 24 hours. Friday 4/2 at approx 7pm I took a dose of Promethazine which began to help the nausea. Extreme headache/migraine lasted for 3 days. During this time I also experienced extreme neck pain, as well as pain near base of skull, behind my ears, and on my temples. Symptoms were steadily improving each day, so I did not seek medical care during this time. I feel I became fully recovered by 4/18. I just had my second vaccine dose on 4/21 and I am very nervous about experiencing a relapse of symptoms.

Day of shot: moderate lethargy starting four hours after administration, lasting until sleep. Increasing soreness at site of shot starting one hour after. Shot day &#43;1: woke with moderate soreness in joints, heavy muscle soreness, the latter of which lasted the whole day.  Overall feeling of fatigue, and the sensation of riding on an endlessly looping rollercoaster lasted for half the day. In the second half of the day, congested sinuses and light coughing/sneezing began, along with light acid reflux. Shot day &#43;2: Muscle soreness mostly gone, small amount of nausea remaining in the morning. Light fatigue. Frequent coughing in the morning, and heavy acid reflux throughout the day. Shot day &#43;3: Symptoms minimal

                                                3 days after receiving the first shot I started to have pain in the hip joints on both sides. At first I thought it was just sore muscles from golfing but it is still present over a month later. Then on April 14 I woke up and both of my ankles felt extremely sore despite the fact that I haven&#39;t been doing any physical activity due to the hip pain. By April 15 at the end of the day my ankles were both extremely swollen and I was having a hard time getting around. I finally went in on Monday April 19 to Urgent Care as my PCP couldn&#39;t get me in so soon. The doctor there thought it might be cellulitis and prescribed me antibiotics. After taking those for over a week now there has been no improvement. I finally got into my PCP today April 26 and he is scheduling a entire series of lab work to be done. He thinks I have somehow developed vasculitis. He stated that he did not know if that could happen from the vaccine but I had no problems whatsoever and was very active until 3 days after the vaccine shot, so I find it hard to believe that the two things aren&#39;t related somehow.

                                                Sharp chest and shoulder pains (heart attack like symptoms) started on Sunday evening and I went to the emergency room. The emergency room cardiologist did an EKG and echocardiogram and determined there was something abnormal. The cardiologist then did a cardiac catheterization and the diagnosis was pericarditis and myocarditis, which is inflammation of the heart and damage to the muscle. I spent two days in the hospital and upon discharge I was sent home with three different medications that I will have to take for the next couple of months.

                                                After he got the vaccine he called his son and quickly said that he had a headache. Said his back hurted him very badly. Then said he was itching all over his body. Then he said he was itching on his head. Then his opposite side of his arm started hurting him badly. And then he started having black spots forming on his feet. All this is traumatizing his kid. I?m not happy that my son has to worry about his Dad. This sort of traumatizing children should be illegal.  My son never done anything to y?all yet he is getting phone calls traumatizing him about a stupid vaccine everyday.

                                                Patient received his vaccine around 9:30AM. Felt fine in 15 min. observation area. Returned to work and began feeling &#34;tingling and numbness in my legs, pressure in my head, ringing in my ears, my arms got heavy and it was hard to move, I had trouble using the phone so told coworker to get his boss&#34; He stated, &#34;I was slouching in my chair, sliding out of it, and my eyesight was blurry&#34;. Nurse was summoned and laid him flat w/feet elevated. He ate a &#34;few donuts and peanut butter crackers after his shot&#34;. He felt better when lying flat but as soon as he sat up, symptoms returned three times. BP-142/88 initially, then rose to 149/106, Pulse-92 10 min. later. On third attempt to sit up, BP 153/99. Patient says his BP has never been above 128/84 and that he just had his annual physical two weeks prior and it was good. EMTs were called since symptoms kept coming back. BP was 170/100s. Was transported to Hospital. He said they did a &#34;brain test&#34; having him touch his nose w/his finger, slid heels down shins, etc. but no other testing was done.&#34; He was discharged to home around 3PM and was told &#34;he had an anxiety attack&#34;. He said they never really asked him what happened. Later that evening at 9:30PM, symptoms returned and he had to lie down. He had &#34;pressure in his head, ringing in ears, and couldn&#39;t get up.&#34; Wife called EMTs. His vision was blurry. BP 150/110 upon exertion (movement) and 138/103 at rest, Pulse btw 105-110. He refused going back to hospital since they did nothing the 1st time. I spoke with him Monday morning and he had seen his Dr. She put him on a Beta blocker still his BP was still elevated. He still feels &#34;cotton headed, muddled, w/constant ringing in ears.&#34; Did not go to work on Monday. Felt frustrated that ER &#34;blew it off and said it was anxiety, which he said he was not feeling anxious until his symptoms began and would not go away&#34;.

Developed pain 2-3 hours in the right arm (injection site). Today 05/05/2021, woke up around 8am with pain behind my knee in the right leg. I have felt lethargic all day so far.

Around noon that day I had a seizure at work and was rushed to the ER. While at the hospital waiting for a room to open up, I had another seizure. This one was much worse than the first. They had to intubate me and I spent 5 nights in the ICU. Another 3 on the Neurology floor for observation. The seizures caused Rhabdomyolysis which caused damage to my kidneys and significant muscle loss/damage. I wasn&#39;t able to walk at all for 3 days. After that I started to be able to get up out of bed and move around a little more each day.

                                                I have had plenty of vaccines in the past, but this was administered EXTREMELY high up on the shoulder.  The pain in my left shoulder started around 3-5 days after the vaccine. I assumed that I had simply slept on it wrong and did not initially consider that my pain might be vaccine related. I have extreme loss of mobility in my left shoulder and it is extremely painful to move my shoulder in any direction. Pain or mobility are not improving with stretches recommended by physical therapist.

It is unclear if this is actually related to the vaccine but is similar to reports of a &#34;covid rash&#34; that has been reported with Moderna  vaccine (generally thought to be harmless)

Body aches build over the night. Wake up with mild/moderate pain in back, knees, arm. Groggy. Went to work on something with a friend at 10:00 AM (T&#43;24Hrs), but had to return home because....  T&#43;24hr: ....headache growing. Went home and found fever at 102°.  Slight chills, bit mainly just heat without sweating. Fever hit 103.2 at peak. Went through 10lbs ice to keep the fever in check. Headache from T24hr-T36HR feels like a spike through the top of frontal lobe to my left eye.  T&#43;32hr: Headache still intense. Only back pain now. Appetite slowly increasing.  T&#43;48hr (Saturday morning). Back pain persists, but mild. Headache gone. Have a relatively normal day.  T&#43;60hrs (Sat. Afternoon): Back pain increasing. Stop all unnecessary lifting/moving.  T&#43;68hrs (early Sunday morning): Go to ER with the back pain. Absolutely excruciating spasms from top of sacrum - roughly LI/12T. Lower back stiff as wood. Given shot or Toradol, dose/prescription to flexiril. I specifically request this plan because usually takes care of the spasms; basically, get me able to move and the pain/spasms will go away.   NOTE: I have a history of back issues in this area, but I have not had an episode in years and certainly never had an episode that works like this with no relief. From about 2017-2019, I r  T&#43;70-78hrs: Feel normal.  T &#43; 78-88hrs: lower back pain comes back with an absolute vengeance.  T&#43;90hrs (early Monday morning): Return to ER. Back pain worse than Sunday morning. Receive toradol shot and prescription Prednisone. Back pain gone by around 10:30 AM. Decide to take prednisone Tuesday morning as its getting a bit late in the day by the time pharmacy fills the prescription.   T&#43;90hrs: Back pain returns in similar fashion as Sunday afternoon. Still. Barely mobile.   T&#43;96 hours: Wake up with lower back pain similar to Sunday/Monday morning. Took prednisone and flexiril this morning.   Please help me.

Soon after I began having a pulled muscle pain in my chest. I also have a big, hard lump in my chest. The pain has been going on for over a month. Lower back pain comes and goes but chest muscle pain is always there. None of this was happening prior to the vaccine.

By 9 AM the chest pain was so extreme that I had my wife take me to the ER.  Where they said I was having a heart attack. I have been at Hospital in the ICU  since then.

                                                The day after the shot, I had the expected fever. The following day, I began to have hand pain and weakness. This continued and seemed likely to be a flare of Sjogren&#39;s, significantly more severe than any symptoms I had previously experienced. After a couple of weeks, my rheumatologist tried me on a pack of methylprednisolone which helped while I was taking them but symptoms rebounded as soon as I finished the pack. This seems like it is not directly related to the vaccine&#39;s action, but the timing makes me think it prompted my immune system to get carried away even after it finished the response to the vaccine. We are continuing to investigate treatment, but in the meantime, I am having to get help for things requiring gripping and I am limited in my ability to type and thus work, so I am also having to look at speech-to-text programs.

He developed difficulty walking due to joint pains. Received 2nd dose of vaccine on 5/28/21. Came to the ER on 6/4/21 due to persistent hand swelling. Labs sent on that day showed proteinuria for which he was sent to rheumatology (serology done for SLE came back positive) and nephrology. Patient has been diagnosed with systemic lupus eryhtematosus with renal involvement.

                                                After I was vaccinated, I didn&#39;t have any initial symptoms and then about thirty minutes after my right shoulder was throbbing and I felt very dizzy. An EMT that was at the vaccination site checked my BP and pulse and monitored me and suggested I go home and rest. She said not to take Tylenol unless I absolutely needed it. When I got home I felt absolutely tired and exhausted. By 6:00PM I was developing a low grade fever. I went to the ER at 5/29/2021 at 7:00PM. My temp was 101.5 so I went and got checked out at the ER. The diagnosis was elevated procalcitonin and they ordered a number of labs as well. They also said it was a post vaccination reaction. They gave me about a 1,000 MG of Tylenol and a liter of fluids. I was at the ER for about 3 hours. I also had swelling and rash around the injection site, a raised rash which almost looked like a burn to me it was about 3 inches. I felt tired and weak for about a week to so following this. Another thing that started was vertigo and migraines, but I was suspected of having Covid twice so DRs do not know and it is hard to sat what that is in regards to. I may have had Covid in March 2020 and Feb 2021, I was unable to get tested but the first time it lasted about 6 weeks and the second time was more mild.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

                                                Took shot on December 30th, 2020. January 3rd night I went to bed with bumps on the back of my head and itching pretty bad. I woke up sometime during the night and realized my top lip was swollen. When I got up the next morning my head was still itching and my top lip was still swollen.  Monday, January 4th, 2021, I began having? Dime sized? Rep spots come up on my body all over that itched pretty bad.  January 7th, my injection site turned really red and began to swell. I called my primary care physician and he immediately put me on some meds, both prescription and otc. The symptoms subsided January 9th. January 10th, I began to notice red spots began to appear again and itch. I continued the meds prescribed and thought it would go away, it did not and a few more appeared. Thursday, January 14, my left hand between my thumb and pointer finger began to hurt and turn red.  A few hours later the same thing began happening to my right hand. They both began to swell, itch, and turn hot. This lasted all Thursday night and part of Friday morning, and then the swelling, and itching, began moving into both wrist and forearms.  Both wrist and forearms turned red and were swollen mid way up the arm. The swelling subsided Saturday night, January 16th. The morning of Sunday, January 17th, my right foot became very tender and painful to walk.  I removed my sock and had a considerable red rash on the inside and bottom of my arch that was hot to the touch and itching.  A few hours later, a rash developed on the left side of my left foot, but not as painful or large. During this whole time, I have continued to have rashes and bumps appear all over my body, with them coming and going, usually lasting about 2 days.

On Sunday I had the same symptoms but I noticed a sharp pain in my back. By Sunday evening I started to feel pain on right side of back in the middle of my back felt like it was my ribs at first. The pain elevated as the evening went on to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand for too long or sit.

                                                Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine EUA Approximately 3 hours after vaccine, shoulder pain began to develop. Pain became significant, waking me in the middle of the night. The following day, I was unable to lift the arm I received the injection in no higher than about 80 degrees from my side. Pain increased despite taking OTC NSAIDS. By the second morning after vaccine administration, pain had worsened and right arm cannot be raised more than about 60 degrees without significant pain. Contacted PCP office about 12 hours after injection, they recommended NSAID dosages alternating ibuprofen and tylenol, and icing the shoulder. Pain impacts daily life activities, including caring for small children , lifting items that weigh more than a few pounds by the impacted arm, and significant difficulty reaching any object above the level of the shoulder. I have never previously experienced this kind of reaction to any other upper arm injection or vaccination.

At the time of patient&#39;s vaccine (01/19/2021), the patient was unaware of his spouse&#39;s COVID-19 status, as they had little contact with others and thought it was a cold. Patient began having COVID-like symptoms on 01/23/2021: cough, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, muscle/body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patient has had two subsequent negative COVID-19 tests while symptomatic. Because of his symptoms, his spouse&#39;s symptoms and positive COVID status, practitioners have cautioned patient to act as if he has COVID. He is under quarantine orders per Public Health. The concern from the patient, Doctors and Public Health officials has been the patient&#39;s negative status while obviously symptomatic, and if he can pass COVID if he is symptomatic but testing negative. He has another test scheduled for Saturday 1/30/2021.

Neck stiffness and soreness began Thursday evening.  Severe chest pains early Saturday morning (3am).  Taken to urgent care - EKG showed irregularity and high level of troponin. Transported from there to the hospital.  They did angiogram, and diagnosed me with pericarditis. The on call physician believes this was most likely caused by the second dose of the vaccine.

I was unable to speak for a few minutes due to the uncontrolled muscle contractions and was just generally too uncomfortable to move. It was not a seizure, but it was temporarily debilitating. Once I got myself wrapped in a warm blanket, it only took about 10 minutes to pass (and never returned). The rest of the day I did feel generally ill, but the day after I felt completely back to normal.

For about 36 hours, I felt exactly like that after receiving the shot. I?m fine today. I plan to get shot #2. This was NOT an allergy and I?m not even sure it qualifies as a reaction. They were side effects that I was told I might have. I?m reporting I had them.

The following day about 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, I got a pain in my lower back. I have been doing stretching,  heat, massage and OTC pain relievers. The pain in my lower back is serve, I couldn&#39;t really stand up straight. I have had to miss a few days of work. I have talked to a family friend who is a Doctor and he said it should only last for a 1-2.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

Took a couple hours then it started  1-9-21 at about 1130pm got headache. Took two Advil 1-10-21 at 11am got a headache  1-11-21 around 830pm shoulder and arm finally started feeling less pain 1-13-21 headache around 134.  Took Advil 1-14: arm and shoulder still cracking. Got really bad constipation. Forced it out. Hurt like hell. Tore something took 2 senna plus pills  1-15. Morning had thick and super long poop again. Forced it out a lil quicker but tore again or hemorrhoids  or both. Took 2 senna pills. Moved my neck wrong way.  All muscles are super super tight in my neck. Cracked with shoulder.  Now I can?t move my neck to the right   1-16: poop was pretty normal. Came out nice.  Still some in rectum wasn?t ready to expel. Had to use badee three or four times and lots of wiping to get clean.  1-18: right arm hurting again about half as bad. Still very painful when I lift etc.   Neck is a lot better  1-19: arm still hurts.  Can?t lift up without pain. Weak to lift other things pain actually seems to be in my shoulder and cracking a lot.  Not in my arm itself.  By the nighttime the pain became more intense in my shoulder and very difficult to lift it or move it.  Like the first day I got the vaccine.  1-20: shoulder hurts worse than ever.  Worst pain ever even if I keep it still has some pain. Horrible.    Became worse over the day  1-21:  at 330pm had loose bowels.  1-22-21 at 1118am.  Loose bowels again after an initial drop of on bowels.   1-23.  Normal poops.    2-5-21.  Got second dose at 1250am in left arm this time instead of right.  At 215pm still fine. But as I got up slight headache. Arm not hurting yet  247pm started having some pain just at injection site. Later at night around 9 or so I got really tired also felt slightly nauseous  2-6-21 at 1207pm.  Arm is sore but bearable.  Can move it fine.   Doable.  At 1221pm felt nauseous.  Sick to my stomach.  130pm or so was able to eat Mac n cheese.  Had raspberries about a half hour earlier to settle my tummy  2/7 at 122am:  laying in bed.  Got a bad headache since I got up.  Arm pain is minor. So long as I don?t touch it it?s fine.   I am tired.  Worn out. Congested.  Left arm and shoulder starting hurting around 2-15?   Once I started working out. Hurt like hell.  800mg Advil helped some but still hurt.  2-26: shoulder left still hurts and tight.  Did not take Advil.   Tried to stretch it.  Feels a little better at 9pm 2-28-21: slight nausea Again.  Still sore arm on and off.  Dried out.  Tired.  Drinking tons of water 3-3.  Last day I worked out and did cardio.  3-5.  Left arm still hurts a bit at injection site.

                                                This 37 -year-old male patient received the Moderna Covid vaccine on his left deltoid at 17:27 on April 06, 2021. That same evening the patient complained of a slight headache. The patient was treated with acetaminophen 650 mg at 1936.  On April 7, 2021 I spoke the provider to follow-up on this ADR; he confirmed that the reported slight headache had resolved.   On April 7, 2021 the patient continued to report a headache, from a scale from 1-10; 10 being the most he reported: 4 to 6. The patient was treated with acetaminophen 650mg, the patient reported this was partially effective. The patient also reported body aches and chills, his temperatures was checked, and it was 98.6.   During the evening the patient again received acetaminophen 650 mg at 1900 for his headache. On April 9, 2021 I spoke with the provider to follow-up on the patient&#39;s headache, body aches, and fever. The provider stated that on April 08, 2021 the patient continued to complain of a headache, a temperature of 101. He was treated with acetaminophen 650 mg in the morning and evening.  As of this morning the patient is no longer complaining of a headache, body aches nor is he febrile. On April 9, 2021 the patient complained of a headache at 1417 and was treated with acetaminophen 650 mg.   On April 12,2021 I spoke with the provider who stated the patient experienced a headache on the evening of April 11, 2021 requested acetaminophen 650 mg and his headache improved. This morning the patient again experienced a headache today and acetaminophen 650 mg improved his headache.  On April 13, 2021 I spoke with the provider who stated the patient continues to experience headaches and continues to be treated with acetaminophen 650 mg. On April 14, 2021 the patient again requested acetaminophen 650 for a headache at mid-day and at nighttime. On April 15, 2021 I spoke with the provider who stated the patient is no longer requesting acetaminophen for his headache, which was described by the patient as stiff neck muscles. The headache/stiff neck muscles have resolved. All other reported events have resolved.

                                                My left arm was sore about 2-3 hours after the shot. Later that evening, my arm was worse and I could not lift my arm up past my chest. Around about 11:00 p.m., I began to feel chills, aches and pains. I was sluggish, tired and had no energy. The next day when I woke-up around 10:00 a.m., I still had the aches and pains, all the way down to the bottoms of my feet. My body hurt to stand. The aches and pains continued that evening, along with diaherra and chest pains. The pains continued through Saturday and the chest pains got worse. The pain would radiate from my chest to my left arm, to my left shoulder, and into my back between my shoulder blades. Then by 7:00 p.m. or so on Saturday, my chest started to feel better and my aches and pains were not as bad. I was then woken up around 12:00 a.m. or so, on Saturday/Sunday with severe chest pains again with the radiation of pain. This also came along with the aches and pains and diahrrea. This has continued through to today, Monday. I tried to do simple putting my dishes away and loading up my dishwasher, and couldn&#39;t complete the task due to the chest pain and severe aches and pains all over my body. I have tried to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter medications which would include: Advil II, Pepto Bismal, Alka-Seltzer, hot showers, hot baths, luke warm baths, vapor bath soaks and a heating pad.

I also started having pain in my right arm after a few hours, which I expected, but at roughly 2am the night of the injection, my right armpit also started feeling painful. It&#39;s now been 2 days and while most symptoms have abated, my right armpit is still incredibly sore.

                                                Approximately 3- 5 minutes after felt strange mild sensation as if pins and needles was moving throughout my body from the injection site. I also started to breathe differently. Couldn&#39;t tell if my heart rate changed or not.   At about 5 minutes, I started to feel light-headed and nauseous as if I just had blood taken or an IV in my, likely a drop in blood pressure. I was reading a book, put it down on my lap as I couldn&#39;t focus on reading and considering to get help. At that moment, I passed out, hunched over in my chair staring at the floor.   This moment likely lasted for about 1 minute, but felt like 20. I was in a dream like state and at one point had a series of images and/or memories flash by in a sequence. Then, I felt like I was half asleep but couldn&#39;t tell what I was staring at but knew that I had to &#34;wake up&#34;.   Then , I was surrounded by people who helped me up. At this moment I felt very weak and tired and was sweating profusely. My right hand felt very weak.   About 10 minutes later, I started feeling better. I was given water which seemed to help. I would have waves of mild nausea come and go that eventually subsided. I also felt random cramping around my stomach/lower chest area and lower right side rib cage area.   At about 15 -20 minutes felt confident to walk to the bathroom and throughout the store. Eventually, I felt confident to drive safely home.  At the time of writing this (approx 2 hours later), I&#39;m feeling random sensations/feelings of itchyness throughout my body. No sign of hives.

Still had random headaches.  4/18/21-4/20/21-symptoms persisted, stayed home from work Monday and Tuesday.

Increasing discomfort throughout the 23rd, such that I could not twist my torso or reach across my body without acute pain. Currently, severe cramping/spasms of muscle groups left of the spine even without attempted motion. It feels as if someone is punching my left lung from the back. There is, however, no numbness or weakness anywhere, no radiating pain, no lung problems or any other issue. Just constant muscle cramps/spasms. May end up visiting a hospital.

                                                I have been experiencing soreness in my back over the past weekend as if I may have pulled a muscle.   Over the last 48 hours I have developed a rash around my torso in where the soreness is located.  After doing some research, I believe I have a case of shingles.  I scheduled an appointment with my doctor for tomorrow to get checked out and receive treatment.   My rash looks just like pictures of shingles that are on the internet.  I also read that the covid vaccination can trigger shingles in certain recipients.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   Fever fluctuating between 101 and 102 degrees F. These symptoms lasted for approx. 8 hours, between 11:00 PM and 7 AM:  extreme weakness (unable to get out of bed; difficulty rolling over); extreme cold and shivering; profuse sweating; delusions between dreams; inability to sleep; severe muscle pain (every movement hurt, like a wore brush being run across whatever muscle moved).  Anxiety and panic attacks because I did not know that the side-effects could be so severe until talking to others who had similar experiences today. Those who I&#39;ve talked to prior to today had some reactions, but such bad ones. The side effects on the fact sheet are not described in terms that made me think these would be mild. However, mine last night were worse than any other illness I&#39;ve had in my life. Not having the strength to move and at the same time feeling as though I was freezing to death with lying in a puddle of sweat brought on a lot of fear--I felt sure I would not make it through the night, and could not even reach the phone to call anyone, which made it more terrifying.  After 7 AM today, falling asleep during work; sweating and chills; muscles ache and pain; exhaustion after performing simple tasks (making tea, eating cereal, etc.); fever between 100 and 102 degrees, fluctuating throughout day.

Per patient the ER doctor stated that at the covidvax clinic the medical personelle administering the vaccine may have hit a blood vessel in his shoulder where the injection was. Patient explains the bruising is still there but the pain is radiating through the armpit and into his bicep through his elbow. Patient reports that his arm is not swollen and the yellow bruise had faded.  Reports 1/8 that using hot packs and ibuprofen make the pain subside.   1/11 reports arm pain is not getting worse but the pain and discomfort are staying about the same.

                                                Lower Back Spasms just a few hours after vacine was administered.  I went to bed with what I thought was just flu like syptoms like achy muscles.  But this was more then that.  Even laying in bed my back would spasm and almost take my breath away.  That night did not sleep due to the sporadic unpredictable pain when laying in bed.  Describe pain as electic shock or stabbing pain that takes your breath away it&#39;s so intense, but then goes away very quickly.  The next couple of days I was forced to stay immobile due to the pain that was sporadic in nature.  Even when laying down it spasmed.   I could barely walk for a few days.  I started taking NSAIDS to help with the pain and I became more mobile after a few days.  Work has been very difficult and spasms have not gone away even now Im still having problems and am struggling making it through the work day.  I have to lay down flat on my back as soon as I get home from work and take ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  I was absolutely fine healthy and very active person prior to the vaccine.  Just hours after getting vaccine it&#39;s almost like my joints and back were inflamed for some reason.

Note from the attached photo that I was injected high in the deltoid, approximately 1 cm below the acromion process. I&#39;m now approaching 72 hours post vaccination and am still experiencing achiness in my upper left arm and limited ROM. No fever, swelling, redness, bruising or allergic reaction. I have been taking Tylenol 500 mg 2 tabs PRN, which has helped with the pain at night. approximately 1 cm below the acromion process. Patient noted gradually increasing achiness and feeling of heaviness in left arm 4-8 hours post vaccine, was unable to sleep due to pain. On 02/10/21, patient took Tylenol 500 mg 2 tab at 05:00 and 14:00, still had difficulty raising arm. On 02/11/21, patient woke up at 02:00 with 7/10 pain in left shoulder, took Tylenol and was able to fall asleep. Patient went to work but was unable to raise left arm no more than 30 degrees from body and continued to complain of achiness. On 02/12/21, patient woke up at 04:30 with 7/10 pain in left shoulder and took Tylenol 500 mg 2 tab. At 06:20, pain is 0/10 and patient is able to raise arm 90 degrees from body but notes stiffness and heaviness. Patient sent message to primary care provider to determine possible shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (SIRVA), awaiting MD response.

                                                About 12 hours after the 2nd dose was given, I woke up at 2:30am with a severe headache, uncontrollable chills, muscular discomfort, soreness at the injection site, and fatigue.  I took 2 Tylenol, the chills subsided about 15 minutes after they began, and the headache was better about 30 minutes after taking the Tylenol.  I was in and out of sleep on the couch until around 6am, and I took my temperature at that time.  It was 102 degrees.  I took a couple more Tylenol at 7am and contained to take 2 every 4 hours (last dose around 6pm that night).  My temperature reduced gradually, but it was still over 101 degrees around noon.  By 6-7pm my fever was gone and didn&#39;t return.  I called out of work sick, and I fell back asleep in bed from 8am-11:30am.  I woke up with significant muscle pain in my left theigh (I sleep on my left side, but the pain was much more pronounced than usual).  This lasted 3-4 hours.  Overall, less acute muscle soreness lasted the full length of pronounced reactivity (~2:30am to ~6:30pm on 02/09).  Fatigue was evident until a went to bed around 11:30pm and not noted when I woke up at 6:30am on 02/10 for work.  Soreness at the injection site (left arm) gradually decreased over about 3 days following the injection, but it never impaired my ability to engage in everyday tasks.

                                                I had a MVA on December 19 2000. After physical therapy the pain in my neck was down to a 1. Then after the 2nd dose of moderna about 15 hours after injection I woke up Sunday morning (the next day) and I could barely get out of bed from the pain in my neck. I could not move my neck and the pain was radiating down my left arm. The next day (Monday) I was feeling better and had more movement in my neck but still lots of pain. I went to the PA on Monday and got checked out. I still had strength but mobility was very little. I still have the pain and radiation down arm.

                                                At 0100, approximately 12hrs after receiving round two of the series, I started shivering uncontrollably. I would characterize this more as spasms than chills. I experienced steady dull muscle ache with occasional sharp jolts of pain, especially in my extremities. My joints began to ache severely and I was unable to sleep.  I registered a fever of 100.3 (my normal temperature is ~97.5). Additionally, I experienced nausea and a moderate headache. I shivered most of the evening and finally got out of bed at 0700. I immediately noticed that I was lethargic and fatigued. My doctor recommended I take 1000mg Tylenol to address the symptoms. This was effective, but only for two hours. After that my symptoms returned - most notably the fever and uncontrollable shivering. Symptoms appear to be declining at this point, approximately 31 hours after injection.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported by the reporter. Concomitant medications were not provided.  On 11 Jan 2021, seven days prior to the onset of the event, the patient received first of their two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the left arm for prophylaxis of Covid-19 infection.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s left ankle and leg started swelling. Healthcare professional performed an X ray and other analysis on the patient but didn&#39;t find anything. The patient  was treated with prednisone and the symptoms went away but when they stopped treating with prednisone the symptoms came back. Patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing.  Healthcare professional showed his concern as he doesn&#39;t know what was happening to the patient. The patient was advised by his physician not to received the second dose.  Treatment for the events inluded predisone and Ibuprofen.  The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the events.   The events, patient&#39;s left ankle and leg starting swelling, were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This was my second dose of the Moderna vaccine.  I had no reactions other than a slightly sore shoulder after the first dose. After the second it was exactly the same until about 5 days after when I developed an itchy, swollen, hot, rash on my arm around the injection site.  Now on day 2 it has roughly doubled in size, and is incredibly annoying! I am using ice blocks and calamine lotion to try and reduce the itching and heat its giving off.

And small low back pain No more vasovagal But the one I experience and the effect over 10 min after was very stronge

                                                After the fifteen minute observation time. My left hand where my arm was injected became tingling and numb.   Ever since then my arm has been a numb feeling. After the second vaccine both sides of my cheeks get this numb tingling feeling. Like muscle weakness. Both arms now feel week and a numbing twisting feeling. I?ve never had this feeling before and feeling like I can?t grip. The feeling is like the arm was slept on. Or fingers being pulled backwards. The facial problem is quite concerning and happens anytime during the day.

                                                Around 12:30pm on 4/24/2021, I noticed a small knot on my right arm, about 3 inches toward my hand from the injection site. The injection site was in my upper deltoid. The small knot measures about 1&#34; (in the direction of elbow to shoulder) by 2&#34; and the muscle in this area feels tight. The area is also slightly pink, slightly raised, midly itchy, and quite warm to the touch. I was advised that this is a typical event that may occur ~1 week after receiving Moderna vaccine. No medical intervention is planned, provided that the symptoms do not worsen.

I?ve been tested for antibodies twice in the last twelve months, once in June 2020, and once in January 2021; both time positive for at least Igg antibodies. Was re-exposed to the virus in Feb 2021 and had two negative tests a week apart from each other. The first test was 5 days after re-exposure.

                                                I have experienced the common side effects i.e. body aches, fatigue and headaches but on a more severe scale.  My symptomps have surpassed the 48 hour period.  I am still experiencing random muscle aches, which I would describe as moderately uncomfortable.    Headache which goes way with IBP or Tylenol.  On 5/3 and 5/4 I just began to take two doses throughout the day instead of three.  I am still experiencing moderate to severe fatigue.  I am slowly recovering, a little less tired since Saturday 4/30, but am still exhausted.  I have sought no treatments.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 26-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 26-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle) (seriousness criterion medically significant), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement). At the time of the report, SEIZURE (thinks it was a potential seizure), PRESYNCOPE (vasovagal effect from the needle), MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) and FALL (Patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement) was resolving.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications taken by the patient were not provided.  The reporter reported that patient never had any allergic reactions to vaccines or medications before and had no past medical histories for vasovagal reactions. After receiving the vaccine, the patient waited in the pharmacy for 15 minutes - 20 minutes. The patient fell off the bench onto the floor and became rigid and stiff and exhibited some rigid movement. The patient was out of it for 15-30 seconds. The reporter stated that she called 911. The patient came to, his eyes were huge, but he was aware to self and surroundings. The emergency team came, took the patient&#39;s vitals which were stable and stated the patient likely experienced a vasovagal effect from the needle. However, the reporter thinks it was a potential seizure; more than a vasovagal response. Emergency team offered no treatment. The emergency team had encouraged the patient to follow up with a doctor but the patient did not want to make a big scene.  Emergency team offered no treatment for the patient.

                                                I noticed a tingling sensation on my in my left arm that goes goes about mid way from my bicep to my hand.  It is best described as when your hand falls asleep and your getting sensation back, that pins and needle feeling.  When condition first occurred I figured it may have been dry skin as I just got done on 5/23/2021 working heavily in the sun and had a mild sunburn.  I did not even apply skin lotion at this time.  I did not notice anything unusual on 5/24/2021 as I worked hard the day before and my arms were tired.  On 5/25/2021 I noticed it and it still felt like a tired arm but the tingling never left.  While it is not painful or debilitating it&#39;s presence is known and is uncomfortable.    I have held my arm up and performed other tests to rule out stroke.  AT this time I am reporting it and will continue to monitor the situation and alert you if it gets worse or gets better.

                                                On April 1, 2021 the symptoms presented with right shoulder pain. Over the course of several days bilateral paralysis presented in the lower extremities.  On April 6, paralysis occurred in both hands/forearms. Then on April 7, bilateral facial paralysis was noted and was instructed to go to the local ER by PCP. A MRI of the brain and cervical region W/WO Contrast was performed along with spinal tap. On April 8, after a repeat MRI of the brain and cervical region, a diagnoses of Guillan Barre Syndrome was provided. April 8- April 12, 2021 IVIG therapy was administered while staying in the hospital. After the infusions were completed, I was moved to inpatient rehabilitation center on April 13. During my stay in the rehab unit I completed extensive therapy with OT/PT/SP along with neurophysiologist. I was discharged from hospital Rehab unit on April 22, 2021 (am). After discharge I was sent home and advised to continue outpatient therapy. I currently have paralysis in both legs, lower arms/hands, and right side of my face. I have been seeing a neruoopthamologist for my right eye as it can not close and is at risk for going blind. Currently I have not been given any sort of outcomes or time line as to when my condition should improve.

                                                After 14-15 days of the Vaccination, i have started seeing inflammation/Liquid build up/pain on both of my knees and stiffness behind left knee. Visited my primary care physician and he checked &amp; suggested to use the knee cap after doing X-ray. As per discussion with Doctor, x-ray results are normal.  i used the knee cap for a week and swelling is reduced ,and again increased depends on how much i rest or walk. again following week i visited the primary care doctor and he observed the increased swelling on both knees and referred me to rheumatoid arthritis specialist. meanwhile i also insisted my Primary care doctor to do the blood work to check if i have arthritis. Blood work results came as normal.   I went to meet rheumatoid arthritis Doctor on June 14th and he looked into all the data checked my knees etc. He felt all are normal and again asked me to do the blood work to check if i have any other type of Arthritis. Today(06/21/2021) i got back the results from the doctors office saying all are normal. but i am not sure why this started happening to me .   The symptoms are  knee pain/inflammation, All joint(shoulders/ankel) pain - on and off.  mild head ache.  The only pointer i believe is Covid Vaccine is something to do with what i am going through now.  but i don&#39;t know for sure and how to resolve my inflammation issue. Any advise would be greatly appreciated.   I used to play Tennis before the vaccine frequently(3-4 days a week) and post this event i couldnt even walk actively as before as the inflammation increases based on the effort.

                                                Initial minor muscle pain over the night of the shot, with no fever or chills noted.  Delayed onset of consistent heavy headaches starting from the right side base of the skull and radiating forward to the front of the head.  Never had this issue before.  Due to a subsequent minor head injury, XRays and CT Scans have been performed with no indication of clotting or nay neck damage except potential minor arthritis.  However, the headaches do no come from overuse, but from standing, sitting. or driving for more than 4 hours without a break.  I can barely make it through an 8 hour work day without issue of headache or fatigue.  The headaches are daily and significant.  It feels like the muscles on the back of the neck on the injection side become easily inflamed and start the headache.  The only consistent help for headaches comes from steroids, NSAIDS, and laying down on a bed.  Consistent acute fatigue has occurred since the shot, requiring resting when driving home from work.  Headaches and fatigue have not subsided.

EARLY Friday morning around 30 minutes after midnight - I noticed pain on my left shoulder / neck area (tenderness). I began to feel around and found a swollen lymph node at the base of my neck just inside my left collar bone. Seems to be the supraclavical lymphnodes. I also noticed tenderness under my left arm in the arm pit region. I received the injection on the left side.

My body Temperature measurement (using oral and touch thermometer) started  to increase from 99, 100, 101 to 102 F on multiple different occasions. I was able to eat but with minimal appetite.   Before eating I took Theraflu which contains 650 mg Tylenol it didn&#39;t work well. Until evening I took 2 tabs Tylenol 500 mg , slept for 4 hours,  woke up with sweat, feeling better not very weak and my temperature went down to 99 F.   Took another 2 tabs an hour later and woke up in the morning normal but little bit tired (Day#2).  Monday( Day#3) normal not my usual energy, but better than Day #2.

Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

The pain was sharp and stabbing.   Over a period of hours the left hand became weak.  He returned to work on the 19th and struggled with manual tasks with his left hand (he is a dentist). Based on his symptoms of pain followed by limb weakness, the diagnosis of brachial neuritis was clinically suspected by his PCP. On the 20th he received a steroid taper starting with 60mg daily for 4 days, then 40mg for 4 days then 20mg for 4 days and then off.  Within a day of starting steroids, the weakness improved slightly and the pain decreased.  As of January 27th he still uses tylenol for pain and has mild left hand weakness that is residual.

On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

Per patient, immediately after being injected he had severe shoulder pain and since receiving the vaccine he has been unable to use his arm. His arm has been in a sling and he is being denied further medical evaluation. The Nurse who was present suggested he contact his family adding that the doctor injected too high.  He had the second vaccine with no adverse reaction.

                                                Severe middle back pain beginning February 21. Initially thought it was a kidney stone, but a visit to a urologist on February 25, determined it wasn&#39;t a kidney stone. The urologist ordered some blood work and that indicated that I most likely had blood clots. Went to the ER on the 25th and had further tests that determined that I indeed did have blood clots in my lungs.

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

                                                Fever (up to 100 degrees F) on and off x 3 days, severe headache for 4 hours, but the worst was the severe lower thoracic back pain that continues - with shooting sharp pains. Shoulders are achy.  Thoracic back still mildly painful to touch and feels like it is bruised but there is no discoloration, swelling or otherwise notable signs.  Also had abdominal muscle pain that felt like he was being punched in the stomach - still feels like he did a lot of sit ups.  Still having loss of appetite, loss of taste, and general fatigue.  He took Aleve once with relief of headache but no other doses have been taken.

                                                I did not experience any adverse effects to the second shot until 50 or so hours until after the shot. From then on I felt extreme exhaustion, joint pain, and muscle weakness for 9 days. So much so that on day 6 after the shot I reached out to my Doctor and scheduled a Covid PCR Test, which came back negative.  It was not until 11 days after the second shot that I felt back to &#34;normal&#34;   In the past few days I have noticed a scar at the site of injection. I haven&#39;t seen any information on scaring after the second shot.

Pain severity was reduced to 2/10, but pain and discomfort  gradually fade over the day of sedentary work at a computer.  @ 17:30 discomfort was gone and pain in right shoulder was reduced to (1/10).  by 20:00 pain was completely gone.       (Note: I regularly get Influenza vaccines every year, and do not recall ever rgetting a reaction this severe before.  I am now nervous about the second dose, as I have heard it is worse for most people. )

Moving my toes was pain level 4. Walking was pain level 7. Everything that bends hurt. My brother said my joints were warm to the touch.

                                                Around 6:30 pmI began feeling chills and incredibly tired.  I became sore all over and began shaking uncontrollably because of the chills.  I went to sleep around 7pm and woke up 20 minutes laterwith the worst fever I ever had.  I was extremely hot but when I lifted the covers I would immediately get cold.  I got out of bed around 3am because I was very thirsty and completly stuffed up in my head and sinuses.  I used vicks sinex and drank water and tea.  I was very cold when i got out of bed.  I went back to bed and woke up every 30 mins or so very hot and chilly when I lifted the covers.  I finally got out of bed at 6am.  At that point I had sweated through two shirts, my sheets and comforter.  When i got out of bed I was no longer chilly.  I had a mild headache, sinus pressure and soreness throughout my neck and shoulders.  Throughout the day (April 21, 2021) I would get chills and then get hot.  I continued to havce sinus pressure and a mild headache.  I went to bed around 8:30pm and woke up at 3:00am.  when I woke up I had sweated through half my shirt.  At the time of writing (April 22, 2021 @ 6:08am) I feel slight sinus pressure, no headache and get chills and hot from time to time.

The chest tightness would persist after these events for roughly 30 mins. This activity-related chest tightness  continued to occur until the 5th day after the shot.

                                                I began to feel a little dizzy on 03-25.   This light lack of equilibrium steadily grew for the next couple days. I found my limbs had apparently began to lose strength.  breathing became difficult  as if I could only take 1/4 breaths unless I actively forced myself to inhale deeply.  I developed sleep apnea about this time.  Driving became difficult. I was walking and driving as if I was drunk.  When walking, it felt as if I was on a swaying ship. Driving felt like my workvan was in a constant crosswind that I wanted to correct from.  At this point, I stopped driving.  That was on 03-25.  On 03-26 I suddenly developed up-beat nystagmus in my vision that continues to this day, making me functionally blind.  I visited multiple urgent care facilities.  Received full panel blood work, urine tests and a MRI. All tests came out completely normal.   Doctors are baffled. I was given Valium to help with my eyes and that does help a little.  However I&#39;m still unable to see adequately to function without assistance.

Later the next day after he ate a meal he developed severe gut pain, 9 out of 10 in pain range.  This happened everyday for the next 6 days.  He contacted his gastro doctor on 3/29/21 and he was ordered to have blood work, X-rays, and CT.  He had been working w/ both his gastro and PCP to treat his symptoms.  He was prescribed Bactrim, renewed RX for diacylamine 20mg, and omeprazole. Also added proactizime, IV GARD, Gas X and Align.  His doctors believe the vax triggered his chronic conditions to flare up.  He feels some better but he still has pain and bloating after eating with vomiting and diarhea.    He says the pain is now a 4 to 5.  He continues to have to take additional medication daily.  He was told this would take weeks to recover from.

                                                Extreme pain in heels of both feet within 24hr of vaccine injection.  Difficulty walking and standing. Constant pain in both feet during daytime and nighttime.  Particularly acute pain in morning after sleep.  After 1-2 weeks, pain remained in heels of both feet, but also migrated into lower ankles.  Swelling was present from the beginning of the episode, but increased over time.  Pain and swelling abated 3 weeks after first vaccine dose for about a week.  Second vaccine dose occurred 3-29-21 and pain/swelling returned.  Pain in heels was still present at this time, but majority of pain migrated to ankles and achilles regions.  Swelling increased by week 5 to become obvious Edema.  Acupuncture did not help.  Stretching did not help.  Rest and elevating feet did not help.  Magnesium supplement may have helped relieve pain, but I am unsure. Compression sock did not help. Ibuprofen did relieve pain but not swelling.  By week 9, no relief from symptoms.  Podiatrist x-rayed affected areas and found no structural issues, but was concerned with Edema.  Administered steroid dosepack for 6 days.  Symptoms immediately abated.  No symptoms as of today.

After that, I decided to go home and on the way home my neck started to get tight, not stiff, tight. I could still breathe but it was hard to take in a deep breath. I turned around and headed to the Hospital. I stayed in the hospital parking lot for about 30 minutes and the symptoms improved as well as my breathing improved but still felt tight in my neck. I went home started driving with plenty of water and was monitoring my breathing., and put on my machine for at least an hour.

There was some pain, the area was raised and swollen and hot to the touch. For the past couple days, my armpits, groin and breasts were tender also. After I noticed the rash, I checked and my left armpit (injection arm) was considerably more swollen and tender than the right. Took two benadryl and went to sleep. Woke up and the red tenderness was all still there. I took one more benadryl and it has not spread.  Unfortunately it hasn&#39;t gone down much, either.

                                                Starting around 9:00pm with general malaise that developed into severe nausea and joint pain over next two hours. Pain was severe enough to bring tears. Began treating with Tylenol 650mg every 4-6hrs, which seemed to help initially. Starting around 11pm, I had severe chills with uncontrollable tremors lasting next 3-4hrs. Could not stop shaking, could not get warm. Intense joint pain continued. Was able to sleep intermittently from 2-3am, but awoke with return of severe nausea and vertigo/dizziness around 3am, accompanied by profuse sweating and hot flashes. I laid on cold tile floor with ice-pack on head/chest until it passed, about 30min, and nearly called for ambulance. Treated nausea by inhaling vapor from rubbing alcohol and taking a dose of zofran dissolving tab, which seemed to help. Able to sleep 4am-9am May 15th and return to normal diet. Malaise continued throughout 15th, but gradually subsided. Rashes in armpits and hot sweats night of 15th. I appear to be mostly normal as of today, May 17th.

During one trip to bathroom where bladder was drained, felt nauseated and light-headed. Got into position to vomit into toilet, and upon getting up, fainted. Spent the rest of the day with high levels of nausea, soreness, and headaches. At the end of the day, with more ibuprophen and pepto bismol, was able to sit up and interact. Food body would accept without nausea was crackers/toast. At end of the night, left shoulder was swollen and red around injection site, radiating out approximately 4in.

Through the night the aches became severe enough to prevent sleep and I began to experience intense bouts of chills, followed by fever and profuse sweating. These symptoms continued through the day on Sunday 5/16. On Monday 5/17 I felt the symptoms lessening, and on Tuesday I felt better after a full 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep. Wednesday 5/19 I woke up feeling dizzy and disoriented. My limbs were weak and I was feeling body aches again, though not as sever as after the initial shot. I have a fever of 101.1 degrees F and have reached out to my PCP to give me direction on what to do next.

On Sunday I was tired but could function, and by today (Monday), I am fully better.

                                                Patient has no clotting history. He developed body aches, left arm pain, and fevers immediately after immunization, but improved. Two days later on 6/2, he developed left flank pain and fevers.  On 6/4, he was evaluated in the ED, with CT scan showing partially occlusive thrombosis of left renal artery with areas of renal infarction. Cr remained stably at baseline. Initial workup was otherwise notable for WBC 17 and negative infectious workup. He was initiated on therapeutic Lovenox.  On 6/5, CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed to evaluate for other clots. Left renal artery was complete thromboses with evolving foci of renal infarction. No other clots were detected. He continued to have fevers. By 6/8, his leukocytosis, fever, and flank pain resolved.  Renal ultrasound with doppler showed restoration of some flow in the left renal artery. He is to be discharged 6/9 on Lovenox 1mg/kg BID without patient Hematology follow-up.  His coagulability workup was notable for positive LAC, FVII deficiency, and PET/CT without evidence of occult malignancy.

I was not able to lift the same amount of weight nor stay on a cardio machine as I once did (I exercise daily).  It never improved.

I lost a significant amount of weight as well (I was questioned at work about it).  I have no family history of diabetes and I have always been lean and fit.  I went to the doctor on 2/27/21 because symptoms became overwhelming.

Arm where injection was also itches a little from time to time, but not as much as it did the day after getting the Vaccine.
