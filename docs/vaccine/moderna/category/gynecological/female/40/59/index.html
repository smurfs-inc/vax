                                                On January 4 at 2:00 pm I suddenly started to bleed from the nose from the left nostril and then from both. The event lasted more than 35 minutes so I had to go to the ER. The diagnosis was Epistaxis. I was discharged because at the time of the medical evaluation I removed a large clot from my mouth and the bleeding stopped.  Appointment with primary physician for diagnosis and appointment with ENT was ordered. On January 5 at 4:15 am I had another episode of nasal bleeding lasting 25 min. After removing a clot through the mouth, the bleeding stopped. At 4:00 pm I presented Epistaxis again so I had to return to the Emergency Room. I was reevaluated and the instruction was to visit the ENT and Afrin prescription for three days and Claritin D q 12 hrs PRN. From January 6 to 9, I began to eliminate a serous-bloody vaginal discharge. That began with the elimination of a clot and progressively diminished day by day.  January 11, 2021, the ENT evaluated me and indicated that it did not observe polyps or anatomical problems. I had not previously prolonged nosebleeds. Previously two minor episodes happened to me, a year ago that resolved in less than 7 minutes. I didn&#39;t have a cold or any other symptoms.  I want to raise the flag because it was a strange event that occurred after the vaccination and that I had not experienced before in that way.My next dose is January 29, 2021. I am awaiting clot test results

Cycle lasted about  8 days, versus my normal 4 days.  These symptoms concern me due to several reports of miscarriages while receiving vaccine.

Change in mensural cycle. This is not good, i hope this side effect is temporary and the vaccination will not play with our hormonal system. Very sacred to go for the second shot.

Just hours later I had chills and a fever and body aches. After taking tylenol I was able to fall asleep again.  I woke up around 2:30 to use the restroom and notice blood when I wiped. The bleeding was minimum throughout the day but since last night 5/6-5/7 it became heavy. Since having the mirena inserted my periods have been very light normally brownish in color,  this is the first time I have seen it heavy and bright red again.

                                                March 26th, 2021 I received the Moderna vaccine. After the Moderna vaccine, my arm felt very sore.  I was dizzy and tired.   On March 29,2021 I got a heavy menstrual cycle. It was the heaviest on March 31-April 2.  (March 14th, 2021 I put in a new nuva ring, I should not have gotten my period)  On March 29th, 20201 I went to the chiropractor. My lower back was hurting and I felt awful.    On April 8th I woke up to bloody blisters in my mouth. The right side kept bleeding and wouldn?t clot.  On April 9th,  I developed inflamed blood vessels all throughout my body from my head to my feet called purpura and petechiae. I called doctor immediately because bruises and red dots were spreading quickly. He sent to me immediately to get labs drawn at the hospital.  My platelets were critically low and I was told to head to the ER. From there I was admitted.  On April 9th, 2021, my blood platelets were 2,000. They are supposed to be 150,000-450,000  Prior to the vaccine,  a full  physical with labs were done by physician on March 22.  My platelets were 210,000. Everything in my labs were perfect.   Currently I am battling kidney stones. I had surgery on May 10th. I?ve never had a kidney stone in my life.

Headache went away by 11am but I felt a great deal of fatigue and just wanted to lay down the rest of the day.  Jan 15- woke up and felt better.  By noon I was feeling very fatigued again.  Jan 16 - 20 - fatigued, weak, and brain fogged. Slept a lot.  Jan 14-20 - had spotting which never happens.  I was on day 10 of my cycle on Jan 14.  Today is Jan 21 and I?m feeling better after taking a monolaurin supplement that treats chronic fatigue.

                                                My second dose was on 1/25/21 .  One day after my 3/4 of my upper arm  into my  axillary area became red, swollen, warm to touch, tender to touch, firm and itchy.  My axillary lymph nodes were also swollen and tender to touch.     My first vaccine was on 12/23/20. Several days after a small area around the injection site became swollen and itchy.  I also had a small palpable lump under my skin at the injection and my skin had a small area of hyper pigmentation for ~2 weeks. Again the area was much smaller and I did not think it would be considered an &#34;Adverse&#34; effect. I was also unaware that I was several weeks pregnant at the time of my first vaccine. when I went to the doctors office on 1/23/21 I was told I was 7.5 weeks pregnant, there was no heartbeat and I had miscarried.

                                                A large area around my injection site was red, swollen, warm to touch, firm and itchy covering 3/4 of my upper arm into my underarm and lymph nodes.      I received my first vaccine on 12/23/20 several days after injection the site became very itchy, red and swollen but in a much smaller area and persisted for several days leaving a small area of skin hyper pigmented for ~2 weeks. However  I did not think it was considered an &#34;Adverse&#34; event and would have not reported it if the second dose was to a similar scale.  Also, when I received first vaccine I did not know I was pregnant at the time.   When I went to the doctor on 1/23/21 I was told I was 7.5 weeks pregnant, but there was no heart beat and  I had miscarried.  Being that I am over the age of 40 and a high risk for pregnancy and miscarriage  I am unsure if my miscarriage is directly related to the vaccine but I felt it should add it to the report.   My first vaccine was administered on 12/23/20 @ 5:30pm at Hospital

                                                Within minutes after the vaccine I noticed my arm swollen and my fingers started swelling as well. It was moderate swelling though. the injection site swollen up and it was hard for me to breathe as well. Not sure if it was the shot itself or if I was just nervous, anxious about receiving the shot. I received the 1st dose on 01/13/21 and I was supposed to receive the second one on 02/10/21 and because I had a flare up on my face, my face swollen up around 01/21 - 01/24, and I found out that I had the infection on my gums and had to get the teeth extracted. It seems that after receiving the vaccine my overall health that is not at the best just got worse. I could not stand for a long period of time, it aggravated things that were already going on with my system.  It affected my uterus, I already have bleeding issues but now I have very heavy periods since the vaccine. And they are lasting longer. I also had a lot of pain at the injection site and also a severe headache.  I also am now battling 2 different kinds of yeast infection that are resistant to the meds given to me.

Had started menstrual cycle on March 17, but post vaccine it was lighter than normal and then on the 22nd it became very heavy and there were lots of large blood clots. This has lasted an additional three days. My cycle usually lasts 5-7 days but day 2/3 are the heaviest and it?s usually very light by day 6/7. I have not had blood clots in several years. These are very large.

                                                It began with severe diarrhea and arm soreness, then came the extreme chills &amp; fever (101F) and the worst body ache of my life. Then my arm and armpit and back and breast on the left side began to swell and swell and swell until I couldn&#39;t keep my my arm down because it hurts my armpit but I also could not lift is because of the pain my shoulder and armpit and breast are all very swollen and red and hot. The fever and swelling are now working it&#39;s way down my torso and hip and leg and foot all on the left side. On Wed 4/21 I went to  Urgent Care and was tested for uti or kidney infection the result had blood in urine but as I am menstruating it was inconclusive. I had been give Ciprofloxacin to take Monday evening by a tele doc. Urgent Care ordered Prednisone 20mg 2 pills daily but the swelling keeps spreading. I have also been breaking out in sweats even just walking to the bathroom and am experiencing tiredness and severe loss of appetite and have lost 4 pound since 4/20 despite the swelling.

Much better now  on day 5 but continuing to experience intense, sudden  headaches and fasciculations in injection arm, particularly around the elbow.

My menstrual period started  earlier than expected this month (LMP 2/1/21, vaccine 2/7/21 and menstrual period 2/22/21) I am always regular - never early or late and wonder if this is a side effect of the vaccine.

                                                On March 3, 2021 the day I received the shot I did experience light-headedness and headache within 15 minutes.  However, over the course of the week I felt back pain on my left side.  Also by my left breast felt swollen.  Those symptoms eased up.  On March 10, 2021 a week later exactly at the injection site it started to swell and itch.  It was accompanied with pain and tingling.  It concerned me to the point that I went to my general practitioner in the morning on 03/12/2020.  He sated to take Tylenol and Benadryl and no steroids which will decrease the immune system.  He also said to follow up with the numbers on the card I received from the vaccine site.

                                                Extreme pain in joints/body aches developed approximately 12 hours after dose with front/side headache similar to migraine pain level with nausea; treated with Nyquil Cough at 3:40 am, Tylenol-650 mg at 7:30 am, and both at 3:30 pm on 3/11. On 3/12, body pain/aches gone, but left with migraine type headache and fatigue. Treated with Tylenol-650 mg on 3/12 at 7:30 am.  Fatigue continued until at least 10 pm 3/12 but gone on 3/13.   Main reason for report: I had an ablation performed and tubal ligation in December 2018 with no break through bleeding at any time since. On Day 28 after first Moderna dose, there was noticeable cramping in low abdomen not experienced since ablation. On Day 32 from first dose-- the same day as the second Moderna dose, there was cramping again in low abdomen and menstrual fluid appearing in urine- more red in color. On Day 33 post-first dose and Day 1 post-second Moderna dose, there was more break-through menstrual fluid- very dark in color typical of prior &#34;end of period&#34; fluid with similar odor, with continued cramping.  This continued, but lessoned on Day 2 post-second vaccine. I understand there can be failed ablations, but the timing seemed worth noting for you in case there is any pattern with impacts on menstruation.

Today (5 days later) my arm is not as swollen, or hot but still itches and is a bit red. I still have pain on my neck and left breast.

My neddle was normal and was not discharge or  I suspect a probable breast cancer and perform a mammogram like previus BIRADS 2 findings.   Inflamation decrease and desapear within the next week. It was normal at the time of the second dose.  This event was repeated 48 hours after receiving the second dose.

                                                Fevers, unable to move arm, chills, nausea, fatigue, migraine.  I had my menstrual cycle over 1  1/2 week ago.  This week no menstrual cycle.  Started bleeding vaginal today in the midst of the adverse symptoms. I got scared. Called my dr no literature about bleeding . Just one study of  women reported menstrual bleeding after shot.  Is this a side affect and will this affects me long term

                                                I had severe acid reflux and heart pain and searing shoulder pain near my neck for two months. The neck pain has mostly gone away as well as the reflux and mostly the heart pain. My period last have been spot on regular bleeding for 5-7 days like clockwork every 28-30 days  for years and immediately after the second shot I have almost had zero period. I had a day of bleeding in March, then nothing, a day of bleeding in April, then  very minor spotting for two weeks now.  It?s most definitely related to the shot and not peri menopause since I was so regular up until that second shot.

                                                Started my regular scheduled monthly period on Saturday following vaccination.  I had stronger than normal cramping for 3 days following.  My periods normally last 3-4 with a day or two of normal flow.  I am on my 5th day of menstruating&#39;s and my bleeding is extremely heavy.  I have also had clotting larger than a dime sometimes much larger than a quarter.  I have never experienced a period like this.  I have not been checked for uterine fibroids or anything else as this is the first month this has happened.  I cannot say for sure that this is related to the vaccine but did feel I should report it since it is abnormal for me.

I am not in menopause and I am on the birth control pill so my period comes like clock work.  After the first dose of the vaccine I did have a little spotting for a day or two.  I know one other person that is experiencing the same thing.  She is also same age as me .  Something is not right.

That night I took Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg and Advil 660mg that night. The next day, my arm was very swollen, even more than it was with the 1st dose. My body ached and I felt so weak. Because of that, I took more Tylenol along with the Bendadryl I was already taken. The 3rd day, my lymph node was swollen and my left breast was tender. I called the NP at clinic and she told me to get checked for COVID, which was negative. On the 4th day, my arm was still swollen and I was nauseous. The next few days were the same and then nothing remarkable. Still having the pain on my right side. The rash is still bright red at times, otherwise it&#39;s normal.

                                                On same day (Saturday) as vaccine I got covid arm. Site around area was hard and as big around as an orange. Very itchy. Very sore. Rash from site down to wrist of left arm which is the arm I got shot in. Had all symptoms thru Tuesday. On the following Saturday one week later, all symptoms returned. Only this time the hard knot wasn?t as big. Maybe the size of a golf ball. Had symptoms till around tues or wed.  Site area continues to flare up, itchy rashy, fever like, maybe once a week. It?s Monday before I get my second dose Saturday coming up and it was hot and rashy for a few hours today.   Also, my whole life I?ve never had a period longer than 4 days and never have worn pads during my period only panty liners. Never had a heavy period. This month I started my period on 4/11/21 and for the first 5 or 6 days it was lite as usual but longer than normal. And a dark red. It?s now 4/19/21 and the last couple days it?s been very very heavy and bright red. With today 4/19 being the heaviest so far. There?s been no break in it. I?m now on day 8 and it?s heavier than it?s ever been my whole life. I?ve had a normal regular period since I was 15. I have no children by choice if that helps somehow.  I have not gone to the dr for any of these side effects.

                                                I had a bilateral mastectomy on 1/28/2021 after being diagnosed with breast cancer on the L side. A sentinal node was removed as well. I have tissue expanders as placeholders. I had the shot on the left side. The day after I had very bad headache but following day, the whole left breast was red, swollen and the nodes all around the breast were swollen. The breast was also hot to the touch. This morning nodes aren&#39;t swollen. Breast is less red and looks a bit bruised, still a little hot to the touch.

Nine days after the period ended, another menstruation period began on April 2. The bleeding is VERY heavy. Very unusual as I?m in perimenopause.

On the evening of 2/3/21,approximately 6pm,  lower lip began to swell. The lip swelling subsided by next morning on 2/4/21. I alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen from the evening of 2/1/21- 2/3/21.

                                                My menstrual cycle came early the day after my first shot and did the same thing after the second shot. The very next day. The first time it happened I thought I had counted my days wrong but after the second vaccine I knew it wasn?t due for another week. My period in March was a longer cycle and had no real flow just heavy spotting for more days.  It struck me so that I thought it should be reported.

                                                The patient was seen in my office on 1/19/21 with complaint of heavy vaginal bleeding.  A CBC was obtained which revealed an H/H of 12.2/36.1 and a platelet count of 1 (not 1K, but 1 platelet!) and this was confirmed on smear review.  She was immediately sent to the Hospital ED and repeat CBC confirmed the critically low platelet count.  She is currently hospitalized and she has received platelet transfusions but her platelet count is still critically low.  She is also receiving steroids and immunoglobulin and is under the care of MD (Heme/Onc)

                                                My first symptoms were expected-- sore arm and slightly tired feeling -- a few days later my shoulder itched where I got the shot. Then a week later, two things-- and one is PMS. Obviously not the shot but I mention this as it is possible that these side effects are related to the PMS. On Sunday 1/3/2021 I was experiencing breast tenderness PMS and that extended under my arms and by the end of that day my glands were swollen and hard in my right armpit. The next morning, they were still hard and swollen and the glands are still today. While I often have breast tenderness, I have never had swollen glands or painful underarms as part of this. Also yesterday 1/4 my right shoulder near where I received the vaccine was i was itchy and it continues to be and red and also hard there... I don&#39;t want to overplay any of these symptoms and they might well relate to PMS but I think in this instance particularly with the very painful swollen glands on the right underarm it&#39;s important to report them

And, was diagnosed with breast cancer in October of 2019, surgery in February 2020, followed by 5 weeks of radiation therapy. The type of breast cancer I had was due to hormones, so any hormones in my body could potentially cause a recurrence of the cancer.

Five days after the shot, I felt a painful, pea-sized lump in my armpit, on the side that I received the injection. It hurt every time I moved my arm. Six days after the shot, my arm got very itchy, hot, and red at the injection site. The rash lasted 2 days. Ten days after the vaccine, my menstrual cycle was to start. On day 1, I had stabbing, debilitating pelvic pain and abdominal cramps, acute nausea, and felt feverish for a day. This is not normal for me. Then I experienced alarmingly heavy flow of bright red blood for 4 days. The blood gushed constantly. More forceful than a miscarriage. I may not have connected this to the vaccine, but my husband noted that the vccine was the only change from last month to this. And then I later read that other women had reported similar symptoms. I cannot stress how worrying and terrifying this experience was. If it is at all vaccine-related, it would help women tremendously to know this could be a side effect, so they don&#39;t panic about their health.

On 3/15/2020 during routine mammogram/sonogram enlarged lymph nodes under left are were observed during sonogram, as well as an indeterminate area in left breast, which will be re-checked during a follow up sonogram . Testing center did inquire regarding when I had received shot and in which arm.  On 3/20/2021 began to experience sore breast, and on 3/25/2021 began to experience a mid-cycle menstrual cycle or vaginal bleeding event that is still occurring as of date of this report 3/29/2021. Date of my previous menstrual cycle began 3/12/2021 and ended 3/17/202.   It should be noted, this is completely unusual, I have only ever experienced menstrual cycles that have a regular  schedule between 24-32 days between cycles and the nature of this bleeding was different than usual.

My heavy bleeding consisted of emptying a 50 ml mentual cup every 1/2 hour to every hour for two-three days after onset. I became extremely amemic and could not get out of bed. Increasing my Aygestin dose to the maximum recommended dosage daily has stopped the excessive bleeding.

After talking to others that have had the vaccine, several have had breakthrough bleeding a couple days after the vaccine and thought nothing of it, but people aren&#39;t reporting because they think its just them. I think it should be reported, and maybe some investigation  follow up as to why this may have occurred.

Redness was gone in about three days and the soreness was gone after two weeks. The second dose was given 1/27/21.

These symptoms were expected and my temperature was normal after taking a shower and drinking some water.  The chills persisted and I checked my temp a few times to make sure I didn&#39;t have a temperature.

                                                *Please note, on the day of the vaccine (January 14th)  about 7pm I experienced severe body pain, cold clammy sweat, nausea, dizzy, and sleepiness.  I THOUGHT I was having a blood sugar issue, but that was not the case.  I went to sleep for about two hours, then woke up about 9pm feeling a little better.  I had NO pain in my arm or anywhere else and slept the entire night.    Friday (1/22), I developed pain and swelling in my breast, armpit, and injection site.  I literally  felt crappy all weekend.  Weird...????  I was confused this happened about ONE WEEK AFTER the vaccine. The injection site was the size of a golf ball, hard, and  quite warm.  I began to feel better after about 3 days, but the arm was still slightly red, sore, and there&#39;s a slight bump.
