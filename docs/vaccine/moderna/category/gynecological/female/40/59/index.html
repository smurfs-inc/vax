                                                On January 4 at 2:00 pm I suddenly started to bleed from the nose from the left nostril and then from both. The event lasted more than 35 minutes so I had to go to the ER. The diagnosis was Epistaxis. I was discharged because at the time of the medical evaluation I removed a large clot from my mouth and the bleeding stopped.  Appointment with primary physician for diagnosis and appointment with ENT was ordered. On January 5 at 4:15 am I had another episode of nasal bleeding lasting 25 min. After removing a clot through the mouth, the bleeding stopped. At 4:00 pm I presented Epistaxis again so I had to return to the Emergency Room. I was reevaluated and the instruction was to visit the ENT and Afrin prescription for three days and Claritin D q 12 hrs PRN. From January 6 to 9, I began to eliminate a serous-bloody vaginal discharge. That began with the elimination of a clot and progressively diminished day by day.  January 11, 2021, the ENT evaluated me and indicated that it did not observe polyps or anatomical problems. I had not previously prolonged nosebleeds. Previously two minor episodes happened to me, a year ago that resolved in less than 7 minutes. I didn&#39;t have a cold or any other symptoms.  I want to raise the flag because it was a strange event that occurred after the vaccination and that I had not experienced before in that way.My next dose is January 29, 2021. I am awaiting clot test results

Cycle lasted about  8 days, versus my normal 4 days.  These symptoms concern me due to several reports of miscarriages while receiving vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I believe the shot triggered a Lupus flare-up (beginning the evening of 3/30--date of the injection, and on-going). I developed bruising on my thighs, developed petechiae on my legs (common to my flare-ups), and was spotting (bleeding).  One week later, I am still very achy and lethargic. Also put me in a very depressed state. I have &#34;mild Lupus&#34; and typically only have a mild flare-up 3 or 4 times a year (and not lasting this long), so I am confident the injection triggered it. The bruising and spotting are new to me and not Lupus related, so those are of special concern.

                                                I have always had relatively heavy periods due to my diagnosis of VonWillebrand&#39;s disease.  Four days after receiving the vaccine, my cycle came on early and I had heavier bleeding than I have ever experienced with large clots.  The bleeding slowed down, but lasted for an entire month.   My cycle then returned to normal.  It seemed very coincidental that this happened immediately following the vaccine, and was not normal for me at all.  I recently read similar stories of other women reporting this, so while at the time it was concerning, I did not report it.  I am a firm believer in science and thought this was possibly just a fluke, but felt that after reading many stories of women having a similar experience, that the responsible action is to report this, to ensure that all of the data is being studied, since the vaccine is so new.  That being said, I only had mild side effects from the vaccine, and I am very grateful that I was able to receive the vaccine, as I have known quite a few people that have died from COVID.  This bleeding for me was not dangerous at any time, and while I was a bit faint, the bleeding during the course of the month did slow down and this all resolved.  Therefore, I would still get the vaccine again.  I should note that after my second vaccine, I had a few days of spotting outside of my cycle, which resolved as well.  I have had no issues since.

I was able to take ibuprofen to resolve the pain and did not need further medical attention. Pain resolved by the next morning.

                                                Bleeding. I had my period from 4/25-5/3. Cycle ended early morning on 5/3. After getting the 2nd covid shot I went to bed with a sore arm and headache. Just hours later I had chills and a fever and body aches. After taking tylenol I was able to fall asleep again.  I woke up around 2:30 to use the restroom and notice blood when I wiped. The bleeding was minimum throughout the day but since last night 5/6-5/7 it became heavy. Since having the mirena inserted my periods have been very light normally brownish in color,  this is the first time I have seen it heavy and bright red again.

                                                March 26th, 2021 I received the Moderna vaccine. After the Moderna vaccine, my arm felt very sore.  I was dizzy and tired.   On March 29,2021 I got a heavy menstrual cycle. It was the heaviest on March 31-April 2.  (March 14th, 2021 I put in a new nuva ring, I should not have gotten my period)  On March 29th, 20201 I went to the chiropractor. My lower back was hurting and I felt awful.    On April 8th I woke up to bloody blisters in my mouth. The right side kept bleeding and wouldn?t clot.  On April 9th,  I developed inflamed blood vessels all throughout my body from my head to my feet called purpura and petechiae. I called doctor immediately because bruises and red dots were spreading quickly. He sent to me immediately to get labs drawn at the hospital.  My platelets were critically low and I was told to head to the ER. From there I was admitted.  On April 9th, 2021, my blood platelets were 2,000. They are supposed to be 150,000-450,000  Prior to the vaccine,  a full  physical with labs were done by physician on March 22.  My platelets were 210,000. Everything in my labs were perfect.   Currently I am battling kidney stones. I had surgery on May 10th. I?ve never had a kidney stone in my life.

                                                The same night of the injection, I experienced shortness of breath and I had to concentrate on my breathing in order to breath. That right short hurt. A day or two this continued. After the next few days I was fine. The following week, I noticed under my right breast and right arm, I had limited moving and a lot of swelling. That arm from the deltoid down also was red and swollen. I contacted my doctor a week after my vaccination. My doctor recommended not getting the second dose due to how it affected my breathing more so than anything. There is still some swelling under my right armpit where my lymph node is but it is not anywhere as bad as it was, and my doctor is not concerned.

                                                After the 1st vaccine, a week later I started my cycle. I thought it was normal. I bled for approximately 5 days, which is normal for me. Less than a week later, I was having weird, long, stringy clots. It reminded me of an abruption since the blood was burgundy in color. It was 3 days, but it still required a tampon. Then a week and 3 days later, I started bleeding again, but that time was for 8 days. At that point, that&#39;s when I called my OB and reported it on my V-safe. I didn&#39;t have the usual premenstrual symptoms. They did a pregnancy test, an ultrasound, lab work and a speculum pap exam, which including swabbing. The tests revealed nothing, so they told me that I&#39;m getting old and maybe I&#39;m just changing. After that, it didn&#39;t happen again and I&#39;ve had my normal cycle since then.  With exception of a sore arm, I didn&#39;t have any other side effects from the vaccine.

                                                I have a very regular 28 day cycle. After the 2nd COVID vaccine my period started (approximately 48 hours later), but I was not schedule to start for another 2 weeks. Not only did I start early, but the blood loss is excessive and will not stop. I used a Diva cup that measures by ounce. I typically lose 1.5 ounces every 3 hour or 12 ounces of blood per day /24 hour period. When my doctor prescribed birth control the bleeding stopped for approximately 2 weeks and then started again. The newest pack of birth control has not stopped the bleeding. I am now so lathargic I am only awake 3 to 4 hours per day unable to work.

Headache went away by 11am but I felt a great deal of fatigue and just wanted to lay down the rest of the day.  Jan 15- woke up and felt better.  By noon I was feeling very fatigued again.  Jan 16 - 20 - fatigued, weak, and brain fogged. Slept a lot.  Jan 14-20 - had spotting which never happens.  I was on day 10 of my cycle on Jan 14.  Today is Jan 21 and I?m feeling better after taking a monolaurin supplement that treats chronic fatigue.

                                                A large area around my injection site was red, swollen, warm to touch, firm and itchy covering 3/4 of my upper arm into my underarm and lymph nodes.      I received my first vaccine on 12/23/20 several days after injection the site became very itchy, red and swollen but in a much smaller area and persisted for several days leaving a small area of skin hyper pigmented for ~2 weeks. However  I did not think it was considered an &#34;Adverse&#34; event and would have not reported it if the second dose was to a similar scale.  Also, when I received first vaccine I did not know I was pregnant at the time.   When I went to the doctor on 1/23/21 I was told I was 7.5 weeks pregnant, but there was no heart beat and  I had miscarried.  Being that I am over the age of 40 and a high risk for pregnancy and miscarriage  I am unsure if my miscarriage is directly related to the vaccine but I felt it should add it to the report.   My first vaccine was administered on 12/23/20 @ 5:30pm at Hospital

                                                My second dose was on 1/25/21 .  One day after my 3/4 of my upper arm  into my  axillary area became red, swollen, warm to touch, tender to touch, firm and itchy.  My axillary lymph nodes were also swollen and tender to touch.     My first vaccine was on 12/23/20. Several days after a small area around the injection site became swollen and itchy.  I also had a small palpable lump under my skin at the injection and my skin had a small area of hyper pigmentation for ~2 weeks. Again the area was much smaller and I did not think it would be considered an &#34;Adverse&#34; effect. I was also unaware that I was several weeks pregnant at the time of my first vaccine. when I went to the doctors office on 1/23/21 I was told I was 7.5 weeks pregnant, there was no heartbeat and I had miscarried.

                                                Within minutes after the vaccine I noticed my arm swollen and my fingers started swelling as well. It was moderate swelling though. the injection site swollen up and it was hard for me to breathe as well. Not sure if it was the shot itself or if I was just nervous, anxious about receiving the shot. I received the 1st dose on 01/13/21 and I was supposed to receive the second one on 02/10/21 and because I had a flare up on my face, my face swollen up around 01/21 - 01/24, and I found out that I had the infection on my gums and had to get the teeth extracted. It seems that after receiving the vaccine my overall health that is not at the best just got worse. I could not stand for a long period of time, it aggravated things that were already going on with my system.  It affected my uterus, I already have bleeding issues but now I have very heavy periods since the vaccine. And they are lasting longer. I also had a lot of pain at the injection site and also a severe headache.  I also am now battling 2 different kinds of yeast infection that are resistant to the meds given to me.

                                                Early and irregular menstrual cycle.  After receiving the 2nd moderna  vaccine my menstrual cycle was almost 2 weeks early, it was also very heavy flow with  lots of blood clots, and was very painful. Every period I have had since receiving the COVID vaccine has been uncomfortable and abnormal for me. Before I had a clockwork period that would start every 28th day, flow was heaviest on day 1 and 2(never more than 3 Menstrual cups full) and then tapered off on day 3 and 4 and no cramps.  My periods( hemorrhaging, clots and cramps) are much longer than 4-5 days per-vaccine, they are now lasting  up to 2 weeks.

                                                I am experiencing VERY, VERY heavy menstrual bleeding and cramping. My period came 9 days early which is also HIGHLY unusual. My cycle is so regular that you could set your watch by it. I do not experience cramping or this heavy of a blood flow EVER. I am 41 years old, I have had my period since I was 10, so I know my body and my cycle pretty well by now. This is not normal and after consulting  my gynecologist, we feel this is not something that is &#34;wrong&#34; with me, but a side effect from the vaccine.

                                                Adverse effects after 1st dose: Nothing happened until exactly 24-hours later. Then the next day, from 3:00pm to 11:00pm: bad chills, body aches, no headaches though, tiredness, low energy, feverish. Took 2 sets of 2 tylenols. After 11pm, everything cleared.  Adverse effects after 2nd dose: BAD!!! Injection was at 2pm, reactions started by 4pm. All of the effects from the 1st dose but almost doubled in intensity and lasted 2-3 days: feverish, tiredness, unable to move body, body aches, muscle aches, headaches. Unable to work during those days!!!   Then additional effects: VERY heavy, torrential period! 1st day of period was Tuesday, May 18, one day late.   Then: Herpes outbreak on the anus (first outbreak in a long time).    WORSE EVENT YET: Around May 18, my ear was itching. I naturally have ear fungus that has been easily treated over the years. But this one did not go away.  I tried to apply the cream, clean. Nothing. By Thursday, I felt an inflammation. By Friday afternoon, I could not hear much from the left year and the right year was starting to be itchy too. Went to a Urgent Care, the RNP prescribed a drop and told me to take Ibuprofen if needed. By 10pm that night, I was in excruating pain: fever, chills, body aches, muscle aches, the ear pain gotten really bad (never experienced this level before), unable to chew, gotten really cold (needed 5 blankets). Long night. By morning, I went to the walk-in clinic of my healthcare provider - VERY sick. The ear has gotten worse and the NP explained that the body was probably unable to fight the small infection in the year because body was still under the virus effect. With my science background, I am afraid that she&#39;s right and/or that the Moderna covid vaccine has suppressed my natural immune system!!! I had a really strong immune system prior to the vaccine, records will prove it. Got sent to ER. They never took me seriously when I said that this is ALL related to the vaccine!!! Got a CT Scan, luckily the infection did not make it to the brain. They prescribed an antiobiotics and let me go. Now, ear pain moved to the right. I can&#39;t hear.

My period after was extremely painful, worse than normal.  I went to the doctor since I had an appointment and I told her about my situation. After the second dose I was getting a hematoma on my right thigh about 3-4 inches in diameter and hot to the touch.

Had started menstrual cycle on March 17, but post vaccine it was lighter than normal and then on the 22nd it became very heavy and there were lots of large blood clots. This has lasted an additional three days. My cycle usually lasts 5-7 days but day 2/3 are the heaviest and it?s usually very light by day 6/7. I have not had blood clots in several years. These are very large.

                                                Changes to menstrual cycle. Due around March 10 and started 2 weeks late, heavier than normal, unusual breast tenderness. Actually was researching ?recanalization? of husband?s vasectomy in May 2020 thinking I could be pregnant prior to starting menstruation. Just read an article that some women are reporting menstrual changes after getting vaccinated and I did for sure but never thought it could be related.

                                                I had an unusual menstrual cycle beginning March 24. I just started another cycle a few days ago, which is far earlier than normal (about 20 days difference vs. my normal 28 days). Further, this is a far more painful period with cramping, a lot of blood, quite a bit of acne and very tender breasts. The vaccine is the only X factor.   I did have other side effects from the second dose, though they all seem to be what was listed ? chills, extreme fatigue and headache.

Left side jaw and teeth pain began one week after shot and has not subsided after 3 weeks. Also, left side headaches. Pain is moving around and dentist felt it was related to the nerve and not a dental issue. This is still ongoing.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine I returned home to work. I started having stomach cramps like my cycle was starting. The cramps became worse and I started spotting. I took two ibuprofen but they provided no relief. I became nauseas and had a headache as well. I felt better the next day except my arm aches and mild stomach cramps. The cramps have continued still.

I received a Benadryl from the nurse on standby at the vaccination site and it seemed to resolve later that evening. Two days later on Sunday evening I began to get Menstrual cramps. At first I didn&#39;t think anything of it as I thought I was just ovulating because I had just had my menstrual cycle ending on April 5. The next day, Monday during the day I begin to get severe cramping and a feeling of nausea because the pain was so severe into Monday night and Continuing Tuesday Into the night.  Wednesday morning was more of the same and the pain seemed to lessen a bit by Wednesday evening.   The amount of blood was definitely more than a ?normal? For me.

                                                It began with severe diarrhea and arm soreness, then came the extreme chills &amp; fever (101F) and the worst body ache of my life. Then my arm and armpit and back and breast on the left side began to swell and swell and swell until I couldn&#39;t keep my my arm down because it hurts my armpit but I also could not lift is because of the pain my shoulder and armpit and breast are all very swollen and red and hot. The fever and swelling are now working it&#39;s way down my torso and hip and leg and foot all on the left side. On Wed 4/21 I went to  Urgent Care and was tested for uti or kidney infection the result had blood in urine but as I am menstruating it was inconclusive. I had been give Ciprofloxacin to take Monday evening by a tele doc. Urgent Care ordered Prednisone 20mg 2 pills daily but the swelling keeps spreading. I have also been breaking out in sweats even just walking to the bathroom and am experiencing tiredness and severe loss of appetite and have lost 4 pound since 4/20 despite the swelling.

                                                My menstrual cycle changed drastically, temporarily, right around my vaccines. I am extremely regular with a normal cycle length of 26 or 27 days. I had my hormones checked less than a year prior to the vaccines as part of a routine exam and was told not to expect any age-related changes anytime soon. The cycle I was in when I received my first dose (12/30/20) was extended by about 3 days - not groundbreaking, but noticeable to me. Then following my second dose (1/27/21), I completely missed a period. So the 2 cycles during which I had my vaccines were 30 days and 53 days long instead of my usual 26-27. Now, a couple months later, I have returned to my usual schedule.  It was unsettling for my cycle to be affected and at first it didn&#39;t occur to me that it could have been related to the vaccine, but the timing was exactly aligned so it seems very likely it was causal.

She was taken off her birth control meds due to TIA&#39;s she experienced a few weeks earlier, according to the patient encounter.

On day 3 after HIS shot, I had body aches, chills and malaise. When my period came (on time, 11 days after his shot), it&#39;s the heaviest it&#39;s ever been, even after each of my 4 births. It&#39;s an extremely heavy flow with lots of cervical fluid and tissue, as well as large clots. I&#39;ve used the sympto-thermal method of birth control (checking temperature, cervical fluid, cervical position every day) for 18 years, and this is absolutely abnormal for me.

My menstrual period started  earlier than expected this month (LMP 2/1/21, vaccine 2/7/21 and menstrual period 2/22/21) I am always regular - never early or late and wonder if this is a side effect of the vaccine.

However, over the course of the week I felt back pain on my left side.  Also by my left breast felt swollen.  Those symptoms eased up.  On March 10, 2021 a week later exactly at the injection site it started to swell and itch.  It was accompanied with pain and tingling.  It concerned me to the point that I went to my general practitioner in the morning on 03/12/2020.  He sated to take Tylenol and Benadryl and no steroids which will decrease the immune system.  He also said to follow up with the numbers on the card I received from the vaccine site.

                                                Extreme pain in joints/body aches developed approximately 12 hours after dose with front/side headache similar to migraine pain level with nausea; treated with Nyquil Cough at 3:40 am, Tylenol-650 mg at 7:30 am, and both at 3:30 pm on 3/11. On 3/12, body pain/aches gone, but left with migraine type headache and fatigue. Treated with Tylenol-650 mg on 3/12 at 7:30 am.  Fatigue continued until at least 10 pm 3/12 but gone on 3/13.   Main reason for report: I had an ablation performed and tubal ligation in December 2018 with no break through bleeding at any time since. On Day 28 after first Moderna dose, there was noticeable cramping in low abdomen not experienced since ablation. On Day 32 from first dose-- the same day as the second Moderna dose, there was cramping again in low abdomen and menstrual fluid appearing in urine- more red in color. On Day 33 post-first dose and Day 1 post-second Moderna dose, there was more break-through menstrual fluid- very dark in color typical of prior &#34;end of period&#34; fluid with similar odor, with continued cramping.  This continued, but lessoned on Day 2 post-second vaccine. I understand there can be failed ablations, but the timing seemed worth noting for you in case there is any pattern with impacts on menstruation.

                                                Sore arm at injection site, extreme fatigue, sudden onset uncontrolable menstrual bleeding &amp; blood clots, felt faint &amp; had some blurred vision.  Heavy bleeding &amp; heavy clotting continued until next morning (I have not had any issues with my cycle since my surgery last year so this was not normal).  Woke up with fever of 100.7 Saturday morning at 4:57am; fever did not go away until Saturday 8:45pm.  Had flu-like symptoms, fatigue, fever, chills, intense all over muscle soreness.  Felt better &amp; symptoms were gone by Tuesday 03/02/2021.  Menstrual cycles went back to normal following month after 2nd vaccine.

I had a menstrual cycle begin December 30, 2020 ending January 5th 2021 and lasting 7 days; another one beginning January 29th 2021 ending February 4th 2021 lasting 7 days. a cycle began March 13th and ended March18th 2021 lasting 6 days and my current cycle beginning April 2nd and continuing through today - and as of right now lasting 11 days. My cycles are typically heavy the first few days then light the rest. This cycle was extremely heavy the first few days, and varying between medium and light the rest of the days.

I have read several articles stating this as a side effect of the J&amp;J vaccine but not Moderna.  Just thought it should be noted as other female friends I know have noted changes in their cycles after receiving same vaccine.

Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccination I began passing large clots and my flow went from regular to heavy. I do have heavy cycles from time to time but found the abrupt change in cycle interesting. Other than being sore in the arm and tired I feel fine.

                                                Approximately 36 hours after injection, patient started spotting menstrual blood. Patient?s cycle is extremely regular, starting  on day 28 or 29 every cycle. This spotting is chalky blood and not like her normal cycle. It also began on day 21 of her cycle. It is 7 days early. This is not a common occurrence for this patient. It is important to look at this side effect of the vaccine.

March 2021 extremely heavy period causing me to miss a day of normal activity. Low iron levels now anemic.  Night sweats cause  me to wake up, change sheets and pjs every night. Anxiety and mood swings. Confusion and at times I cannot recall words. Temperature remains under 97°F. Chills, aches, joint paint, pale and dry skin despite drinking water. Recently a large hemorrhoid has appeared requiring me to see doctor. My finger and toes are painful and red and it feels as if my vascular system is ?off?.  Hence, the hemorrhoid. I have been out of work for 5 days and cannot stop sleeping.  I have almost gone to the ER just to get peace of mind with what is wrong with me. I get out of breath quickly. I?m starting to feel very frustrated with physical pain and am becoming very weepy.

The following day, these symptoms all resolved, but I felt what I can only explain as &#34;manic&#34; - very high energy, poor ability to concentrate, people around me that day commented that I was &#34;very talkative.&#34;  This lasted for about 12-18 hours. One week after the vaccine, I experienced an irregular menstrual period - very light, on and off spotting for several days. No treatment was sought for any of these symptoms.

                                                The night after the shot I developed COVID arm which burned and itched and swelled up. The next night a rash spread to my arms and trunk. The next night my right leg swelled up horribly and got a rash as well on my upper quad. My eyes burned for days after the shot and my eye doctor said my eye lids were inflamed and gave me steroid eye drops to help. The next night I woke up in the middle of the night itching my face. My whole face was covered in a rash that burned and was swollen. I had 4mg pills of methylpredisolone on hand at home and self treated with three pills (one each day for three days) and that helped with the swelling and Benedryl helped with the itching. I started having heavier periods at increments more than once a month (like once a week). I also have experienced significant weight gain - almost 10 pounds - in the month after the shot. I have weighed the same thing since I was in college and still wear the same clothes until after the shot. The periods have subsided but the weight is still here and I&#39;ve done nothing else differently.

I felt awful for 5 full days, slowly recovers for 4 more days, then I was fine.  The only lingering effects was my eczema became super inflamed and never calmed back down. And my right arm where I got my 2nd shot was soar for 2 weeks.

My neddle was normal and was not discharge or  I suspect a probable breast cancer and perform a mammogram like previus BIRADS 2 findings.   Inflamation decrease and desapear within the next week. It was normal at the time of the second dose.  This event was repeated 48 hours after receiving the second dose.

                                                Irregular menstruation starting 1/25. I track my temperature, so I was supposed to menstruate and felt cramping but no bleeding. The same thing happened in February. I did resume menstruation in March.  I realize this isn&#39;t a serious event, but I saw an article today that is linking the Covid vaccine with menstruation changes.

On 4/14 (one month post second dose) suffered very strong cramps, followed by an very heavy menstrual period. The menstruation too place 11 days after the last one, which was within a regular 22 day cycle. I have always had a very regular cycle and never one that started 11 days after the previous one. Bleeding was so heavy, I had to stay in bed for 2 afternoons and even considered a trip to the ER.

                                                My menstrual cycle started 7 days early. My cycle is always exactly 28/29 days apart with a heavy flow. Very regular FOR YEARS. Can set a calendar by it.  I was shocked when it started 7 days early! There would be no other reason except a side affect from the vaccine.  I have read this happening to others, but being looked at as an anecdote, however with younger people getting vaccinated now, I am looking forward to learning of this is more common among women in their reproductive years.

                                                I started having menstrual cramps on Tuesday, 4-27. I had some spot bleeding yesterday and seem to have actually stayed menstruating today. I have always been very regular and even more so on Larissia. The cramps started 11 days after my first shot, 13 days before it was expected. This is really unusual for me.  I have been tracking my period for a few years and the only time it has been irregular was when my body was adjusting the last time I quit birth control. I have no tests or treatment to report other than the usual ibuprofen if the cramps get bad. I also have had headaches on and off, but it was the extremely early period that drove me to report.

                                                I had severe acid reflux and heart pain and searing shoulder pain near my neck for two months. The neck pain has mostly gone away as well as the reflux and mostly the heart pain. My period last have been spot on regular bleeding for 5-7 days like clockwork every 28-30 days  for years and immediately after the second shot I have almost had zero period. I had a day of bleeding in March, then nothing, a day of bleeding in April, then  very minor spotting for two weeks now.  It?s most definitely related to the shot and not peri menopause since I was so regular up until that second shot.

                                                with this 1st of 2 shots I began getting a headache that began within 1 hour after the shot.  The headache immediately became intense and stayed.  Advil did not do anything for it.  That same evening I began having intense abdominal pain on my right side, it became so bad I was scared my appendix was going to burst.  I had my son on standby to take me to the hospital.  It was so severe I could not stand.  The only way that I can describe the pain would be: after natural birth and you begin nursing, the insanely intense contractions of the uterus to shed the afterbirth is how intense the pain was. I then started my menstrual cycle but was not supposed to for another week and 1/2.  The pain stayed, but did dull some, it wasn&#39;t as sharp but still intense.  My flow was extraordinarily heavy and I lost count of how many huge blood clots I passed.  Some clots were the size of my palm.  This cycle lasted a full 7 days.   My normal cycle starts with a little spotting, then 1 or 2 days of medium flow, then a couple days of spotting.  I also do not have my cycle every 30 days, more like 38-40.  I figure its pre-menopause.

                                                I am a very regular person in my 28 day menstrual cycle.   After my first shot on march 31st. I had a sore for about 4 or 5 days. I was fine. But my period came unexpectedly 5 days early on April 15. It was a very light flow and only 3 days long. My regular period is about 7 days.  My next period came on May 8th. At first spotting, then full period. This was a more normal 7 days.  I had my second dose vaccine injection on May 17th at 11am.  I had a fever for 3 days with shivers and body pains. Suddenly the fevers and chills just stopped after 3rd day.  No one else in my family in our household got obvious side effects (all men).  I got a vaginal yeast infection which was treated at home with over the counter medication on May 27th.  Very rare to get for me.   My 3rd period started on June 2nd. Very heavy flow with a lot of back pain.   My periods are now random and just not normal.

                                                Started my regular scheduled monthly period on Saturday following vaccination.  I had stronger than normal cramping for 3 days following.  My periods normally last 3-4 with a day or two of normal flow.  I am on my 5th day of menstruating&#39;s and my bleeding is extremely heavy.  I have also had clotting larger than a dime sometimes much larger than a quarter.  I have never experienced a period like this.  I have not been checked for uterine fibroids or anything else as this is the first month this has happened.  I cannot say for sure that this is related to the vaccine but did feel I should report it since it is abnormal for me.

I am not in menopause and I am on the birth control pill so my period comes like clock work.  After the first dose of the vaccine I did have a little spotting for a day or two.  I know one other person that is experiencing the same thing.  She is also same age as me .  Something is not right.

That night I took Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg and Advil 660mg that night. The next day, my arm was very swollen, even more than it was with the 1st dose. My body ached and I felt so weak. Because of that, I took more Tylenol along with the Bendadryl I was already taken. The 3rd day, my lymph node was swollen and my left breast was tender. I called the NP at clinic and she told me to get checked for COVID, which was negative. On the 4th day, my arm was still swollen and I was nauseous. The next few days were the same and then nothing remarkable. Still having the pain on my right side. The rash is still bright red at times, otherwise it&#39;s normal.

                                                My last period prior to my first vaccine shot had been in June 2020.  All signs, including blood work, pointed to me having entered menopause.  My mom also went through menopause at age 45 when her periods suddenly stopped, so I figured I was following in her footsteps.  On Saturday, February 13, 2021, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, and by Thursday morning, I was spotting.  This was very surprising since I had not had a period in several months.  Over the course of a couple of days, it turned into a full-blown period with the most severe cramping I&#39;ve ever had in my life.  By Saturday, they felt like labor contractions, and I was releasing sizable blood clots.  I made an appointment at our health clinic, and all bloodwork again pointed to menopause.  After my 2nd Moderna vaccine, I again experienced just a tiny bit of brown spotting a few days after the vaccine.  However, it did not progress into a full-blown period that time.

                                                On same day (Saturday) as vaccine I got covid arm. Site around area was hard and as big around as an orange. Very itchy. Very sore. Rash from site down to wrist of left arm which is the arm I got shot in. Had all symptoms thru Tuesday. On the following Saturday one week later, all symptoms returned. Only this time the hard knot wasn?t as big. Maybe the size of a golf ball. Had symptoms till around tues or wed.  Site area continues to flare up, itchy rashy, fever like, maybe once a week. It?s Monday before I get my second dose Saturday coming up and it was hot and rashy for a few hours today.   Also, my whole life I?ve never had a period longer than 4 days and never have worn pads during my period only panty liners. Never had a heavy period. This month I started my period on 4/11/21 and for the first 5 or 6 days it was lite as usual but longer than normal. And a dark red. It?s now 4/19/21 and the last couple days it?s been very very heavy and bright red. With today 4/19 being the heaviest so far. There?s been no break in it. I?m now on day 8 and it?s heavier than it?s ever been my whole life. I?ve had a normal regular period since I was 15. I have no children by choice if that helps somehow.  I have not gone to the dr for any of these side effects.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Up until recently, I have had a predictable cycle every 28 days, lasting 7 days, beginning heavy and tapering out.  At the beginning of 2021, I began to enter the perimenopause stage.  My first gap was 37 days (normal period length/strength) and my second gap was 48 days.  My most period came after my first vaccine (at the end of 48 day gap).  I felt it was lighter and less discharge.  It ended after the normal 7 days.  I had 2 days of nothing (as to be expected).  I then began to have some brown discharge and mild cramping/discomfort.  This was not heavy enough for a pad or tampon, only a panty liner was needed.  The brown discharge occurred for about 3-4 days when small amounts of fresh, bright red blood began showing.  This has been occurring for the past 3 days, along with continued mild cramping/discomfort.  I am still in the middle of this discharge which now alternates between fresh blood drops and brown discharge.  I was originally scheduled to have my second dose tomorrow but have decided to postpone it as I don&#39;t want to chance blood clots.  Additionally, I am 45 years old and have had 3 children.  I have never had a menstrual cycle closer than 26 days apart.  I have NEVER had any blood discharge after my normal 7 day cycle.  Another matter to consider is that I have a blood clotting disorder called Factor V Leiden, heterozygous.  I did hemorrhage after giving birth to my third child but have had no other clotting issues.

                                                I started feeling like I was getting my period even before I got my second shot. On the one hand, maybe I was and it was just a coincidence. I had the typical brain fog, muscle and overall body fatigue. Nothing horrible, but it was there. The second shot itself was no big deal and I went about my day no problem afterward. I was just surprised when I started menstruating given that I haven&#39;t actually bled in more than a year because I am on the Mirena IUD (inserted in 2018). Period symptoms like tender breasts and being foggy heads or tired for a day is one thing, an actual period is another. I haven&#39;t even had spotting in at least a year, probably two. I had active (light) bleeding for 2 or 3 days. I am now two and a half weeks post my second shot and my breasts are as tender as if I am getting my period imminently, which doesn&#39;t make sense at all given the timing. I had the most painful mammogram I have ever experienced in my life on Friday (April 23) though the results were clear. Other than that, and since the moment I got my shot,  I have felt perfectly fine. Maybe a little tired and hungover feeling the day immediately after the shot, but nothing more.

                                                My monthly period arrived the day after (as it should have) my first vaccine does of Moderna. My period was heavier for a longer duration than it typically is. It was not necessarily heavier, but the heaviness lasted longer. This level of heaviness typically lasts for one day and after the vaccine it lasted for three days.

I was off for about 2 weeks and which I had the second dose between there. A week  or so after my second dose on the 24 of April I started again, again very heavy and still ok it as of 5/16/21. At 45 yrs old I have been regular my whole life. Usually 4 days and very light bleeding. I don?t even wear pads just liners.  Not sure how much longer this is going to go on but it shows no signs of easing up any.

On Tuesday, 20-APR-2021, my period started ~7 days early (sugar pill was to start on Sunday 25-APR-2021, it usually starts the following Tuesday). On this day, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema was noted in addition to knee pain/swelling. My period lasted for 26 days, stopping finally on 15-MAY-2021. It was light. The lower extremity edema also subsided around this time. The knee pain and swelling stopped 0n 28-APR-2021.

                                                I experienced typical immune response symptoms as explained in provided literature and from public sources such as the CDC and my local health department.  In addition to typical symptoms of an immune response (fatigue, headache, muscle aches) that were transient, I also experienced an exceptionally heavy mensuration two weeks after the immunization. This is NOT caused to situational stress or anxiety. I fully expected to be just fine after the immunization, I have no needle phobia, and the vax clinic was in a familiar setting staffed with kind, efficient, and professional volunteers and medical staff. I was with my husband who is a loving, supportive partner.    I assure you that there was no ?psychological? effect that caused heavy menses after the immunization as is stated in much of the news sources; it was not ?all in my head? as the CDC a state health department seem to think. I am quite insulted that this side effect is regarded as such. I though medical professionals could look past Stereotypical ?female histrionics?  and consider this a side effect.  A second unusual symptom I experienced was a lack of control of my temper.  Situations that I would normally  find mildly irritating or slightly frustrating were sources of extreme anger and frustration. This occurred 72-96 hours after the immunization. I didn?t realize this until several days after the exceptional negative reactions.

                                                Exceptionally heavy menstruation for two cycles after the administration of the first and second dose of the Moderna covid vaccine.    I experienced an exceptionally heavy menstrual flow two weeks after the first Moderna covid vaccine (reported to VAERS).  After the second vaccine I again experienced two more cycles of extremely heavy menstural flow. The flow was notable because it was as heavy or heavier at times than post-partum  bleeding after having two completely natural births.  Both cycles were so heavy they interfered with my daily activities including work. This have never happened to me before in the preceding 35 years of menstruation.   I recently completed a third menses which was typical and normal for me.  Please do not insult me by attributing heavy menses to ?psychological effects? of receiving the Moderna covid vaccine. I am not an anxious, stressed person, I do not have a needle phobia, I fully expected to be just fine after the vaccine, and I received it in a comfortable, efficiently run, familiar location accompanied by my loving, supportive husband who also received the vaccine.    This is a genuine, unaknowledged side effect that needs further study. It is exceedingly embarrassing to bleed though my clothing at work because heavy menses was unexpected. I had to go home to change and had to inform my (male) superior of my need. Sure wish this would be part of the educational piece of side effects!

By 11 days, all the symptoms had resolved.

Nine days after the period ended, another menstruation period began on April 2. The bleeding is VERY heavy. Very unusual as I?m in perimenopause.   Recap: since Moderna shot one period came early and then a second period nine days later. Very heavy both.

                                                Metallic taste filling mouth within first two minutes of injection, lasting for three hours.  Cold sweat and the feeling of possible fainting lasted ten minutes. Nausea occurred for 24 hours. Swelling of lymph node in the armpit of the left arm (non-injection) arm as well as a feeling of burning near the underside of the arm just above left elbow lasting 48 hours. When the metallic taste resolved, it was replaced by an indescribable taste lasting for two hours. Within 24 hours, a strong smell of &#34;plastic&#34; for two hours was replaced by the strong smell of &#34;burnt toast/burning&#34; for several hours.  The lymph node in the left arm still feels swollen but less so, and it six days past the injection date. Menstruation began a week early, which has not been off schedule for ten years, so it feels related. I hope this helps; feel free to reach out if you have additional questions.

                                                I had a bruise on my arm for almost two weeks at the site of the shot. I started to feel cramping as if I was  getting ready to start my cycle on Sunday. They lasted almost two weeks every day and some days I needed to take Ibprofen because they were strong. I also had very sore and tender breasts and became bloated like I was going to start my cycle. I finished my cycle two days prior to getting the shot, so these symptoms are not normal at this time. I still have some cramping and off and on bloating. My breasts hurt off and on. I have started slightly spotting. I should not have my cycle until the end of the month. I told my doctor about these symptoms and she said they sound related and to report this.

                                                Vaginal Bleeding began 2 days after vaccine. I had a uterine ablation in 2018 and have not had a period at all until 2 days after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna. It was not a regular period. I bled heavily for a couple of weeks, then lightly for a week or so, and then started bleeding heavily again following. Currently I am still experiencing vaginal bleeding like a period but more frequent (every 2 weeks as opposed to once a month). It has now been 2 months since the last dose of the vaccine and I continue to have this pattern of bleeding. My MD is aware and when I questioned the vaccine, I was told it probably was not related, but offers no other explanation.

AFTER MY VACCINES MAYBE LATE MARCH 2021 I STARTED NOTICING ACHES AND PAIN MOVING AROUND ESPECIALLY IN BED WHEN I AM TRYING TO TURN ON MY SIDES. ALMOST LIKE I HAVE ARTHRITIS. I STARTED ALSO HAVING JOINT PAIN THAT I NEVER USE TO HAVE. I AM IN CHRONIC PAIN DAILY. SOME DAYS IT&#39;S MORE ACHIER THAN OTHER DAYS. IT&#39;S NOT AS BAD DURING THE DAY WHEN I AM MOVING AROUND BUT WHEN I AM IN BED AND TRY TO TURN OR MOVE I FEEL MY ENTIRE BODY REALLY ACHIE. I HAVE NEVER HAD THESE SYMPTOMS BEFORE. I AM TRYING TO SEE A CHIROPRACTOR AND MASSAGE THERAPIST NOW AND SEE IF THIS WILL HELP BUT SOMEITMES THE ACHE IS UNBAREABLE. ADVIL WLL JUST TAKE THE EDGE OFF BUT IT NEVER GOES AWAY. IT WEIGHS HEAVY ON MY MIND DAILY. ALSO MY MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS OUT OF WACK. I USED TO BE REGULAR ON MY CYCLE BUT AFTER THE VACCINE I DID NOT HAVE MY PERIOD UNTIL APRIL FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS. I MISSED MAY&#39;S PERIOD. MY SISTER ACTUALLY HAD COVID AND SHE IS NOT VACCINATED BUT SHE IS GOING THRU THE SAME THING. HER PERIOD IS OUT OF WACK AS WELL

                                                It is not a big deal, but I feel it is strange. I have regular periods, every 35 days followed by 45 days, then alternate. My period was altered by this vaccine. Period happened 2 days after the shot.  The exact same pattern happened after the first dose of Moderns vaccine administered on 5/2. I have never had period shorter than 30 days in my life. I suspect there must be a hormone change induced by the mRNA vaccine. It could be easily ignored by most women recipients due to 28 days interval. But, could it cause any potential consequence to teenagers? That&#39;s why I want to bring this issue to attention.

The same night I started to feel like I had the flu. There was muscle and joint pain throughout my body. I had a headache and my stomach was hurting me. I developed a fever and it went as high as 105 degrees. I called the on-call doctor the next day and she said that I would probably be fine by Sunday. I did not feel better and my symptoms continued. My blood pressure became very high too, and I was advised to see my doctor, but it got better. My knees felt like they were on fire. My appetite went away come completely. On Sunday, I called the doctor again and told her how I was feeling. My doctor told me to go to the hospital to get an IV because I wasn&#39;t drinking fluids. I couldn&#39;t even get out of my bed and I had urinated on myself. I did experience a couple of UTI&#39;s after the vaccine. I told the doctor that I would drink broth and my son made me some. Sunday my fever went up and down and at one point. On Monday I started having a headache again and I was very nauseous. I went back to work on Wednesday with a headache. I took homemade soup and I ate there. I still had a headache throughout the day. On Thursday, I felt a lot better. A few days later, I experienced some dark vaginal bleeding, not related to my period. I had a vaginal ultrasound. I had a biopsy and everything was fine. The heavy bleeding continued and I ended up having to get an IUD to control the bleeding. I had some blood work done and my live enzymes were elevated. I had an ultrasound to check everything. I had a fibroid scan as well. I had an endoscopy. The doctor thinks I might have liver sclerosis. I told him that I do not drink. I&#39;m meeting with my liver doctor tomorrow. There are now complications with my thyroid. I saw an endocrinologist and he said that I may need calcium in my body.

                                                I received Moderna Covid vaccine on day 21 of my menstrual cycle (2/8/21).  I was supposed to begin my period five days later, 2/13/21.  The start of my period was delayed by eight days, finally starting 2/21/21.  I track my period with an app so I know that this is highly unusual.  I&#39;m 47 so I was assuming perimenopause could be playing a role in my delayed period until I discovered that there are many others reporting the same issue.  It&#39;s not a big deal to have a delayed period, it just would have been nice to know that it&#39;s a normal potential side effect.

                                                My menstrual cycle came early the day after my first shot and did the same thing after the second shot. The very next day. The first time it happened I thought I had counted my days wrong but after the second vaccine I knew it wasn?t due for another week. My period in March was a longer cycle and had no real flow just heavy spotting for more days.  It struck me so that I thought it should be reported.

                                                Abnormal menses.  Huge clots.  Velocity and volume of blood extreme.  (Different from previous experiences of menorrhagia).  The only other time I experienced this type of dramatic and concerning bleeding was after I took the Hepatitis vaccine (first shot) about 2 years ago.  I think that&#39;s the only other vaccine I&#39;ve had as an adult.  There is mention of heavy bleeding as a rare side effect for Hepatitis vaccine, and I surely hope you will study this effect from Covid vaccine as it took nearly a year to regulate my cycle after the Hepatitis vaccine reaction.  I&#39;ve seen some reports suggesting that the excessive bleeding that women are experiencing after the Covid vaccine is due to stress and that is just plain insulting.  Stress does affect the menstrual cycle; that is well-known, but this is something entirely different.  I have also had small clots in the nose during the past several days, which again, is highly abnormal for me.  Thank you for looking into the bleeding side effects that hundreds (if not more) women are struggling with at this time.

                                                Starting on Saturday early morning, had severe chills and was very tired. Had a fever of 101 and slept off an on all day. Could not keep my eyes open and went to bed very early. I woke up the next morning (Sunday) feeling soso even though the day before I drank a bottle of gatorade, a bottle of water and 1/2 of a jug of a 3  gallon water. My legs were sore, like a feeling of being dehydrated, not flu like and my arm swelled up like a balloon, my eyes were very swollen, hands and feet as well. The swelling lasted until this past Saturday, April 10 and had a bunch of water weight on my body (4 extra pounds, which I have shed 2 of). I have a lot of memory loss as well as I ended up with my period, which I have not had in approximately 9 years.  I had a headache for the first four days.

Bleeding so heavily medical care was sought after first injection. Thought it might be my IUD, which was removed after the first episode. Full gynecological exam indicated everything was normal. Menstrual bleeding happened again 2 days after second vaccine,  characterized by early arrival, heavy flow and clotting.

                                                I received the the first dose of the COVID vaccine on Friday, 4/23/21. On Sunday evening (4/26), my menstrual  cycle started, even though I just had my last period the week prior. My cycle varies as I&#39;m in peri-menopause but I&#39;ve never had two cycles a week apart before. Also, my normal cycle is normally moderate amount of bleeding the first day and then cuts off drastically (spotting mainly) for the next 2-3 days. I am on day 3 today and the amount of bleeding has been heavy since it started Sunday evening. The color is also very bright red (where normally it is more of a dark rust color).   I am not experiencing any cramping at all or any other pain, just abnormally heavy bleeding.

My period was always normal, in terms of amount, time, etc. At first, I didn&#39;t think of it was related to vaccine.  However, after the second dose (on 4/11/2021) , same thing happened again: I got my period in shorter cycle, and the bleed was very heavy, running pure blood (didn&#39;t see tissue in) and drag for ~10 days, I basically had to bed rest to let it stop.

I am consistently 28 days on my cycle to this took me by surprise. After some googling  of similar items in the weeks after, it seems there may be other studies that are exploring whether this is a causal event. As such I?ve decided to report it. It?s just very odd to me because I am extremely like clockwork., so it took me by surprise. I mentioned it to my pharmacist today while getting my second shot and he suggested I report it said that perhaps you can keep track in case others are. I know there are external CDC studies that are apparently going on to try to investigate this abnormality. Thank you for your time.

                                                This may be nothing, but I have seen other women with similar issues after the vaccination, so I thought it would be best to report it, just in case.  I am 47 years old and very likely perimenopausal. My cycle was between 32-35 days, fairly consistently. After my second dose, my period came a full week early, was heavier, and I had more cramping. Now I have just had my second period after my second shot, and it came after 28 days. So it seems like my cycle has shortened. Again, this may be a coincidence, but my periods have always been in the 32-35 day cycle range, very rarely under 30. It&#39;s unusual for me to have three periods so close together like this.

I have the Mirena birth control implant and do not have a monthly period and have not had one for many years nor do I get the cramps and other symptoms of having a period.   For the past 9 days since getting the vaccine,  I have had spotting and cramping off and on daily.   This is NOT normal for me!

                                                Between two doses of Covid vaccine(April 22 and May 19), I started a period on May 10 at the time I expected  but it was just spotting for four days. This was surprising because I have had regular menstrual cycle in recent years and  this kind of spotting have not occurred. After I received the second dose, I started another period  on May 28 which lasted 5 days. This time it was very heavy blood flow and I have seen a lot of blood lumps and had severe(worse than regular) cramping pain for two days. I am not sure if this change in my period is related to Covid vaccine or not. Other than this, I had known side effects like muscle pain.

                                                I had a strong reaction to the second dose (fever over 101 after taking Ibuprophen that lasted 2 days).  Then I had abnormal uterine bleeding that prompted me to contact my doctor who ordered a pelvic ultrasound.  The ultrasound showed what looked like possibly a clot or a cyst in the uterus.  I then had a hysteroscope to further examine it and it was no longer there so it has been a clot that subsequently passed. Since then, my periods have returned to a normal timing pattern, but remain heavier than before.

Fatigue for 48 hours beginning day after vaccination. Occurred with both doses. Fever for 24 hours beginning day after vaccination. Occurred with second dose only. Nausea for 24 hours beginning day after vaccination. Occurred with second dose only. Two menstrual cycles occurred 14 days apart between first and second doses of vaccine. (Never experienced rapid cycle before.) Menstrual cycle has since returned to normal. Intense muscle and joint pain interfering with mobility and activities began day after first dose of vaccine, and has continued intermittently for two months until present. (June 10, 2021) Pain affects hips, back, knees, ankles, knuckles, wrists, and elbows. Previous to vaccine, pain only experienced in hips and back if over-exercised.

She is currently hospitalized and she has received platelet transfusions but her platelet count is still critically low.

                                                In addition to initial pain at and around (3-4?) the injection site, within a few hours, this pain spread up across the back of my neck and down my arm and resulted in what felt kind of like a sprain in my hand. If I just so much as flexed my hand slightly, the pain would shoot out from the center of my hand. So I wrapped it to keep myself from moving it unintentionally. It continued to be very painful for another two full days (all of 4/13 and 4/14). It&#39;s better today (4/15), but not completely gone. My husband was telling his coworker about it who said that his wife had the exact same thing except her pain was in her wrist, which is why I felt that it was likely tied to the shot and I should report it. Especially since I had done nothing to injure my hand. In addition to this symptom, I also got my period on 4/13, the morning after I got the shot, even though it&#39;s not due for two more weeks and my periods are never irregular like that. I have heard of women having heavier menstrual flow following Covid vaccination, but those reports were not of earlier onset, so I wanted to be sure that this event was reported as well.

She said she was feeling achy before the vaccine and thinks one may have been imminent. The night after they vaccine she said she woke up with heavy bleeding.  She said it was abnormally heavy and said it will not stop. She said she is also said she has a headache and injection site pain. I recommended she go to a walk in clinic or ER if the blood loss was sufficient and to follow up with her md on Monday. As of now she has not sought medical treatment.

In under 48 hours a lump appeared under the skin at vaccination site on left arm. The area was swollen, hot to the touch, and there was a red rash on the skin above the lump. The swollen lump under the skin was treated with Zyrtec  10 mg- once per day; and Aleve 220 mg- twice per day. An ice pack was applied as needed. Cortizone cream was applied topically to the rash as needed. Within four days these symptoms had lessened significantly. Within seven days the lump under the skin, as well as the rash, were gone and treatments  were terminated.   Unexpected, unusual menstrual bleeding began 14 days after receiving first Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination. This unusual menstrual bleeding lasted a full 2 weeks before it ended.

Took tylenol and advil and went to bed (tylenol alone didn&#39;t seem to be enough).   Went to bed.  Woke up with INTENSE back pains almost like back labor.  There were a few moments that I could not walk well.  Ibuprofen all day his symptoms.  Period flow changed to heavier on the end dates when they are typically super light.    A couple weeks later, I was teaching online and suddenly, I started getting intense cramping (I have had cramps once before and then labor--that is it my entire life).   I was miserable.  I couldn&#39;t sit.  I took 600 ibuprofen and waited till the pain subsided and took a 2 hour nap, woke up exhausted.   Period arrives on time one month post second vaccine but is definitely heavier already and definitely more irritable.  I thought I was going through perimenopause symptoms till I saw an article on possible links.  It adds up perfectly.

                                                I am in peri-menopause and do not typically get a period (very rare). A week after the 2nd dose I began to bleed heavily. I thought it strange but it was nothing more than a nuisance.  4 days ago I woke with lower back pain that was so terrible that I had a hard time getting up from my bed.  This pain was not alleviated with tylenol or ibuprofen. This morning I was woken up by intensive abdominal pain, diarrhea and heavy bleeding.  It has been 6.5 hours and the pain is almost unbearable. I have to work so I am hoping it stops. I have read that some women have had the same thing happen so I want to report it so that someone takes it seriously - this pain is debilitating.  I&#39;m scared that it isn&#39;t going to abate.  I&#39;ve gone from no period to 2 horrible periods in 30 days.

My next period was due to start on February 19, 2021. I had my Second shot February 11 and I have not started my period. I took a pregnancy test and they have been negative.  I find this very unusual that I have not started my period yet and pregnancy tests are negative. The only thing different in my life at this time was the Covid shot

                                                Mid-cycle menstrual bleeding (basically a full 7-day menstrual cycle that started one week after my regular cycle ended. ) Dr found no logical cause for this (no infection, no possible pregnancy, etc) other than possibly stress or pre-menopause but saw other women asking online if others had also experienced this and felt I should report it just in case there is a causal relationship. I have never had random cycles before.

It has lightened up but not stopped after more than two weeks. My age is 50 and I am in peri-menopause.

Two days later started spotting on dayly basis and with clots wich continued until I started on  progesterone on April 8, 2021 (prescribed for 10 days).  Even with the pill, I continue to spot lightly. I am unsure about getting the second dose of the Moderna Covid vaccine on 03/15/2021.  Even with a history of previous fibroid removed around 2014.  My period seem has never behave &#34;non-stop&#34; like this.

I had my second COVID shot on 5/4/21. On 5/28/21, I started my menstrual (on time after skipping a month), but it has been exceedingly heavy and long-lasting. This has been my worst in 38 years in regards to heavy bleeding. I didn?t have any cramps though, so that was a plus, but to be at the tail end of day SEVEN and still using ultra tampons every two hours is unprecedented in my personal biology. That is usually on only day two and maybe three, and those last at least four hours. Coincidence? Maybe? Just doesn?t seem right to me.

Day 5 after Moderna vaccine my period start again super heavy with all period symptoms way worse that I ever experience. Pounding headaches, cramps and heavy bleeding and hot flashes. I have a menstrual disorder and period is tough on me but this was off the chart. Day 6-7-8 after Moderna vaccine I also had low grade fever on an off (101-102 F). Not sleeping, not eating and very tired buy day 11 I hit bottom and by day 12 I started to feel better. Going to see my doctor to discuss treatment before my second Moderna vaccine dose.

After the 2nd shot, I got my period 2 weeks early, and the blood is bright red and heavy, which it hasn&#39;t been  for years (I am peri menopausal so my periods of late have been very dark and pretty light, though always like clockwork.)  I read somewhere that people are chalking this up to the stress of getting the vaccine. Let me tell you, this is the least amount of stress I&#39;ve had for this entire quarantine time. Also, we were lucky enough to have the means to have our food and supplies delivered to us, so this last year was actually less stressful than normal.   (I marked &#34;no&#34; on recovered for item 20 as I am still having my period, which at 4 days is a little longer than usual as well.)

                                                On April, I started to break-through bleed.  The break-through bleeding continued for a week.  It was not heavy or debilitating; however, it is hugely inconvenient to spot and have hormonal fluctuations. My cycle was regular till now. Since 4/20, I am spotting again.  My period was due 4/15 and I never got it. My 2nd Moderna is 5/4 and I am concerned what those side effects will be on my menstrual cycle.  I have a Copper IUD- hormone-free and take no meds.

But noticed a rather large (3-4&#34;) raised rash mark below the injection site about 4 days after having the vaccine. It was warm and hard and sometime mildly itchy. It lasted for about a week and then completely disappeared. I will also mention that my period was affected by the vaccine. I am normally on schedule to a day but I was late by 1 week. I didn&#39;t associate this w/ the vaccine until my sister mentioned that she had the same issue (she also had the Moderna vaccine as well).

Shoulders, elbows, knees &amp; fingers. Manly stronger pain is on both shoulders to the point I went to the Emergency Room.

                                                Prior to receiving the 2 dose vaccine I had not had my period in over 7 months. Since receiving the vaccine I have had 3 very irregular and heavy periods. I recently became aware that there seems to be a link between the vaccine and menstruation becoming irregular or heavy. I thought I would report it.

                                                Right off that bat, I noticed heart palpitations and also flushing on the chest. I was getting a rash on chest. The EMT there told me to go home and take Benadryl. I took two of them. It didn&#39;t help with the symptoms. I called the doctor - he told me to take three Benadryl every six hours. I didn&#39;t really sleep that night - I was tired due to Benadryl. I put ice on my chest in the middle of the night because it was on fire. I remembered that I tried to go to work the next day but I couldn&#39;t. I went to the doctor. He told me to take 2 Benadryl one hour before the next shot. It took awhile for the symptoms to go away - I took Benadryl during the next week. I still had the rash on my chest. I went to the OB/GYN after that for my annual exam and after that I was bleeding and I thought it had been from my pap smear. I was  bleeding very heavily - altogether it was three months of heavy bleeding. Medication to stop bleeding: Filled on Provera - 10 mg - on 2/8/2021 - they told me to take it for 10 days. Tranexamic acid -650 mg 2 tablets 3 times a day for up to 5 days..  They did bloodwork. I did a Sonogram.  I had to leave during my work duties a couple of time (I&#39;m a surgical assistant in surgeries)  because I was bleeding and my co-workers told me I didn&#39;t look good. Had second dose of vaccine (lot number 004M20A) on 2/5/2021 - the bleeding got heavier (and in fact, immediately after I had the shot, I had to go to the bathroom I started bleeding so heavily - heavier than I had ever bled before) after the 2nd vaccine and the rash that I had after the first vaccine was still there but would come and go with Benadryl. I did testing on April 20th - for pre-surgery.  I had a DNC on April 27th  and after the DNC I felt so much better. The rash is gone; I&#39;m not as  tired. And I feel better.

                                                My first symptoms were expected-- sore arm and slightly tired feeling -- a few days later my shoulder itched where I got the shot. Then a week later, two things-- and one is PMS. Obviously not the shot but I mention this as it is possible that these side effects are related to the PMS. On Sunday 1/3/2021 I was experiencing breast tenderness PMS and that extended under my arms and by the end of that day my glands were swollen and hard in my right armpit. The next morning, they were still hard and swollen and the glands are still today. While I often have breast tenderness, I have never had swollen glands or painful underarms as part of this. Also yesterday 1/4 my right shoulder near where I received the vaccine was i was itchy and it continues to be and red and also hard there... I don&#39;t want to overplay any of these symptoms and they might well relate to PMS but I think in this instance particularly with the very painful swollen glands on the right underarm it&#39;s important to report them

Had not had a period in over 8 months.  Hot flashes had subsided.  One month later having EXTREMELY bad period, with excessive bleeding. Could not even go to work. I truly believe it came from vaccine.  Figure I should report so there may be data. The second dose caused severe fatigue for 5 full days, my concentration was foggy.

                                                I started bleeding vaginally and am still bleeding 20 hours later. I have been in full menopause since 2013 after having both of my ovaries removed. And, was diagnosed with breast cancer in October of 2019, surgery in February 2020, followed by 5 weeks of radiation therapy. The type of breast cancer I had was due to hormones, so any hormones in my body could potentially cause a recurrence of the cancer.

                                                Immediately after, felt fine except for a sore arm. I exercised as normal and it went away after two days. Five days after the shot, I felt a painful, pea-sized lump in my armpit, on the side that I received the injection. It hurt every time I moved my arm. Six days after the shot, my arm got very itchy, hot, and red at the injection site. The rash lasted 2 days. Ten days after the vaccine, my menstrual cycle was to start. On day 1, I had stabbing, debilitating pelvic pain and abdominal cramps, acute nausea, and felt feverish for a day. This is not normal for me. Then I experienced alarmingly heavy flow of bright red blood for 4 days. The blood gushed constantly. More forceful than a miscarriage. I may not have connected this to the vaccine, but my husband noted that the vccine was the only change from last month to this. And then I later read that other women had reported similar symptoms. I cannot stress how worrying and terrifying this experience was. If it is at all vaccine-related, it would help women tremendously to know this could be a side effect, so they don&#39;t panic about their health.

I was bleeding through pads/tampons at 1 per hour during waking hours for 2-3 weeks resulting in anemia.  My hemoglobin was 7  GM/DL and my iron  was 11 UG/DL  Ferritin 2.4 NG/ML    All of those levels were very low vs. standard range.

                                                This is day 6 of my 2nd Moderna vaccine.  I began coughing around 10 pm tonight. I noticed  3 days after  my 2nd vaccine that my breast are tender. And they still are. My 2nd vaccine was March 9, 2021.   Slight headache still persist.  All other body pains are gone. The cough is new. Seems like phlegm is trying to come up .

                                                Experiences expected arm soreness one day after receiving shot and some malaise for subsequent 2-3 days. On 3/15/2020 during routine mammogram/sonogram enlarged lymph nodes under left are were observed during sonogram, as well as an indeterminate area in left breast, which will be re-checked during a follow up sonogram . Testing center did inquire regarding when I had received shot and in which arm.  On 3/20/2021 began to experience sore breast, and on 3/25/2021 began to experience a mid-cycle menstrual cycle or vaginal bleeding event that is still occurring as of date of this report 3/29/2021. Date of my previous menstrual cycle began 3/12/2021 and ended 3/17/202.   It should be noted, this is completely unusual, I have only ever experienced menstrual cycles that have a regular  schedule between 24-32 days between cycles and the nature of this bleeding was different than usual.

                                                I started a period on 3/16 that last a week prior to getting my first Moderna shot the morning of Saturday, 3/27, at a scheduled 11 AM appointment, though it was probably closer to 11:30 by the time I received the injection at a local .  The following morning, I had to scramble out of bed at 6:30 AM to run to the bathroom before soaking my sheets with a monster, Stephen King Carrie-worthy period that has been relentless and continued non-stop for 2 weeks, unabated.  I was in contact immediately with my endocrinologist, fearing that my thyroid meds needed to be upped in dosage.  And I was scheduling an appt. with a new gyn as well (won&#39;t see this person till June as a new patient) but hey, prior to this, I had no period through much of 2020.  My endocrinologist put me on a daily dosage of medroxyprogesterone to halt the period.  A week later, as of yesterday, 4/10, I was still bleeding heavily.  Today, it is lighter so hopefully, it&#39;s coming to an end.   I&#39;d assume my sore arm was the extent of the Moderna side effects but then  came across an article by fluke and happenstance this morning.

My heavy bleeding consisted of emptying a 50 ml mentual cup every 1/2 hour to every hour for two-three days after onset. I became extremely amemic and could not get out of bed. Increasing my Aygestin dose to the maximum recommended dosage daily has stopped the excessive bleeding.

This may seem normal given my age, however I didn?t start my period till 16 years of age ( just like my mother and also my daughter) and have still never missed a period.

                                                vaginal bleeding.  I have not had a period in over a year and 2 days after the shot I started bleeding. After talking to others that have had the vaccine, several have had breakthrough bleeding a couple days after the vaccine and thought nothing of it, but people aren&#39;t reporting because they think its just them. I think it should be reported, and maybe some investigation  follow up as to why this may have occurred.

It got worse over the next few days, then began to subside. There?s still tenderness, but recovering. Icing helped reduce the pain. I had a clear mammogram before the vaccine.

The bleed was extremely HEAVY, large clotted surges.  Cramping was moderate... I don&#39;t typically experience cramps with my cycle..  This occurred over 3-4 days.  I consulted with my OBGYN and she recommended I stop taking the pill for 5 days and restart.  During that time, the bleeding subsided and then restarted, 2 times (stopping for over 24 hours) then occurring again with a slight decrease in the amount of bleeding each time.  I have since resumed taking the pill and all bleeding has stopped.  I chalked this up to menopause and stress however recently read articles about the vaccine causing  unusual bleeding patterns and though I would report the event after learning that such data was not collected during trials.

By April 12th the swelling progressed to her forearm and into the lymph nodes in her armpit and breast. She saw her provider on Tuesday, April 13th and was given doxycycline and prednisone. I spoke with the patient on Wednesday, April 14th and she stated the swelling has not progressed and the tightness feels better.

                                                I am perimenopausal and have not had a period in almost 11 months. I started a light period on 4/22 in the morning with light cramping and it continued to be light all day. By 4pm I started to have painful abdominal cramps that became severe. I took about 8 doses of OTC naproxone between 5:30am-8pm but still experienced severe pain that kept me immobile from about 5pm to 9:30pm when I fell asleep. I woke up Friday 4/30 with continued light bleeding. At about 9am the bleeding became profuse for about 10 minutes soaking my pad and pants. Then it returned to light bleeding. This is not a typical period for me.

                                                So since the vaccination, late night, I started getting chills and fever up to 102/103. I took Tylenol that is all. I did write it all down somewhere because I am a healthcare professional as well. I also had a runny nose, headache, and body aches. On the 10th I started spotting and bleeding that lasted for about 5 days and it was associated with lower abdominal pain. I contacted my PCD and then my OBGYN, I schedule a visit. I scheduled a mammogram and biopsy for breast and uterus. My last ultrasound was last year in July so the pap came out negative and it was just fibrocystic disease. I did consult a surgeon following the biopsy and she also said that it&#39;s ok. My OBGYN said that there have been others that post vaccine have bleeding issues. I am a mechanical researcher in health care. So my vaccine in Feb. and this was all going on March and the 17th of March and I was on the phone and I just fainted. After that I had a cardiovascular evaluation go on and we are not sure what happened.

I mainly feel hot all the time.  Additionally: I spoke with a friend who is 59, and she had the same shot and had her menstrual cycle for 3 days since her 2nd shot, and she has been menopausal for several years now.

Feb 9 I received the 2nd dose and again had sore left arm and more pain in the left breast lymph area. Four weeks after around March 7 my lymph nodes on the LEFT side began swelling and aching which became very painful and worrisome. My Left breast was very tender and sore and that area swollen. I am 10 weeks post shot and the MD today palpated and said he still feels swelling.  I am being sent for a mammo.   I have breast implants and it &#34;FELLS like the vaccine is fighting the implant&#34;

Within the next 24 hrs I had a fever of 102, body aches, chills where I couldn&#39;t stop shaking, sore arm at injection site. It was the worse I had felt in a very long time. I called my on call physician on Saturday. He gave no treatment other than rest, fluids and Tylenol. I slept the entire weekend after receiving the vaccine on Friday. I had fatigue for about 2 weeks after the shot. In March, I was still fatigued, my ankles were also significantly swollen and difficulty breathing like wheezing at the end of March. I had a significant asthma event I had a course of prednisone. My normal inhalers were not working. I also used medicated breathing treatments, nebulizer. Also, in March,  I had the worst menstrual cycle. I had significant cramps and heavy bleeding both of which were unusual. In April and forward, it was back to normal.  My ankles and breathing are back to normal.

Last week I started to experience pre-menstrual cramps that lasted about 6 days, on the day 2 I started spotting and that developed into what looks very much like heavy menstrual bleeding that is now lasting for 6 days with cramping coming and going. My OBGYN retired and I could not get appointment with the new Dr until June21st 2021. If the bleeding does not slow down I plan to go  the ER. .

On Sunday 04/04/21 my eyebrows, around my mouth, my chin &amp; under my neck were excessively itching. To the point I felt like I had two chins. On Monday 04/05/21 my body began feeling itchy and during the evening I began seeing scanty rashes. By Tuesday 04/06/21 it was unbearable.  I could not sit still. Different areas would feel funny like a burning sensation, then wherever I feel the burning rashes would break out with severe itching. My body itched beyond relief. I sought medical treatment at Urgent Care Facility. I was given predisone40 mg daily &amp; Benadryl for 5 days. Only today 04/09/21 I finally got relief. My breast &amp; abdomen still very  tender, I took Photos of my rashed arm.

Was given Benadryl and stayed for 1 1/2 hours while monitored by nurses.  Went home, rested and felt poorly the rest of the day.   The new issue was then on Sunday, the lymph gland on my left clavicle swelled up. I thought it was a blood clot so I went to the ER. Had I been told this may happen I would not have gone to the ER.   The swelling has not gone down but gotten worse, has expanded to both arm pits, arms, groin areas, upper chest and breasts. Overall feeling of malaise and tiredness. Occasional heavy chest and headaches.   Spoke with PCP yesterday. He asked if I was given anything for my symptoms ( swelling and pain ) I said no. He is hoping this will resolve itself with time.   Have used heating pad and Tylenol and have rested for three full days.

                                                The first night I had about 1/3rd cup of a clear slimy no oder discharge. Very weird! Then # nights later in the middle of the night I started bleeding vaginally. it was at least 2 to 3  tablespoons every 30 minutes to an hour. I am 58 and not had a period for 15 years!  I had terrible pain and bloating. I became light headed and weak, I had chills and a slight fever. This lasted three days. I went to urgent care, they sent me to my doctor. they ran tests and could not find any reason for my bleeding. It has since stopped but I still have some pressure by my overies.

Redness was gone in about three days and the soreness was gone after two weeks. The second dose was given 1/27/21. About 12 hours after given the 2nd vaccine, I woke up from a sleep with chills, temp of 99.2, muscle and joint aches, breast tenderness, site soreness, slight redness.  These symptoms were expected and my temperature was normal after taking a shower and drinking some water.  The chills persisted and I checked my temp a few times to make sure I didn&#39;t have a temperature.

I THOUGHT I was having a blood sugar issue, but that was not the case.  I went to sleep for about two hours, then woke up about 9pm feeling a little better.  I had NO pain in my arm or anywhere else and slept the entire night.    Friday (1/22), I developed pain and swelling in my breast, armpit, and injection site.  I literally  felt crappy all weekend.  Weird...????  I was confused this happened about ONE WEEK AFTER the vaccine. The injection site was the size of a golf ball, hard, and  quite warm.  I began to feel better after about 3 days, but the arm was still slightly red, sore, and there&#39;s a slight bump.

                                                On Friday evening, 24 hours after my 2nd vaccine, my left arm started to itch. My arm, underarm and left breast was very red, swollen, itchy,  tender to the touch and my arm felt sort of numb and weird.  Prior to feeling that way, I had a headache and the left side of my neck was tight and painful. I put some Benadryl gel and an ice pack on my arm and underarm. The following day it felt a little better but still had redness, swelling and itchiness. On Sunday when I went back to work, I had NP take a look at my arm. She felt I may have developed a cellulitis and prescribed Keflex 500mg QID x 7 days. Today, Monday, 2/15/2021, my arm is still a bit red and feels tight but is much better than it was on Friday and Saturday.

Dose 2 - 1:45 p.m. 4/16/2021 - two days later, like clock work, period cramping, heavy spotting. Dose 1 - spotting lasted 14 days, stopped the morning of my pelvic ultrasound to determine if there was something serious going on. Dose 2 - spotting started two days after vaccine, counting the days to see how long this lasts, with cramping. I am 59, no kids, never been pregnant, last period at age 39, menopause at 42 and still in menopause.  What is going on Moderna? A vaccine should not interfere with hormones or hormone replacement therapy. A vaccine cost me additional procedures  - still waiting on the bill for the ultrasound and several doctor appts, and lab work.
