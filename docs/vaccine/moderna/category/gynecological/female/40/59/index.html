                                                On January 4 at 2:00 pm I suddenly started to bleed from the nose from the left nostril and then from both. The event lasted more than 35 minutes so I had to go to the ER. The diagnosis was Epistaxis. I was discharged because at the time of the medical evaluation I removed a large clot from my mouth and the bleeding stopped.  Appointment with primary physician for diagnosis and appointment with ENT was ordered. On January 5 at 4:15 am I had another episode of nasal bleeding lasting 25 min. After removing a clot through the mouth, the bleeding stopped. At 4:00 pm I presented Epistaxis again so I had to return to the Emergency Room. I was reevaluated and the instruction was to visit the ENT and Afrin prescription for three days and Claritin D q 12 hrs PRN. From January 6 to 9, I began to eliminate a serous-bloody vaginal discharge. That began with the elimination of a clot and progressively diminished day by day.  January 11, 2021, the ENT evaluated me and indicated that it did not observe polyps or anatomical problems. I had not previously prolonged nosebleeds. Previously two minor episodes happened to me, a year ago that resolved in less than 7 minutes. I didn&#39;t have a cold or any other symptoms.  I want to raise the flag because it was a strange event that occurred after the vaccination and that I had not experienced before in that way.My next dose is January 29, 2021. I am awaiting clot test results

Pelvic/lower back/neck aches began evening of vaccination, around 10pm. Pain was significant enough to cause insomnia during the night and did not improve during the day after vaccination. Pain improved considerably after dose of ibuprofen mentioned above.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I believe the shot triggered a Lupus flare-up (beginning the evening of 3/30--date of the injection, and on-going). I developed bruising on my thighs, developed petechiae on my legs (common to my flare-ups), and was spotting (bleeding).  One week later, I am still very achy and lethargic. Also put me in a very depressed state. I have &#34;mild Lupus&#34; and typically only have a mild flare-up 3 or 4 times a year (and not lasting this long), so I am confident the injection triggered it. The bruising and spotting are new to me and not Lupus related, so those are of special concern.

                                                I have always had relatively heavy periods due to my diagnosis of VonWillebrand&#39;s disease.  Four days after receiving the vaccine, my cycle came on early and I had heavier bleeding than I have ever experienced with large clots.  The bleeding slowed down, but lasted for an entire month.   My cycle then returned to normal.  It seemed very coincidental that this happened immediately following the vaccine, and was not normal for me at all.  I recently read similar stories of other women reporting this, so while at the time it was concerning, I did not report it.  I am a firm believer in science and thought this was possibly just a fluke, but felt that after reading many stories of women having a similar experience, that the responsible action is to report this, to ensure that all of the data is being studied, since the vaccine is so new.  That being said, I only had mild side effects from the vaccine, and I am very grateful that I was able to receive the vaccine, as I have known quite a few people that have died from COVID.  This bleeding for me was not dangerous at any time, and while I was a bit faint, the bleeding during the course of the month did slow down and this all resolved.  Therefore, I would still get the vaccine again.  I should note that after my second vaccine, I had a few days of spotting outside of my cycle, which resolved as well.  I have had no issues since.

                                                Summary: Extremely long and heavy menstrual cycle, resulting in anemia,  after the covid vaccine.  I received the second dose of my vaccine on 02/14/2021. I was fully immunized on 02/28/2021. I should have started my period on the next day, or the day after. My cycle is usually 25-26 days.  My period started on 03/14/2021 instead (38 day cycle) and lasted for two weeks. It was extremely heavy during those two weeks, interfering with my daily life and preventing me from leaving home.  I started feeling dizzy and lightheaded and was still dealing with extremely heavy bleeding, so I went to the ER on 03/29/2021. My uterus had an extremely thick lining, identified on an ultrasound, and I was quite anemic. I was told I nearly needed a blood transfusion. Since 03/29/2021, I have been on daily birth control and progesterone to get control of the bleeding. I have only had a few days without bleeding in that time. I am now scheduled for a D&amp;C and uterine ablation to manage my bleeding.

                                                Bleeding. I had my period from 4/25-5/3. Cycle ended early morning on 5/3. After getting the 2nd covid shot I went to bed with a sore arm and headache. Just hours later I had chills and a fever and body aches. After taking tylenol I was able to fall asleep again.  I woke up around 2:30 to use the restroom and notice blood when I wiped. The bleeding was minimum throughout the day but since last night 5/6-5/7 it became heavy. Since having the mirena inserted my periods have been very light normally brownish in color,  this is the first time I have seen it heavy and bright red again.

                                                March 26th, 2021 I received the Moderna vaccine. After the Moderna vaccine, my arm felt very sore.  I was dizzy and tired.   On March 29,2021 I got a heavy menstrual cycle. It was the heaviest on March 31-April 2.  (March 14th, 2021 I put in a new nuva ring, I should not have gotten my period)  On March 29th, 20201 I went to the chiropractor. My lower back was hurting and I felt awful.    On April 8th I woke up to bloody blisters in my mouth. The right side kept bleeding and wouldn?t clot.  On April 9th,  I developed inflamed blood vessels all throughout my body from my head to my feet called purpura and petechiae. I called doctor immediately because bruises and red dots were spreading quickly. He sent to me immediately to get labs drawn at the hospital.  My platelets were critically low and I was told to head to the ER. From there I was admitted.  On April 9th, 2021, my blood platelets were 2,000. They are supposed to be 150,000-450,000  Prior to the vaccine,  a full  physical with labs were done by physician on March 22.  My platelets were 210,000. Everything in my labs were perfect.   Currently I am battling kidney stones. I had surgery on May 10th. I?ve never had a kidney stone in my life.

                                                Sudden vaginal bleeding in March, passing a large clot., only lasted a matter of 5-6 hours. Haven?t had a heavy period in years due to birth control. In May, have had a heavy period for 13 straight days. Again, haven?t had a heavy period in 20 years due to continuous birth control and never one that lasted more than 4-5 days. I?m on say 13 now, with no end in sight.

                                                The same night of the injection, I experienced shortness of breath and I had to concentrate on my breathing in order to breath. That right short hurt. A day or two this continued. After the next few days I was fine. The following week, I noticed under my right breast and right arm, I had limited moving and a lot of swelling. That arm from the deltoid down also was red and swollen. I contacted my doctor a week after my vaccination. My doctor recommended not getting the second dose due to how it affected my breathing more so than anything. There is still some swelling under my right armpit where my lymph node is but it is not anywhere as bad as it was, and my doctor is not concerned.

I went to ER because a lot of heavy bleeding soaking through pads and blood clots. I have NEVER experienced that much blood and NEVER have had large blood clots with my periods and my periods are always regular. It was scary and it was first period after getting shot. My breast also were itchy until menstural cycle and bleeding finished.

The patient said that she is now experiencing an irregular menstrual cycle.  She began bleeding within days of the vaccine, which is 2 weeks earlier than her expected menstrual cycle, which is typically very regular.  She sates that she is still bleeding today lightly.  I suggested that she contact her physician or OBGYN and would report perceived ADR.

                                                After the 1st vaccine, a week later I started my cycle. I thought it was normal. I bled for approximately 5 days, which is normal for me. Less than a week later, I was having weird, long, stringy clots. It reminded me of an abruption since the blood was burgundy in color. It was 3 days, but it still required a tampon. Then a week and 3 days later, I started bleeding again, but that time was for 8 days. At that point, that&#39;s when I called my OB and reported it on my V-safe. I didn&#39;t have the usual premenstrual symptoms. They did a pregnancy test, an ultrasound, lab work and a speculum pap exam, which including swabbing. The tests revealed nothing, so they told me that I&#39;m getting old and maybe I&#39;m just changing. After that, it didn&#39;t happen again and I&#39;ve had my normal cycle since then.  With exception of a sore arm, I didn&#39;t have any other side effects from the vaccine.

After the 2nd COVID vaccine my period started (approximately 48 hours later), but I was not schedule to start for another 2 weeks. Not only did I start early, but the blood loss is excessive and will not stop. I used a Diva cup that measures by ounce. I typically lose 1.5 ounces every 3 hour or 12 ounces of blood per day /24 hour period. When my doctor prescribed birth control the bleeding stopped for approximately 2 weeks and then started again. The newest pack of birth control has not stopped the bleeding. I am now so lathargic I am only awake 3 to 4 hours per day unable to work.

It made the sore arm and body aches from the vaccine seem like child&#39;s play. Now starting 2nd menstrual cycle early again,  3 days early, already increased bloodflow. I will submit another report if this cycle is as horrible as the first. Why aren&#39;t women warned of this?

And I am not pregnant and I had my tubes tied several years ago I also have pin point red blood spots on my chest and face since the vaccine. The dr wasn?t sure what they were.

Period characterized by heavy bleeding, increased cramping, dizziness. Had Ultrasound  and found no fibroids or cysts that could have caused issue.  In the end of March, I experience severe migraines/headaches and  vertigo for 10 days that was not amenable to medications. I went to ER, had MRI which was negative for acute disease. Went to neurologist 3 times during this illness. Received occipital nerve block with no help.  5 days after MRI, I had a Lumbar puncture to rule out infectious meningitis. Cultures were negative. Diagnosis was aseptic meningitis.

Jan 16 - 20 - fatigued, weak, and brain fogged. Slept a lot.  Jan 14-20 - had spotting which never happens.  I was on day 10 of my cycle on Jan 14.  Today is Jan 21 and I?m feeling better after taking a monolaurin supplement that treats chronic fatigue.

                                                A large area around my injection site was red, swollen, warm to touch, firm and itchy covering 3/4 of my upper arm into my underarm and lymph nodes.      I received my first vaccine on 12/23/20 several days after injection the site became very itchy, red and swollen but in a much smaller area and persisted for several days leaving a small area of skin hyper pigmented for ~2 weeks. However  I did not think it was considered an &#34;Adverse&#34; event and would have not reported it if the second dose was to a similar scale.  Also, when I received first vaccine I did not know I was pregnant at the time.   When I went to the doctor on 1/23/21 I was told I was 7.5 weeks pregnant, but there was no heart beat and  I had miscarried.  Being that I am over the age of 40 and a high risk for pregnancy and miscarriage  I am unsure if my miscarriage is directly related to the vaccine but I felt it should add it to the report.   My first vaccine was administered on 12/23/20 @ 5:30pm at Hospital

One day after my 3/4 of my upper arm  into my  axillary area became red, swollen, warm to touch, tender to touch, firm and itchy.  My axillary lymph nodes were also swollen and tender to touch.     My first vaccine was on 12/23/20. Several days after a small area around the injection site became swollen and itchy.  I also had a small palpable lump under my skin at the injection and my skin had a small area of hyper pigmentation for ~2 weeks. Again the area was much smaller and I did not think it would be considered an &#34;Adverse&#34; effect. I was also unaware that I was several weeks pregnant at the time of my first vaccine. when I went to the doctors office on 1/23/21 I was told I was 7.5 weeks pregnant, there was no heartbeat and I had miscarried.

                                                Within minutes after the vaccine I noticed my arm swollen and my fingers started swelling as well. It was moderate swelling though. the injection site swollen up and it was hard for me to breathe as well. Not sure if it was the shot itself or if I was just nervous, anxious about receiving the shot. I received the 1st dose on 01/13/21 and I was supposed to receive the second one on 02/10/21 and because I had a flare up on my face, my face swollen up around 01/21 - 01/24, and I found out that I had the infection on my gums and had to get the teeth extracted. It seems that after receiving the vaccine my overall health that is not at the best just got worse. I could not stand for a long period of time, it aggravated things that were already going on with my system.  It affected my uterus, I already have bleeding issues but now I have very heavy periods since the vaccine. And they are lasting longer. I also had a lot of pain at the injection site and also a severe headache.  I also am now battling 2 different kinds of yeast infection that are resistant to the meds given to me.

                                                I had a  couple of blood clots earlier in the week which I found weird. On Saturday morning I went to the bathroom and wiped and there was very bright red blood. I called and was told as long as I did not bleed through a tampon or pad not to worry and if I was still having issues to contact my primary on Monday. I went through 2 super tampons on Saturday. The color was very dark, almost black in color and sticky to the touch.  I did not need another tampon that night and it was gone the next day. I am and always have been VERY regular. My period is not due to start until the 15th of this month.

                                                I am experiencing VERY, VERY heavy menstrual bleeding and cramping. My period came 9 days early which is also HIGHLY unusual. My cycle is so regular that you could set your watch by it. I do not experience cramping or this heavy of a blood flow EVER. I am 41 years old, I have had my period since I was 10, so I know my body and my cycle pretty well by now. This is not normal and after consulting  my gynecologist, we feel this is not something that is &#34;wrong&#34; with me, but a side effect from the vaccine.

                                                Early and irregular menstrual cycle.  After receiving the 2nd moderna  vaccine my menstrual cycle was almost 2 weeks early, it was also very heavy flow with  lots of blood clots, and was very painful. Every period I have had since receiving the COVID vaccine has been uncomfortable and abnormal for me. Before I had a clockwork period that would start every 28th day, flow was heaviest on day 1 and 2(never more than 3 Menstrual cups full) and then tapered off on day 3 and 4 and no cramps.  My periods( hemorrhaging, clots and cramps) are much longer than 4-5 days per-vaccine, they are now lasting  up to 2 weeks.

My chest would get tight &amp; I would have sharp pains &amp; palpitations.  My period was also messed up from the shot &amp; I asked the heart doctor &amp; he said hormones can also mess with your heart. I think it is all connected with the messed up period &amp; heart palpitations from the shot. I read online that another person had palpitations due to the shot. They took magnesium, calcium, &amp; zinc &amp; felt a lot better. My friends husband had a heart attack &amp; the doctor prescribed magnesium for the rest of his life so maybe add some magnesium to the shot for the palpitations.

                                                Adverse effects after 1st dose: Nothing happened until exactly 24-hours later. Then the next day, from 3:00pm to 11:00pm: bad chills, body aches, no headaches though, tiredness, low energy, feverish. Took 2 sets of 2 tylenols. After 11pm, everything cleared.  Adverse effects after 2nd dose: BAD!!! Injection was at 2pm, reactions started by 4pm. All of the effects from the 1st dose but almost doubled in intensity and lasted 2-3 days: feverish, tiredness, unable to move body, body aches, muscle aches, headaches. Unable to work during those days!!!   Then additional effects: VERY heavy, torrential period! 1st day of period was Tuesday, May 18, one day late.   Then: Herpes outbreak on the anus (first outbreak in a long time).    WORSE EVENT YET: Around May 18, my ear was itching. I naturally have ear fungus that has been easily treated over the years. But this one did not go away.  I tried to apply the cream, clean. Nothing. By Thursday, I felt an inflammation. By Friday afternoon, I could not hear much from the left year and the right year was starting to be itchy too. Went to a Urgent Care, the RNP prescribed a drop and told me to take Ibuprofen if needed. By 10pm that night, I was in excruating pain: fever, chills, body aches, muscle aches, the ear pain gotten really bad (never experienced this level before), unable to chew, gotten really cold (needed 5 blankets). Long night. By morning, I went to the walk-in clinic of my healthcare provider - VERY sick. The ear has gotten worse and the NP explained that the body was probably unable to fight the small infection in the year because body was still under the virus effect. With my science background, I am afraid that she&#39;s right and/or that the Moderna covid vaccine has suppressed my natural immune system!!! I had a really strong immune system prior to the vaccine, records will prove it. Got sent to ER. They never took me seriously when I said that this is ALL related to the vaccine!!! Got a CT Scan, luckily the infection did not make it to the brain. They prescribed an antiobiotics and let me go. Now, ear pain moved to the right. I can&#39;t hear.

My period after was extremely painful, worse than normal.  I went to the doctor since I had an appointment and I told her about my situation. After the second dose I was getting a hematoma on my right thigh about 3-4 inches in diameter and hot to the touch.

I went to  Urgent Care Friday 5/21/2021, they were going to refer me to get an ultrasound and mammogram....the Ultrasound facility would not be able to see me until August 2021. The pain increased and throughout the week redness was noticeable on the skin. I went to Emergency Room 5/26/2021...they gave me antibiotics, performed an ultrasound and set and appt for a biopsy the next day. I went in 5/27/2021 for an ultrasound guided biopsy, where they drained the abscess. I took antibiotics for ten days and the lump went down. The culture results came back as 2&#43; Beta Hemolytic Streptococci, Group B, no white blood cells (PMNs) seen and no organisms seen. I have a follow up appt with my PCP 6/18/2021. I am unsure if this is related to the vaccine...but I have never experienced anything like this before and it was the same side I had the vaccine.

                                                After my Moderna vaccine, at about 6pm I felt my lymph nodes got swollen and my body started to ache.  I really started to feel harsher symptoms the next day on 02-20-2021;  just felt my lymph nodes more  swollen and tender to touch and I started to feel crummy. On 02-20-2021, I had an odd combo of symptoms, the pain I felt was like I was giving child birth, my uterus and ovaries were hurting really bad, had tender breasts, felt like I was lactating. I also felt like I had influenza A, where my whole body ached, these symptoms lasted a whole day. I slowly started to resume my normal activities. Since receiving the vaccine, I?ve have bad periods, pain like having childbirth.   My subsequent menstrual periods were horrible, had worse menstrual cycle.  My last menstrual cycle was not at bad at all. I called my gynecologist, reschedule for next week appt, the symptoms of menstrual period have subsided and I will be having have an appointment to see my gynecologist next week.

                                                After the 2nd vaccine, Around 2 PM 02/09/2021 I felt really bad. I started getting a fever, had the chills, a bad headache all at the same time. I just felt awful. All of my energy was drained out. My fever kept getting higher. The next morning I decided to take a Motrin and that got my fever down within an hour or so. By 3:00 PM 02/10/2021 everything just went away all at once. It only lasted 24 hours. My period started after I got the 2nd dose vaccine. That month everything was fine but it was the beginning of March that my period started being weird and liquid-y. I know this because I used a menstrual cup, and it was just all over the place and a bright red. It was a week late which is very strange. It lasted the same amount of days it usually lasts. In April it was still liquid-y and weird. In May it got better but it was only four days long. I&#39;m getting off my period right now (06/17/2021)  but this month (June) it&#39;s the same consistency but it only lasted 3 days and my period usually lasts 5-7 days. In May I had strep throat and went to urgent care, I tested positive for strep on May 16, 2021.

I wasn&#39;t bleeding heavily, just spotty, but it was definitely odd. Since I&#39;m on the pill, I usually bleed for 5-7 days and then I&#39;m done until the next one. I also started getting migraines every day, which usually happens due to extreme fluctuations in hormones. I just dealt with the bleeding and took some migraine meds.

                                                Began a menstrual cycle 2 days after first vaccine that never stopped. After 2nd dose vaccine bleeding became uncontrollable, hemoraging with massive clots. Unlike any bleeding or cycle I had ever experienced in my life. No medication would resolve the issue. After 110 days of a extreme, non-stop menstrual cycle I had an endometrial ablation. Nothing was found in my endometrial lining to explain the bleeding. The only cause was the vaccine. I was anemic given the months of bleeding, I had consistent headaches, fatigue, and an eye  twitch that developed on the left hand side.  Given that my only choice to stop the bleeding was to have a surgical procedure, I am now no longer able to have children after taking the vaccine.

                                                I got the shot around 10AM. Around 12:30PM I started to feel a mild flu. By 8PM that night, it was the worst flu I ever had. That lasted for about 2 days. Tuesday, the fever started to reside. I had crazy fatigue and brain fog. That lasted until about May 19th-20th. I started getting more energy. I barely had the energy to shower. I started to gradually feel better. I went back to work around June 1st. I was very tired in the mornings and the evenings. I started to feel all the way tired all day on the 14th. I got my period that day as well, so I thought it was related to my period. I have been feeling bad ever since. My neck will also just tighten up for no reason. I still have crazy fatigue. It&#39;s hard to concentrate. I&#39;m pretty much in bed all the time. On days that I do have energy, it will take one activity and then I&#39;m back in bed from fatigue. I have seen several doctors. I have been in for blood tests at clinic. I am just completely incapable. I get weird sensations in the nervous system. I experience what reminds me of a panic attack. It is extremely uncomfortable. The bleeding during my period was the worst it&#39;s ever been. I&#39;ve had loss of appetite. The cramps during my period were extremely bad. I can&#39;t hardly be in the sun because it exhausts me. I get out of breath because I&#39;m simply exhausted. I get random nausea. I&#39;ve done a lot of emotional work with depression and anxiety. I feel like I&#39;m fighting my own brain. The doctors are just stumped. There were a couple days where I felt like I should go to the ER, but I couldn&#39;t advocate for myself, so I just didn&#39;t go. The herbal biologist that I am seeing, her theory is that there is a virus in my system, and it took advantage of my lowered immune system while it was dealing with the vaccine. My mom had a weird thing happen when she was going through menopause that was very similar to what I&#39;m going through now.

Since I never experienced this pain outside of actual labor went to urgent care.  Thought could have kidney stones so walked next door to ER.   Luckily it was not stones and I was fine.  Went to ob and everything checked out fine.  I experienced this pain for roughly 6 hours prior to my menstrual cycle.  Once I would start the pain was better but I was bleeding clots (semi deflated grapes look).  This was 5/20/2021 and 6/14/2021.  When I started on 7/11/2021 the pain was gone.  So three periods after first dose extreme pain. Unable to move or do anything.

                                                Very quickly I began to feel nauseous and flush.  The nausea was strong and steady most of the night till around 9pm. My L arm kept falling asleep and my whole L side of my leg, I had to repeatedly move them around to wake them up. I had fever like sensations of hot and cold runny nose but no fever, and was tired. I slept fine but woke up to my menstral cycle starting 4 days early, significant joint pain and just sluggish. My hips were very painful most of today till around 2pm I took a nap and felt better. My joints still hurt but the pain is much more manageable now at 7:30pm.

Had started menstrual cycle on March 17, but post vaccine it was lighter than normal and then on the 22nd it became very heavy and there were lots of large blood clots. This has lasted an additional three days. My cycle usually lasts 5-7 days but day 2/3 are the heaviest and it?s usually very light by day 6/7. I have not had blood clots in several years. These are very large.

                                                Changes to menstrual cycle. Due around March 10 and started 2 weeks late, heavier than normal, unusual breast tenderness. Actually was researching ?recanalization? of husband?s vasectomy in May 2020 thinking I could be pregnant prior to starting menstruation. Just read an article that some women are reporting menstrual changes after getting vaccinated and I did for sure but never thought it could be related.

                                                I had an unusual menstrual cycle beginning March 24. I just started another cycle a few days ago, which is far earlier than normal (about 20 days difference vs. my normal 28 days). Further, this is a far more painful period with cramping, a lot of blood, quite a bit of acne and very tender breasts. The vaccine is the only X factor.   I did have other side effects from the second dose, though they all seem to be what was listed ? chills, extreme fatigue and headache.

Left side jaw and teeth pain began one week after shot and has not subsided after 3 weeks. Also, left side headaches. Pain is moving around and dentist felt it was related to the nerve and not a dental issue. This is still ongoing.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine I returned home to work. I started having stomach cramps like my cycle was starting. The cramps became worse and I started spotting. I took two ibuprofen but they provided no relief. I became nauseas and had a headache as well. I felt better the next day except my arm aches and mild stomach cramps. The cramps have continued still.

I received a Benadryl from the nurse on standby at the vaccination site and it seemed to resolve later that evening. Two days later on Sunday evening I began to get Menstrual cramps. At first I didn&#39;t think anything of it as I thought I was just ovulating because I had just had my menstrual cycle ending on April 5. The next day, Monday during the day I begin to get severe cramping and a feeling of nausea because the pain was so severe into Monday night and Continuing Tuesday Into the night.  Wednesday morning was more of the same and the pain seemed to lessen a bit by Wednesday evening.   The amount of blood was definitely more than a ?normal? For me.

Then my arm and armpit and back and breast on the left side began to swell and swell and swell until I couldn&#39;t keep my my arm down because it hurts my armpit but I also could not lift is because of the pain my shoulder and armpit and breast are all very swollen and red and hot. The fever and swelling are now working it&#39;s way down my torso and hip and leg and foot all on the left side. On Wed 4/21 I went to  Urgent Care and was tested for uti or kidney infection the result had blood in urine but as I am menstruating it was inconclusive. I had been give Ciprofloxacin to take Monday evening by a tele doc. Urgent Care ordered Prednisone 20mg 2 pills daily but the swelling keeps spreading. I have also been breaking out in sweats even just walking to the bathroom and am experiencing tiredness and severe loss of appetite and have lost 4 pound since 4/20 despite the swelling.

                                                My menstrual cycle changed drastically, temporarily, right around my vaccines. I am extremely regular with a normal cycle length of 26 or 27 days. I had my hormones checked less than a year prior to the vaccines as part of a routine exam and was told not to expect any age-related changes anytime soon. The cycle I was in when I received my first dose (12/30/20) was extended by about 3 days - not groundbreaking, but noticeable to me. Then following my second dose (1/27/21), I completely missed a period. So the 2 cycles during which I had my vaccines were 30 days and 53 days long instead of my usual 26-27. Now, a couple months later, I have returned to my usual schedule.  It was unsettling for my cycle to be affected and at first it didn&#39;t occur to me that it could have been related to the vaccine, but the timing was exactly aligned so it seems very likely it was causal.

Heavy bleeding. Tongue and throat mild numbness at the height of pain. Extremely painful to pass stool and urinate. Worst pain lasted two days. 8 days later mild cramps persist, passing stool still uncomfortable. Day 7 cramps got worse for half a day. bleeding/spotting lasted 7 days (usually 3). Night 7 arm started to hurt again and itch, hives formed injection spot. Next morning (now) arm feels hot, itchy, sore and irritated.  Still cramping in lower abdomen today.

I also had a rash on my left arm after first vaccination for a couple days. The 2 days following the first vaccine, I had no taste or smell (except sweet). 2nd vaccination: In the first 12 hours, arm started to hurt than whole body hurt intensely. Within one day, I was confined to bed. I could not see or hear. I experieinced cold sweats with hot and cold flashes.  My face swelled and I had broken capillaries on my face as well as 22 pimples. (I&#39;ve never had that before). It felt like I had a migraine in every joint and vertebrae in my body.  My breathing became labored within 36 hours of getting vaccine. Today, almost 2 weeks later, I still experieince consistent fatigue and intermittent heat and cold waves,

She had apparently experienced two strokes in the prior weeks, according to her chart.  On 04/28/2021, the patient stated she had been on her period for 5 days, the heaviest period she&#39;s experienced.  She was taken off her birth control meds due to TIA&#39;s she experienced a few weeks earlier, according to the patient encounter.

It&#39;s an extremely heavy flow with lots of cervical fluid and tissue, as well as large clots. I&#39;ve used the sympto-thermal method of birth control (checking temperature, cervical fluid, cervical position every day) for 18 years, and this is absolutely abnormal for me.

Much better now  on day 5 but continuing to experience intense, sudden  headaches and fasciculations in injection arm, particularly around the elbow.

My menstrual period started  earlier than expected this month (LMP 2/1/21, vaccine 2/7/21 and menstrual period 2/22/21) I am always regular - never early or late and wonder if this is a side effect of the vaccine.

However, over the course of the week I felt back pain on my left side.  Also by my left breast felt swollen.  Those symptoms eased up.  On March 10, 2021 a week later exactly at the injection site it started to swell and itch.  It was accompanied with pain and tingling.  It concerned me to the point that I went to my general practitioner in the morning on 03/12/2020.  He sated to take Tylenol and Benadryl and no steroids which will decrease the immune system.  He also said to follow up with the numbers on the card I received from the vaccine site.

                                                Extreme pain in joints/body aches developed approximately 12 hours after dose with front/side headache similar to migraine pain level with nausea; treated with Nyquil Cough at 3:40 am, Tylenol-650 mg at 7:30 am, and both at 3:30 pm on 3/11. On 3/12, body pain/aches gone, but left with migraine type headache and fatigue. Treated with Tylenol-650 mg on 3/12 at 7:30 am.  Fatigue continued until at least 10 pm 3/12 but gone on 3/13.   Main reason for report: I had an ablation performed and tubal ligation in December 2018 with no break through bleeding at any time since. On Day 28 after first Moderna dose, there was noticeable cramping in low abdomen not experienced since ablation. On Day 32 from first dose-- the same day as the second Moderna dose, there was cramping again in low abdomen and menstrual fluid appearing in urine- more red in color. On Day 33 post-first dose and Day 1 post-second Moderna dose, there was more break-through menstrual fluid- very dark in color typical of prior &#34;end of period&#34; fluid with similar odor, with continued cramping.  This continued, but lessoned on Day 2 post-second vaccine. I understand there can be failed ablations, but the timing seemed worth noting for you in case there is any pattern with impacts on menstruation.

The area where I got the vaccine started to get hard.  I felt my breast tender especially my left one and I felt pain put my collard bone to by neck (left side).  Today (5 days later) my arm is not as swollen, or hot but still itches and is a bit red. I still have pain on my neck and left breast.

                                                Sore arm at injection site, extreme fatigue, sudden onset uncontrolable menstrual bleeding &amp; blood clots, felt faint &amp; had some blurred vision.  Heavy bleeding &amp; heavy clotting continued until next morning (I have not had any issues with my cycle since my surgery last year so this was not normal).  Woke up with fever of 100.7 Saturday morning at 4:57am; fever did not go away until Saturday 8:45pm.  Had flu-like symptoms, fatigue, fever, chills, intense all over muscle soreness.  Felt better &amp; symptoms were gone by Tuesday 03/02/2021.  Menstrual cycles went back to normal following month after 2nd vaccine.

I have read several articles stating this as a side effect of the J&amp;J vaccine but not Moderna.  Just thought it should be noted as other female friends I know have noted changes in their cycles after receiving same vaccine.

                                                Probably unrelated but I am on day 3 of my normal menstrual cycle (typically 5-7 days).  Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccination I began passing large clots and my flow went from regular to heavy. I do have heavy cycles from time to time but found the abrupt change in cycle interesting. Other than being sore in the arm and tired I feel fine.

Two days later a very heavy flow started with heavy clotting. Normal hormonal headache was present as well during this extra period.

This is not a common occurrence for this patient. It is important to look at this side effect of the vaccine.

March 2021 extremely heavy period causing me to miss a day of normal activity. Low iron levels now anemic.  Night sweats cause  me to wake up, change sheets and pjs every night. Anxiety and mood swings. Confusion and at times I cannot recall words. Temperature remains under 97°F. Chills, aches, joint paint, pale and dry skin despite drinking water. Recently a large hemorrhoid has appeared requiring me to see doctor. My finger and toes are painful and red and it feels as if my vascular system is ?off?.  Hence, the hemorrhoid. I have been out of work for 5 days and cannot stop sleeping.  I have almost gone to the ER just to get peace of mind with what is wrong with me. I get out of breath quickly. I?m starting to feel very frustrated with physical pain and am becoming very weepy.

The following day, these symptoms all resolved, but I felt what I can only explain as &#34;manic&#34; - very high energy, poor ability to concentrate, people around me that day commented that I was &#34;very talkative.&#34;  This lasted for about 12-18 hours. One week after the vaccine, I experienced an irregular menstrual period - very light, on and off spotting for several days. No treatment was sought for any of these symptoms.

                                                Day 15 post-vaccination, woke up with a vaginal bleeding similar to menstruation. It was very heavy, lasted 6 days, and I was passing clots. No medical help was needed or sought, but it was uncomfortable. I am in premature menopause and do not menstruate. I take HRT. Following my first Moderna shot, I had a very similar bleeding as well, starting the morning after. I have not had any vaginal bleeding following these two (after the first and second Moderna shot).  Besides these effects, within hours of this second dose, I was feeling tired. I woke up the next morning with body aches similar to that of influenza, a temperature of 99.5, which is quite elevated for me, and overall tiredness. These symptoms resolved by next morning, when I woke up with a throbbing headache. It resolve following one dose of 200mg generic ibuprofen.

                                                The night after the shot I developed COVID arm which burned and itched and swelled up. The next night a rash spread to my arms and trunk. The next night my right leg swelled up horribly and got a rash as well on my upper quad. My eyes burned for days after the shot and my eye doctor said my eye lids were inflamed and gave me steroid eye drops to help. The next night I woke up in the middle of the night itching my face. My whole face was covered in a rash that burned and was swollen. I had 4mg pills of methylpredisolone on hand at home and self treated with three pills (one each day for three days) and that helped with the swelling and Benedryl helped with the itching. I started having heavier periods at increments more than once a month (like once a week). I also have experienced significant weight gain - almost 10 pounds - in the month after the shot. I have weighed the same thing since I was in college and still wear the same clothes until after the shot. The periods have subsided but the weight is still here and I&#39;ve done nothing else differently.

At the same time my period started    early full force.  It was as if I Haden;t just had my period less than 2 weeks prior, but I had,  I&#39;ve had relatively irregular cycles since I was 13, but I haven&#39;t; had one this bad for a long, long time.  I felt awful for 5 full days, slowly recovers for 4 more days, then I was fine.  The only lingering effects was my eczema became super inflamed and never calmed back down. And my right arm where I got my 2nd shot was soar for 2 weeks.

June 1st and morning of 2nd: spotting.  - June 2nd - bleeding stopped altogether immediately after 2nd dose received.  - June 6th - bleeding started back up 4 days later. - June 7-8 -- extremely heavy bleeding (unusual). - June 9 -- light  - June 10 -- nothing (also unusual as my periods usually taper off and last at least 7-8 days)  - June 11 -- back up again with a light day (strange). - June 12 -- official end but post-period I did not have the usual ovulation discharge . This was a highly unusual and erratic cycle, that was inconsistent with my typically predictable periods.

                                                In my first 2 menstrual cycles following the 2nd dose of my COVID-19 vaccine (approximately 2 weeks later), menstruation phase was significantly heavier and longer than my normal menstruation phase. Normal (currently on an Mirena IUD) currently is 5-6 days of hormonal changes and very light. brown or dark colored spotting, with very little red blood, that peaks on day 2 or 3. After the vaccine, menstruation for the next two cycles lasted 8 full days of bright red discharge which was daily heavier than normal conditions and consistent across the days (did not get more or less for 8 days). However, it was never so heavy to be dangerous (e.g. still rarely used a tampon). The concerning or noticeable change was both the color and the length of time. Have only had 2 menstrual cycles so far.

Approximately 2 hours after receiving my first dose of Moderna, I got my period. I googled and saw other reports of other women having this issue- so thought I better report it as it may effect menstrual cycles.

My neddle was normal and was not discharge or  I suspect a probable breast cancer and perform a mammogram like previus BIRADS 2 findings.   Inflamation decrease and desapear within the next week. It was normal at the time of the second dose.  This event was repeated 48 hours after receiving the second dose.

                                                Irregular menstruation starting 1/25. I track my temperature, so I was supposed to menstruate and felt cramping but no bleeding. The same thing happened in February. I did resume menstruation in March.  I realize this isn&#39;t a serious event, but I saw an article today that is linking the Covid vaccine with menstruation changes.

On 4/14 (one month post second dose) suffered very strong cramps, followed by an very heavy menstrual period. The menstruation too place 11 days after the last one, which was within a regular 22 day cycle. I have always had a very regular cycle and never one that started 11 days after the previous one. Bleeding was so heavy, I had to stay in bed for 2 afternoons and even considered a trip to the ER.

                                                My menstrual cycle started 7 days early. My cycle is always exactly 28/29 days apart with a heavy flow. Very regular FOR YEARS. Can set a calendar by it.  I was shocked when it started 7 days early! There would be no other reason except a side affect from the vaccine.  I have read this happening to others, but being looked at as an anecdote, however with younger people getting vaccinated now, I am looking forward to learning of this is more common among women in their reproductive years.

MY SYMPTOMS WERE MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED &amp; DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE REPORTED! DAY 1 - 4/10/2021 11:50 am Got the first shot of Moderna Stayed for 15 min before being released. No symptoms at that time.  12:35 pm The following symptoms started (in that order) 1. Shivering &#43; symptoms of a cold 2. Mucus in the throat 3. Mild headache 4. Pain in the jaw, jaw muscle weakness (cotton mouth?)  it felt like my jaw was shaking as if I had drunk a lot of coffee 5. Tongue felt numb, I couldn&#39;t talk properly 6. Salivated a lot 7. Elevated heart rate 8. Whole face, jaw, head, hands and body were shaking 9. Teeth grinding

                                                I started having menstrual cramps on Tuesday, 4-27. I had some spot bleeding yesterday and seem to have actually stayed menstruating today. I have always been very regular and even more so on Larissia. The cramps started 11 days after my first shot, 13 days before it was expected. This is really unusual for me.  I have been tracking my period for a few years and the only time it has been irregular was when my body was adjusting the last time I quit birth control. I have no tests or treatment to report other than the usual ibuprofen if the cramps get bad. I also have had headaches on and off, but it was the extremely early period that drove me to report.

                                                I had severe acid reflux and heart pain and searing shoulder pain near my neck for two months. The neck pain has mostly gone away as well as the reflux and mostly the heart pain. My period last have been spot on regular bleeding for 5-7 days like clockwork every 28-30 days  for years and immediately after the second shot I have almost had zero period. I had a day of bleeding in March, then nothing, a day of bleeding in April, then  very minor spotting for two weeks now.  It?s most definitely related to the shot and not peri menopause since I was so regular up until that second shot.

                                                This is a follow up report. I first reported severe vertigo that started 7 days after the vaccine and lasted 12 days. I thought that was the end of my symptoms but I was very wrong. After that, I experienced severe swelling of my right hand which 12 weeks later has not thoroughly resolved. I have numbness and tingling in my hands and feet that comes and goes. My right leg feels heavy at times and the thigh muscles go into spasms. The vertigo is back although in a mild form. I started having joint pain in my fingers, knees, and toes that comes and goes. My entire body is a mess. It&#39;s as if you took me out of my regular healthy vibrant body and stuck me in the body of an 80 year old person. On top of it all, my menstrual cycle has also been affected. None of these side effects were mentioned to me beforehand. You said your vaccine is safe. YOU LIED.

Note: for three days after first vaccination, we noticed excessive bleeding from minor abrasions on the roof of mouth. We also noticed bruising as a consequence of minor bumps to arms, legs, and torso.  After both vaccinations, in other words, we noted that her blood did not clot as normal.

                                                with this 1st of 2 shots I began getting a headache that began within 1 hour after the shot.  The headache immediately became intense and stayed.  Advil did not do anything for it.  That same evening I began having intense abdominal pain on my right side, it became so bad I was scared my appendix was going to burst.  I had my son on standby to take me to the hospital.  It was so severe I could not stand.  The only way that I can describe the pain would be: after natural birth and you begin nursing, the insanely intense contractions of the uterus to shed the afterbirth is how intense the pain was. I then started my menstrual cycle but was not supposed to for another week and 1/2.  The pain stayed, but did dull some, it wasn&#39;t as sharp but still intense.  My flow was extraordinarily heavy and I lost count of how many huge blood clots I passed.  Some clots were the size of my palm.  This cycle lasted a full 7 days.   My normal cycle starts with a little spotting, then 1 or 2 days of medium flow, then a couple days of spotting.  I also do not have my cycle every 30 days, more like 38-40.  I figure its pre-menopause.

But my period came unexpectedly 5 days early on April 15. It was a very light flow and only 3 days long. My regular period is about 7 days.  My next period came on May 8th. At first spotting, then full period. This was a more normal 7 days.  I had my second dose vaccine injection on May 17th at 11am.  I had a fever for 3 days with shivers and body pains. Suddenly the fevers and chills just stopped after 3rd day.  No one else in my family in our household got obvious side effects (all men).  I got a vaginal yeast infection which was treated at home with over the counter medication on May 27th.  Very rare to get for me.   My 3rd period started on June 2nd. Very heavy flow with a lot of back pain.   My periods are now random and just not normal.

                                                Until March 27th, 2021, I was a healthy individual who could perform life&#39;s all responsibility full of energy. Daily I use to do one hour of Yoga medication and almost every day 5 miles walking.  Although, I met with a car accident on May 5th, 2017, and got some problems with my neck and Lumber. I could manage that pain by doing yoga  &amp; meditation. 1.On March 27th, I got the covid vaccine first short. I got a fever and experienced energy loss. I am facing energy loss until today.  2. On April 2nd evening, I  started feeling itching all over my body which increased tremendously by 11:30 pm, my tongue got heavy, and numbness was there. My husband called the emergency call doctor. She suggested taking antihistamine if I have it at home immediately, and if the heaviness of tongue won&#39;t go, visit ER ASAP.  I took Benedryl and slept. 3.Slowly, my right leg started Paining while walking. I noticed swelling and swollen nerves on my ankle, calf, and knee. Also, on April 3rd, I got my periods which were the heaviest periods of my whole life. I visited my physician and told her about my right leg and heavy periods. She suggested I do a vein study. I immediately did it. The doctor found I have venous insufficiency in both legs and fluid in the right knee. She recommended wearing compression socks until six weeks and visit again.  She also said venous insufficiency is not my leading cause of leg swelling and to see my physician again.   4.Slowly, My walking and yoga both stopped due to lots of pain in the legs. My energy levels kept on going down.   5.I kept feeling dizziness, heavy and squeezed feeling in my heart, sweating, neck pain, lower back pain, cold feet, hot feeling in head, and headache along with tiredness.  6.On April 28th, I took 2nd covid 19 vaccines; I   got a fever, bad back pain, and headache. I was hoping to get it better, but it kept on increasing. Pain in the right leg and ankle increased. I got my periods in the first week of May. Periods were heavy; I started experiencing lower back pain, which radiated all over my back, neck, head, pain in the left side of my chest, moderate pain left lower abdomen, dizziness.   I called my physician she said to take a pain killer. I started taking it but found no satisfactory results.   7.I went to the Urgent Care on May 21st due to a bad headache and dizziness. Doctors found I have High Blood pressure.  The doctor said it might be just today. So suggested pain killer. 8. I started monitoring my BP; it kept coming between 139/97-140-96. Hence I went to ER on the 25th when BP reached 140/96, and I felt pain in the left side of my body, such as left side chest pain, which was elevated towards the left hand and neck, jaw, headache, back pain  In ER, too, my BP was 149/92. The doctor gave me BP medicine and advice to see my physician and neurologist. 9. I saw a Neurologist who suggested doing an MRI of the head. I visited my physician, who referred me to a Cardiologist and changed my BP medicine.  10 I saw a Cardiologist too; he doesn&#39;t see any immediate danger to my heart: suggested echocardiogram and Stress test.  11.At present, as mentioned earlier, pain is as it is; blood pressure keeps ongoing high as 125/87 or sometimes 135/92. If I do routine work such as household work, attending office calls, or talking, working more than 30 min on a laptop affects me badly, and pain alleviates. This pain indeed changed me and affected my day-to-day life adversely.  12. Currently, I am experiencing the following conditions:  Pain in -right leg left chest area with tightness feeling, neck shoulder, hand, left abdomen, lower back, headache in the back portion,  pain in the backside of ear, nose, jaw Legs -cold feet. tingling sensation in toes, right leg swollen Head- I feel dizziness and headache, a hot sensation on the top of the head. Face- left cheek sometimes swells when BP  raises. When my bp gets higher, I feel hot in my head and ear. I can feel a lump on the ear point, which hurts.

I also feel pain on my left breast. My blood pressure was 15-20% higher than two years ago (I did not consistently monitor my blood pressure.  so I am not sure if it is related to vaccine)

                                                Two months after completing the second Moderna vaccine, my menstrual cycle has changed.  In May, my cycle was extremely lighter than normal. In June, I experienced passing of 1 large blood clot daily  with no menstrual flow from June 1 to June 16.  From June 17 to June 24, I&#39;ve experienced a heavier than normal flow with the passing of multiple large clots throughout the day. From June 25 to current, I have no more clots but still have a menstrual flow. The gynecologist commented that it could be a side effect of the vaccine or my fibroids. I have had my fibroids for over 15 years and my fibroid symptoms took place while in my twenties. No treatment was suggested. Simply wait and see.

                                                since getting the first dose of the covid vaccine, I began having my period every two weeks. As a person who has always suffered from migraines during menstruation, this increase in my periods  doubled the number of debilitating migraines I get each month. My period comes every two weeks now and it doesnt seem to be going back to normal. I would have never taken the vaccine if I had known this could happen. I may not be able to maintain full time employment, as there is no drug that works on my migraines and i have to miss work when they occur. Thank god I am not interested in having more children bc this has done something to my reproductive/hormonal system.

Also, I feel my immune system ramped up which is exacerbating my adrenal-thyroid condition and making it difficult to calm down and fall asleep at night.

                                                Started my regular scheduled monthly period on Saturday following vaccination.  I had stronger than normal cramping for 3 days following.  My periods normally last 3-4 with a day or two of normal flow.  I am on my 5th day of menstruating&#39;s and my bleeding is extremely heavy.  I have also had clotting larger than a dime sometimes much larger than a quarter.  I have never experienced a period like this.  I have not been checked for uterine fibroids or anything else as this is the first month this has happened.  I cannot say for sure that this is related to the vaccine but did feel I should report it since it is abnormal for me.

I am not in menopause and I am on the birth control pill so my period comes like clock work.  After the first dose of the vaccine I did have a little spotting for a day or two.  I know one other person that is experiencing the same thing.  She is also same age as me .  Something is not right.

                                                Dr. told me to take Benadryl (25mg) the day before and of the 2nd dose.  He told me to continue taking it for 10 days. That night I took Tylenol Extra Strength 500mg and Advil 660mg that night. The next day, my arm was very swollen, even more than it was with the 1st dose. My body ached and I felt so weak. Because of that, I took more Tylenol along with the Bendadryl I was already taken. The 3rd day, my lymph node was swollen and my left breast was tender. I called the NP at clinic and she told me to get checked for COVID, which was negative. On the 4th day, my arm was still swollen and I was nauseous. The next few days were the same and then nothing remarkable. Still having the pain on my right side. The rash is still bright red at times, otherwise it&#39;s normal.

                                                My last period prior to my first vaccine shot had been in June 2020.  All signs, including blood work, pointed to me having entered menopause.  My mom also went through menopause at age 45 when her periods suddenly stopped, so I figured I was following in her footsteps.  On Saturday, February 13, 2021, I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, and by Thursday morning, I was spotting.  This was very surprising since I had not had a period in several months.  Over the course of a couple of days, it turned into a full-blown period with the most severe cramping I&#39;ve ever had in my life.  By Saturday, they felt like labor contractions, and I was releasing sizable blood clots.  I made an appointment at our health clinic, and all bloodwork again pointed to menopause.  After my 2nd Moderna vaccine, I again experienced just a tiny bit of brown spotting a few days after the vaccine.  However, it did not progress into a full-blown period that time.

                                                On same day (Saturday) as vaccine I got covid arm. Site around area was hard and as big around as an orange. Very itchy. Very sore. Rash from site down to wrist of left arm which is the arm I got shot in. Had all symptoms thru Tuesday. On the following Saturday one week later, all symptoms returned. Only this time the hard knot wasn?t as big. Maybe the size of a golf ball. Had symptoms till around tues or wed.  Site area continues to flare up, itchy rashy, fever like, maybe once a week. It?s Monday before I get my second dose Saturday coming up and it was hot and rashy for a few hours today.   Also, my whole life I?ve never had a period longer than 4 days and never have worn pads during my period only panty liners. Never had a heavy period. This month I started my period on 4/11/21 and for the first 5 or 6 days it was lite as usual but longer than normal. And a dark red. It?s now 4/19/21 and the last couple days it?s been very very heavy and bright red. With today 4/19 being the heaviest so far. There?s been no break in it. I?m now on day 8 and it?s heavier than it?s ever been my whole life. I?ve had a normal regular period since I was 15. I have no children by choice if that helps somehow.  I have not gone to the dr for any of these side effects.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Up until recently, I have had a predictable cycle every 28 days, lasting 7 days, beginning heavy and tapering out.  At the beginning of 2021, I began to enter the perimenopause stage.  My first gap was 37 days (normal period length/strength) and my second gap was 48 days.  My most period came after my first vaccine (at the end of 48 day gap).  I felt it was lighter and less discharge.  It ended after the normal 7 days.  I had 2 days of nothing (as to be expected).  I then began to have some brown discharge and mild cramping/discomfort.  This was not heavy enough for a pad or tampon, only a panty liner was needed.  The brown discharge occurred for about 3-4 days when small amounts of fresh, bright red blood began showing.  This has been occurring for the past 3 days, along with continued mild cramping/discomfort.  I am still in the middle of this discharge which now alternates between fresh blood drops and brown discharge.  I was originally scheduled to have my second dose tomorrow but have decided to postpone it as I don&#39;t want to chance blood clots.  Additionally, I am 45 years old and have had 3 children.  I have never had a menstrual cycle closer than 26 days apart.  I have NEVER had any blood discharge after my normal 7 day cycle.  Another matter to consider is that I have a blood clotting disorder called Factor V Leiden, heterozygous.  I did hemorrhage after giving birth to my third child but have had no other clotting issues.

                                                I started feeling like I was getting my period even before I got my second shot. On the one hand, maybe I was and it was just a coincidence. I had the typical brain fog, muscle and overall body fatigue. Nothing horrible, but it was there. The second shot itself was no big deal and I went about my day no problem afterward. I was just surprised when I started menstruating given that I haven&#39;t actually bled in more than a year because I am on the Mirena IUD (inserted in 2018). Period symptoms like tender breasts and being foggy heads or tired for a day is one thing, an actual period is another. I haven&#39;t even had spotting in at least a year, probably two. I had active (light) bleeding for 2 or 3 days. I am now two and a half weeks post my second shot and my breasts are as tender as if I am getting my period imminently, which doesn&#39;t make sense at all given the timing. I had the most painful mammogram I have ever experienced in my life on Friday (April 23) though the results were clear. Other than that, and since the moment I got my shot,  I have felt perfectly fine. Maybe a little tired and hungover feeling the day immediately after the shot, but nothing more.

My period was heavier for a longer duration than it typically is. It was not necessarily heavier, but the heaviness lasted longer. This level of heaviness typically lasts for one day and after the vaccine it lasted for three days.

On this day, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema was noted in addition to knee pain/swelling. My period lasted for 26 days, stopping finally on 15-MAY-2021. It was light. The lower extremity edema also subsided around this time. The knee pain and swelling stopped 0n 28-APR-2021.

Which on June 30 (the day I had the 2nd Moderna vaccination) is supposed to stop the bleeding and it seemed that way. But on June 1 when I got up, the bleeding returned more profuse, until today June 2 continues and does not seem to stop. And everything happened to me after the vaccines. I don&#39;t know if it has anything to do with it. And I have not been able to see any gynecologist because everything is by appointment and the closest appointments are for November or December. And they don&#39;t see it as something of an emergency or priority. And I worry about my hemoglobin. Although for the rest I feel normal.

                                                Exceptionally heavy menstruation for two cycles after the administration of the first and second dose of the Moderna covid vaccine.    I experienced an exceptionally heavy menstrual flow two weeks after the first Moderna covid vaccine (reported to VAERS).  After the second vaccine I again experienced two more cycles of extremely heavy menstural flow. The flow was notable because it was as heavy or heavier at times than post-partum  bleeding after having two completely natural births.  Both cycles were so heavy they interfered with my daily activities including work. This have never happened to me before in the preceding 35 years of menstruation.   I recently completed a third menses which was typical and normal for me.  Please do not insult me by attributing heavy menses to ?psychological effects? of receiving the Moderna covid vaccine. I am not an anxious, stressed person, I do not have a needle phobia, I fully expected to be just fine after the vaccine, and I received it in a comfortable, efficiently run, familiar location accompanied by my loving, supportive husband who also received the vaccine.    This is a genuine, unaknowledged side effect that needs further study. It is exceedingly embarrassing to bleed though my clothing at work because heavy menses was unexpected. I had to go home to change and had to inform my (male) superior of my need. Sure wish this would be part of the educational piece of side effects!

                                                I experienced typical immune response symptoms as explained in provided literature and from public sources such as the CDC and my local health department.  In addition to typical symptoms of an immune response (fatigue, headache, muscle aches) that were transient, I also experienced an exceptionally heavy mensuration two weeks after the immunization. This is NOT caused to situational stress or anxiety. I fully expected to be just fine after the immunization, I have no needle phobia, and the vax clinic was in a familiar setting staffed with kind, efficient, and professional volunteers and medical staff. I was with my husband who is a loving, supportive partner.    I assure you that there was no ?psychological? effect that caused heavy menses after the immunization as is stated in much of the news sources; it was not ?all in my head? as the CDC a state health department seem to think. I am quite insulted that this side effect is regarded as such. I though medical professionals could look past Stereotypical ?female histrionics?  and consider this a side effect.  A second unusual symptom I experienced was a lack of control of my temper.  Situations that I would normally  find mildly irritating or slightly frustrating were sources of extreme anger and frustration. This occurred 72-96 hours after the immunization.

                                                I experienced overactive bladder and excessive urination  starting a couple weeks after the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine for Covid-19. I then experienced fatigue and headache along with an early and excessive menstrual cycle lasting longer than normal by 10 days so far. The bleeding is on and off heavy and I am very concerned that my menstrual cycle is interrupted and still going on for 15 days.

                                                My first shot was 4/15/2021 and my second shot was 5/13/2021. I experienced the same type of reaction to both shots, but at different stages and extremes.  From my first shot on  4/15/2021. I felt fine until 3 weeks later on 5/5/2021 when my back started aching, then at the base of my spine, it felt like fluid was collected at the base and it was extreme pain - I could not sit down or bend over for a week. After a few days it started to get better, but then my knee started swelling and I could not do simple tasks for 2 days. I could not walk down the stairs, but then on 5/12/2021 it seemed to rectify itself.  I did tell the nurse about my ailments before my second shot and they said they had not heard of anyone having these symptoms, and said perhaps I should not get the 2nd shot, but I was told that I had to for my job and I just wanted to get it over with. A friend of mine had said she experienced the same back pain, so I thought maybe it was just a vaccine side effect and decided to get the second shot on 5/13/2021. The next day was brutal. I had a headache so bad for 4 days I could not think or do any work or even leave my bed. On the 2nd and 3rd day I was dizzy - the room was spinning like I was drunk and  so I stayed in bed, but then on Tuesday, 5/17/2021 I started to feel better and the headache went away. Then I felt fine for several weeks until 6/19/2021. I started to get a backache, then my stomach swelled like I was having period cramps, but it was 2 weeks until my period, so I should not feel this. My uterus felt so swollen and painful. My back started to hurt badly and fluid felt like it was collecting on the base of my spine again. I could not sit down or get up from bed or bend over from the pain. This lasted for 9 days until it slowly alleviated. But one thing that was different in this episode is that a lump suddenly appeared on my inner right thigh. I read an article that the vaccine causes swollen lymph nodes. I assume that is what it is. It showed up on 6/19/2021 and as of today, 6/28/2021 it is still there. I have not seen a doctor because I have no primary care physician at the moment. I am monitoring my thigh lump, it seems to have gone down slightly, but it is still there today (6/28/2021). My back still hurts slightly, but not as bad. I am continuing to monitor my symptoms.

After receiving the first dose of the moderna covid vaccine, I had a light period about 13 days before I should have, and then a regular period on schedule.  After receiving the 2nd dose, I didn&#39;t have my regularly scheduled period (I am going on 15 days late as of today).

                                                The main reaction I am experiencing is vaginal bleeding started May 20th 2021 and has not stopped it is now July 7th 20th 21 there have been days where it was spotty others were just normal type. Days. In the beginning I was 10 days early for my typical menstrual cycle and the blood seemed to be old. It was dark in color and not like a fresh shedding of the uterine wall. And then we&#39;re my normal period cycle came up it turned to what appeared to be my typical bleeding I continued to spot. And today on July 7th I started having clots large blood clots fresh in color but a lot of bleeding I have had two periods since it&#39;s began and July 7th would be a week after what would have been my typical cycle.  Another side effect of experiencing is painful cramping of my hands and feet and occasionally my calves. It&#39;s to the point where pressing on the gas pedal can make my toes cramp when driving holding grocery bags with my hand cramp. Any kind of body stretch will make any of my muscles cramp I never know which one.  I&#39;ve had multiple side effects starting with a raised bumpy rash on both sides of my face. They were not pimples they never came to a head a few of the bumps ended with small scab on them I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s from me scratching at times it was itchy they started May 20th and I have just a scattering of the bumps at this point July 7th 2021.

On Saturday somewhere after 5 I was dizzy, nausea, very fatigue. I didn&#39;t know what was going on but I dranked orange juice. I was scared to eat because of nausea. I did not feeling better until the following Sunday or Monday which was 6/19-20/2021. I fought all week to feel better again I didn&#39;t think of anything. I just took Vitamin C gummies(2 a day), orange juice, noodles, iron(Ferrous Sulfate). Just last week some time I just realize I had not seen my cycle since May and it&#39;s now July. Well correction it was the last week of May into the first week of June.

                                                Vaccine given March 18   Menstruation began five days early on March 20. Lasted six days. Very heavy. Unusual. Nine days after the period ended, another menstruation period began on April 2. The bleeding is VERY heavy. Very unusual as I?m in perimenopause.   Recap: since Moderna shot one period came early and then a second period nine days later. Very heavy both.

                                                Metallic taste filling mouth within first two minutes of injection, lasting for three hours.  Cold sweat and the feeling of possible fainting lasted ten minutes. Nausea occurred for 24 hours. Swelling of lymph node in the armpit of the left arm (non-injection) arm as well as a feeling of burning near the underside of the arm just above left elbow lasting 48 hours. When the metallic taste resolved, it was replaced by an indescribable taste lasting for two hours. Within 24 hours, a strong smell of &#34;plastic&#34; for two hours was replaced by the strong smell of &#34;burnt toast/burning&#34; for several hours.  The lymph node in the left arm still feels swollen but less so, and it six days past the injection date. Menstruation began a week early, which has not been off schedule for ten years, so it feels related. I hope this helps; feel free to reach out if you have additional questions.

I also had very sore and tender breasts and became bloated like I was going to start my cycle. I finished my cycle two days prior to getting the shot, so these symptoms are not normal at this time. I still have some cramping and off and on bloating. My breasts hurt off and on. I have started slightly spotting. I should not have my cycle until the end of the month. I told my doctor about these symptoms and she said they sound related and to report this.

                                                Vaginal Bleeding began 2 days after vaccine. I had a uterine ablation in 2018 and have not had a period at all until 2 days after receiving 2nd dose of Moderna. It was not a regular period. I bled heavily for a couple of weeks, then lightly for a week or so, and then started bleeding heavily again following. Currently I am still experiencing vaginal bleeding like a period but more frequent (every 2 weeks as opposed to once a month). It has now been 2 months since the last dose of the vaccine and I continue to have this pattern of bleeding. My MD is aware and when I questioned the vaccine, I was told it probably was not related, but offers no other explanation.

                                                several hours after the shot i got very tired / sleepy. had to sleep. slept until the next day. had a fever that lasted  . had general body achiness. chills and teeth chattering. bundled up in layers and got under a blanket..had to simply lie still and sleep, drink , eat crackers. when i checked my fever it was above 100. at other times i believe i had a fever but it was lower. had a short pronounced episode of nausea while walking around the next day after eating a piece of chocolate. had to lie down pronto. so then decided to stay horizontal as much as possible. rest/sleep  and being horizontal/still  were necessary. i also had loose stool but not a big deal.that may or may not have been related to vax. also for context my menstrual cycle had started the morning of april 21st.

I have had the Paraguard  IUD for almost two years, used to heavy periods but they are regular in cycle length and usually only have one very heavy day. I keep track in a period calendar. It has only been 5 days since my last period ended, which also lasted two weeks?one week light spotting, one week heavy flow. Today I?m having menstrual cramps again.

She states after Having the vaccine in April when she started her menstrual period in May.  She states she felt the blood coming out and started for the bathroom but before she could get there she had blood soaked through her clothes and pouring onto the floor.  She placed a super tampon, and a large pad and was soaking through these every 10-15 min.  after about 45 min the bleeding stopped as quickly as it had started.  She mentioned this to some of her female co-workers.  Several of them reported similar but less dramatic symptoms. They had all had the same Moderna covid-19 vaccine as it was provided by the employing company.

It wasn?t just the one cyst that had a reaction, it was across my entire left breast and part way through my right.  Lymph nodes were not swollen.

                                                Extreme menstrual disruption. Despite being on a continuous birth control pill, which means I normally never get my period, I menstruated for more than four weeks! That has literally never happened, not even close, not on or off the pill, ever in my life. I was so concerned I made a special appointment to see my gyno to get checked out. She thought it could be related to the generic version of the pill I was taking, but I think it was because of an inflammatory response to the vaccine. Eventually it did stop naturally.

I STARTED ALSO HAVING JOINT PAIN THAT I NEVER USE TO HAVE. I AM IN CHRONIC PAIN DAILY. SOME DAYS IT&#39;S MORE ACHIER THAN OTHER DAYS. IT&#39;S NOT AS BAD DURING THE DAY WHEN I AM MOVING AROUND BUT WHEN I AM IN BED AND TRY TO TURN OR MOVE I FEEL MY ENTIRE BODY REALLY ACHIE. I HAVE NEVER HAD THESE SYMPTOMS BEFORE. I AM TRYING TO SEE A CHIROPRACTOR AND MASSAGE THERAPIST NOW AND SEE IF THIS WILL HELP BUT SOMEITMES THE ACHE IS UNBAREABLE. ADVIL WLL JUST TAKE THE EDGE OFF BUT IT NEVER GOES AWAY. IT WEIGHS HEAVY ON MY MIND DAILY. ALSO MY MENSTRUAL CYCLE IS OUT OF WACK. I USED TO BE REGULAR ON MY CYCLE BUT AFTER THE VACCINE I DID NOT HAVE MY PERIOD UNTIL APRIL FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS. I MISSED MAY&#39;S PERIOD. MY SISTER ACTUALLY HAD COVID AND SHE IS NOT VACCINATED BUT SHE IS GOING THRU THE SAME THING. HER PERIOD IS OUT OF WACK AS WELL

                                                It is not a big deal, but I feel it is strange. I have regular periods, every 35 days followed by 45 days, then alternate. My period was altered by this vaccine. Period happened 2 days after the shot.  The exact same pattern happened after the first dose of Moderns vaccine administered on 5/2. I have never had period shorter than 30 days in my life. I suspect there must be a hormone change induced by the mRNA vaccine. It could be easily ignored by most women recipients due to 28 days interval. But, could it cause any potential consequence to teenagers? That&#39;s why I want to bring this issue to attention.

                                                Almost right after receiving the vaccine, I started to feel sore under my neck and my shoulder. The gave me an ice pack. I took 800mg of Motrin. The same night I started to feel like I had the flu. There was muscle and joint pain throughout my body. I had a headache and my stomach was hurting me. I developed a fever and it went as high as 105 degrees. I called the on-call doctor the next day and she said that I would probably be fine by Sunday. I did not feel better and my symptoms continued. My blood pressure became very high too, and I was advised to see my doctor, but it got better. My knees felt like they were on fire. My appetite went away come completely. On Sunday, I called the doctor again and told her how I was feeling. My doctor told me to go to the hospital to get an IV because I wasn&#39;t drinking fluids. I couldn&#39;t even get out of my bed and I had urinated on myself. I did experience a couple of UTI&#39;s after the vaccine. I told the doctor that I would drink broth and my son made me some. Sunday my fever went up and down and at one point. On Monday I started having a headache again and I was very nauseous. I went back to work on Wednesday with a headache. I took homemade soup and I ate there. I still had a headache throughout the day. On Thursday, I felt a lot better. A few days later, I experienced some dark vaginal bleeding, not related to my period. I had a vaginal ultrasound. I had a biopsy and everything was fine. The heavy bleeding continued and I ended up having to get an IUD to control the bleeding. I had some blood work done and my live enzymes were elevated. I had an ultrasound to check everything. I had a fibroid scan as well. I had an endoscopy. The doctor thinks I might have liver sclerosis. I told him that I do not drink. I&#39;m meeting with my liver doctor tomorrow. There are now complications with my thyroid. I saw an endocrinologist and he said that I may need calcium in my body.

After receiving the 2nd dose, I noticed that I had nodules starting to pop up on my right breast. I called my PCP, and scheduled an appointment. I saw his PA, and she ordered an emergency ultrasound, blood work and a mammogram. The radiologist recommended that I not touch my breast because their was so much inflammation. My doctor wanted me to have surgery to reduce the swelling. I went to get a second opinion. The doctor there said that he agreed with the radiologist. The PA wanted me to go in and have surgery to have all of my lumps drained. I&#39;m going back in 6 months to do f/u ultrasounds and mammograms. My radiologist said that he wants me to f/u with him in one year.

                                                1st side effect - Left Arm was used for shot/s because patient has been experience frozen shoulder on the right side.  Patient has been experience significant shooting pain in left arm since injection.  Patient was told to move arm around to help.  This has done nothing for alleviating the side affect.   2nd side effect - patient has not had period since the second shot of Moderna.  Patient tracks periods on an called Flo and it can be seen through data her period was normal and consistent until the Moderna shot and now her periods have stopped.

Filling an ultra tampon in 5 minutes. Going through tampon, pad, underclothes, outer clothes, and through a sweater onto car seat in less than 15 minutes. This bleeding has been going on now for 5 days. This is my first cycle since having the 2nd vaccine and I&#39;ve NEVER experienced bleeding like this, especially with an IUD. It&#39;s debilitating. I literally ran out of my office and into my car after being stranded in the work bathroom for 10 minutes hoping the bleeding would slow enough to get to my car. Changing tampon and pad every 15 minutes. I can&#39;t leave the house. I am afraid to go out in public for fear of bleed through accidents. I&#39;m traveling with extra clothes, sanitary supplies and layer up.

I have been to the Dr. twice, for heavy, abnormal bleeding and abnormal clotting . First Dr.  visit was on  06/15/21, bleeding for two weeks I was put on medication to control it, I was sent to do an ultrasound on 6/30/21, and had a biopsy done on 7/1/21.  Results pending until the 20th of July 2021.  To this date I am still bleeding however it is controlled by medication. If I skip my medication for a day I will start to bleed heavy. I have been bleeding for a month and ten days.

My knees, thigh bones, hips, pelvis, lower back, and shoulders all hurt like I had been beaten with a bat.  I took a sick day from work due to the severity of symptoms.  I had no fever, but did have hot flashes periodically throughout the day.  I was dizzy upon standing, had nasal congestion, and sever fatigue, and developed a moderately bad headache later that day.  I went to sleep at 10:30 p.m. on 1/26/2021 and slept through the night.  Upon waking on 1/27/2021, I felt much better.  I still have some lingering fatigue and stiffness but not enough to interfere with my normal routine.  I was vaccinated in my left arm and today, 1/27/2021 I woke up with swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit that are quite sore.

                                                I received Moderna Covid vaccine on day 21 of my menstrual cycle (2/8/21).  I was supposed to begin my period five days later, 2/13/21.  The start of my period was delayed by eight days, finally starting 2/21/21.  I track my period with an app so I know that this is highly unusual.  I&#39;m 47 so I was assuming perimenopause could be playing a role in my delayed period until I discovered that there are many others reporting the same issue.  It&#39;s not a big deal to have a delayed period, it just would have been nice to know that it&#39;s a normal potential side effect.

                                                It was two weeks after the vaccine, I had severe pain in my right breast.  On my  lower right breast, near the ariola, there was a tiny lump that was very red with two red streaks going up my breast.  I called my OB/GYN and I was told to watch it that women have been reporting breast issues after the vaccine. There was no change.  I called my PCP on 02/11/2021 to get an appointment. He saw me but the streaking was gone. The fever in the breast was gone as well. My PCP felt like it was Mastitis from the vaccine.  I have never had Mastitis before.  I have never had children. Finally by 02/14/2021 it was better.

My period in March was a longer cycle and had no real flow just heavy spotting for more days.  It struck me so that I thought it should be reported.

Neither time was I scheduled to start my period.  And both were very heavy bleeding.

                                                Abnormal menses.  Huge clots.  Velocity and volume of blood extreme.  (Different from previous experiences of menorrhagia).  The only other time I experienced this type of dramatic and concerning bleeding was after I took the Hepatitis vaccine (first shot) about 2 years ago.  I think that&#39;s the only other vaccine I&#39;ve had as an adult.  There is mention of heavy bleeding as a rare side effect for Hepatitis vaccine, and I surely hope you will study this effect from Covid vaccine as it took nearly a year to regulate my cycle after the Hepatitis vaccine reaction.  I&#39;ve seen some reports suggesting that the excessive bleeding that women are experiencing after the Covid vaccine is due to stress and that is just plain insulting.  Stress does affect the menstrual cycle; that is well-known, but this is something entirely different.  I have also had small clots in the nose during the past several days, which again, is highly abnormal for me.  Thank you for looking into the bleeding side effects that hundreds (if not more) women are struggling with at this time.

                                                Starting on Saturday early morning, had severe chills and was very tired. Had a fever of 101 and slept off an on all day. Could not keep my eyes open and went to bed very early. I woke up the next morning (Sunday) feeling soso even though the day before I drank a bottle of gatorade, a bottle of water and 1/2 of a jug of a 3  gallon water. My legs were sore, like a feeling of being dehydrated, not flu like and my arm swelled up like a balloon, my eyes were very swollen, hands and feet as well. The swelling lasted until this past Saturday, April 10 and had a bunch of water weight on my body (4 extra pounds, which I have shed 2 of). I have a lot of memory loss as well as I ended up with my period, which I have not had in approximately 9 years.  I had a headache for the first four days.

Bleeding so heavily medical care was sought after first injection. Thought it might be my IUD, which was removed after the first episode. Full gynecological exam indicated everything was normal. Menstrual bleeding happened again 2 days after second vaccine,  characterized by early arrival, heavy flow and clotting.

On Sunday evening (4/26), my menstrual  cycle started, even though I just had my last period the week prior. My cycle varies as I&#39;m in peri-menopause but I&#39;ve never had two cycles a week apart before. Also, my normal cycle is normally moderate amount of bleeding the first day and then cuts off drastically (spotting mainly) for the next 2-3 days. I am on day 3 today and the amount of bleeding has been heavy since it started Sunday evening. The color is also very bright red (where normally it is more of a dark rust color).   I am not experiencing any cramping at all or any other pain, just abnormally heavy bleeding.

                                                Sore arm for a few days with fatigue, resolved after a week. On the morning of 4/23 the bottom of my shot (left) arm felt bruised, tender. By the night of 4/23 my left armpit was also sore, tender. Late night 4/23 my left breast was extremely sore and I noticed lumps, very swollen ducts? As of now, late night on 4/28, or very early morn 4/29, the lumps are large, extremely painful and don?t seem to be going away . I?m anxious about my second shot.

                                                I felt a pain in the lower quadrant of my right breast during the night and there was a hard nodule. It was sensitive to touch. Thursday evening I looked at the area in the mirror and realized that the area was red about 2 inches in circumference and the area was hard and appeared swollen. I saw the doctor the next morning and was put on antibiotics &amp; anti-inflammatory medication. The redness has greatly reduced, but the hard nodule is still present. I have a follow up doctor&#39;s appointment this Thursday.

                                                I have tracked my period for decades.  My period is very regular on cycles that run every 23-27 days averaging 25 days. My periods last 5-7 days. I never spot between cycles. I was given my second dose of COVID on day 10 of my cycle and my period started 4 days later on day 14. It lasted 5 days.  Other symptoms I experienced after my second dose included: (1) tired - took a nap starting 5 hours after dose was administered, (2) chills - started 10 hours after dose, lasted for 7 hours, and required multiple folded king-sized comforters to get warm (3) all over body aches - lasted until about 36 hours after dose.

I felt if I pushed to allow the stool to come out my vomit would also project, so I refused period came two weeks early very heavy unusual in perimenopause and I don&#39;t get hot flashes but sweat sometimes witout being hot. Now with no fever I was constantly sweating all day Friday up until Sunday Stayed in bed two days no appetite, slight nausea Forced myself to go downstairs saturday but bathing and putting on my clothes was too much so I had to rest for half an hour before doing so. I had to teach a class of 13 to 15-year-olds and talking was labored like I was gasping for breath (40 minutes). Sat still for the rest of the day and felt better Sunday better but the headache is the only issue and on and off nausea especially when asleep Today headache is more prominent, perhaps because I left the house for the first time and went grocery shopping The doctor said to take Tylenol but I have not since the fever broke. Only took two acetamophin on Thursday  She also said to report my symptoms Wondering if the headache, brain fog, and lethargy will go away after period ends, more than likely by Friday. It is petering off.

My period was always normal, in terms of amount, time, etc. At first, I didn&#39;t think of it was related to vaccine.  However, after the second dose (on 4/11/2021) , same thing happened again: I got my period in shorter cycle, and the bleed was very heavy, running pure blood (didn&#39;t see tissue in) and drag for ~10 days, I basically had to bed rest to let it stop.

I am consistently 28 days on my cycle to this took me by surprise. After some googling  of similar items in the weeks after, it seems there may be other studies that are exploring whether this is a causal event. As such I?ve decided to report it. It?s just very odd to me because I am extremely like clockwork., so it took me by surprise. I mentioned it to my pharmacist today while getting my second shot and he suggested I report it said that perhaps you can keep track in case others are. I know there are external CDC studies that are apparently going on to try to investigate this abnormality. Thank you for your time.

                                                This may be nothing, but I have seen other women with similar issues after the vaccination, so I thought it would be best to report it, just in case.  I am 47 years old and very likely perimenopausal. My cycle was between 32-35 days, fairly consistently. After my second dose, my period came a full week early, was heavier, and I had more cramping. Now I have just had my second period after my second shot, and it came after 28 days. So it seems like my cycle has shortened. Again, this may be a coincidence, but my periods have always been in the 32-35 day cycle range, very rarely under 30. It&#39;s unusual for me to have three periods so close together like this.

                                                Between two doses of Covid vaccine(April 22 and May 19), I started a period on May 10 at the time I expected  but it was just spotting for four days. This was surprising because I have had regular menstrual cycle in recent years and  this kind of spotting have not occurred. After I received the second dose, I started another period  on May 28 which lasted 5 days. This time it was very heavy blood flow and I have seen a lot of blood lumps and had severe(worse than regular) cramping pain for two days. I am not sure if this change in my period is related to Covid vaccine or not. Other than this, I had known side effects like muscle pain.

                                                I had a strong reaction to the second dose (fever over 101 after taking Ibuprophen that lasted 2 days).  Then I had abnormal uterine bleeding that prompted me to contact my doctor who ordered a pelvic ultrasound.  The ultrasound showed what looked like possibly a clot or a cyst in the uterus.  I then had a hysteroscope to further examine it and it was no longer there so it has been a clot that subsequently passed. Since then, my periods have returned to a normal timing pattern, but remain heavier than before.

Fatigue for 48 hours beginning day after vaccination. Occurred with both doses. Fever for 24 hours beginning day after vaccination. Occurred with second dose only. Nausea for 24 hours beginning day after vaccination. Occurred with second dose only. Two menstrual cycles occurred 14 days apart between first and second doses of vaccine. (Never experienced rapid cycle before.) Menstrual cycle has since returned to normal. Intense muscle and joint pain interfering with mobility and activities began day after first dose of vaccine, and has continued intermittently for two months until present. (June 10, 2021) Pain affects hips, back, knees, ankles, knuckles, wrists, and elbows. Previous to vaccine, pain only experienced in hips and back if over-exercised.

I had an increase amount of bleeding with large blood clots. At the same time my birth control brand was switched to another brand so didn&#39;t know if the change in bleeding/clots was related to change in birth control or moderna vaccine. I reached out to my gyne and made her aware she stated that it was not related to the birth control as it was the same med/dosage. That more than likely was related to moderna vaccine and if the bleeding didn&#39;t stop or if it increased to seek medical attention. My cycle lasted for a total of 9 days vs 4-5 days. Clots were from day 4-9.

I had to soak my feet to soften and lather lotion for weeks. I had such sever itching in different areas and had to apply hydrocortisone and numbing cream to alleviate the itching. I thought this has all been normal ?things? in my life?!?!? The spotting still has not stopped and my Pap smear was normal.

                                                In addition to initial pain at and around (3-4?) the injection site, within a few hours, this pain spread up across the back of my neck and down my arm and resulted in what felt kind of like a sprain in my hand. If I just so much as flexed my hand slightly, the pain would shoot out from the center of my hand. So I wrapped it to keep myself from moving it unintentionally. It continued to be very painful for another two full days (all of 4/13 and 4/14). It&#39;s better today (4/15), but not completely gone. My husband was telling his coworker about it who said that his wife had the exact same thing except her pain was in her wrist, which is why I felt that it was likely tied to the shot and I should report it. Especially since I had done nothing to injure my hand. In addition to this symptom, I also got my period on 4/13, the morning after I got the shot, even though it&#39;s not due for two more weeks and my periods are never irregular like that. I have heard of women having heavier menstrual flow following Covid vaccination, but those reports were not of earlier onset, so I wanted to be sure that this event was reported as well.

I also started menstrual bleeding despite being in what I thought to be menopause, I had not menstrated for 6 months. Three days after the shot my left lymph node in my armpit began to swell and be painful to the touch.  I am now seven days post vaccine and my armpit and lymph node are still very sore and swollen and I do not feel 100%, a general unwell feeling. I am having serious doubts that I will get the second dose.

Relief now, 5 hours later., maintaining excederine doses and migraine medication when migraine headache returns.

She said she was feeling achy before the vaccine and thinks one may have been imminent. The night after they vaccine she said she woke up with heavy bleeding.  She said it was abnormally heavy and said it will not stop. She said she is also said she has a headache and injection site pain. I recommended she go to a walk in clinic or ER if the blood loss was sufficient and to follow up with her md on Monday. As of now she has not sought medical treatment.

In under 48 hours a lump appeared under the skin at vaccination site on left arm. The area was swollen, hot to the touch, and there was a red rash on the skin above the lump. The swollen lump under the skin was treated with Zyrtec  10 mg- once per day; and Aleve 220 mg- twice per day. An ice pack was applied as needed. Cortizone cream was applied topically to the rash as needed. Within four days these symptoms had lessened significantly. Within seven days the lump under the skin, as well as the rash, were gone and treatments  were terminated.   Unexpected, unusual menstrual bleeding began 14 days after receiving first Moderna COVID-19 Vaccination. This unusual menstrual bleeding lasted a full 2 weeks before it ended.

After my second dose, I had a light period for around four/five days that started two days after the vaccine. Now, a month later, I have another period, this time much heavier. I called my gyno and he said this was being seen as reaction to the vaccine. Because the periods have both been like normal periods, cramping, etc. I am feeling not super worried but I would like to understand why I am having them and if they are going to continue or stop and what it means to my body that this is happening.

There were a few moments that I could not walk well.  Ibuprofen all day his symptoms.  Period flow changed to heavier on the end dates when they are typically super light.    A couple weeks later, I was teaching online and suddenly, I started getting intense cramping (I have had cramps once before and then labor--that is it my entire life).   I was miserable.  I couldn&#39;t sit.  I took 600 ibuprofen and waited till the pain subsided and took a 2 hour nap, woke up exhausted.   Period arrives on time one month post second vaccine but is definitely heavier already and definitely more irritable.  I thought I was going through perimenopause symptoms till I saw an article on possible links.  It adds up perfectly.

I took Tylenol and the headache went away in about 7-8 hours.  Other symptoms went away by themselves in 3-4 days.  One the six night of the 2nd dose, I felt sharp abnormal pain. It started to bleed on the 7th day and is getting a bit heavier  than usual.  If it is period, then it?s two weeks earlier.  Today is the 8th of 2nd dose, still heavier than normal period.  Yesterday I hurt my finger by a needle,  I couldn?t stop the bleeding right away.  It was quite a lot of blood than normal.  My hand was all red.  Right after the 2nd dose, I had 4-5 days of headache, two days of them were severe.  I took Tylenol but it didn?t help a lot.

This is also not something I have ever experienced before now. I&#34;ve been eating protein just in case I&#39;ve become iron-deficient- but it does not seem to be helping.

                                                Around March 30 I started getting oral ulcers. I didn&#39;t think about it possibly being related to the COVID-19 Moderna Vaccine until I continued to get oral ulcers. They would come and go and as of today&#39;s date I have been having oral ulcers again for several days.  I also noticed that I was due to start my menstrual cycle on May 10th - I have always been quite consistent in the time frame of the start of my cycle and as of today, May 16th I have yet to begin my cycle. Having read that this has been experienced by a number of other women (post vaccine) I believe it to also be related.

I thought it strange but it was nothing more than a nuisance.  4 days ago I woke with lower back pain that was so terrible that I had a hard time getting up from my bed.  This pain was not alleviated with tylenol or ibuprofen. This morning I was woken up by intensive abdominal pain, diarrhea and heavy bleeding.  It has been 6.5 hours and the pain is almost unbearable. I have to work so I am hoping it stops. I have read that some women have had the same thing happen so I want to report it so that someone takes it seriously - this pain is debilitating.  I&#39;m scared that it isn&#39;t going to abate.  I&#39;ve gone from no period to 2 horrible periods in 30 days.

In May, I started having my menstrual cycle and I hadn&#39;t had it last since December of 2018. It was really heavy and the worry was the fact that I was on blood thinner too. I had it for about five days. I got sent to  Hospital  ER  - May 17th  - and through the process, I had to get biopsy and ultrasounds done. A month later, I haven&#39;t seen another menstrual cycle. Follow up visit will be - Oncologist - July 8th  - They want to determine of what is causing my body is producing estrogen again - discussion of ovaries removed in future. Don&#39;t know yet.

                                                I have been in menopause and completely without a period or spotting since July 2019.   This past Friday, on June 18th, I began to bleed  VERY heavily.  By heavily I mean, changing an overnight size maxi pad every hour, and sometimes having to change undergarments or clothes due to overflow.  I&#39;ve had heavy periods before, especially during those perimenopausal months, but never anything like this.  It came with all of the usual menstrual symptoms such as breast tenderness, cramps, and irritability, stomach upset and exhaustion, and those too, were more severe than I have ever experienced.  The  extremely heavy bleeding lasted from Friday to Wednesday.  It was lighter on Thursday, and today a bit lighter than yesterday but still there.  I did not make the connection to the vaccination until my brother who works in the sciences and pharmaceuticals forwarded me a couple of articles.  Some background:   I have been experiencing after effects of having Covid19 since I was diagnosed with the virus in early December 2020.  I&#39;ve had ongoing inflammation, headaches and random bouts of extreme fatigue.  Following the first vaccine, I experienced some illness but felt fine after the second.

Previously I didn?t not have cramps. It was strong enough to bleed through pads within hour.   On day 5 it?s even stronger and my prior periods would be diminishing by day 4. I have also felt tired, achey, nauseous but it?s manageable.  Just want to report because this was abnormal experience.

This very heavy bleeding lasted for over 30 days until I saw doctor who gave me medication to stop the bleeding.  My period has since resumed it&#39;s normal cycle albeit slightly heavier than before.

                                                Within 20 minutes after the vaccine, I got heavy feeling in chest and that is a sign for me that my asthma is having issues. So I used two puffs of my albuterol inhaler. So then I talked to the nurse and told her I was having asthma symptoms. She wanted me to wait a little longer. I left about 40 minutes after the vaccine. I left to go home because I was feeling better. On the way home, I noticed my lips starting to swell and I didn&#39;t feel good. I took 10mg of Zyrtec when I got home and I took 40mg of Pepcid and then I felt a little better and I had to go to work and I&#39;m a HCP. Later in the afternoon, my throat was itching. I called my primary care doctor and got an appt for Wednesday morning. I didn&#39;t feel good the rest of the day. I came home and was using my inhaler every four hours. I took 50mg of prednisone which is my rescue dose that they leave for me. I went to bed. My lips were still tingling and swelling. I got up the next morning, and I used my inhaler. I went to doctor and doctor said I was wheezing and I haven&#39;t wheezed in years. He prescribed me more prednisone and I went home and felt really horrible the rest of the day. My lips felt like they were swelling for the next 14 days. I was on a prednisone taper. I had to start using my Flovent inhaler. After that I had to use my nebulizer for a few days. I felt bad for 14 days plus. It really messed up my asthma bad. In February (about two weeks after the vaccine when I got my Adderall refilled I told my doctor that my heart was beating rapidly) I had a problem with my heart beating rapidly for two months after that. I had to go back to doctor and had two more doctor visits because of that. I had some pineapple about a month and a half ago and it made my lips swell up for three days afterwards and it flared my asthma which it has never done in the past. Usually (before vaccine) I could eat up to 5 or 6 pieces before it caused an allergy issue. This time it was about two pieces of pineapple and I got this reaction. I have never had that happen before. In April or May, I was having breast pain on the left side of my body. Last night it started hurting a little but by the end of May and beginning of June, I thought it was pretty much gone. The pain in the breast was painful to the touch and really tender and it was only on the left side of my body. It was really weird. A couple of weeks ago, I talked to co-workers and they said they had lumps in their breast too after the Moderna vaccine. I have an infection, an abscess in my navel area. I have never had one before. That started in April, I noticed it was swelling. I was watching it. May I went to the doctor for it. They cultured it and nothing came back but yet it was getting redder. And so I saw my primary care doctor, they gave me cephalexin for it. It&#39;s better but I need to go back and see him again and probably get more antibiotic. I have been using Bactroban ointment for it. Note: I refused to go to the ER because I&#39;m a HCP. I saw that a week or two after I had the COVID vaccine, they recalled doses for adverse reactions.

I saw my OB/GYN on 01/21/2021 and she performed a biopsy, a pap smear, and also had a vaginal, and abdominal ultrasound, done on me the same day. All tests came back normal. No cervical polyps were seen; endometrial lining was appropriate for my age , being 2 years post menopausal. There is no other explanation for the bleeding that persists.

                                                Lump in clavicle started small and painful, increased in size, pain also felt underneath breast and in the underarm region.  Lump increased in size and is tender to touch.  It hurts to move or lie in certain positions.  I had an ultra sound on  January 29.  I was told that it may be a reaction from the vaccine but not certain and I was given a referral to a general surgeon- I have an appointment with that doctor on February 2, 2021.   After the ultrasound visit on January 29 another lump has appeared on January 30 in front of the clavical, it is shaped different than the initial lump and is also tender.  It has increased in size since it appeared.

I have never had random cycles before.

                                                IRREGULAR AND HEAVY PERIOD!!!.   Vaccine received on last day of menstrual cycle. Two days later started spotting on dayly basis and with clots wich continued until I started on  progesterone on April 8, 2021 (prescribed for 10 days).  Even with the pill, I continue to spot lightly. I am unsure about getting the second dose of the Moderna Covid vaccine on 03/15/2021.  Even with a history of previous fibroid removed around 2014.  My period seem has never behave &#34;non-stop&#34; like this.

In the years I have been on chemo and I also have an IUD in my uterus (because you can&#39;t get pregnant on chemo) I have not had a menstrual cycle in almost 6 years.  After getting my second Moderna shot I had a full blown period/menstrual cycle for 2 whole days (48 hours).  Got the Moderna shot Friday morning and then the menstrual cycle started less than 12 hours later and lasted for two days. There was cramping, heavy flow, bright red blood like how they use to be before chemo.  My Oncologist and My OB/GYN  encouraged me to report this side effect of the Moderna to the CDC

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after the shot, I got lightheaded. A couple of hours later, my arm was sore and I started feeling tired. The next morning when I woke up, I felt like I had run a marathon and got hit by a semi-truck at the same time. My legs started having shooting pains. I could not walk normally. I ran marathons  before and I had the marathon walk. I could not walk for more than a couple of steps without having severe pain. It felt like all the nerves in my legs were on fire. It took approximately 4 or 5 days for the pain to stop and I could walk normally. I was in bed for 4 days. It took about 2 weeks to feel back normal. Then I started having spotting. I have not had a period or any break through bleeding in over 6 years. That lasted about 3 days. As of today, I am in a small flare. It is not a full flare but am having symptoms. If the symptoms do not improve in the next 2 weeks, I will be going to my GI doctor.

Was going through 40&#43; pads a day, having to change every 30 minutes or so to not leak. Very upsetting. Went to dr for bloodwork, had CBC and results returned normal.  Dr encouraged me to have 2nd shot.  Period stopped 2 days after 2nd shot  2nd shot: Had shot on a Wednesday. That Saturday had hive/rash at injection site. Red, warm, itchy, raised. Treated with OTC Benadryl.

                                                My primary dr but I received vaccines via CVS.     4/2nd 1st vaccine: nausea, light headache &amp; extreme fatigue. I fell asleep several hrs after I got it &amp; was fatigued the next day. Additionally, began to feel jittery/clumsy w/ my fingers, eye twitching, some shooting pains on the legs, some vertigo. The jitters stayed for about a wk or so, eye twitching was bad &amp; I felt a little anxiety ridden/panic attack like. After 4 wks passed, eye twitching had lessened, vision kept changing thruout this time &amp; jitters seemed to be gone. Interesting, I had not had a menstrual cycle in many months but had one 3 - 4 weeks after vaccine.     5/2nd 2nd vaccine: I was a little tired the 1st day. Two days later, I was hit with fatigue, jitters, eye twitching too but lighter version. Along w/fatigue, I didn&#39;t feel like myself &amp; felt anxious &amp; short.  I started to have internal vibrations/shaking of tingling toes/fingers/abdomen/vaginal area - light burning too. Recently, a little on my left shoulder. As well, I had some highly infrequent but sharp, painful aching pains in foot area. Last 3 days I feel like my energy is up again, like myself. Vibrations &amp; eye/vision issues continue though not as bad. I hope it all resolves and I continued in this better state.  I do hope to get back to 100% though.  This has all been concerning.

I had my second COVID shot on 5/4/21. On 5/28/21, I started my menstrual (on time after skipping a month), but it has been exceedingly heavy and long-lasting. This has been my worst in 38 years in regards to heavy bleeding. I didn?t have any cramps though, so that was a plus, but to be at the tail end of day SEVEN and still using ultra tampons every two hours is unprecedented in my personal biology. That is usually on only day two and maybe three, and those last at least four hours. Coincidence? Maybe? Just doesn?t seem right to me.

                                                On 6/15 I began heavy menstrual bleeding with large clotting. I am on oral contraceptives and this bleeding occurred 4 days earlier than it should have. The oral contraceptive keeps me regular and my bleeding is of a medium flow lasting no more than 4 days. I had extremely heavy bleeding for 8 days with continued spotting.  I&#39;m also experiencing large bruising from the slightest injury. I even bled and later bruised at the injection site on 6/26 when receiving my second Moderna dose. This was in addition to fatigue, muscle cramping and headaches. But I expected that. The bleeding is extremely unusual.

I reported this to my obgyn, who confirmed that she knows of many cases that the vaccine does cause interferance with a women&#39;s reproductive system.

Day 5 after Moderna vaccine my period start again super heavy with all period symptoms way worse that I ever experience. Pounding headaches, cramps and heavy bleeding and hot flashes. I have a menstrual disorder and period is tough on me but this was off the chart. Day 6-7-8 after Moderna vaccine I also had low grade fever on an off (101-102 F). Not sleeping, not eating and very tired buy day 11 I hit bottom and by day 12 I started to feel better. Going to see my doctor to discuss treatment before my second Moderna vaccine dose.

I read somewhere that people are chalking this up to the stress of getting the vaccine. Let me tell you, this is the least amount of stress I&#39;ve had for this entire quarantine time. Also, we were lucky enough to have the means to have our food and supplies delivered to us, so this last year was actually less stressful than normal.   (I marked &#34;no&#34; on recovered for item 20 as I am still having my period, which at 4 days is a little longer than usual as well.)

But noticed a rather large (3-4&#34;) raised rash mark below the injection site about 4 days after having the vaccine. It was warm and hard and sometime mildly itchy. It lasted for about a week and then completely disappeared. I will also mention that my period was affected by the vaccine. I am normally on schedule to a day but I was late by 1 week. I didn&#39;t associate this w/ the vaccine until my sister mentioned that she had the same issue (she also had the Moderna vaccine as well).

                                                On April, I started to break-through bleed.  The break-through bleeding continued for a week.  It was not heavy or debilitating; however, it is hugely inconvenient to spot and have hormonal fluctuations. My cycle was regular till now. Since 4/20, I am spotting again.  My period was due 4/15 and I never got it. My 2nd Moderna is 5/4 and I am concerned what those side effects will be on my menstrual cycle.  I have a Copper IUD- hormone-free and take no meds.

                                                The first week after the Moderna 1st shot, I got my period which I didn&#39;t have for more than 6 months. I had it with an alarming amount of blood cloths. Right after, the second week after the modern 1st shot and after that period,  all of my joints started to hurt really bad. Shoulders, elbows, knees &amp; fingers. Manly stronger pain is on both shoulders to the point I went to the Emergency Room.

Since receiving the vaccine I have had 3 very irregular and heavy periods. I recently became aware that there seems to be a link between the vaccine and menstruation becoming irregular or heavy. I thought I would report it.

                                                After one week began to experience very light spotting (post-menopause).  Also experienced menstrual cramps.  Went for a yearly PAP smear and the initial results were &#34;inconclusive.&#34;  Was sent for a transvaginal  and abdominal ultrasound which showed the endometrial stripe to be 7mm (thickened). Required an endometrial biopsy (normal results). 12 weeks later developed SHINGLES.

                                                Four weeks after my first shot of the Moderna vaccine (first shot on March 16, 2021) I got my period -- a very heavy one (started April 12, 2021). This was after 13 months after being in menopause (my previously last period was in March of 2020, and I had been sporadic through 2019). The period lasted for 6-7 days with 4 days of fairly heavy flow. I was quite tired, but I also got my second Moderna shot the morning of Day 2 of my period. Hard to tell what was causing the mild fatigue at that point.

                                                Right off that bat, I noticed heart palpitations and also flushing on the chest. I was getting a rash on chest. The EMT there told me to go home and take Benadryl. I took two of them. It didn&#39;t help with the symptoms. I called the doctor - he told me to take three Benadryl every six hours. I didn&#39;t really sleep that night - I was tired due to Benadryl. I put ice on my chest in the middle of the night because it was on fire. I remembered that I tried to go to work the next day but I couldn&#39;t. I went to the doctor. He told me to take 2 Benadryl one hour before the next shot. It took awhile for the symptoms to go away - I took Benadryl during the next week. I still had the rash on my chest. I went to the OB/GYN after that for my annual exam and after that I was bleeding and I thought it had been from my pap smear. I was  bleeding very heavily - altogether it was three months of heavy bleeding. Medication to stop bleeding: Filled on Provera - 10 mg - on 2/8/2021 - they told me to take it for 10 days. Tranexamic acid -650 mg 2 tablets 3 times a day for up to 5 days..  They did bloodwork. I did a Sonogram.  I had to leave during my work duties a couple of time (I&#39;m a surgical assistant in surgeries)  because I was bleeding and my co-workers told me I didn&#39;t look good. Had second dose of vaccine (lot number 004M20A) on 2/5/2021 - the bleeding got heavier (and in fact, immediately after I had the shot, I had to go to the bathroom I started bleeding so heavily - heavier than I had ever bled before) after the 2nd vaccine and the rash that I had after the first vaccine was still there but would come and go with Benadryl. I did testing on April 20th - for pre-surgery.  I had a DNC on April 27th  and after the DNC I felt so much better. The rash is gone; I&#39;m not as  tired. And I feel better.

                                                I had not had a period since October of 2020.  I was experiecing all the signs of menopause.  Hot flashes, no menses, etc.  On 5/15, I began a very small period.  I thought it might be a fluke.  43 days later on June 26, 2021 I began a heavy period.  It is still ongoing as I write this.  Along with this period came, what seems to be, neuropathy.  I am having extreme pain in my right hip and leg that I also experienced with the 2nd dose of the vaccine which lasted for several weeks.  My periods prior to October 2020 had slowed down and were quite simple after several years of the periods like the one I&#39;m having now.  I don&#39;t know if this is temporary or if I&#39;ve been completely knocked out of menopause and am having to walk through peri-menopause all over again.

                                                I have been menopausal (no periods) since September 2020. I bled bright red blood (not old blood) starting on or before June 13th 2021.  I wasn&#39;t paying attention at the beginning because I thought it was nothing, so the start could have been slightly earlier.   Once it went on for days and got a little heavier, I started counting and worrying a bit, as I haven&#39;t bled for several months.  The bright red bleeding (enough to require a pad) stopped after 15 days.  It was never unusually heavy.  But it was constant, bright red blood.  I had read reports about this possibly being linked to the NA vaccine, so I felt I needed to report this.   I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related.  Thanks.

                                                At 6pm the day of the injection I began post menopausal bleeding. (I have have not had a period for 4-5 years). I have contacted primary care provider to see if I need to follow up with him. Have not yet heard back from his office. I have  also contacted GYN, and they have scheduled me for an appointment on 7/21/21.

Am very active in job, boxing workouts 3 x&#39;s per week and play Lacrosse with my daughter.   Being very tired even after 8 hours sleep - extreme lower back pain.  And right leg sciatica that has gone away after a few visits to Chiropractor.

However, when I got the 2nd dose, the injection site was swollen and red for 2 days. At the week and a half mark, I felt like I had covid. My chest was tight, I couldn&#39;t smell, I couldn&#39;t taste, and I was fatigued. I felt every symptom. I was told I had to take 14 days off of work and was not pleased about that. I was having body aches. Everything hurt. When I tried to change the channel on the remote, and it hurt. I was coughing and everything felt like a chore. It was so hard to do anything. I was coughing up foam. Towards the end, I started getting a more solid cough. It was pea-sized yellow chunks. There was no blood. It was never green or clear. Everything was either white or off white. It felt a lot like pneumonia. My oxygen was slightly down. I was not okay. I was doing really great and then all of a sudden I couldn&#39;t hardly get from the bathroom to the bed. It was a drastic and sudden change in my abilities. I have never had hip problems before and I appeared to have an infection. I was having to go to the chiropractor and get regular adjustments. They put me on an antibiotic and that caused the inflammation to go down. I get winded pretty easily. I am not back to work. I am still not well. I get tired really easily. I am going to physical therapy. I didn&#39;t have an injury. The only thing in my life that changed was that I got the vaccine. I know that I did not contract covid because my test was negative. I started into menopause and my periods were coming every 27 days exactly. After the vaccine, my periods were a whole lot worse. I was bleeding so much that I was going through a pad an hour. It was unmanageable. It hasn&#39;t really tapered off at all. I am passing huge clots. The OBGYN can not find anything wrong that could be causing it. All of my labs came back totally normal. I never went to the ER. I was told not to go anywhere or do anything. I was told to stay home.

Was referred to Radiology to get a Diagnostic Mammogram on June 24, 2021.  During this visit, three lumps were found in Mammogram, and Ultrasound determined that they were cysts.  One large one and two smaller ones.  The technician asked if I had the shot in my left arm, and said it looks like your lymph nodes are doing there job, in other words, this is what you would expect them to look like.  The results were confirmed that is was not breast cancer, but cysts.  Note, my older sister also reported that she has breast cyst(s), but this was prior to Covid-19 Pandemic.

                                                My first symptoms were expected-- sore arm and slightly tired feeling -- a few days later my shoulder itched where I got the shot. Then a week later, two things-- and one is PMS. Obviously not the shot but I mention this as it is possible that these side effects are related to the PMS. On Sunday 1/3/2021 I was experiencing breast tenderness PMS and that extended under my arms and by the end of that day my glands were swollen and hard in my right armpit. The next morning, they were still hard and swollen and the glands are still today. While I often have breast tenderness, I have never had swollen glands or painful underarms as part of this. Also yesterday 1/4 my right shoulder near where I received the vaccine was i was itchy and it continues to be and red and also hard there... I don&#39;t want to overplay any of these symptoms and they might well relate to PMS but I think in this instance particularly with the very painful swollen glands on the right underarm it&#39;s important to report them

Had not had a period in over 8 months.  Hot flashes had subsided.  One month later having EXTREMELY bad period, with excessive bleeding. Could not even go to work. I truly believe it came from vaccine.  Figure I should report so there may be data. The second dose caused severe fatigue for 5 full days, my concentration was foggy.

And, was diagnosed with breast cancer in October of 2019, surgery in February 2020, followed by 5 weeks of radiation therapy. The type of breast cancer I had was due to hormones, so any hormones in my body could potentially cause a recurrence of the cancer.

                                                A few days after the first dose, I started wheezing, shortness of breath, severe fatigue, sore throat, and a slight cough. I had to go to urgent care. Please note this did coincide with my period which may have made things worse. My second dose also coincided with my period, and I experienced fever, chills, sore throat, body aches. The second shot also coincided with my period. The vaccine has also changed the schedule of my period cycle. It came a week to two weeks earlier. While I am not worried about my fertility anymore, I worry about younger women. Call if you have questions.

                                                I have a Mirena IUD and typically do not have a period. After my first shot, I had a period almost immediately and it was heavier than just the very light spotting that happens occasionally with an IUD.  I have since had intermittent bleeding, including 7 days after my second shot.  The bleeding comes with migraines, which I normally have once a month around ovulation. They have occurred three times since my first shot.  Other than the sudden onset of the menstrual cycle, I had elevated temp of 99.5 - 99.8 plus chills and upset bowel for 24 hours after the second shot. I did not have these side effects after the first shot. After these symptoms subsided, I had intermittent dizzy spells for another 24 hour period, but nothing else other than irregular menstrual bleeding.

                                                Immediately after, felt fine except for a sore arm. I exercised as normal and it went away after two days. Five days after the shot, I felt a painful, pea-sized lump in my armpit, on the side that I received the injection. It hurt every time I moved my arm. Six days after the shot, my arm got very itchy, hot, and red at the injection site. The rash lasted 2 days. Ten days after the vaccine, my menstrual cycle was to start. On day 1, I had stabbing, debilitating pelvic pain and abdominal cramps, acute nausea, and felt feverish for a day. This is not normal for me. Then I experienced alarmingly heavy flow of bright red blood for 4 days. The blood gushed constantly. More forceful than a miscarriage. I may not have connected this to the vaccine, but my husband noted that the vccine was the only change from last month to this. And then I later read that other women had reported similar symptoms. I cannot stress how worrying and terrifying this experience was. If it is at all vaccine-related, it would help women tremendously to know this could be a side effect, so they don&#39;t panic about their health.

It is no worse than on 5/7 but also does not appear to be significantly abating.

I was bleeding through pads/tampons at 1 per hour during waking hours for 2-3 weeks resulting in anemia.  My hemoglobin was 7  GM/DL and my iron  was 11 UG/DL  Ferritin 2.4 NG/ML    All of those levels were very low vs. standard range.

                                                Besides the general flu like symptoms, I had daily horrible migraines every day for about three weeks starting the day after the vaccine shot.  I saw a neurologist and pain specialist and received bilateral greater occipital nerve block, which was not particularly helpful.  Also, prior to second vaccination, menstruation was extremely regular, every 3.5 weeks.  Last menstrual period began the day after the second shot (4/21/2021) and lasted about 5 days, and has not recurred since; the vaccine seems to have triggered menopause.

Instead of ending in two or three days after the time of the vaccination, my period continued for another two and a half weeks. The blood flow was unusually heavy, clotted, and dark. I became anemic as a result of this excessive blood loss and am still trying to rebuild my energy through iron supplements.  (I will never take a Moderna shot again!!!)

Approximately 3 weeks after the second dose (at the end of May 2021), I had mild cramps and felt like I may have ovulated.  About 2 weeks after that on 06/10/2021 I started to have a period. It lasted about 4 days and was mostly a medium flow (and some light flow). My ob-gyn did tests (see below) but I did not discuss this as an adverse reaction with her. I read an article today that mentioned some women are having unusual menstrual symptoms after the vaccine and wanted to report it just in case.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine I started my menstrual period.  I had not had a period for 7 months and thought I was in Menopause.  I continued to get a period in Feb &#39;21, and Mar &#39;21.  In April of &#39;21 I got a period and that did not stop.  I visited my GYN who did an endometrial biopsy and a polyp was found.  A D&amp;C was performed on 5/26/21.  There were no abnormal cells found in the specimen from the D&amp;C.  I again had a period on 7/22/21.  It appears that I was not in Menopause or for some reason my periods have restarted.  I do not really think this was related to the vaccine but I know other women have been experiencing this so I wanted to report it.

                                                This is day 6 of my 2nd Moderna vaccine.  I began coughing around 10 pm tonight. I noticed  3 days after  my 2nd vaccine that my breast are tender. And they still are. My 2nd vaccine was March 9, 2021.   Slight headache still persist.  All other body pains are gone. The cough is new. Seems like phlegm is trying to come up .

On 3/15/2020 during routine mammogram/sonogram enlarged lymph nodes under left are were observed during sonogram, as well as an indeterminate area in left breast, which will be re-checked during a follow up sonogram . Testing center did inquire regarding when I had received shot and in which arm.  On 3/20/2021 began to experience sore breast, and on 3/25/2021 began to experience a mid-cycle menstrual cycle or vaginal bleeding event that is still occurring as of date of this report 3/29/2021. Date of my previous menstrual cycle began 3/12/2021 and ended 3/17/202.   It should be noted, this is completely unusual, I have only ever experienced menstrual cycles that have a regular  schedule between 24-32 days between cycles and the nature of this bleeding was different than usual.

                                                I started a period on 3/16 that last a week prior to getting my first Moderna shot the morning of Saturday, 3/27, at a scheduled 11 AM appointment, though it was probably closer to 11:30 by the time I received the injection at a local .  The following morning, I had to scramble out of bed at 6:30 AM to run to the bathroom before soaking my sheets with a monster, Stephen King Carrie-worthy period that has been relentless and continued non-stop for 2 weeks, unabated.  I was in contact immediately with my endocrinologist, fearing that my thyroid meds needed to be upped in dosage.  And I was scheduling an appt. with a new gyn as well (won&#39;t see this person till June as a new patient) but hey, prior to this, I had no period through much of 2020.  My endocrinologist put me on a daily dosage of medroxyprogesterone to halt the period.  A week later, as of yesterday, 4/10, I was still bleeding heavily.  Today, it is lighter so hopefully, it&#39;s coming to an end.   I&#39;d assume my sore arm was the extent of the Moderna side effects but then  came across an article by fluke and happenstance this morning.

                                                Heavy menstrual bleeding occurred about 12 hours after my vaccinne (at both first and second doses). My heavy bleeding consisted of emptying a 50 ml mentual cup every 1/2 hour to every hour for two-three days after onset. I became extremely amemic and could not get out of bed. Increasing my Aygestin dose to the maximum recommended dosage daily has stopped the excessive bleeding.

My doctor was concerned enough to order several tests - pap smear, transvaginal ultrasound, blood work, and referred me to a Gynecologist Oncologist.  They did a biopsy from my uterus.  I just got the results of everything today and there is absolutely nothing wrong with me.  I read that some women were having this happen, so I wanted to add my own experience. There was no other explanation for this bleeding, so maybe this is related to my vaccine? I sure don&#39;t know, but there you go!

Took 2 Tylenol and went up as high as 103.   Arm hurt very bad and full body aches, no appetite and lymph nodes swelling.  These symptoms lasted for 3 days.   A few days later,  my lower left side on back started to hurt.  It felt like diverticulitis to me.  I decided to go to Urgent Care and they took blood work and to follow up the next with a CT scan with contrast which came back normal.   I was to continue to modify my diet and monitor myself.   On 5/18/2021 to 5/20/2021 I had extreme menstraul-like pain with cramps and wanted to report this adverse reaction.  My doctor ordered a pelvic ultrasound which came back normal.

The ER doctor ran tests and asked that I follow up with my PCP. My doctor prescribed Provera to slow down or stop the bleeding. I have been taking the medication but it is not working because it hasn&#39;t stopped the bleeding.

My doctor decided to do an ultrasound and found that the lining of my uterus was thicker than normal. A Hysteroscopy to exam the inside of the cervix and uterus to collect tissue for a biopsy along with removing a polyp. I&#39;m currently awaiting the results of the biopsy.

First period after the first vaccine was delayed, and then was 28 days of bleeding (received the second the shot during this time).  11 days later I had another period with four days of bleeding that were heavy enough that my husband encouraged me to call the doctor (clots the size of golf balls).  Since then (48 days and counting) no period.

After talking to others that have had the vaccine, several have had breakthrough bleeding a couple days after the vaccine and thought nothing of it, but people aren&#39;t reporting because they think its just them. I think it should be reported, and maybe some investigation  follow up as to why this may have occurred.

Then a few weeks later, I began bleeding...heavily.  This occurred while taking active birth control pills (not at a time I should have been menstruating).  The bleed was extremely HEAVY, large clotted surges.  Cramping was moderate... I don&#39;t typically experience cramps with my cycle..  This occurred over 3-4 days.  I consulted with my OBGYN and she recommended I stop taking the pill for 5 days and restart.  During that time, the bleeding subsided and then restarted, 2 times (stopping for over 24 hours) then occurring again with a slight decrease in the amount of bleeding each time.  I have since resumed taking the pill and all bleeding has stopped.  I chalked this up to menopause and stress however recently read articles about the vaccine causing  unusual bleeding patterns and though I would report the event after learning that such data was not collected during trials.

Thursday I started spotting (red, not brown; this was fresh blood), and Friday I started bleeding to fill a super-size tampon within 2 hours. That continued for 5 days (I went through a full box of tampons in a weekend.) Given that I&#39;m 54 and hadn&#39;t had a period for 6 months, I thought I was post-menopausal. The bleeding finally subsided on day 7.

                                                Breast cancer, metastatic to lymph node. Within about 6 weeks of administration patient noticed skin changes of breast and lump. Mammogram confirmed a spiculated mass. Surgery confirmed invasive carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features; margin positive for invasive carcinoma, with lymphovascular invasion and positive lymph node. Patient did previously have an abnormal mammogram previously however no clinical signs of cancer were present until the vaccine was given. It is thought that perhaps the vaccine would have accelerated the course of previously existing breast cancer.

                                                With first  dose I had a headache that began day 4 after vaccine.  Headache was intense but would quickly go away with tylenol.  Headache wen away but I was left with the sensation of having &#34;air pumped in my head&#34;.  Felt uncomfortable, and I was constantly aware of the sensation, made head feel somehow heavy.  I consulted my doctor, but no explanation.  Feeling went away 2 weeks after vaccination and never returned.  The second dose  (May 2, 2021) was much more concerning, as I began feeling different pain spots that would feel like stabbing at points. They all were on the left side of my body : lower back, inner arm, shoulder blade and my left breast.  The most concerning reaction had to do with swelling of my left breast, if was noticeably swollen and painful to the touch.  At time I felt the same stabbing pain I felt in other areas of my body.  The pain would come and go.  It took a month before all of this cleared and resolved. .  I saw my doctor and had a breast ultrasound, which came back normal.  I understand from reading some studies that moderna vaccine may have symptoms that mimic breast cancer, I wish this was listed somewhere as it was really scary to experience this type of pain and wondering if it was or not the vaccine.

These went away as soon as I got close to the hospital so I did not seek medical treatment. 45 minutes after receiving vaccine, headache and lymph node swelling. 30 hours after receiving the vaccine rashon arm that started out as small hives and then grew to a rash 4 inches side and 2 inches tall and this lasted for 5 days. The rash was so inflamed that an ice pack could not cool the skin. Dizziness for 2 days.  Hives on left foot the 3rd day that went away quickly and hives on right food on the 4th day after receiving the vaccine that went away quickly. Excessive thirst the first 2 days and dry mouth. Bleeding/spotting for 5 days even though my period had ended 2 days prior to receiving the vaccine.

However, endometrial stripe was 6mm and she had a fibroid, it is therefore possible the increase in bleeding after the vaccines was coincidental and I referred her back to gyn for re-evaluation as she remains at increased risk for endometrial cancer

By April 12th the swelling progressed to her forearm and into the lymph nodes in her armpit and breast. She saw her provider on Tuesday, April 13th and was given doxycycline and prednisone. I spoke with the patient on Wednesday, April 14th and she stated the swelling has not progressed and the tightness feels better.

I started a light period on 4/22 in the morning with light cramping and it continued to be light all day. By 4pm I started to have painful abdominal cramps that became severe. I took about 8 doses of OTC naproxone between 5:30am-8pm but still experienced severe pain that kept me immobile from about 5pm to 9:30pm when I fell asleep. I woke up Friday 4/30 with continued light bleeding. At about 9am the bleeding became profuse for about 10 minutes soaking my pad and pants. Then it returned to light bleeding. This is not a typical period for me.

                                                The following morning after my second vaccine, I woke up with a very sharp headache.  I could not lift my left arm that was vaccinated.  My lower back was sore and I began to have severe menstruation-like cramps that soon turned into throbbing in my uterus and my lower back.  It felt very similar to back labor pains I had with my second child.   This lasted until 3:00 pm and decided to take 1000 mg of Tylenol.  Throughout the day I had a fever and chills.   I attempted to sleep throughout the day.   I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol at 8:00 pm.  This help with my fever.  At 11:00 pm my uterus pain subsided mostly.  The next morning, I felt weak but feel better.

                                                So since the vaccination, late night, I started getting chills and fever up to 102/103. I took Tylenol that is all. I did write it all down somewhere because I am a healthcare professional as well. I also had a runny nose, headache, and body aches. On the 10th I started spotting and bleeding that lasted for about 5 days and it was associated with lower abdominal pain. I contacted my PCD and then my OBGYN, I schedule a visit. I scheduled a mammogram and biopsy for breast and uterus. My last ultrasound was last year in July so the pap came out negative and it was just fibrocystic disease. I did consult a surgeon following the biopsy and she also said that it&#39;s ok. My OBGYN said that there have been others that post vaccine have bleeding issues. I am a mechanical researcher in health care. So my vaccine in Feb. and this was all going on March and the 17th of March and I was on the phone and I just fainted. After that I had a cardiovascular evaluation go on and we are not sure what happened.

The. bleeding continued for 7 days. I contacted my doctor and was seen in the office. She collected a FSH , which was 35.9. She also opted to do a TV U/S. The ultrasound findings were WNL, with the uterus being small and a thin endometrial stripe.  All things looking normal, my physician told me to let her know if the bleeding didn&#39;t stop or returned again. I haven&#39;t had any bleeding since. I don&#39;t know if this unusual bleeding is related in any way to my vaccine.

Severe lower back pain and extreme fatigue included in symptoms. 05/20/21 - start of chest pains, upper back pain, and difficulty breathing 05/24/21 - visit to doctor, concern of possible extreme anemia from hemorrhaging, lab work done 05/25/21 - doctor visit to address lab results, chest pain, back pain, difficulty breathing, light headedness, and sweatiness condition at extreme level.  EKG in doctor office shows problem.  Doctor staff takes me to ER.  EKG in ER points to heart attack (also labs, xray, and other tests).  ER sends me by air lift to a hospital with a cath lab. 05/25/21 continued....cath lab does angiogram, blood tests, etc... Cardiologist cannot find cause of heart arrhythmia, no blockage found, &#34;wandering&#34; EKG settles back to normal.  Cardiologist verbally mentions Paricarditis as a possible diagnosis but does not include that in his written report/medical record.  Discharged. Since 5/25/21 doctor&#39;s have continued with diagnostic tests to explain &#34;heart&#34; event.  As of 07/07/21 no definitive diagnosis, continuing tests.

                                                24 hours after the second injection, I had intense pain in all my joints on the left side of my body. 5 days later I had intense pain in my calves that came and went. 11 days later while taking a long road trip. I had excruciating pain in my calves.  I thought maybe I was dehydrated so I consumed some potassium and some hydro lights.The pain did not resolve so I went to an urgent care where I had my blood tested (everything looked good) and then ultrasounds of both of my legs to find blood clots.  This showed no blood clots.  General pain finally went away within a week.  I do continue to have what feels like knots in my legs a random times.  Then on July 6th, I had unexplained vaginal bleeding after being in menopause for 15 months. I made an appointment with my obgyn on Thursday where I had blood taken and a biopsy for possible uterine cancer.  The following week I went for two types of ultrasounds to see if there were any structural issues.  Everything was normal; no cancer, no polyps or fibroids, just an unexplained period.

I mainly feel hot all the time.  Additionally: I spoke with a friend who is 59, and she had the same shot and had her menstrual cycle for 3 days since her 2nd shot, and she has been menopausal for several years now.

                                                Jan 11 2021 was my first shot and I felt the sore left arm and some left breast area tenderness which I attributed to working out. Feb 9 I received the 2nd dose and again had sore left arm and more pain in the left breast lymph area. Four weeks after around March 7 my lymph nodes on the LEFT side began swelling and aching which became very painful and worrisome. My Left breast was very tender and sore and that area swollen. I am 10 weeks post shot and the MD today palpated and said he still feels swelling.  I am being sent for a mammo.   I have breast implants and it &#34;FELLS like the vaccine is fighting the implant&#34;

So far, lobster and salmon. Lobster caused a tightening of the throat. Salmon caused tingling and swollen lips.

The symptoms receded after Day 2, but the body aches and nausea and fatigue remained. Roughly one month after the second shot, I got my period, even though I have gone through menopause and have not had a period in roughly three years. I would also like to add that I am pro-vaccine as my father was a prominent pharmaceutical scientist. I was in perfect health through the entire pandemic and menopause and do believe my menstrual cycle was somehow changed or restarted by the vaccine.

Within the next 24 hrs I had a fever of 102, body aches, chills where I couldn&#39;t stop shaking, sore arm at injection site. It was the worse I had felt in a very long time. I called my on call physician on Saturday. He gave no treatment other than rest, fluids and Tylenol. I slept the entire weekend after receiving the vaccine on Friday. I had fatigue for about 2 weeks after the shot. In March, I was still fatigued, my ankles were also significantly swollen and difficulty breathing like wheezing at the end of March. I had a significant asthma event I had a course of prednisone. My normal inhalers were not working. I also used medicated breathing treatments, nebulizer. Also, in March,  I had the worst menstrual cycle. I had significant cramps and heavy bleeding both of which were unusual. In April and forward, it was back to normal.  My ankles and breathing are back to normal.

                                                Postmenopausal heavy bleeding. I entered menopause 15 years ago and did not experienced ANY menstrual-type of bleeding sine 2009. Last week I started to experience pre-menstrual cramps that lasted about 6 days, on the day 2 I started spotting and that developed into what looks very much like heavy menstrual bleeding that is now lasting for 6 days with cramping coming and going. My OBGYN retired and I could not get appointment with the new Dr until June21st 2021. If the bleeding does not slow down I plan to go  the ER. .

I took 2 OTC Motrin which improved but did not eliminate pain. A few hours later, prior to taking additional NSAIDs, I checked neck and underarm for swollen lymph nodes as that was what the pain/ache reminded me of. I did not feel and lymph nodes in my neck or underarm but I did notice  2 new lumps in my breast on that same side. One was tiny and hard ~1mm, the other was about the size of a pea. Both were located in the upper, outer quadrant @ about10:00.  I called my PCP and got appointment.  By the time of my appointment, I could no longer find the tiny lump. My PCP ordered a breast ultrasound which I had which did not show any new lumps

On Sunday 04/04/21 my eyebrows, around my mouth, my chin &amp; under my neck were excessively itching. To the point I felt like I had two chins. On Monday 04/05/21 my body began feeling itchy and during the evening I began seeing scanty rashes. By Tuesday 04/06/21 it was unbearable.  I could not sit still. Different areas would feel funny like a burning sensation, then wherever I feel the burning rashes would break out with severe itching. My body itched beyond relief. I sought medical treatment at Urgent Care Facility. I was given predisone40 mg daily &amp; Benadryl for 5 days. Only today 04/09/21 I finally got relief. My breast &amp; abdomen still very  tender, I took Photos of my rashed arm.

Was given Benadryl and stayed for 1 1/2 hours while monitored by nurses.  Went home, rested and felt poorly the rest of the day.   The new issue was then on Sunday, the lymph gland on my left clavicle swelled up. I thought it was a blood clot so I went to the ER. Had I been told this may happen I would not have gone to the ER.   The swelling has not gone down but gotten worse, has expanded to both arm pits, arms, groin areas, upper chest and breasts. Overall feeling of malaise and tiredness. Occasional heavy chest and headaches.   Spoke with PCP yesterday. He asked if I was given anything for my symptoms ( swelling and pain ) I said no. He is hoping this will resolve itself with time.   Have used heating pad and Tylenol and have rested for three full days.

Then # nights later in the middle of the night I started bleeding vaginally. it was at least 2 to 3  tablespoons every 30 minutes to an hour. I am 58 and not had a period for 15 years!  I had terrible pain and bloating. I became light headed and weak, I had chills and a slight fever. This lasted three days. I went to urgent care, they sent me to my doctor. they ran tests and could not find any reason for my bleeding. It has since stopped but I still have some pressure by my overies.

Redness was gone in about three days and the soreness was gone after two weeks. The second dose was given 1/27/21. About 12 hours after given the 2nd vaccine, I woke up from a sleep with chills, temp of 99.2, muscle and joint aches, breast tenderness, site soreness, slight redness.  These symptoms were expected and my temperature was normal after taking a shower and drinking some water.  The chills persisted and I checked my temp a few times to make sure I didn&#39;t have a temperature.

I THOUGHT I was having a blood sugar issue, but that was not the case.  I went to sleep for about two hours, then woke up about 9pm feeling a little better.  I had NO pain in my arm or anywhere else and slept the entire night.    Friday (1/22), I developed pain and swelling in my breast, armpit, and injection site.  I literally  felt crappy all weekend.  Weird...????  I was confused this happened about ONE WEEK AFTER the vaccine. The injection site was the size of a golf ball, hard, and  quite warm.  I began to feel better after about 3 days, but the arm was still slightly red, sore, and there&#39;s a slight bump.

                                                On Friday evening, 24 hours after my 2nd vaccine, my left arm started to itch. My arm, underarm and left breast was very red, swollen, itchy,  tender to the touch and my arm felt sort of numb and weird.  Prior to feeling that way, I had a headache and the left side of my neck was tight and painful. I put some Benadryl gel and an ice pack on my arm and underarm. The following day it felt a little better but still had redness, swelling and itchiness. On Sunday when I went back to work, I had NP take a look at my arm. She felt I may have developed a cellulitis and prescribed Keflex 500mg QID x 7 days. Today, Monday, 2/15/2021, my arm is still a bit red and feels tight but is much better than it was on Friday and Saturday.

Dose 2 - 1:45 p.m. 4/16/2021 - two days later, like clock work, period cramping, heavy spotting. Dose 1 - spotting lasted 14 days, stopped the morning of my pelvic ultrasound to determine if there was something serious going on. Dose 2 - spotting started two days after vaccine, counting the days to see how long this lasts, with cramping. I am 59, no kids, never been pregnant, last period at age 39, menopause at 42 and still in menopause.  What is going on Moderna? A vaccine should not interfere with hormones or hormone replacement therapy. A vaccine cost me additional procedures  - still waiting on the bill for the ultrasound and several doctor appts, and lab work.
