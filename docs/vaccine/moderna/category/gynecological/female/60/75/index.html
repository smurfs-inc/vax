                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

It&#39;s six hours later and I&#39;m still experiencing menstruation,  cramping,  irritability and exhaustion.  What is going on? I feel younger and more energetic.

                                                Within 7 days of the injection, my left breast begin to swell and feel uncomfortable. Days after this, left breast nipple inverted. This problem is only escalating in my opinion. Sporadic pain in breast - sharp deep pain. Within 10 days of the injection, large rash appeared at injection site, approx size of a softball. An additional rash also appeared below and to right (towards inner arm) of the injection site; it started small and proceeded to spread to approx several inches. Sporadic pain in upper arm continues. I reported all of this to my physician. I was told to take Tylenol and Bendadryl. I pushed for an appt to check on my breast, and that appt is scheduled for 3/12/21 with a PA.

On Sat 3/28/21 I developed very large red hive like lesions all over my neck, under ears, and one very large one on my left side.  These lasted for 4 days. They were very large welt line lesions but were nit itchy like hives. I also developed some vaginal spotting. I also became very flushed and very hot and fatigued with any excercise despite not having fever except for second day. I have pictures of these red hive like spots

Early that evening chills, fever, body aches, headache,  &amp; dry cough that lasted most of the night.  The following day fatigue, runny nose, body aches, headache, swollen lymph node/breast area &amp; arm tenderness continued.  The third day following the shot less fatigue, but still swollen area with pain and less headache.  Today, (day 4) minor headache, injection area, under arm and side of breast is still quite tender and swollen.  Research articles (U of MN, medRxiv services, etc.) indicate a 2nd shot may not be needed?????

                                                Began with stabbing pain in left shoulder that woke me up every 2 hours all night long. Progressed to massive migraine headache in a wide band across my forehead.  Found fluid pooling in a channel from my armpit past my elbow; rubbed on it and raise arm until it went away. Muscles in left arm stopped working; couldn&#39;t move my arm; put left arm in a sling.  Started feeling like I was burning up with fever, but body temperature was normal 98.8 degrees. Several hours later was having sudden chills and found body temperature had risen to 102 degrees F.  Developed high blood pressure for me. The lymph node in my neck were swelling, armpit tender to touch, and left breast tender to touch too.  Started icing the back of my neck to take down temp. Put ice on my shoulder to try to cool the pain.  I was very frightened and worried that: (1) got sepsis bacterial infection from shot (2) got bad lot of Moderna or (3) Moderna vaccine sat out at room temperature too long and had gone bad.  48 hours after the 2nd dose and after icing, symptoms started to ease.

                                                The next day after vaccine was given, I got vaginal spotting/breakthrough  bleeding. I am postmenopausal and on HRT and have been for 14 years and have not had any spotting after menopause and HRT was started. This highly unusual. Today, I also got a little spotting in the afternoon, like yesterday. So this is the second day in a row. I do not have any discomfort. I contacted my doctor late today and left a message for her. I do hope she will contact me tomorrow. I have heard that there are some new symptoms  reported in the UK regarding female gynecological  side effects like changes in  menstrual cycle, which would not apply directly to me, but maybe similar symptoms?  I am hoping the spotting will stop soon.  The question is, would a 2nd dose be advised or not?

                                                After Moderna Dose #1 Within one day of vaccination the person experienced extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, joint achiness, headache, and nausea.  She felt feverish and chilled but had no fever.  She noted nightmares , hard to focus, eye sensitivity, abdominal pain and about 10days after vaccination had an episode of thick saliva and drainage so that she had to sleep upright.  These symptoms progressed for about a week and then slowly resolve completely by about 3 weeks post vaccination.     After Moderna Dose #2  - RN spoke with client 1 week after dose #2. Within one day of vaccination she experiences intense fatigue, headache on day 2, light sensitivity, body aches in joints and muscles, her arm felt hot, swelling of her breasts, no appetite, and abdominal pain, She did NOT experience any rashes or itching or difficulty breathing.  Her symptoms were so incapacitating that she could not do any of her ADL&#39;s and could only relieve her pain by lying down in bed all day.  As soon as she tried to move around the intense joint pains returned and she had to lie down.  Normally she treats her arthritis with Colchicine as needed but received no relief.  After a few days she did try one dose of Allegra (antihistamine) with some relief.  Resting by lying down in bed for a week has been her only relief.  She did not indicate any allergies to PEG.
