                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

Upon waking the next morning I was shocked to find I am menstruating, at age 60,  for the first time since February 2016. It&#39;s six hours later and I&#39;m still experiencing menstruation,  cramping,  irritability and exhaustion.  What is going on? I feel younger and more energetic.

                                                I got my first dose of the Modena vaccine on March 29th, only had local injection site pain for 3 days, then I did not have any other sides effects. Unfortunately 3 weeks later, my legs and back waist started growing rashes, total about 30 which were itchy, these rashes slowing faded in 3-4 days. Starting on the 19th, my waist and left hip are in pain and I can hardly move and can&#39;t bend. The pain changes place to place and from sometimes being very light and sometimes strong. It has been 6 days now, although pain is not getting worse. I am thinking that these symptoms are due to my body overacting in response to the vaccine, resulting in spine and hip joint inflammation inducing pain.

                                                The adverse reaction was that I got a 5 day long menstrual period for the first time since 2012. I am 60 years old and past menopause since 2012, with no other menstrual bleeding, uterine problems or any gynecological issues during that intervening time. The period started about 2 hours after my 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine. It was a light period, not heavy, but more than just spotting...it did last 5 days, requiring a pad during all 5 of those days. I also had some fatigue and general achiness in my neck, back and joints, but that only lasted a day or 2. Unfortunately, I did not call my dr when this happened. For these reporting purposes, I guess that would have been helpful. I did call and make an appointment, but it will not occur until May 12, 2021. That is why I didn?t fill out the doctor and facility portions of this form. One last thing...I am not any kind of anti-vaxxer. I am a left-of-center suburban mom of 5 grown kids with a college education. (Not sure if that makes any difference here, but I offer it in the For-What-It?s Worth Dept.

Patient developed spontaneous wet purpura, petechiae and vaginal bleeding on 3/19/2021. CBC showed undetectable platelet count. Normal hemoglobin and platelets. Did not respond to dexamethasone 40md daily x 4 or multiple IVIG doses. Started romiplostim on 3/25/21 and is currently on dose escalations with platelets persisting undetectable.  On 3/28 developed acute anemia with a 2 to 3 g/dL hemoglobin drop and was found to have a spontaneous hemoperitoneum . Treated with tranexamic acid, multiple platelet transfusions and an additional dose of romiplostim. Bleeding has since resolved but platelets remain undetectable.

                                                Immediately after I received the shot, I felt my whole left arm get very warm.  Before going to bed Wednesday evening,  my arm began to hurt.  Beginning at approx. 1:00 am after receiving shot, I got a headache which kept me up most of the night.  The headache continued until Friday morning with taking Tylenol every 4 hours.  Thursday other than my head hurting, my body hurt and I had a loss of appetite. Thursday evening I got chills, and ran a temperature.  I was still taking Tylenol.  I was able to keep my temp at bay only getting to 100.5 at the highest.  Thursday night with all my pain, I did not sleep well again.  My left arm hurt so bad and I was having a hard time letting it rest at my side.  I realized my left armpit was swollen and down my left side to my breast I was very sore and tender.  I woke Friday morning without a headache.  I worked out at a gym on Friday but was not able to keep up with my usual routine.  I still did not have an appetite but ate just for the energy.  Food did not taste good.  I had Covid in early November and lost my taste and smell.  It returned so I&#39;m not sure why food is not tasting good.  It almost has a bland, metal taste if that makes sense.  I felt like I was on the road to recovery only to run a temp again Friday evening.  I got chills and knew what what was coming.  No temp on Saturday as of yet.  I do not have a headache which I am glad.  My left arm still hurts but I am getting better range of motion.  It is still very tender under the armpit area.

Used icepacks, motrin, extra-strength tylenol for 4 days.  Pain reduced slightly, but for 2 more weeks felt off &amp; on left arm pit,  and left arm swelling, sensation of fluid under skin near left chest, left upper back, left upper side. Minor relief by keeping left arm elevated, wearing a compression sleeve, wearing a sports bra all day and at night. Swelling is not going away. It increases and decreases but never feels normal. Its now 4 weeks. Inaddition to the above I had the expected side effects: bodyaches, left arm injection pain, tired, low grade temp, headache, foggy head for 10 days.

This problem is only escalating in my opinion. Sporadic pain in breast - sharp deep pain. Within 10 days of the injection, large rash appeared at injection site, approx size of a softball. An additional rash also appeared below and to right (towards inner arm) of the injection site; it started small and proceeded to spread to approx several inches. Sporadic pain in upper arm continues. I reported all of this to my physician. I was told to take Tylenol and Bendadryl. I pushed for an appt to check on my breast, and that appt is scheduled for 3/12/21 with a PA.

                                                1. Metallic taste in my mouth. It started about 45 minutes after my vaccination and lasted all day. Resolved by the next day. 2.Extreme fatigue - all day of my vaccination. Resolved by the next day. 3.Fever of 100 degrees, chills, ached everywhere. Especially extreme ache in both of my hands. It all started about 11pm on the day after my vaccination. Lasted all night. Resolved in the morning.  4. Woke up Friday morning, 2 days after my vaccination,  after feverish night to what felt like a busted lip. My lip upon inspection was fine, no abrasions, but felt tingly and like there was nerve damage upon waking. It has lasted 3 days, and began waning on the 4th day. There&#39;s just a bit of the sensation remaining. 5.Same time frame as #4. I awoke to left breast pain/ tenderness. I have a cyst with mild pain and tenderness that is monitored, and the vaccination made this area worse for the same time frame as above.

The headache, fatigue, and pain resolved within one day.  The breast symptoms gradually resolved over four days.

Never any body aches, nausea , or diarrhea.   Nurse thought a type of colitis.  I have never had colitis.  Today fever is gone but the pelvic area is very tender to touch.  Cramps are very mild and now infrequent.  My stools and urine were normal.  Just weak from fever.

                                                Pelvic joint and muscle pain; still persistent. At first I thought it was due to not walking owing to ice and snow but has intensified even though I am back to walking. I expected headaches or flu symptoms as I had from the first Shingrix shot. I have no history of adverse effects to flu vaccines.

Early that evening chills, fever, body aches, headache,  &amp; dry cough that lasted most of the night.  The following day fatigue, runny nose, body aches, headache, swollen lymph node/breast area &amp; arm tenderness continued.  The third day following the shot less fatigue, but still swollen area with pain and less headache.  Today, (day 4) minor headache, injection area, under arm and side of breast is still quite tender and swollen.  Research articles (U of MN, medRxiv services, etc.) indicate a 2nd shot may not be needed?????

                                                Began with stabbing pain in left shoulder that woke me up every 2 hours all night long. Progressed to massive migraine headache in a wide band across my forehead.  Found fluid pooling in a channel from my armpit past my elbow; rubbed on it and raise arm until it went away. Muscles in left arm stopped working; couldn&#39;t move my arm; put left arm in a sling.  Started feeling like I was burning up with fever, but body temperature was normal 98.8 degrees. Several hours later was having sudden chills and found body temperature had risen to 102 degrees F.  Developed high blood pressure for me. The lymph node in my neck were swelling, armpit tender to touch, and left breast tender to touch too.  Started icing the back of my neck to take down temp. Put ice on my shoulder to try to cool the pain.  I was very frightened and worried that: (1) got sepsis bacterial infection from shot (2) got bad lot of Moderna or (3) Moderna vaccine sat out at room temperature too long and had gone bad.  48 hours after the 2nd dose and after icing, symptoms started to ease.

                                                Two weeks after the 1st vaccine I started having severe muscle and joint pain in my shoulder and pelvic Areas. Within 24 hours of my second vaccine I experienced four hours of chills and malaise. This lasted four hours.  My second vaccine was on April 16, 2021 in my left arm. the Vaccine was Madonna, lot number 043 B21A. two days after my second vaccine, my left knee became swollen to the point of being unable to bear weight. The shoulder and pelvic area pain continued to worsen and I began experiencing profound fatigue. I felt as though I had full body inflammation. The acute pain then  extended into my right-hand where I experienced a sudden and spontaneous rupture of my thumb tendon which required surgery to repair.  The rapture occurred why was sitting quietly doing nothing strenuous. I am being followed by a rheumatologist with a new diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. My symptoms have been going on for over two months and they&#39;re quite debilitating.

                                                The next day after vaccine was given, I got vaginal spotting/breakthrough  bleeding. I am postmenopausal and on HRT and have been for 14 years and have not had any spotting after menopause and HRT was started. This highly unusual. Today, I also got a little spotting in the afternoon, like yesterday. So this is the second day in a row. I do not have any discomfort. I contacted my doctor late today and left a message for her. I do hope she will contact me tomorrow. I have heard that there are some new symptoms  reported in the UK regarding female gynecological  side effects like changes in  menstrual cycle, which would not apply directly to me, but maybe similar symptoms?  I am hoping the spotting will stop soon.  The question is, would a 2nd dose be advised or not?

After one hour I was fine.  Second vaccine was administered on Feb. 8th at noon. By 3:30 AM Feb 9th I could barely get out of bed because of severe joint pain and aching. I was nauseated, had a mild fever, mild headache and very tired. This lasted until  February the 10th at which time I felt better. By Feb. 11th I had return of deep aching pain in my hips and pelvic bones. ( I have arthritis and know what joint pain is). This was much worse. I felt ill from about one week after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna. I started feeling much better with the occasional return of mild symptoms.  I go to physical therapy for arthritis pain and had taken a week off. I returned to physical therapy on Thursday. February 18th. I was unable to complete my usual workout due to weakness in my legs and joint pain. I returned on Feb. 22nd and the same thing happened I felt weak, diaphoretic, nauseated,  after exercising a short time. This has never happened before.

Also arm was sore from armpit to middle of arm  on inside of arm. It has been two weeks now and my breast is still slightly swollen on left side near armpit and I am concerned. This is my first shot and what will happen if I get the second.  The breast still bothers me. If I had to do it again I thing I might not of got the vaccine.

                                                After Moderna Dose #1 Within one day of vaccination the person experienced extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, joint achiness, headache, and nausea.  She felt feverish and chilled but had no fever.  She noted nightmares , hard to focus, eye sensitivity, abdominal pain and about 10days after vaccination had an episode of thick saliva and drainage so that she had to sleep upright.  These symptoms progressed for about a week and then slowly resolve completely by about 3 weeks post vaccination.     After Moderna Dose #2  - RN spoke with client 1 week after dose #2. Within one day of vaccination she experiences intense fatigue, headache on day 2, light sensitivity, body aches in joints and muscles, her arm felt hot, swelling of her breasts, no appetite, and abdominal pain, She did NOT experience any rashes or itching or difficulty breathing.  Her symptoms were so incapacitating that she could not do any of her ADL&#39;s and could only relieve her pain by lying down in bed all day.  As soon as she tried to move around the intense joint pains returned and she had to lie down.  Normally she treats her arthritis with Colchicine as needed but received no relief.  After a few days she did try one dose of Allegra (antihistamine) with some relief.  Resting by lying down in bed for a week has been her only relief.  She did not indicate any allergies to PEG.

                                                May 18 I received my first Covid Moderna Vaccination.  4 hours later when I went to urinate there was blood on the toilet paper. It only lasted about 3-4 minutes.  2 hours after that I went to the bathroom again to urinate and it burned really bad.  I called my doctor and was able to see her the next morning ( May 19)  She sent my urine in for a culture and it came back as a Urinary Tract Infection. She treated me with Cipro for 3 days. She felt that I should see my GYN regarding the bleeding and felt that it is Post Menopausal Bleeding. I saw my GYN on June 7. She did a Pap Smear and it came back normal but it showed that I have a Bacterial Vaginitis infection and treated me with Metronidazole Vaginal Gel for 5 days. Today June 14 is my last day for that. But when I went to the bathroom to urinate there was some blood again on the toilet paper. I don&#39;t know if all this is a coincidence or if this is a reaction to the vaccination. My doctor doesn&#39;t think it is a reaction but I want to make sure since I was fine till I was vaccinated. I am concerned because I had no sign of the bleeding or the burning before I got the vaccination. I am also concerned because my next vaccination is tomorrow June 15. If I don&#39;t get the second one then is the 1st one not going to be valid. If I do get the second one could I have a worse problem with bleeding and UTI? Due to the bleeding I have to have a vaginal ultrasound and depending on the results I might have to have an endometrial biopsy.
