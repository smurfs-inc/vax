She ended up going to the local ED - since she was still very fatigued and was feeling like she was going to pass out - blood work and U/S done - this is where she found out she had been pregnant but had lost the pregnancy (no heart beat).  Per her report - all other blood work was unremarkable.  No other medications given to her during this visit and was just told that she would be &#39;passing the products of conception within this next week&#39;.

Advised patient to monitor for other signs and symptoms of bleeding such as excessive bruising, nose bleeds, gum bleeds, and to check her stool for the appearance of coffee grounds. Patient was calling to try to find a doctor nearby who could see her. Advised patient that if she could not find a doctor to go to urgent care if the bleeding continued or worsened.

Also had high fever (reaching 103.8) for four days (starting two days after vaccination) which was reported, and a rash of purple spots across my chest, arms, and back started after fever stopped. Rash was not very bothersome, but alarming. Experienced frequent nausea and lightheadedness, but I also was experiencing those symptoms at the time due to my concussion. One week exactly after vaccination all symptoms were gone and no treatment was needed.

Since then, it has overflowed two more times, so my period is significantly heavier than usual.

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

                                                Pt reports receiving dose #1 of the COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) on 1/26/21. She reports feeling intense abdominal cramping that evening into the next morning, and she reports starting her menstrual period that morning. The pt continued to have 2-3 days of heavy menstrual bleeding then 2-3 weeks of intermittent passage of menstrual blood and clots with continued cramping. The pt has been receiving depo provera injections on time for approximately two years, and she reports that she has not had her period during this time. After receiving the COVID-19 vaccine was when she resumed her menstrual period after a long time. She reports to her primary care clinic today to receive her depo injection on time, and she reports having some menstrual bleeding today. This RN consulted with a provider on site who encouraged use of tylenol for abdominal cramping, maintaining hydration and rest.  This RN asked pt to call back next week after her 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to report status of menstruation and any side effects from depo injection or covid vacccine. It is also important to note that the pt has a hx of dysmenorrhea, but the two years of depo injections have suppressed her regular menstrual cycle.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had a really awful headache and swollen arm, that was incredibly touch-sensitive. Around 3 pm that day, 25 hours after the injection I was hit with severe nausea. About an hour later, I began vomiting and had diarrhea. For some time, I was unable to keep water down. I called a 24-hour nurse line, and they advised contacting my doctor&#39;s emergency line. I did, they said if I couldn&#39;t make it through the night without keeping water down I needed to go to the hospital. Luckily, right before bed I drank some water and was able to make it through the night. The next morning, I had a telehealth visit with someone from my doctors office to review symptoms. Today I have had waves of nausea, but no vomiting. I have had diarrhea, and I had a spontaneous period that was very heavy and two weeks early today (2 days post vaccine).

I?m not sure it?s related to the vaccine but it has never happened to me before. So I thought it would be best to report since if heard similar things from other women. It?s heavier than usual and more painful.  Also I had pain in my left armpit that went away after a few days that started about a week before my menstrual cycle. I?m guessing it was swollen lymph nodes due to the vaccine because I have seen other women report that as well.

                                                I developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of platelets) and menorrhagia due to the vaccine according to my doctor. I believe there have been about 30 cases of this occurring so far.   In my case, I took the vaccine and felt relatively tired for two days. There were no other symptoms. About a week later, I got my period after not having it for a couple months. The blooding was light for a few days, but then got extremely heavy. After about a week of very heavy bleeding, I went to urgent care. They took blood tests, and found that I had a critically low level of platelets (6 platelets when the normal range is 150-400). I was admitted to the ER for multiple days, and they gave a platelet transfusion and IVIG  fluids, which has helped considerably. I also had to take steroids to suppress my immune system so that my platelets could increase.

                                                By the evening of April 16th, I was experiencing a fever of 103.5 after already medicating an hour prior. On the 17th, my fever continued and I noticed vaginal bleeding. On the morning of April 18th, I went to the emergency room because I was still experiencing this bleeding, as well as bleeding from my nose. We came to the conclusion that I had an ovarian cyst rupture.

So it?s like I started PMSing a bit early. I got my period a few days ago which means I had my period twice this month which is very uncommon for me.

                                                The date of the second dose was 05/25/2021, which is when the side effects started. I had the normal and expected effects, such as a sore arm and fatigue. I began my period that morning, before I went in for the shot. I would like to be as detailed as possible, so I will likely include some graphic details in this description. My apologies in advance.  My period normally lasts 3-4 days and is moderate (as far as I know) regarding blood loss. After the second dose, the flow was extremely heavy and my period lasted for almost an entire week (7 days). It was miserable. I was bloated and tender in that area, and extremely tired. I was also cramping, which is unusual for me nowadays.  About two weeks after that, I felt a stabbing or ripping pain in the uterus area. It stayed for about two days, throbbing every minute or so. I could not sleep those days. It was not so unbearable that I could not perform everyday actions, but it was taking up a good portion of my thoughts that weekend. After that, it went away and I thought it was over.  About three days ago from today (today is June 22nd, or 06/22/2021), the pain returned and I knew it meant the start of my period. The timing was normal. The next day I began bleeding, but the flow is again much heavier than normal. The pain is back and much worse than before. I am going through many more pads than usual and it is, for me, a worrying amount of blood. Since this is the second period in a row I am experiencing this, I felt it was necessary to report it in. I hope this is okay and not taking resources from those with worse issues.  I would also like to note that I experienced my first panic attack in 5 years the night of my second dose (for no reason- they&#39;ve always had a concrete reason for occurring) and my anxiety was notably worse that week (I am on medication and was otherwise doing very well managing the anxiety). During the attack I experienced the usual symptoms: my throat closing up and making it harder to breathe, and uncontrollable shaking and crying.  I was not thinking of anything that would make me nervous at the time of the attack. I had just finished an online gaming session with a friend and was showering to prepare for bed, so I was fully relaxed.  Additionally, my mental health has notably dipped a bit over the last month, though there are a number of factors at play and I don&#39;t want to blame the vaccine for that. However, I was told to at least make note of it here just in case there does end up being a correlation.

She reported the itching resolved after the medications and then she is still complaining of breast pain.  She noticed 2 drops of fluid out of her right nipple.  I do not necessarily know that this is an allergic reaction I am just not sure what to make of the coincidence with the Covid immunization it could be entirely unrelated.  Advised follow-up with her PCP regarding these issues.  Return precautions discussed.  She verbalized agreement and understanding with plan of care.  Sent home from ED.

Estimated due date was 10/22/21 based on her last menstrual period.  She had her first covid vaccine on 3/4/2021.  She saw me for her first prenatal visit on 3/24/21 and was asymptomatic.  Fetal heart tones were not appreciated on doppler.  She was referred for a dating ultrasound, which she never completed.  She began having some bleeding sometime after the appointment on 3/24.  She got her 2nd covid vaccine on 4/1/21.  She began having pelvic cramping on 4/3.  went to emergency dept 4/4.  u/s showed an 8week 2 day gestation with no heart beat.  she continued to have bleeding and cramping 4/5 and likely completed the miscarriage that day.

I have an IUD which makes my periods regular, but I have not had by period since 4/7, so it is late by two full weeks now and it has not returned yet.

The bleeding was light also lasted about a full week, while before on birth control it was light for a day or two, and before that would be heavy for about five days.

Fever/body chills lasted two days after receiving. Extreme dizziness hours after receiving and lasting about 3 days. Abnormal period began one week later (2.5 weeks early) with terrible period cramps, abnormal increase in blood loss, nausea and headache.  About a week and a half after receiving first vaccine I felt real congested, stuffy, and like I had a cold. Abnormal for a generally healthy person without history of chronic or really any sicknesses. Chronic ?cold? feeling every couple weeks since receiving (today?s date is june 26).  The tingling and numb sensation happens every day to this day in my left forearm, palm and fingers, and on the left side of my skull.  It starts gradually and lasts for about 20-40 minutes, about 2-5 times a day. No amount of movement or massage for blood flow helps. Still experiencing irregular and abnormal cycles, and extreme heavy flow almost at once that has never been normal. New direct stabbing and cramping pain has began to occur since my first cycle after the shot. It?s a sharp stabbing and cramping pain in my reproductive organs area. Worsening hormonal acne with no changes to previous routine/no new medications, etc.

Doctor checked urinalysis, vaginal swab and hormonal bloodwork. All came back normal. Was sent to urgent care to have a covid test and flu test. Both came back negative.

                                                Two days post receiving the first dose of theCOVID-19 Vaccine by Moderna, I noticed menstrual spotting and abdominal cramping despite being on birth control and being a week away from my regularly scheduled period. This is extremely out of the ordinary because my periods are very regular and I have never experienced break through bleeding in between my periods. It has been only around 48 hours after receiving the vaccination that this occurred.

Period bleeding occurred on day 2 and has been atypical (usually no period), very dark and bright red, a bit each day.

When it does finally come I have no bloating or breast pain, but I do get occasional cramping and very very heavy bleeding with many blood clots. My first period since the second dose has been incredibly light and the complete opposite of what it normally is. Brest pain, bloating and very light flow. No clots, no heavy flow, no cramping. I&#39;ve heard lots of other girls talk about how they&#39;ve had terrible periods after their second dose when they usually have normal ones so I figured I should report that I&#39;ve had the opposite effect.

                                                I began menstruating in the evening of Tuesday January 5th, 2021 (on schedule). However by the morning of January 6th, my flow had increased in a way I had never experienced before.  And until midday on January 9th, I was going through 1 ?super? tampon every 2-3 hours. My menstruation flow resembled blood, and was not as clotted as my regular flow. On January 9th, the bleeding slowed and normalized.  I contacted my doctor?s office and was directed to take 1000mg of acetaminophen twice daily, and call back if my flow had not slowed down by Monday because I would have to come in.   I followed the recommendations for one day (on January 8th)  and took a total of 2000mg of acetaminophen.

I am not sure if the acne cream got in my eye the night before the vaccine. it is called Retin A cream 0.025%. I have also been feeling very weak. I got a B12 injection on my butt for energy(Friday, march 12). My legs feel like they are in pain and the hurt when I walk. I also had a lot of pelvic pain after the vitamin injection. I drank ibuprofen March 14 at night. I woke up feeling very weak. Before going to bed on March 15 I drank Tylenol. I still feel pain in my legs today and now I have lower back pain.

                                                I received my 1st dose of the vaccine on 3/19 which was also the same time I should have gotten my period. My period cycle ranges from 24-26 days on average, so it wasn&#39;t certain that I would get my period on 3/19. As on 4/10/2021 I discovered that I never got my period. There is no possible chance that I am pregnant because I am not sexually active and have never been. I haven&#39;t taken any form of contraceptive for about 2 years, maybe longer. The only factor, other than the vaccine, that might cause a missed period could be stress. The date of my vaccine shot was around the end of the school term which is a higher stress time period, but not much more than normal and I experience that level of stress about every 9-11 weeks. None of which did I miss or have a delayed period.   My 2nd dose is scheduled for 4/16/2021.

I have already had my monthly period begining April 5th-10th, 2021. The blood flow is very abnormal. What looked like old and black blood initally is now fresh red blood. Along with the blood flow, I developed painful and uncomfortable labial lacertations. I have Nexplanon in my left arm and have not had abnormal reactions to the Nexplanon in over a month. I am concerned that I developed these symptoms after the second dose, but not the first. I am concerned that this vaccine had a reaction with my Nexplanon implant.

The Sunday after my vaccination (on a Tuesday) I started a period which was normal until the next Tuesday when it got extremely heavy and I had to leave work. Days 2 and 3 of my period had always been the worst before I was on birth control and would last 6-7 days petering out at the end, and I am now on day 6 with as heavy a period as day 2. I&#39;ve also noticed a lot of blood clots in my menstrual fluid which I have never had before. I have had to take days off of work and hope this doesn&#39;t last too much longer.

It?s not a lot that I need a pad. It?s enough whenever I wipe after peeing, I see a little spot of blood. After the second dose, the spotting continues but start to become heavier. A week later after second dose, the spotting is a bit heavier that I need to wear a panty liner.  This spotting been going for a month now since my first dose.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 17-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainted), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)). On 18-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol). On 19-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) and FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug). On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period) and PALLOR (Pale as a ghost). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainted) had resolved, SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work), SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol), FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period), PALLOR (Pale as a ghost), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)) outcome was unknown and DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) had not resolved. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported. Treatment medications include Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) for diarrhea for 1.5 days (unknown dose/frequency).  Patient waited out 20 minutes post-vaccination and then went to the bathroom. When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

Patient describes her symptoms as if she is having a normal menstrual cycle.  This patient uses Nexplanon for contraception successfully without a menstrual cycle for the past 2 years.  Denies other urinary or vaginal symptoms, or possibility that she may be pregnant.  Although there is high suspicion that this is a COVID-19 vaccine side effect, I will evaluate for abnormal anovulatory uterine bleeding with labs and follow-up with ulatrasound if her symptoms do not resolve with time.    24yo female with left sided supraclavicular lymphadenopathy presenting within 24hrs of her 1st and 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Patient endorses waning symptoms after the first dose until she received the second dose at which point the lymph node came back.  Physical exam remarkable for one 1x1cm left sided supraclavicular lymph node tender to palpation.  Likely reactive lymphadenopathy.  I will treat with watchful waiting given reactive lymphadenopathy to include supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is a known side effect of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and that patient&#39;s young age and lack of risk factors.  If persistent over several months I will re-evaluate the lymph node with imaging.

                                                Patient received her 1st Moderna COVID vaccine on 6/17/2021.   Upon returning home the patient noted a rash on her left upper arm where she had recieved her Moderna Covid vaccine, as well as on her chest and her right arm. The patient returned to clinic and was seen by provider, MD. He documented the following:  She denies any itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing. only allergy she has had in the past is guaifenesin. The rash is petechial in scattered on both shoulders and chest. She denies taking any over-the-counter or prescription medications.  She has not had any bleeding difficulties. Recommend observation of the rash.  It may spread intake 3-4 weeks to completely resolve.  See again in clinic if she has worsening rash or any bleeding issues occur.  Later on the evening of 6/17/21 this patient reported the patechial rash had spread to her other arm and she felt a pressure in her nose. Our medical team strongly encouraged the patient to go to the Emergency Department for evaluation. Patient agreed. When our team follow up with her the AM of 6/18/21, the patient stated she chose not to go to the hospital. She stated she would go today, because she noticed excessive clotting with her menses. Again, our medical team strongly encouraged her to go to the ED. This is all the information we have up to this point.

                                                I was pregnant at the time of my first and second dose of the vaccine. My estimated due date was February 15th 2022. A half hour after my second dose I had a little bit of spotting and moderate to severe cramping. This was dismissed as gas pains. Later that night I went to the bathroom to find a substantial amount of blood in my underwear at which point I called a nurse line and was directed to go to the ER. They gave an ultrasound and ran blood work. Miscarriage was strongly suspected but not totally confirmed. I was also running a low fever and experiencing severe chills, muscle and joint pain and a severe headache. I was sent home and told to follow up with my doctor for more blood work to confirm the miscarriage. I continued to get severe cramping, bleeding and loss of uterine tissue vaginally. On Monday I saw my doctor had blood work and confirmed the miscarriage. I am still bleeding today.

                                                I experienced a missed miscarriage. I was pregnant during both doses of the vaccine (1st dose 1/15/21), but 2/12/21 (the day of the 2nd dose) was the day the gestational sac stopped growing. I was 8 weeks pregnant at this point. The ultrasound was on 2/17/21 and it was reported that I was supposed to be 8wk 6days, but gestational sac was only 8wk 1day. I was due on 9/23/21.   My PCP encouraged me to get the vaccine, knowing that I was pregnant. So I did.   Upon receiving my 2nd dose of the vaccine, I did not experience any symptoms and believe that my body was focused more on the vaccine than the development of the baby. Obviously I&#39;m not positive that this was the cause, but I wanted to make it known, so I can hopefully prevent this from happening again, if the vaccine was indeed a contributor.

                                                I got my period out of the blue the following morning. It was the worst period / PMS of my life. I was having full blown contractions, waves of pain and heat so much that I was throwing up. I also had diarrhea and very heavy bleeding. Once I was able to keep ibuprofen down I was absolutely fine and the symptoms dissipated. In total this pain, vomiting and diarrhea, unable to think or drink water or communicate lasted about 2 hours.

                                                I got vaccinated on 3/11. About a week and a half ago from today&#39;s date (4/3/2021), I began experiencing spotting of blood. I am currently in the middle of my last 3rd month of 3 month birth control pills, and was not late enough on a pill to trigger spotting. I have had intermittent low and heavy spotting, with some clotting. It fluctuates, sometimes red, sometime brown. It is ongoing, I have just today reported it to my primary care doctor via email but have not heard back from her yet.

My menstrual cycle was supposed to begin this week around 4/4/2021 and I am feeling symptoms of it such as bloating however I&#39;m nearly half a week late despite having a very regular cycle before the vaccine.

On 12-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on an unknown date and the estimated date of delivery was 15-Nov-2021. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant). 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache). On 22-Mar-2021, the patient experienced VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown). On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) and HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue). On 12-Mar-2021, EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant) had resolved. On 09-Apr-2021, ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried), FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown) and FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) had resolved. At the time of the report, VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding), MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, Ultrasound foetal abnormal: abnormal (abnormal) Had some bleeding and found out it was subchorionic hemorrhage. Bleeding is in another part of the uterus where is baby is not. On 01-Apr-2021, Ultrasound scan: abnormal (abnormal) Saw baby heartbeat but was informed baby had not grown.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information provided mentioned ultrasound and cytotec.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable as patient took both doses of the vaccine. Patient reported that she does not blame Moderna, as her OB feels the miscarriage was related to a &#34;genetic issue.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-060699 (Patient Link).   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 13-Apr-2021: Patient updated AE and mentions fetal complications resulting in miscarriage. Events and outcome of case thus updated with new information.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Although I would not characterize it as adverse, I wanted to report irregularities in my period since data about how the COVID-19 virus affects menstruation has been, in my understanding, especially desired.  I had a period last 3 days with a day each of spotting before and after the main period. It was exceptionally light in blood volume for me, and I had a throbbing headache on April 5th.

When I begin my cycle, it was out of the ordinary heavy and it lasted for approximately two weeks. This is out of the ordinary and typically my periods are not heavy and are not long. I no longer get periods as I take birth control continuously every month and so it is odd for me to get my period For a long amount of time and heavy at that.

                                                Patient Miscarried; vaccine exposure during pregnancy; This spontaneous case was reported by a health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Patient Miscarried) and EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (vaccine exposure during pregnancy) in a 25-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 023M20A and 030m20a) for COVID-19 vaccination.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma. Concomitant products included ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE (LEXAPRO) for an unknown indication.   On 22-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 22-Mar-2021, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (vaccine exposure during pregnancy) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 30-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Patient Miscarried) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Patient Miscarried) and EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (vaccine exposure during pregnancy) outcome was unknown.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No treatment information was reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was Not Applicable   Company Comment:  This case concerns a 25-year-old who experienced vaccine exposure during pregnancy and abortion. Abortion occurred 1 month 8 days post mRNA-1273 use. Although a temporal association exist, there is still not enough information to assess the causal association with the product use.  Critical details such as the obstetric history including the duration of pregnancy, antenatal history and condition at the time of abortion is lacking.  Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 25-year-old who experienced vaccine exposure during pregnancy and abortion.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, increased amounts of heart palpitations were experienced for at least 3 weeks before noticing a little respite in their frequency.  Irregular periods and heavy menstruation have also been experienced. Period following vaccine was heavy and came at a much earlier date than usual for the cycle. The 2nd period after that one started at the end of April and is still going on (as of May 18th). I do not have any history of irregular periods or menorrhagia of this extent.

After 2 months of bleeding, I have seen a primary physician and a gynecologist. I was told to take birth control, i took it for a month  but the bleeding didn&#39;t stop. The bleeding would occasionally stop only if I take 3 birth control pills. On top of that, I would randomly get a excruciating sharp pain in the lower abdomen area.

After both my first and second dose, I started my period on the same day that I received the vaccine. My period was on time but, different. The colour of blood seemed off, looked diluted in a way, and I had EXTREME cramping which is abnormal for me. At one point I felt as if I was having contractions. The extreme cramping occured the following day after receiving my vaccines. It has been 36 hours since my second dose and the symptoms are subsiding.
