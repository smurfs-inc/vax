She ended up going to the local ED - since she was still very fatigued and was feeling like she was going to pass out - blood work and U/S done - this is where she found out she had been pregnant but had lost the pregnancy (no heart beat).  Per her report - all other blood work was unremarkable.  No other medications given to her during this visit and was just told that she would be &#39;passing the products of conception within this next week&#39;.

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had a really awful headache and swollen arm, that was incredibly touch-sensitive. Around 3 pm that day, 25 hours after the injection I was hit with severe nausea. About an hour later, I began vomiting and had diarrhea. For some time, I was unable to keep water down. I called a 24-hour nurse line, and they advised contacting my doctor&#39;s emergency line. I did, they said if I couldn&#39;t make it through the night without keeping water down I needed to go to the hospital. Luckily, right before bed I drank some water and was able to make it through the night. The next morning, I had a telehealth visit with someone from my doctors office to review symptoms. Today I have had waves of nausea, but no vomiting. I have had diarrhea, and I had a spontaneous period that was very heavy and two weeks early today (2 days post vaccine).

                                                I developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of platelets) and menorrhagia due to the vaccine according to my doctor. I believe there have been about 30 cases of this occurring so far.   In my case, I took the vaccine and felt relatively tired for two days. There were no other symptoms. About a week later, I got my period after not having it for a couple months. The blooding was light for a few days, but then got extremely heavy. After about a week of very heavy bleeding, I went to urgent care. They took blood tests, and found that I had a critically low level of platelets (6 platelets when the normal range is 150-400). I was admitted to the ER for multiple days, and they gave a platelet transfusion and IVIG  fluids, which has helped considerably. I also had to take steroids to suppress my immune system so that my platelets could increase.

She reported the itching resolved after the medications and then she is still complaining of breast pain.  She noticed 2 drops of fluid out of her right nipple.  I do not necessarily know that this is an allergic reaction I am just not sure what to make of the coincidence with the Covid immunization it could be entirely unrelated.  Advised follow-up with her PCP regarding these issues.  Return precautions discussed.  She verbalized agreement and understanding with plan of care.  Sent home from ED.

                                                I began menstruating in the evening of Tuesday January 5th, 2021 (on schedule). However by the morning of January 6th, my flow had increased in a way I had never experienced before.  And until midday on January 9th, I was going through 1 ?super? tampon every 2-3 hours. My menstruation flow resembled blood, and was not as clotted as my regular flow. On January 9th, the bleeding slowed and normalized.  I contacted my doctor?s office and was directed to take 1000mg of acetaminophen twice daily, and call back if my flow had not slowed down by Monday because I would have to come in.   I followed the recommendations for one day (on January 8th)  and took a total of 2000mg of acetaminophen.

It?s not a lot that I need a pad. It?s enough whenever I wipe after peeing, I see a little spot of blood. After the second dose, the spotting continues but start to become heavier. A week later after second dose, the spotting is a bit heavier that I need to wear a panty liner.  This spotting been going for a month now since my first dose.

On 18-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol). On 19-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) and FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug). On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period) and PALLOR (Pale as a ghost). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainted) had resolved, SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work), SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol), FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period), PALLOR (Pale as a ghost), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)) outcome was unknown and DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) had not resolved. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported. Treatment medications include Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) for diarrhea for 1.5 days (unknown dose/frequency).  Patient waited out 20 minutes post-vaccination and then went to the bathroom. When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

                                                I experienced a missed miscarriage. I was pregnant during both doses of the vaccine (1st dose 1/15/21), but 2/12/21 (the day of the 2nd dose) was the day the gestational sac stopped growing. I was 8 weeks pregnant at this point. The ultrasound was on 2/17/21 and it was reported that I was supposed to be 8wk 6days, but gestational sac was only 8wk 1day. I was due on 9/23/21.   My PCP encouraged me to get the vaccine, knowing that I was pregnant. So I did.   Upon receiving my 2nd dose of the vaccine, I did not experience any symptoms and believe that my body was focused more on the vaccine than the development of the baby. Obviously I&#39;m not positive that this was the cause, but I wanted to make it known, so I can hopefully prevent this from happening again, if the vaccine was indeed a contributor.

For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information provided mentioned ultrasound and cytotec.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable as patient took both doses of the vaccine. Patient reported that she does not blame Moderna, as her OB feels the miscarriage was related to a &#34;genetic issue.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-060699 (Patient Link).   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 13-Apr-2021: Patient updated AE and mentions fetal complications resulting in miscarriage. Events and outcome of case thus updated with new information.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.
