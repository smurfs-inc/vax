Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

                                                I received the vaccination on Friday and on Sunday my bleeding increased. I already had some mild bleeding that had been constant since Feb 23rd or 24th. But I had an appointment on Feb 26th that confirmed I had a baby with a healthy heartbeat. I was also diagnosed with a very small uterine cyst. They told me the cause of the bleeding was pro ant implantation bleeding.  I had light bleeding (bleeding just needing one or two pant liners each day) until Sunday the  7 when I saw an increase in bleeding. I called my doctor on Tuesday (I decided not to call Monday because I felt I would get the same answer I had already gotten, which was that everything was fine) and they had me come in die an urgent same day appointment. At that appointment I learned my baby did not have a heartbeat. The baby was measuring at just over 8 weeks.  The due date given to me based on my last period was October 12th. So I was exactly 9 weeks when I went into the appointment Tuesday to find out the baby didn?t have a heartbeat.  I officially miscarried the embryo and the placenta on Friday March 12th.  This would have been my second baby. My first is a male and he is 18 months old. My first pregnancy didn?t have any complications. I do not have a history of miscarriage in my family, and this was the first one I have had.  I did have to take 150mg of Clomid to get pregnant with this baby.

They were just a bunch of red spots with white circles around them.  I took benadryl and it was resolved in a few hours.

The morning after getting the shot I began to have vaginal bleeding. I went to my OBGYN to have the baby checked. I was referred to a specialist for a level 2 ultrasound. Everything was found to be normal with the baby. The cause of the bleeding is still unknown by the timing aligns perfectly with my vaccine. The bleeding increased and has now began to slow.

But I am worried that the Moderna vaccine may have impacted the efficacy of my birth control since I do not get my period on the IUD. Will take a pregnancy test at appropriate time to determine fully.  This must be researched as it has very frightening implications for unexpected pregnancy if it is impacting the IUD. Otherwise, my body was simply stressed enough by the vaccine that I have my period. It is odd either way.

I contacted my provider and I was instructed to take a pregnancy test, which was positive. I went in for an exam on the 12th and they confirmed that I was indeed pregnant. They tested my Beta Hcg twice. I didn&#39;t get my results immediately due to one site being closed due to COVID. I could&#39;ve gone to the hospital and received the results immediately, but my doctor didn&#39;t want to take the chance due to the hospital having a lot of COVID. They confirmed that I was pregnant on the 19th or 20th. I bled for a few days after that. The final Beta Hcg was done and my level was 0.

                                                3 days after the shot, I experienced menstrual cramping and bleeding two weeks before normal period start date. Four days of unusual spotting, discharge, and cramps have followed. Black discharge with a foul smell. I know this is highly unusual for my body. No other stressors and no history of irregular period. I will see my doctor soon, but my bloodwork from a few months ago was normal. I&#39;ll continue to monitor, but this is a concerning side effect and I hope it is temporary. I wish I&#39;d known this was a possibility.

Two days after first dose: I started mensturating heavily and suddenly with severe menstral symptoms.  I continued to sporadically have light bleeding for 3 weeks. Prior to this event, I had not had a period in almost a year due to my birth control method. I have cramps, bloating, breast pain, irregular bleeding and weight gain. I received the second dose on 03/25/21 and by 03/30/21 I was experiencing yet another round of extreme PMS symptoms like severe breast pain, severe cramps that leave me bedridden, and intense food cravings. I have not had cyclic periods for several months prior to either of these events. It was jarring enough for me to start tracking my period symptoms because it was so out of the normal. I have been filtered into thinking any issues with my period are just something to deal with and to not seek medical attention, but I have missed approximately 6 days of work due to various symptoms after both of my doses.

Acute pain and numbness has worn off, but there is still moderate pain when using the arm. About a week post-dose, began spotting. Was not due to have menstrual period for 2-3 weeks according to birth control pill pack, and normally does not have any menstrual symptoms (no period) at all. Bleeding has increased daily, and is now fairly heavy. Accompanied by cramps.

                                                I believe that the vaccine could have affected my monthly menstrual cycle (particularly ovulation), which (if it is documented by enough women) I feel should be looked into more so more women are aware. I&#39;ve been tracking my period/ovulation for months for family planning purposes. I had 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/20/21 and my next period on 1/28/21. I&#39;ve been using OPK tests to track ovulation over the past few months, which have been positive on cycle day 18 or cycle day 19 (it&#39;s never been outside of those days before). When  I tested using the OPK twice per day on 2/10/21 (Cycle day 14) through 2/17/21 (cycle day 21), I got all negatives. I have no idea when I actually ovulated in February and think that the vaccine may have moved the date up earlier (which never happened). I know that I ovulated sometime, since I got a very happy surprise positive pregnancy test on 2/25/21 (which conflicts with the infertility myths!). While our family is thrilled with the news, I wanted to report it to VAERS in case there could be a possibility that the covid vaccine could throw off somebody&#39;s menstrual cycles/ovulation. If there is a link between those two, I feel like women of childbearing age would want to be informed of that possibility!

Pain at injection site for 3 days (red and swollen lump)- This has subsided 3. Tightness and pain in left neck (same side as injection)- This has subsided 4. My period was supposed to end on Saturday 3/20/22, but I am bleeding more heavily and this is unusual for me so I wonder if it is related to the vaccine somehow. Still bleeding as of today 3/22 Note: I treated the symptoms with ibuprophen and tylenol.

Pregnancy tests were negative prior to receiving the first vaccine and then turned positive on 12-29-2020 (5 days after getting first vaccine.)

Also some very light clotting, which rarely happens for me. I was not due for my period for 2.5 weeks. My cycle is extremely regular and has never deviated from 28-31 days in the last 6&#43; years. I have a copper IUD (for 6 years), and have never been pregnant.

No history of drug or alcohol abuse. No s/sx of other causes of a early 2nd trimester miscarriage. Of note the 1st trimester genetic testing was unable to be performed due to low fetal free cell DNA when she was at 10w. We were in the process of repeating the labs when the miscarriage happened.  No history of COVID infection, no s/sx of COVID infection at the time of the miscarriage or subsequently. She was not tested.

I received my first vaccine  at 4 weeks 4 days.  I then went in for my first ultrasound at 6 weeks 5 days.  The doctor told me the baby wasn?t developed normally and a miscarriage had already started.  I believe the gestational sac measured about 5 weeks 3 days.

                                                This is my first pregnancy. I had a normal ultrasound at my 8-week appointment, showing heartbeat and movement. My estimated delivery date was October 12, 2021. Four days after my second COVID shot, I had my 12-week checkup. They ran a urine test and asked me questions about my progress, all seemed normal. I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any side effects that would lead me to believe that I had miscarried. The OBGYN attempted to listen to the heartbeat but couldn&#39;t hear anything, so she wrote me a prescription to head over to the imaging site to get an ultrasound just in case. I drove there immediately and was given an ultrasound. They couldn&#39;t hear anything so we went ahead with a TVA. After approximately 45 minutes and no updates, the technician said that the results would be forwarded to my doctor and that they would reach out to me about the results. My doctor informed me that they could not hear a heartbeat and that I must have miscarried within the past couple days because the fetus length was as expected for 12-weeks of gestation. I am now scheduled for D&amp;C on 4/5/21.

I started experiencing mild swelling and tenderness in my L armpit/breast, with mild pain during movement and compression. Yesterday (1/18), the injection site became slightly raised, blotchy, and very itchy. I woke up this morning feeling like I had a cold, with joint soreness and a mild itchy rash around my ankles, in addition to fatigue and warmth/itchiness around the injection site

                                                There was very little pain until before bed the day I received the vaccine. At that time, I started feeling tenderness in the shoulder where I received the shot. The next day (today) the pain, inflammation, and swelling started moving down from my shoulder through to my fingers. I was barely able to get my wedding ring off because of the swelling. The tenderness now goes note my whole arm, under my arm pit, down my shoulder blade, and even my left breast. I have taken Benadryl for the swelling and tried to get it elevated, and I have taken ibuprofen for the body aches that I?ve had today as well.

I had confirmed pregnancy with home positive test and missed period. I had an estimated due date of 9/24/2021.  This was my 4th pregnancy. I have had two uncomplicated pregnancies to term. In September 2020 experienced a chemical pregnancy with early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks.  The first 24 hours after 1st dose of vaccine I experienced extreme arm soreness in the arm that was vaccinated,  causing  headache and unable to sleep. After 24 hours I felt &#34;normal&#34;. 2 weeks and 3 days following the first dose of Moderna, I  had a miscarriage. On the night of 2/15/21 I lost the pregnancy with vaginal bleeding, bright red  blood, passing tissue, clots/ sac. I had an uneventful pregnancy up to that point, feeling well as I had with prior pregnancies.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna COVIDI19 vaccine on 12/29/2020 not knowing I was pregnant.  I took a home pregnancy test the week of 1/3/2021, which came back positive.  On 1/17/2021, I started having some spotting and saw my OBGYN on 1/18/2021.  My OBGYN did a transvaginal ultrasound and estimated I was about 5 weeks pregnant.  I went for bloodwork prescribed by my OBGYN on 1/18 and 1/20 to measure my HcG levels.  By 1/20-1/21 the bleeding became heavy and my HcG levels dropped.  I had a follow up appointment with my OBGYN on 2/3/2021 where they performed another transvaginal ultrasound and more bloodwork to confirm that I had miscarried.

As of 3/30/21 I have yet to start my period. Experiencing bloating, swollen breast, fatigue. Pregnancy test taken today was negative.  2) Suffered a fracture of upper left humerus, neat vaccine site. Injury was sustained during a fall while downhill skiing and may be unrelated to the vaccine, but the fracture was at the same spot as my vaccination.

I have had to wear a pad ever since this dose although my period was not scheduled to return for a few weeks following the dose. The blood is dark brown suggesting that it is old. It has continued, and I am now going on 10 days of symptoms.

The patient&#39;s medical history included eczema.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included pre-natal vitamins.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) on 31 Dec 2020. On 28 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received the vaccine while breastfeeding and reported having a clogged duct and possible mastitis.  She began to experience flu like symptoms on 29 Jan 2021.  She had a fever and missed pumping breast milk.  On 30 Jan 2021 her milk production was about half of the typical amount.  The flu like symptoms resolved on 31 Jan 2021.  On 01 Feb 2021 her breast became hard, red, and sore.  On 02 Feb 2021 her breast symptoms resolved; however, her milk production was 65-70% of normal. She treated the events with acetaminophen and magnesium sulfate dissolved in water.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events clogged duct, possible mastitis, milk production dropped, and were not reported.  The outcome of the event, received vaccine while breastfeeding, was considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, flu like symptoms, was considered resolved on 31 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, breast was hard, red, and sore, was considered resolved on 02 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I had no other issues or complications that would have contributed to my miscarriage.

The heavy bleeding lasted full 2 days, that day within 5hrs I had body aching and later had a fever. I had the fever and body aching for about 24hrs and my period for 2days. Since then I have been having random spotting of light or heavy bleeding. I had my period on 3-6-21 to 3-16-21 full days bleeding. Now I still have random spotting of blood cloth and heavy bleeding for few hours and it stops.

I have been trying to conceive, and I am wondering if the vaccine has had an impact on my fertility.  My menstrual cycle had always been regular prior to the second dose.

Later around 5pm I started to experience full body aches akin to the flu. Then I had chills and a mild fever of 100 and a headache. This lasted through the night. I slept until 11am today the 11th and awoke with only a headache. Then around 8pm I began experiencing menstrual cramps and breast tenderness despite my cycle (bleeding) ending 5 days ago. I usually do not experience menstrual cramps. This has been happening for the last 2 hours. It?s now 10pm

                                                Miscarriage; Received vaccine when pregnant; A spontaneous report was received from a 34-year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) when pregnant and experienced a miscarriage.  The patient&#39;s medical history included three prior pregnancies, with two live births and one miscarriage. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included prenatal vitamins and doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 011J20A) on 30 Dec 2020. On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 028L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  At 7 weeks gestation, the fetus had a normal heart beat. She reported that she had no complications with the pregnancy.  On 08 Feb 2021, the patient had a miscarriage. Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The events received vaccine when pregnant and miscarriage were considered recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report concerns a 34-year-old, P2G4 who experienced miscarriage 1 month 9 days post administration of first dose and 12 days after the last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine. There is not enough information such as the last menstrual period, estimated date of conception and delivery and gestational age at the time of miscarriage. In addition, the patient&#39;s detailed medical history including any trauma  and reason for previous miscarriage is lacking. Vaccine exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not applicable.

This was my first pregnancy and I had no complications up to that point. On 2/2/21 I began experiencing menstrual type cramps, which continued for a few days. On 2/5/21, my OBGYN suggested I be examined in Labor and Delivery, where it was determined I was in pre-term labor. Contractions were temporarily stopped, however my water broke on 2/7/21 and it was suggested that I be induced. I was induced on a later date at 34w1d pregnant and delivered my son, who weighed in at 4lbs. 15oz.

This happened twice that evening and has never happened before. My pulse was pounding in my head and it took about 1-2 minutes of slow breathing to calm my heart rate again. I wore my heart rate monitor the rest of the evening and overnight, with no other adverse effects. Stairs had no impact on me the next day. I had also exercised that morning, and while my heart rate was higher than normal with that type of workout, I didn?t think anything of it at the time and didn?t have the pounding head issue.  Due to this issue, I?m a bit nervous about the second shot in the series.   2: I started my period the morning I got the shot; day 4 and 5 of my period were significantly heavier flow than normal. Day 4 also included cramps and nausea throughout the entire day, which is not normal for me.

                                                In the early afternoon of 3/25 I noticed pain in my breast while nursing my baby. After the feeding I could feel a hard lump on the underside of my breast that was tender to the touch and warm. I used an ice pack on the area, took curcumin and grapefruit seed extract, and nursed again on our regular schedule. The clog was resolved after the next feeding and after taking the supplements and using ice. Clogged ducts have happened to me frequently in the last ten months of nursing. I don?t know if this was related to the vaccine, but I figured I would report it in case it became a pattern in nursing mothers.

                                                One week after the first dose of the vaccine I had breakthrough bleeding. It was enough to soak a sanitary pad. I went to the ER and they could not identify the reason for the vaginal bleeding. I was discharged the same night. It reoccurred three days after when I had been on a walk. It did not happen again and I did not have any problems after the second shot. The baby seems to be fine. Due Date -09/17/2021 Pregnancy-First

I did not have a visible rash, but my dermatologist said it was a histamine reaction. I was intensely itchy for three days and then it went away  after five days. I had a miscarriage five weeks after the second dose which was a week after the itch started. I saw my OBGYN, PCP ER , Gastroenterologist and Dermatologist.

Pain in my arm. Nausea and major, major, major migraines. I had migraines consistently - couldn&#39;t move off my couch. Those symptoms mostly went away after the third day.  I saw my OB/GYN this week and they said that my fetus stopped growing about three weeks ago.  Pregnancy history - my third pregnancy; none have gone to full-term. I have had a miscarriage before that was very similar to this one.  Estimated date of delivery - December 2, 2021. I have recovered from the immediate side effects. I get the fetus removed next week.

GI issues persisted for the next 3 weeks and on Thursday evening, 2/25/2021 at about 6:30 pm. I was sitting on floor with children and almost passed out. I felt very faint, dizzy, and instantly started chilling. I had a fever of 102.8 and could not get warm. My husband was going to call paramedics, but I encouraged him not to. Discovered my right breast was red and inflamed/ swollen as well as all of my lymph nodes in my right arm pit. I could not reach my right arm forward. I noticed around 12:06 AM after not being able to get warm or break fever. I messaged my primary care clinic when I noticed the breast swelling, redness, pain, and lymph node swelling. I continually felt like I was going to faint/pass out and was very dizzy all night long. I was also extremely fatigued. The did a telemedicine appointment the next morning and diagnosed me with mastitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I am a breastfeeding mother and all of these symptoms came on suddenly and severely on the same side that I got the vaccine shot. I have been breastfeeding for over 7 months and my supply has been dwindling to nothing so I have no problems with engorgement or blocked milk ducts. Before this baby I had just got done breastfeeding a baby for 11 months with no issues of the like.

                                                Sweating, low-grade fever, chills, body aches, exhaustion, headache. I took Tylenol for 24 hours starting when I woke up at  6am to help with symptoms. It took about 36 hours for my symptoms to be gone after they started. I was also on my period when I received the vaccine. My period seemed to slow down almost completely while my symptoms were happening, and then my period resumed with abnormal cramping and clotting after my symptoms were gone.

                                                Severe period cramps which I haven&#39;t had in months since I&#39;ve gotten COVID-19 back on Jan 29th. I believe I got it then bc I wrote on Feb 14 exactly 2 weeks after seeing our factory partners. My head felt shaken like astigmatism in my brain. So haven&#39;t had a real period for a year and then after the vaccine worst cramps in my life. Then I have stomach hurting and GI issues every hour or so. Lastly my eyes have been red at night a lot and I would keep getting headaches from time to time for no reason and I&#39;m not a headache person.

Hospital testing confirmed 100% break of amniotic fluid with nothing left to sustain baby who had normal heartbeat and was still alive - measuring on target. Induced at 11:20pm on the 27th and delivered at 5:30am on 4/28/21 at 17 weeks and 3 days a baby boy measuring 8.25 inches and 5.6 ounces.   No placental infection or abnormalities. Pathology noted an abruption hematoma that could have resulted from induced labor. No trauma, blood work, or other explanations for early rupture of what was a perfectly healthy and growing baby.

                                                On 3/4/21, I was informed that I was pregnant with my 4th child. On 4/12/21, I was scheduled for my 1st dose of the Moderna as well as having a first trimester NCIT testing being done. At that exam, my provider was able to find a fetal heart rate (177), he was dated to be approximately 12 weeks and 6 days, and there were no concerns at that time regarding physical abnormalities or brain deformities. Additionally, I was sent out for bloodwork to rule out Trisomies and determined gender of the baby. The results of that lab work came back as negative and we were expecting our first son October 19, 2021. However, yesterday, 5/4/21, I attended my monthly prenatal appointment and the provider informed me that she could not find a heartbeat. She used a doppler scanner and then the in office ultrasound machine; neither of which detected a heartbeat. I was sent out to Radiology for a formal scan to refute or affirm the findings. Sadly, the results came back that I had lost my child. There was no heartbeat found and the results showed that my child stopped growing and remained 12 weeks in size. I am scheduled to have my pregnancy evacuated Friday, 5/7/21 at 1040a. While I am aware that miscarriage in 1 in 4 women, I cannot in good faith say that the vaccine may have contributed to my pregnancy loss. The only change in my routine was the addition of the vaccine. I am hopeful that this pain will not be felt by others and can be researched further to ensure fertility loss or future pregnancy loss isnt a norm following this vaccine.   Additionally, I have had 3 full term, healthy pregnancies prior to this miscarriage. None of these pregnancies had complications and the children were birthed without issue.

This progressed to two open wounds where sutures began to surface and had to be removed. After my second dose of the Moderna vaccine I developed another area on my right areola scar line that opened up to reveal another suture that required removal.

I also started to have vaginal bleeding when I wasn?t due to have a period. The rash got progressively worse, to spread all over torso back and front.  Vaginal bleeding also continued to worsen. Went to ER to have labs checked, was told it looked like Pityriasis rosea- and that all lab values and clotting factors were normal. Sent home with prescription for Atarax if needed. Was told it would be self limiting but if worsened to come back.

I have had one pregnancy before, six years ago, that ended in a healthy, full-term child with no complications.   I received the vaccine on Thursday morning. Thursday evening - Saturday morning I had extreme body aches, fever and night sweats, headache and grogginess. On Saturday evening, my miscarriage began. The estimated date of delivery would have been November 20, 2021.

No swollen or tender lymph nodes.  The L outer area of my L breast has also been tender.  I was 18 weeks on the day of vaccine #2 with minimal to no breast pain at that point.  No treatment has been needed.  My OB will be sending me for an ultrasounds if it has not dissipated at my 28 week visit (I?m currently 25 weeks).

                                                I had never been pregnant before and have been undergoing fertility treatments for about two and a half years (6 failed IUIs followed by 2 failed frozen embryo transfers via IVF).  I had my third frozen embryo transfer on 3/12, almost exactly the same time Alaska opened vaccine availability to anyone over the age of 16.  Our doctor?s advice along with everything we found online showed not much was known about the vaccine, but there was no firm reason to think there would be a problem with getting it in early pregnancy.  We also knew that being pregnant would mean higher likelihood of having severe symptoms if I got Covid-19, so I signed up for and was administered the first Moderna vaccine on the day of my first pregnancy test. 3/22 my beta HcG level came back at 72, confirming pregnancy.  As is standard, I was asked to come back three days later to confirm appropriate growth in those numbers.  By Thursday, March 25th my HcG level had fallen to 17, and by Monday, March 29th that level was less than 3. It?s impossible to know if the vaccine played a role in the early miscarriage, but I wanted to provide the data in case there are any trends or information can be learned from my experience.

On 2/5/21 I miscarried the baby and ended up hemmoraging thus requiring a blood transfusion. The fetus was sent to pathology and I was informed that at 12 weeks when I miscarried that the baby had termed at 9 weeks which was the time of my first vaccine injection.

I got the injection of the second dose on 4/15/21 around 11 am and began bleeding and cramping due to miscarriage about 27 hours later. Miscarriage confirmed by OBGYN on monday 4/19/21.  I am blood type o-negative.  Will be tested for blood clotting disorder as possible cause of early pregnancy loss.  I should also state that I had a pretty severe case of &#34;moderna arm&#34; within just a few hours of the vaccination, maybe 4 hours, with approx 70% of my upper arm covered in deep red, hot, raised, swollen, and itchy skin that lasted several days.  I also got a fever of approx 101 degrees F about 20 hours after the vaccination.

                                                Estimated due date of pregnancy was november 2021. We experienced a miscarriage during the vaccine symptoms of the first shot. The second dose of vaccine was way worse than the first. I got a sore arm, aches, a headache, nausea, a fever, chills, pins and needles feelings in my hands and feet, heartburn, and dizziness. I kept feeling like I might throw up and I developed a great big rash on my arm again, called covid arm. I spent the entire day on the couch next to a bucket because if I got up, I was too light headed and nauseated to do anything. It lasted 24 hours or so. By day 3 after the shot, I felt okay other than soreness, a headache, and a big itchy rash at the injection site. We are concerned about the miscarriage but don&#39;t know if it was or wasn&#39;t related to the vaccine. I did have a big reaction and we wonder if my immune system gearing up targeted the very early fetus as an intruder. We are deeply saddened by our loss.

                                                I am a nursing mother and ended up with an inflamed, painful red breast on the side I received the shot several hours later. Knowing that covid-19 vaccine has not been tested on nursing mothers, I wanted to report side effects as I have noticed nursing peers also stating similar things. I believe this should warrant further data collection so nursing mothers can adequately prepare for this side effect. I had two nights of chills and fever and swollen breast with bruising. Took ibuprofen as well as natural mastitis remedy: sunflower lethicin.  Pain has subsided and swelling has reduced.

On Saturday 1-9-2021 she woke up with significant vaginal bleeding. On Monday 1-11-2021 she went to the OB/GYN and there she had a positive pregnancy test. The diagnosis of miscarriage was made at that time. A couple of days later, a repeat pregnancy test resulted in a negative reading.

I was due for my menstruation cycle but when it came, I began to bleed heavily. This is not a norm for me - my periods are usually light with spotting at the beginning of my cycle. It was so heavy when it began on Friday that I bled through my pants. For the rest of the day, Saturday and the beginning of Sunday my blood flow was very heavy and I was constantly changing pads. I was going to contact my GYN doctor but then my flow slowed down later in the day Sunday thankfully. I just wanted to let your office know just in case other woman are reporting the same issue. Thank you.

                                                I was diagnosed with post-partum hypothyroidism 4/6/20 (labs below) and put on medication (levothyroxine).  Based on lab trends over the next 9 months, medication was weaned down and after labs on 12/28/20 (below), I was taken off medication as my physician felt that this condition was resolved .  I received my first COVID vaccination on 12/31/20.  Over the next month, I felt progressively more tired.  On 1/25/21 @noon I started having symptoms of hypotension unrelated to dehydration. These symptoms were intermittently persistent for the next  2 weeks.  On 1/27/21 @0400 I started having profuse uterine bleeding (menorrhagia) which resulted in a call to the MD later that day who recommended high dose ibuprofen and rest.  I omitted AM ibuprofen dose on 1/29/21 and received the second COVID vaccine on 1/29/21.  Repeat thyroid labs were drawn on 2/8/21 (below) and were  completely unexpected given previous lab trends.  My physician placed me back on medication and I will get my labs drawn again in a month.  Acknowledge that there isn&#39;t data with the COVID vaccine and autoimmune conditions; however, I am wondering if the vaccine induced the TPO antibodies  along with the COVID antibodies.  This may be something to look more into for other autoimmune disorders as well as more patients are vaccinated.

                                                I had some arm soreness that started the morning after (22nd) and that lasted until the 27th of January....it got better each day. I had fever to 102 that started on the 22nd. The fever ended on 23rd. I took Tylenol - it didn&#39;t help on the 22nd but by 23rd it did. I felt fatigue -22nd and went away on 24th.  I miscarried 27th-29th -30th- that timeframe. The miscarriage prompted care. I went to Medical Center. I was not pregnant at time first vaccination. Estimated date of delivery had been - September 22, 2021; I have no prior pregnancy history.

I also had nightly episodes of hot flashes that lasted 5 days 4 weeks after my 1st dose.  I have never experienced a hot flash before in my life.  After my second dose, I began my period 6 days later which was 10 days earlier than expected.  It has also been much heavier than normal with unusual cramping in both my lower abdomen and lower back, much like my contractions I had with my first child during childbirth.

This period began with spotting and progressed to a heavy, painful, period with heavy clotting. The clots were bigger than quarters, numerous,  and lasted a few days. This was unlike any period I have ever experienced. My periods do not give me any trouble and this one is as so bad. I almost called off work. I had to take a heating pad with me. It was not normal. My next period came early as well and now I?m over a week late. I took a pregnancy test and I?m not pregnant. To be concluded...  the conclusion of possible effects are yet to be determined

                                                The Moderna vaccine induced my menstruation. I am currently breastfeeding and had not been menstruating since becoming pregnant in January 2019. I had a baby since then and due to nursing on demand my period had not returned. Less than 24 hours after getting vaccinated I woke up to a moderate menstrual flow, bright red blood. I am still menstruating and experiencing mild cramping and bloatedness in my abdominal area. There was no prior indication this would happen before the vaccine. I had not even spotted before. My cycle has historically been very regular and I am certain the vaccine had something to do with stimulating my endocrine system and thus causing my menstruation.

Had to take 650 mg Tylenol every 4 hours to keep the fever a bit low (the fever would not go below 101.5). After 20 hours, could control the fever with every 6 hours of Tylenol (650 mg). Took medication for 40 hours. The fever went down but had chills for 3 days. less than 72 hours after the injection had a miscarriage. Was 5 weeks pregnant at the time of miscarriage.

Another day I woke up from sleeping on my side because my breast was sore.  I also had some menstrual cramps.

                                                On May 7, 2 Days after receiving the Moderna shot, I started to get breast tenderness, indicating an upcoming menstruel cycle, despite not being due until May 17. It is important for me to note here that my period is always on time (within a day or 2). On May 9, I began to have some cramping. When I got out of the shower on the morning of May 10, I had begun bleeding. At this point, the cramps began to worsen. Often leaving me doubled over in pain (while common for some women, this is completely abnormal for me. I normally don&#39;t have any cramping at all.) The bleeding itself is heavier than usual. I&#39;m also extremely exhausted compared to usual.

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced extreme breast tenderness in both breasts. They felt sore to the touch all over, had the sensation of being full and heavy, and had to be supported in a bra in order to be tolerable. I liken it to postpartum pain associated with breast feeding and milk engorgement. I would list the symptoms the first night as moderate to severe. It limited my ability to do certain tasks because of the pain and discomfort. The breast tenderness has decreased in severity since then but it is now 1/11/2021 and both breasts are still tender. The severity is now mild. It&#39;s uncomfortable but does not limit my daily activity. Of note, I have had a tubal ligation and ablation and am not pregnant but I cannot track the timing of my cycle to know if the vaccine affected my cycle or caused hormonal changes that could explain the breast sensitivity.   I had arm soreness at the injection site for the first 48 hours but that has gone away. No other symptoms to report.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

That day was my 5th day of my period and there were very few brown spot during the day time as normal.  After dinner, I started feel abdominal cramp and suddenly a lot of blood came out. The bleeding lasted about 1 hour and soaked 5-6 pads.  The next few days had small amount of blood. This situation never happened in my past 20 years period experience before. I had very normal period always lasted about 5-6 days.

                                                I was trying for a pregnancy and was likely pregnant but not detectable at vaccine number 1. Found out about pregnancy a week or so before vaccine 2.  (I was likely about 5 weeks pregnant then based on LMP of dec 22 with avg cycles of 35 days. Decided to get vaccine due to general advice that it is okay during pregnancy. (No known adverse effects). After dose 2, had about 10-12 hours of chills without fever and general fatigue. Shortly afterwards experienced mild cramps. This is my 5th pregnancy and I have no history of complications of any sort. Cramps are not usual for my pregnancies but I know it can be normal so I did not think anything of it. Mild spotting occurred but again did not think anything of it as I know it can be normal. I was scheduled for a first OB visit  Mar 3 where I should have been 10 weeks. (Initial positive pregnancy test was Jan 29). Ultrasound showed empty 5.6 week gestational sac with a yolk sac and subchorionic hemorrhage.   OB suspected pregnancy failure. We followed pregnancy with ultrasound of better quality 10 days later which showed a possible fetal pole and yolk sac but no heart beat and gestational sac measured at 6.0 weeks. Today March 18 awaiting repeat ultrasound tomorrow but started bleeding and cramping. Consistent with the start of the miscarriage. With no histories of abnormal pregnancies and with the gestational  sac consistently measure at 6 weeks (matching to about the time of shot#2), I am inclined to believe that the second covid shot stopped the progression of my pregnancy. I am a huge pro vaccine health care provider but would recommend now an investigation into first trimester covid vaccinations and possibly not recommend this during that time period.

                                                -About 3 minutes after receiving the shot mouth and throat felt itchy.  The itchiness lasted until the following day. -Later that day in the afternoon around 3pm I had heavy breakthrough bleeding like I got my period which lasted for several days.  I finished my birth control pill pack the following weekend and got my normal period.   - In the afternoon of the 7th day after the shot my mouth was itchy again.  Later that night my arm was sore, hot to the touch and had a rash.  The next day the rash had spread down my arm.  My throat, tongue and eyes were itchy.  I called my PCP and spoke to a friend is an a doctor.  I took Advil and Benadryl which helped.  The rash and itchiness persisted from Mon - Thurs.   - 15 days after the shot I got a bloody nose that lasted for about 45 minutes.  I have not had a bloody nose since I was a child so thought this was worth mentioning.   - Around the same time I had headaches in the back of my head that felt like burning.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

                                                Approximately five days after the injection, I had my first period since 2013.  Due to a combination of pregnancy (delivered 2/2014) and subsequently two Morena IUDs, I have not even had spotting since 2013.  For three days, I had period-like blood and cramping.  I reported this during my routine rheumatologist appointment who told me to report it here. Additionally, I had pain in the arm for three days as expected from the literature about side effects from the trials.  I am scheduled to have my second dose on 2/4/21 and will report any other side effects.

I had increased PMS symptoms, and the menstrual flow is very very heavy and bright red ? the heaviest flow I have experienced and the brightest red blood I have experienced. It shows no signs of diminishing, though in a normal cycle, I would be nearly done.

Breastfeeding may not be able to continue with the return of my period so this is a huge deal for me and likely other women.
