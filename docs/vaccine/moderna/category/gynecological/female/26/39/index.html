Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

                                                Woke up realizing that I had started my period and was experiencing horrible menstrual cramps (pain scale of 9 out of 10) and nausea. Took ibuprofen but vomited from pain. After applying a heated pad I managed to fall asleep. Continued to take ibuprofen regularly over the next 3 days as my cramps continued. Normally my cramps are between 4-6 on a pain scale out of 10 and only last the first day. I have never vomited from menstrual pain before, so this was very unusual.

Change tampons  after 2-3 hours of wearing them. Rest of cycle is light.  (After Vacation) Day:1-spotting , light cramping. Day:2- very heavy flow, needing multiple super tampons. Cramps are painful-needed a painkiller.   I had to leave work because of the bleeding and pain. Uncharacteristic of me. I haven?t had to ask to leave my job because of something like this before.  Last month was a little heavier than usual but I didn?t think much of it. This month is just really bad.

The manufacturer instructed us to reach out to the patient to let them know they have received a higher dose which may have the potential for increased local and or systemic side effects. Mariah reported that her period was 8 days late and she is normally very regular. No other side effects reported by Mariah.

                                                Received shot at 11:08 am Friday morning. Struggled to fall and stay asleep ~12-5:30 am Saturday morning. 4:10 am: messaged a friend saying the muscle spasms/cramping was similar to a full body mild period cramps and it was probably why women were getting their periods early. ~1:30 noticed I had gotten my period about 2 weeks early. Did not notice typical body signs that period was about to start.  My period has been inconsistent in the year of 2021. Some have been two weeks from each other, some have been 6 weeks. I typically notice  increased acne and breast firmness prior to start of period. It could be a coincidence.

                                                Since starting the vaccination series for covid, my menstrual period which is regulated by my medication Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo was irregular. It started a few days late after vaccination. I have not stopped bleeding since. It has been nearly 2 months of continuous bleeding resembling a menstrual period that just won&#39;t stop. Some days it is just spotting, others it is heavy. I have felt lethargic, low-energy, mentally foggy because of this. I have experienced menstrual cramps during this time as well.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history was provided by the reporter.  The patient&#39;s past medical history included Polycystic ovarian syndrome and Hypothyroidism. Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE and METFORMIN for an unknown indication.    On 08-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on 01-Jan-2021 and the estimated date of delivery was 08-Oct-2021. On 08-Jan-2021, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant when she received her first Moderna dose). On 05-Feb-2021, the patient experienced INTENTIONAL DOSE OMISSION (Electing not to receive second Moderna dose after learning she was pregnant). On 27-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarriage) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) beginning around the  first week of the pregnancy.  On 08-Jan-2021, EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant when she received her first Moderna dose) had resolved. On 05-Feb-2021, INTENTIONAL DOSE OMISSION (Electing not to receive second Moderna dose after learning she was pregnant) had resolved. On 27-Apr-2021, ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarriage) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No information regarding treatment was provided.  Nurse reported she was unaware she was pregnant when she received her first Moderna dose on 08-Jan-2021. Nurse reported that she discovered she was pregnant a week 29-Jan-2021 prior to her scheduled second Moderna dose on 05-Feb-2021. Testing was performed on the fetus and physicians determined the baby was a normal healthy girl with no genetic abnormalities or findings. Reportedly, she stopped metformin during her pregnancy so glucose testing could be performed.

                                                I was at the end of my menstruation cycle when I received my first dose. When I got a period again in April it was delayed, insanely heavy (I have an IUD mine are usually so light I don?t where tampons or pads and my main symptoms are emotion and appetite related) but I was bleeding through multiple things a day. I was also in the worst menstrual pain I?ve ever had and almost went to urgent care. The next period I had after the second dose followed the same way. So painful I was doubled over at my desk screaming. I?ve also had 24/7 vaginal discharge which is never something I had before. And it?s A LOT of discharge. More than a panty liner could handle and I have to visit the restroom 10x more a day just to get rid of the discharge. It?s incredibly thick, sticky, and almost clear. There is so much of it that when I sit to pee, sticky strings of it will fall from my body. It has relatively little to no smell, and the consistency is almost like tapioca. I don?t know what to do.

                                                Menstrual changes: menstruation started earlier than expected (3 days early) and menstrual side effects were more intense than usual (cramping, menstruation was much heavier than normal). The period also lasted 9 days, whereas 5 days is usual for me.   Additionally, I experienced persistent gum pain and sensitivity for a week and a half after my first vaccination. That also started on the same day as my early period.

The pharmacy called 911 ems came and checked out my vitals. They were normal by then.   Then when I got home I began to bleed vaginally. I was in the middle of ovulating. ( not normal for me to bleed then)  And now I am late for my normal period.

                                                IRREGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLE &amp; MORE SEVERE PMS:  My period came 1 week later than it should have and bleeding was inconsistent with previous cycles. It was spotty and very light over a much longer time frame. Usually, my regular cycle lasts 5 days, and this cycle began 5/27 and lasted for 8 days. My next period (June) came early starting 6/21 and has been much heavier than usual already. Pre-menstrual symptoms of heavy cramping, constipation, and fever started a week prior, reaching as high as 102.8F. and was on and off for two days. Nausea and cramping was severe for 2-3 days before 6/21 at the start of this June menstrual cycle. I have no been ill for any reason prior to receiving my second Moderna dose and when I met with the doctor on Monday 6/14 to discuss my symptoms, I was told to &#34;keep an eye on it&#34; with no specific diagnosis or recommendation.

                                                Approx 4AM 6/19/21 is when I noticed I was experiencing vaginal bleeding beyond what I had ever experienced before. I was not due for a menstrual cycle. Between 4AM and 10AM I went through 3 overnight sanitary pads. Over the course of the rest of the day I went through 8 regular pads, soaking them through with blood. I contemplated going to the ER. The blood was excessive and bright red, freely flowing and passing clots larger than a dollar coin. The bleeding finally slowed around 36hr after it began. I used ibuprofen beginning the evening of 6/19/21 to help stop the bleeding. The bleeding finally stopped entirely the evening of 6/21/21. The most unique part is that there was little to no pain, even before I began to take the ibuprofen.

                                                I received the vaccination on Friday and on Sunday my bleeding increased. I already had some mild bleeding that had been constant since Feb 23rd or 24th. But I had an appointment on Feb 26th that confirmed I had a baby with a healthy heartbeat. I was also diagnosed with a very small uterine cyst. They told me the cause of the bleeding was pro ant implantation bleeding.  I had light bleeding (bleeding just needing one or two pant liners each day) until Sunday the  7 when I saw an increase in bleeding. I called my doctor on Tuesday (I decided not to call Monday because I felt I would get the same answer I had already gotten, which was that everything was fine) and they had me come in die an urgent same day appointment. At that appointment I learned my baby did not have a heartbeat. The baby was measuring at just over 8 weeks.  The due date given to me based on my last period was October 12th. So I was exactly 9 weeks when I went into the appointment Tuesday to find out the baby didn?t have a heartbeat.  I officially miscarried the embryo and the placenta on Friday March 12th.  This would have been my second baby. My first is a male and he is 18 months old. My first pregnancy didn?t have any complications. I do not have a history of miscarriage in my family, and this was the first one I have had.  I did have to take 150mg of Clomid to get pregnant with this baby.

Started off irregular for a few days, stopped and came back with an exorbitant amount of blood - needed a super tampon and pad every hour. Lasted about 7.5 weeks in total by using progesterone to stop the bleeding. Also significant cramping and pain. Both the heavy bleeding and pain with cramps are out of the norm for me.

On 04/12/2021 I was confirmed I had a miscarriage. My doctor told me to go to the ER and that&#39;s where they confirmed it. I was 7 weeks pregnant my due date was 11/26/2021. They did said I was at high risk because I had a copper IUD that was removed.

                                                My menstrual cycle came on 5 days early but when it came on I had large blood clots. I?ve never had my cycle come on early. I take birth control tablets the correct way and the Saturday when I started bleed, I had taken my tablet at my regular time that day.  I also usually don?t have heavy periods at all so the amount of blood so early was unusual for me.

                                                Irregular menstrual bleeding starting in the middle of birth control pill cycle (spotting with increased flow for 14 days), headaches/migraine, fatigue, joint pain (left knee and right fingers), blotchy discoloration and veins can be seen in a &#34;lace-like&#34; pattern on the back of both legs, some sharp pains in lower leg especially at night, return of rash/inflammation on arms particularly on right arm.   Went to a clinic on 4/12/21 to ensure discoloration on legs was not a symptom of blood clots since my primary Dr. had to move my appointment out a week. Determined discoloration was not a concern and gave me a prescription for migraines. I have not taken the migraine medication as of 4/26/21.  Primary Dr. appointment on 4/19/21. Determined symptoms were not a side effect of the birth control, but possibly the COVID vaccine. Ordered blood work. As a result, a CT chest scan was ordered due to high D-Dimer test results which was completed on 4/20/21 at the Hospital to check for PEs. Was also instructed to stop taking the birth control (still currently not taking ad will not start taking again). Follow-up with Dr. on 4/23/21 CT scan came back normal, but following up with additional blood work and ultrasound of both legs (scheduled for 4/26/21) to determine what the issue could be. Follow-up to discuss results scheduled for 4/28/21. Instructed to postpone second dose of COVID vaccine and take one baby aspirin a day.

                                                My menstrual cycle has been consistent (occurring every month) and there have been no changes for the past 10 years. One week before the 1st Moderna COVID-19 vaccine date, my period arrived like normal. Exactly one week after taking the first dose, I received my period once again (twice in 1 month). This is very abnormal. There were no other factors affecting my lifestyle. I believe the vaccine has contributed to my abnormal period and this should be made aware to all volunteers prior to receiving their vaccine.

                                                My first menstrual cycle post 2nd vaccine was extremely abnormal. I had very painful cramping prior to my period and during the period. In addition, I had the heaviest period of my entire life. I was bleeding so much I had to use ultra sized tampons and change them ever 1-2 hours. This has never happened to me before and was very concerning. The heavy bleeding lasted 3-4 days.    My second period post 2nd vaccine has still been a little heavy but is mostly back to normal.

                                                Received the first Moderna vaccine on April 8th. I started my period as per expected on April 29th. My period lasted twice as long as my normal period. Typically my period lasted 3 days. My period then lasted 5 days and much heavier than usual.  I received the second vaccine May 7.  I started my period today and have debilitating cramps. Per usual I rarely have cramps and if so are mild enough to knock out with 1 ibuprofen. I have taken OTC and am still in a lot of pain. Unlike any period I?ve experienced. I also have menstrual cup, so I am able to see my flow is 2-3x heavier than usual.  There have been no other changes in my life other than the vaccine. My younger sister also experienced similar issues and we got the vaccine at the same time. I reported because I saw other women were experiencing this as well.

Also during this time I had experienced fever, chills and was very fatigue. I sought care from my ob/gyn and she ordered for me to receive a trans vaginal ultra sound to make sure everything was okay, and the results came back everything was fine I was just experiencing abnormal bleeding.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 05/12/2021, two days prior to expected menstrual/period. I received my period as expected. HOWEVER, my next period was supposed to occur on 06/10/2021. I am 10 days late, and have been experiencing mentsrual cramps in my low abdomen and back pain for two weeks, with no period. My period has been late one other time in 27 years of life, and only by 5 days. I have never had such a late period, and I am not pregnant.

In May, they started to get even heavier and even more painful. In June, I was bleeding extremely heavy. They lasted almost a whole week each time. I was in excruciating pain. I have an IUD. I was barely getting a period. When I did, it was light spotting a day or two prior to receiving the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Extreme chronic fatigue:9 or more hours of sleep at night. on days off, after being aways for about 5hrs, I end up taking a 3-4hr nap, then go to bed at usual time of 11pm. Still extremely tired when waking up, and have no energy to do anything during the day. Seems to be increasing worse. My doctor prescribed me Adderall to help me get through work.  Intense Brain Fog: I used to have perfectly clear thought function. Now I struggle trying to remember what I was going to do, what I need to do, trying to get my thoughts out when speaking. At work, I have a hard time gathering my thoughts &amp; what I&#39;m trying to say when answering questions. Making obviously stupid mistakes, that I normally would never make beforehand.  Menstrual Cycles: I&#39;ve been on the same birth control &amp; take religiously for 10yrs now and my cycle ran like clockwork. Now, I begin spotting half way through my cycle for about 5 days. Then when I do have my period, it is basically nonexistent. No real bleeding, more like black in color discharge &amp; what seems like chunks, instead of normal red blood.

During my period I was nauseous off and on, lightheaded most days and extremely fatigued the first two days enough so I couldn&#39;t work or get out of bed. This is all very different from my usual menstrual period and nothing changed in my diet or lifestyle from the previous month other than receiving this vaccine.

Sore throat and swollen throat glands twenty minutes after shot that continued for a couple hours after.  Swollen breasts leading to back pain twenty minutes after shot continuing for a week following.  Headache, fatigue, and joint pain for 48 hours after shot.  Nausea and acid reflux for several days after shot.  Menstrual spotting occurring one week after shot (had period the week before).  I saw a doctor at an urgent care and he suspects I may have anemia that was worsened due to being on my period right before shot and that likely contributed to the dizziness and rapid heartbeat.  No explanation for other symptoms but I am healthy.

Symptoms mostly disappeared the next day except for body aches, sensitive inner ears (some difficulty draining the eustachian tube, they randomly pop, and some pressure is released). 3rd day most symptoms gone except still cannot fully release eustachian tubes, still mild swelling in arm light, and started menstrual spotting (day 15 of the cycle, my previous cycle started 4/1 and was regular.). 4th-day post vaccine and I am starting to spot more heavily, I think the cycle is about to start. I wonder if my body was stressed enough I did not ovulate. I experienced a change in discharge on days 2 and 3 but when I took an ovulation test it came up negative on both days,   After the first shot, I felt like I couldn&#39;t take a full breath and I felt like something was in my lungs like phlegm or something ( I don&#39;t Smoke FYI) but I noticed the symptoms went away after the second dose.

Everything was found to be normal with the baby. The cause of the bleeding is still unknown by the timing aligns perfectly with my vaccine. The bleeding increased and has now began to slow.

                                                When i got my first dose March 27, 2021 it was fine about 2 weeks later I had a rash on my arm where I got vaccination. Around the same time (April 5th) it was due for my menstrual cycle and I did not get it until a week late. I am an individual who&#39;s cycle is right on track so this was very weird.  I only thing I did different was getting the vaccine

This persisted. I noticed my supraclavicular lymph node was also swollen. I went to the Doctor regarding this. My first 2 periods after the vaccine were heavier. I went to my OB GYN because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to the vaccine or my IUD. It was not due to the IUD. I was also feeling super tired. I also experienced a full feeling in my neck so I got my lymph&#39;s checked. I got labs done which all came back fine. I was still feeling tired and having lymphadenopathy so I went to my PCP.  Now, I still have the lymphadenopathy on my neck. It is not large enough to see. I also have a feeling of fullness in my neck. I also still have increased fatigue.

Prior to getting vaccinated, I experienced a regular cycle with light flow (no cramps) that lasted exactly 4 days (consistently, for the past 16 years). Since being vaccinated, I?ve experienced two abnormal cycles. The first cycle involved extreme pain and cramps, incredibly heavy flow that lasted for 6 days with spotting for 4 days afterward. The second, and more recent cycle was light and less painful, but I?ve been spotting for 7 days now. Every time I think it?s stopped, it starts back up.

                                                I got my period even though I am on the IUD. I have not really had my period since getting my IUD.  Normally I would not report this. But I am worried that the Moderna vaccine may have impacted the efficacy of my birth control since I do not get my period on the IUD. Will take a pregnancy test at appropriate time to determine fully.  This must be researched as it has very frightening implications for unexpected pregnancy if it is impacting the IUD. Otherwise, my body was simply stressed enough by the vaccine that I have my period. It is odd either way.

I contacted my provider and I was instructed to take a pregnancy test, which was positive. I went in for an exam on the 12th and they confirmed that I was indeed pregnant. They tested my Beta Hcg twice. I didn&#39;t get my results immediately due to one site being closed due to COVID. I could&#39;ve gone to the hospital and received the results immediately, but my doctor didn&#39;t want to take the chance due to the hospital having a lot of COVID. They confirmed that I was pregnant on the 19th or 20th. I bled for a few days after that. The final Beta Hcg was done and my level was 0.

Four days of unusual spotting, discharge, and cramps have followed. Black discharge with a foul smell. I know this is highly unusual for my body. No other stressors and no history of irregular period. I will see my doctor soon, but my bloodwork from a few months ago was normal. I&#39;ll continue to monitor, but this is a concerning side effect and I hope it is temporary. I wish I&#39;d known this was a possibility.

Two days after first dose: I started mensturating heavily and suddenly with severe menstral symptoms.  I continued to sporadically have light bleeding for 3 weeks. Prior to this event, I had not had a period in almost a year due to my birth control method. I have cramps, bloating, breast pain, irregular bleeding and weight gain. I received the second dose on 03/25/21 and by 03/30/21 I was experiencing yet another round of extreme PMS symptoms like severe breast pain, severe cramps that leave me bedridden, and intense food cravings. I have not had cyclic periods for several months prior to either of these events. It was jarring enough for me to start tracking my period symptoms because it was so out of the normal. I have been filtered into thinking any issues with my period are just something to deal with and to not seek medical attention, but I have missed approximately 6 days of work due to various symptoms after both of my doses.

                                                I started with the headache the day after the first dose of moderna vaccine. Since then and until today 18 days later it has not been taken away from me and it has been changing. Sometimes they are punctures, sometimes pangs that come and go and sometimes constant pressure. Also my period is 11 days late, which has never happened to me, it is usually early.

                                                My mensural cycle began the same day that I received the vaccine. My period was extended to last a total of two weeks. At the injection site, a large red welt appeared and was consistently present for a total of two weeks. Being in the sun, irritated the welt and would turn it bright red and itchy.  The welt would come and go for an entire month following the injection. For the first five days following the injection, my left middle finger acted as if it was jammed on and off. The finger ached and hurt and I was unable to bend said finger.  I had a low grade fever for a couple days following the injection.   One month after the injection, I formed an outer ear infection in my left ear and minor scrapes were not healing as they did in the past. Scrapes and cuts began taking weeks to heal instead of days. The ear infection lasted one week before I asked for antibiotic drops. The day that I received antibiotics, my ear infection spread to the right ear, and lasted another week. Both ear infections lasted approximately one week each. Also a month after my injection, my facial acne increased substantially and I began feeling lethargic with light throat irritations such as coughing and flem.   Due to these reactions to the first Moderna injection, I elected to not receive the second injection.   Five weeks after my injection, on 23 Apr 21, I received my TDAP booster and PPV23, one in each arm. I have never had reactions to vaccines prior to the Moderna injection; but now, for the first two days after the booster injections, I could not raise my arms due to severe pain and muscle aches at the injection sites. I felt weak and lethargic as well as experienced lightheadedness and rushes of blood pressure changes on 24 Apr 21. Currently on 25 Apr 21, I am still experiencing moderate injection site pains and feel lethargic.

                                                At around 0100 I began developing body aches, severe headache, chills,  and joint pain. I also developed a mild fever of 101.3. I took Tylenol, took a warm bath with epsom salt and began feeling better around 0500-0700. I then slept 9hrs. Woke up ran some errands went home and was extremely tired. I then napped for 5hrs. After that I felt a lot better. I did have a pretty sore arm for several days but it was tolerable.  The more concerning adverse effect I experienced from Moderna was after my first dose on 2/12/21, my period following  that dose which was to be 02/23/22  was essential non-existent. I then had pregnancy tests done to confirm I was not pregnant.  My period has since seemingly returned to normal.

Was prescribed an over the counter antihistamine and told not to receive the second vaccine.   Over the course of the following week pain throughout my body worsened - the most painful being in my ovaries, in my muscles, and (believe it or not) feeling like in my blood! I eventually stopped sleeping and psychosis developed. I was voluntarily hospitalized in an ER first, then in a Psych unit at Hospital where my psychosis was stabilized along as the primary concern while my physical health symptoms were monitored and managed with (what I assume was) patient-lead care. During my time in-patient I requested to stop taking my birth control pills, which was heard.   Upon leaving the hospital (currently 2 days out), I have continued taking prescribed mental health medications (Geodon 20mg in the evening, Prozac 40mg in the morning) and continue to monitor and manage my pain with over-the-counter Tylenol. Since leaving in-patient the pain is localized to pelvis/ovaries.

                                                Shot 1: sore arm and bouts of fatigue during three-week interim. Period is longer (9 days) and more painful than usual. PMS symptoms also endure for most of my bleeding, and bleeding becomes more heavy on day 4, as if I had a &#34;second&#34; period. Shot 2: 8 hours post shot, awakened with slight body aches. The body aches progressed to fever, headache and nausea between post-vaccine hours 8 to 12. From hours 12-27, I experienced a fever of 100, vomiting, diarrhea, body aches, chills, and insomnia. Fever initially not affected by tylenol or ibuprofen. I cycled tylenol and ibuprofen throughout the day. At hour 27 post-vaccination I was able to take 3 ibuprofen and slept for 3 hours. Woke up at hour 31 and fever was gone for good. Days 2-6 post-vaccine, experienced headache and joint pain concentrated on the side of shot. There was a bruise just beneath the shot that turned green and is still visible 11 days post-vaccine. Bouts of fatigue have not ceased since first vaccine. Onset of period is currently delayed by 4 days.

I got my first shot in February very early in my pregnancy when I wasn&#39;t aware I was pregnant. I then proceeded the get my second shot which at that I knew I was maybe 6 weeks into pregnancy.   I&#39;ve never been pregnant before and the estimated date of delivery would have been November 2021.

It has gotten worse this week with blood clots and bleeding through a tampon within 2 hours. I have severe cramps today. All things that are very unusual. My periods sometimes do not come at all and I never experience cramping due to birth control.

                                                The first Moderna shot caused me to miss my next menstrual cycle, which had never happened to me prior to receiving the shot. In the week I received the 2nd shot on 3/13/21, I had uterine cramping that same day within a few hours of getting the shot. I also noticed a change to my cervical mucus during my ovulation cycle 2 weeks later. I then became pregnant the following month and was found to have a missed miscarriage at 6 weeks 1 day. It seems like their is a strong correlation between the side effects from the Moderna shot and the miscarriage.

I started feeling achy and took 1 more Tylenol around 11:45 pm before going to bed. I woke up around 2 AM (May 29) with extreme shakes, fever of 100.4. I tried to drink some tea / water and I began having uncontrollable vomiting / diarrhea for about 3 hours. At that point I was lightheaded, and my arms and legs both became numb / tingling. My husband drove me to the ER and I was given 2 bags of IV fluids, nausea medication and pain meds. I am also on the tail end of my period and began having cramping. The doctors were very concerned about an elevated heart rate and believe I was possibly also having a panic attack

                                                Ever since I got my second vaccine, I have been spotting (bleeding). It&#39;s been consistent since the second dose in August and it&#39;s nearly July. I still have my period in addition to the daily spotting.

                                                After receiving the second dose of Moderna I started feeling fatigue and sleeping more often. I was also having having menstrual bleeding for weeks on and off. Started getting Petechiae and did blood work. Platelets came back at count of 40. Prior blood work done in October 2020 7 months before receiving covid vaccine and platelets were at 246. I have no history of low platelets or any health issues until the after the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the first dose, experienced severe arm pain, shoulder pain, and hand numbness. Acute pain and numbness has worn off, but there is still moderate pain when using the arm. About a week post-dose, began spotting. Was not due to have menstrual period for 2-3 weeks according to birth control pill pack, and normally does not have any menstrual symptoms (no period) at all. Bleeding has increased daily, and is now fairly heavy. Accompanied by cramps.

                                                I believe that the vaccine could have affected my monthly menstrual cycle (particularly ovulation), which (if it is documented by enough women) I feel should be looked into more so more women are aware. I&#39;ve been tracking my period/ovulation for months for family planning purposes. I had 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/20/21 and my next period on 1/28/21. I&#39;ve been using OPK tests to track ovulation over the past few months, which have been positive on cycle day 18 or cycle day 19 (it&#39;s never been outside of those days before). When  I tested using the OPK twice per day on 2/10/21 (Cycle day 14) through 2/17/21 (cycle day 21), I got all negatives. I have no idea when I actually ovulated in February and think that the vaccine may have moved the date up earlier (which never happened). I know that I ovulated sometime, since I got a very happy surprise positive pregnancy test on 2/25/21 (which conflicts with the infertility myths!). While our family is thrilled with the news, I wanted to report it to VAERS in case there could be a possibility that the covid vaccine could throw off somebody&#39;s menstrual cycles/ovulation. If there is a link between those two, I feel like women of childbearing age would want to be informed of that possibility!

Pain at injection site for 3 days (red and swollen lump)- This has subsided 3. Tightness and pain in left neck (same side as injection)- This has subsided 4. My period was supposed to end on Saturday 3/20/22, but I am bleeding more heavily and this is unusual for me so I wonder if it is related to the vaccine somehow. Still bleeding as of today 3/22 Note: I treated the symptoms with ibuprophen and tylenol.

After vaccine 2; My period started within 5 mins of getting the second vaccine. I got terrible back cramps almost immediately, which has lasted into a second day (unusual for me). They are so bad I can&#39;t stand up straight, or walk around.

I had never had so much blood and fluid before in my life. The size of the tissue that I was menstruating was very very large and the pain and heavy menstruating went on until the end of the week (it never decreased or became better). Then after the second dose the same thing happened - not even 24 hours later I got my period with extreme pain, very large chunks of tissue, and extreme flow of blood. Then my third period the same exact thing has happened, extreme pain, very very large chunks of tissue, and extremely heavy flow.

Occurred again two days post-vaccination just over 24 hours after first occurrence. Intermittent abdominal cramping noticed as well. I am a female that regularly tracks menstrual cycles, has a consistent 29 day cycle with a period lasting an average of 5 days. I have good knowledge of my ovulation window and am certain this is not related to any ovulation/implantation occurrences. It is too early in my cycle for that to occur.  I am reporting so that you have this information but also out of concern that this could represent the onset of any other bleeding issues that may be developing as a result of getting vaccinated.

Later in the evening after receiving vaccine, noticed bleeding that resembled normal menstrual bleeding. Bleeding ended within 24 hours.  Menstrual period did not formally begin/return(?) until April 12. Experienced heavy flow going into the 5th day now, expect period to end soon as cycle normally lasts no more than 5-7 days. Suspect radiology and/or vaccine could be cause for delayed period.

At 5 am, a terrible migraine set it. I took 1000 mg Tylenol and laid in bed for about 45minutes until it kicked in. At this time I also had complete body aches, but nothing hurt worse than my arm. The I slept another 3-3.5 hours. In the morning, the headache was less intense, the fatigue was still there but not debilitating, and the brain fog was present but minimal. I had nausea hit 3-5 times, but usually subsided within 5-10 minutes. 24 hours after the shot, I started spotting, mostly dark, chunky bits of uterine lining. I am not scheduled to start my period for 12 days. The spotting has increased - I?m now on my second tampon before heading to bed. I?ve also developed a small rash about 1-2 inches below the injection site, which feels warm, and is red in a rough square shape about 2?x2?. I still have a faint headache.

                                                The patient received the first vaccine on 03MAR21 and began spotting on 10MAR21.  A miscarriage was confirmed on 19MAR21.  At the time of the first vaccine (03MAR21) the patient was unaware that she was pregnant as she had a negative home pregnancy test on 02MAR21.  She was told by her OB/GYN to inform us of her miscarriage.

                                                After both doses of the moderna vaccine, my menstrual cycle has become erratic. My menstrual cycle is becoming extremely short. My menstrual cycle previously has always been very regular. Typically my menstrual cycle would be 28 days apart with heavy bleeding that tapers at the end of my cycle. I am now experiencing menstrual cycles that last only 20 days and little to no bleeding. I am only ?spotting? while on my period now.  Something is wrong and other women I know  who have taken the moderna vaccine are having this issue just exactly the same as myself.  It?s like my body cannot have a proper menstrual cycle. To add, I have confirmed that I absolutely am NOT pregnant.

April 27, first ultrasound measured fetus at 6w1d (behind what was expected given LMP, should have measured 7w2d), embryonic cardiac activity was present, but could not be documented by M-mode. Provider warned 60% chance of abnormal pregnancy. BetaHCG testing results: April 27 was 28,247H; April 29 was 29,925H. A follow-up ultrasound on May 6 showed no fetal heart tones, and and fetus still measured 6w1d, unchanged from last visit. Provider prescribed misoprostol which was taken same day (May 6) to complete the miscarriage. Follow-up ultrasound May 13 showed gestational sac was gone and endometrium was less than 1cm in thickness.

Seen again in OBGYN office 3/16/21 which confirmed complete spontaneous miscarriage.

A few days later I started my period. It was irregular with severe PMS, panic attacks, anxiety and depression, severe cramping, more bleeding and blood clots than usual, period lasted longer than usual. Every day since I have been having PMS symptoms (anxiety, depression, panic attacks) and cramping. The cramping feels like period cramps but I am no longer on my period. The cramps last all day long and are not going away. I also had severe eye pain in my right eye about 1 week after the injection. The pain lasted for about 2 days, and was a throbbing pain behind my eyeball. I have never experienced any issues with my eyes before. I also had covid January 2021 and did not experience any of these symptoms then.

                                                The day I received the shot I had fatigue and pain in all my joints as described though I am not sure if it was normal as I returned home at 10am and proceeded to fall asleep till 7pm even though the night before I had my regular 8hrs of slumber. The following week I was supposed to have my period. Instead I had abdominal cramping and the period did not come. It came 2 weeks after that (so 3 weeks total of abdominal cramping) aka my period was 2 weeks late. The period also did not discharge as normal (bloody mucus pieces over 5 days), it came out in one go as a decidual cast (with some bloody spotting for half a day tops). Honestly if I wasn&#39;t abstinent for 2021 I would have thought I got pregnant and just miscarried. After the  decidual cast left my body the abdominal cramping ceased. I have previously never had a decidual cast and at most in my entire life, my period has been 5 days late.  In addition, just 24 hrs after receiving the 1st dose and still ongoing today is that I erupted in cystic acne on my face, chest, shoulders, and back. I do have adult acne but on average I would have 2-3 pimples on my shoulders at any given time. After the shot I was sporting 15&#43; pimples in each of these locations. This may be hormonal acne due to the strange menstruation situation from above. I work from home and had to forge wearing a bra as the straps and bands would irritate the acne and cause them to form a &#39;head&#39; and then rip open and burst from contact.

I took Tylenol and a 3 hour nap. I woke up with terrible joint pain, particularly in my knees, hips, ankles and wrists. All day I continued to have breast pain. I went to bed at midnight still I?m hurting. I woke up this morning still noticing the breast pain, but joint pain is gone.

But now I am getting intense pain to the point of feeling like I would fainting with periods after vaccination and this hasn&#39;t happened in years.  This started on my next cycle after my vaccination. I went to the Doctor May 27th to explain what was happened.

Began spotting on May 1 - approx 5 weeks pregnant. Spotted brown/pink with some clots until May 5, when I started lightly bleeding red.  Beta tests on May 5 and May 7 showed 6228.7 and 6529.0, respectively.  May 10 went in for viability scan - ultrasound showed gestational sac with 2 yolk sacs and 2 fetal poles, one measuring at 6 weeks and other measuring at 6w1d. No sign of misscarriage, no reason for bleeding was seen on the scan. Scan was perfect on paper. Bleeding picked up after scan and I lost the pregnancy on May 11 around 4:30pm. Bleeding continued for one week and HCG levels were low enough to show a negative test at my followup appointment 2 weeks later on May 26.

                                                My menstruation has been extremely regular since 12 years old. It occurs once a month, at the start of the month, and lasts 5-7 days. It is heavy the first 2-3 days with intense cramps, then the cramps go away and it gradually lightens until it&#39;s done. However, since getting the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I&#39;ve had my regular period followed by maybe a week of no period, after which I start bleeding again. This bleeding does not come with cramping or any of the regular symptoms of my period: sore lower back, irritability, bloating, nausea, acne. The first time the extra bleeding happened was following my first dose of the Moderna vaccine and was extremely light, so much so that it was barely recognizable (a very faint light brown discharge). Every month since this first vaccine, the additional bleeding has continued. After getting the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, the bleeding has actually increased. It still occurs about a week after my normal period. Not only is it heavier each month, it occurs for longer. Now, for example, it is no longer simply a light brown discharge that can be taken care of with a thin panty-liner. Instead, I have to change a regular tampon a few times a day and wear an overnight pad when I sleep. It is mostly dark brown in color but when I wipe, there&#39;s sometimes a faint pink color. My first dose of the Moderna vaccine was batch # 006B21A and my second dose was batch # 032B21A.

                                                Adverse event: alteration of ovulation and menstrual cycle. I have a very regular cycle that I track very closely with over 2 years of basal body temperature and cervical mucus data. Based on this carefully tracked data, I ovulate around cycle day 16-17 and have a menstrual period that lasts 2-4 days. After receiving the first shot of Moderna on the 11th day of my cycle, I continued to have low and erratic temperatures for 2 weeks. I did not observe any of the typical signs of ovulation.  I took a pregnancy test which was negative. My menstrual bleed was also ~10 days delayed, and lasted for about 7-8 days which is over twice the usual length of my natural menstrual bleeds. The bleed was generally the same flow (moderate) as my normal bleed, but lasted much longer.

                                                Alright so in late afternoon/evening on April 16th 2021, I went on a long walk which is normal for me. I noticed my yoga pants feeling tight and I felt bloated. When I got back, I had a lighter dinner. The next day I wasn&#39;t feeling well still and it was my Mother&#39;s birthday. I was feeling really weird and I just kind of ignored it. By the end of the day, after dinner, I started feeling really not great. I felt sick to my stomach, I wasn&#39;t getting sick/vomiting but then the next day I tried to go out to see my friends at brunch and just talked - I did not eat because it hurts to eat anything. I went to the store and got yogurt because it is all I could stomach. The following day I finally went to the ER because I was just really in pain, I said to my mom can you just cut out my stomach it hurts so bad. The pain was on my left side though, I&#39;m not even sure if that&#39;s stomach pain. The DRS at the ER they did exams and they gave me medications for my pain  but they weren&#39;t really sure what to diagnose it as. I got a stool softener, a nausea tablet and pain medicine. Most of that week I was still eating just yogurt. Also, mind you, I had started my period around this time and that made it confusing as well. I drove out to Iowa and saw my GI DR on May 11th 2021 in CA and he said well if it is all gone, that&#39;s great. So when my period came back, I began having the pains again. I was in pain so much that it hurt to even turn my body. That pain has continued to be repeated every time after the second dose of the vaccine. I saw my OBGYN on Friday July 2nd 2021.

Pregnancy tests were negative prior to receiving the first vaccine and then turned positive on 12-29-2020 (5 days after getting first vaccine.)

Also some very light clotting, which rarely happens for me. I was not due for my period for 2.5 weeks. My cycle is extremely regular and has never deviated from 28-31 days in the last 6&#43; years. I have a copper IUD (for 6 years), and have never been pregnant.

                                                Vaccine Saturday evening. Noticed ball of left foot feeling numb Sunday morning. Numbness spread throughout left leg during the day.  Some aching but mostly numbness in the subsequent days. No loss of function. Left arm went numb Wednesday. Right foot and right hand developed some tingling/numbness Wednesday night/Thursday morning  (today). Right leg has progressively gotten more numb today (Thursday). Vaginal spotting started Tuesday 3/9, only 1.5 weeks into my current cycle and current pack of birth control pills (highly unusual).

                                                This is my first pregnancy. I had a normal ultrasound at my 8-week appointment, showing heartbeat and movement. My estimated delivery date was October 12, 2021. Four days after my second COVID shot, I had my 12-week checkup. They ran a urine test and asked me questions about my progress, all seemed normal. I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any side effects that would lead me to believe that I had miscarried. The OBGYN attempted to listen to the heartbeat but couldn&#39;t hear anything, so she wrote me a prescription to head over to the imaging site to get an ultrasound just in case. I drove there immediately and was given an ultrasound. They couldn&#39;t hear anything so we went ahead with a TVA. After approximately 45 minutes and no updates, the technician said that the results would be forwarded to my doctor and that they would reach out to me about the results. My doctor informed me that they could not hear a heartbeat and that I must have miscarried within the past couple days because the fetus length was as expected for 12-weeks of gestation. I am now scheduled for D&amp;C on 4/5/21.

                                                Approximately 30-45 mins after vaccine injection, I began menstrual bleeding.  I suffered a miscarriage 3 weeks prior to the vaccination, and was not expecting to start my menstrual cycle.  Since the miscarriage and up to the day of vaccination, I had light and inconsistent spotting (brown in color).  However, after the vaccination I have had a light flow of blood, red/pink in color.  My best guess is that an anticoagulant in the vaccine caused my blood to thin to the point where I began bleeding again from the recent miscarriage.  The bleeding is ongoing as of the time of this report.

                                                2 days after the first dose of the vaccine, I started cramping. The cramping was followed by 5 days of spotting just like the first dose. After 5 days of spotting, I then began my normal period (I?m on birth control). My flow so far has been way more intense then usual. My birth control tends to keep my period light, but at the moment I am bleeding heavily and cramping really bad. The cramping is intense (which I typically do not get during my period). I am again having cluster migraines. The PMS is more intense as well.

The cramping was then accompanied by a week of spotting, even though I was in the middle of my birth control pack and shouldn?t have been bleeding. The cramping was intense (which I typically do not get during my period). I also had cluster migraines and intense PMS overall.

                                                I have the nexplanon implant as birth control, and my body stopped having periods two years ago because of that. After my second dose I experienced spotting for about three weeks and then it turned into a full blown menstrual cycle. It is very weird. It doesn&#39;t feel like a big deal but I also think it is important to note considering my BC reacts with my body reliably in such a way that I do not menstrate.

I attribute this to the vaccine as this has never happened before. I have also read other women?s periods have been impacted. I had the vaccine on 3/1 and still have not had a period.   When I got the vaccine I had 103 fever, terrible chills, fatigue, and a headache. The fever started 8 hours post vaccine and lasted about 30 hours. The headache lingered for 5 days. These symptoms have since subsided.

                                                Extremely unusual menstrual cycle. Usually my menstrual cycle is 6 days long. First day is light, second day is heavy, and then it wains from there. After receiving the Covid shot I started my period and heavily bled for four days to the point that I was soaking through super plus tampons every hour to two hours and having to wear heavy night pads. It was similar to bleeding after birthing a child. Then after the four days my bleeding stopped. On the fifth day I had severe leg pain in the upper right hip area. Then on the sixth day I started bleeding again. I?m on day 8 of my period.  My period has never been this long.

More than 3 hours later, but the same evening, I started my period. Two weeks earlier than I should have. I have been bleeding for three days and having cramps.   This also happened my first Moderna shot on April 2nd. I had more severe stomach pains and started my period for only one day.  However both times I?ve also had my regular period too. So 3 times between April 2nd and now.

                                                I received my second Moderna shot on 4/9/2021. I was sick for about 36 hours and it went away. No big deal. On 4/12 I got my period. I haven?t had a period in 3 years because of my birth control. I had really bad cramping and lots of clots. It lasted about 5 days and was gone. On 4/30 I got another period. Same lots of clotting and bad cramps. That went away after about 5-6 days.  I went to the dr on 4/13 and told her about it which she ignored and said it could be anything. She will run labs but won?t check estrogen levels since I?m on birth control. I go for labs on Monday 4/17.  Well on 4/15, which is the day I am writing this I am again on my period. This isn?t normal. As well as the pains that I am constantly feeling in what feels like my tubes or something. I also know I am not the only person this has happened to. The shots have just became available for teens and I have a 14, 12 and 6 year. All girls. And I am all for the shot however this makes me question if it won?t affect my daughters and how it will affect them if it?s doing this to me.  I am hesitant to give it to them and I wasn?t before.

                                                Ever since the completion of both COVID-19 vaccine doses, my menstrual cycle has been overly painful, long, and extremely (to an almost uncontrollable state). This has never been the case since I was 13 years old. My 2nd COVID-19 vaccine was the beginning of February, any by the end of February when my cycle started my period was out of control. It is now May, and has not resolved at all. Every month my cycle is worse and worse. It went from 4-5 days pre-COVID vaccine, to 7-8 days post- COVID vaccine. The menstrual cramps are so awful, which I have never had before. The flow/heaviness is so extreme and uncontrollable, I can&#39;t even leave the house for the first 2-3 days. This needs to be looked into. The ONLY thing with me that has changed, in the past couple of months is getting the vaccine. Nothing else would cause this. I have read some articles that are saying post-menopausal women are getting periods again and younger women are experiencing unusually abnormal periods. Please look into this and research it, as this is definitely not right

                                                My menstrual cycle has always been a little irregular but it has gotten substantially worse since the vaccine and I am unsure if it is related so erring on the side of caution and reporting. On may 9th I had profuse mid-cycle bleeding and was going through super tampons every 15 minutes for at least 6 hours. I went to the emergency room and tested negative for pregnancy (thus not a miscarriage) and my IUD was in place so my IUD that I have had for 2 years was not the cause of the bleeding. My period came back 2 weeks after that bleeding episode and has lasted for 13 days.

A few days after my vaccine, I went to hospital 05-09-2021 with pain on my abdomen, and the pain migrated down more, like I had a blockage from being dehydrated.   At the hospital they did an ultrasound and MRI and performed lab work.  My abdomen was fine by the next day.  My EDD: 12-10-2021.

I received my second dose of Covid-19 Vaccine on 5/4/21 and was anticipated to have my period for the month of 5/8/21. I did not receive my period which was odd as I was on birth control. I waited a week and when my period still had not started I decided to take a pregnancy test to verify I was not pregnant. The pregnancy test came back positive. I proceeded to take 3 more tests for accuracy. I had my first visit with my OBGYN who ordered blood work to confirm pregnancy and verified my due date would be 1/13/22 making estimated conception 4/22/21.

Has talked with pcp. States as a nurse knows to increase water and did this. States she was also in bed for 3 days post the 2nd shot with body aches, fatigue, and low grade fevers. No work up was necessary, but was really upset that her breast milk dried up as she was enjoying the bonding with her baby. States he was more cuddly than her daughter was. He seemed to miss it also but transition to bottles/formula well.  He was 5 months old.  She otherwise had no changes in medications at that time and did not take antihistamines. She has also noted heavy menstrual cycles (she is not sure if related or not) thinks a light cycle in December, but since March (about a month post 2nd dose) have been much heavier &amp; longer. Lasting 7-10&#43; days, changes regular sized tampon about q2 hours.  No known hx of prior covid infection.

I was running 104F fever for 2 days that OTC medicine would not break the fever. On 04/20/21 I had my LMP while severely sick. I found out I was pregnant on 05/13/21 and had a miscarriage at around 10 weeks on 06/29/2021. I have 2 prior children with no history of miscarriage or fertility issues and was seen routinely and early on in my care. I wanted to report this in case anyone is studying these kinds of events and would want the information.

I started experiencing mild swelling and tenderness in my L armpit/breast, with mild pain during movement and compression. Yesterday (1/18), the injection site became slightly raised, blotchy, and very itchy. I woke up this morning feeling like I had a cold, with joint soreness and a mild itchy rash around my ankles, in addition to fatigue and warmth/itchiness around the injection site

                                                There was very little pain until before bed the day I received the vaccine. At that time, I started feeling tenderness in the shoulder where I received the shot. The next day (today) the pain, inflammation, and swelling started moving down from my shoulder through to my fingers. I was barely able to get my wedding ring off because of the swelling. The tenderness now goes note my whole arm, under my arm pit, down my shoulder blade, and even my left breast. I have taken Benadryl for the swelling and tried to get it elevated, and I have taken ibuprofen for the body aches that I?ve had today as well.

                                                At the time of administration of the first does of Moderna vaccine, I was 6 weeks pregnant.  I had confirmed pregnancy with home positive test and missed period. I had an estimated due date of 9/24/2021.  This was my 4th pregnancy. I have had two uncomplicated pregnancies to term. In September 2020 experienced a chemical pregnancy with early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks.  The first 24 hours after 1st dose of vaccine I experienced extreme arm soreness in the arm that was vaccinated,  causing  headache and unable to sleep. After 24 hours I felt &#34;normal&#34;. 2 weeks and 3 days following the first dose of Moderna, I  had a miscarriage. On the night of 2/15/21 I lost the pregnancy with vaginal bleeding, bright red  blood, passing tissue, clots/ sac. I had an uneventful pregnancy up to that point, feeling well as I had with prior pregnancies.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

I took a home pregnancy test the week of 1/3/2021, which came back positive.  On 1/17/2021, I started having some spotting and saw my OBGYN on 1/18/2021.  My OBGYN did a transvaginal ultrasound and estimated I was about 5 weeks pregnant.  I went for bloodwork prescribed by my OBGYN on 1/18 and 1/20 to measure my HcG levels.  By 1/20-1/21 the bleeding became heavy and my HcG levels dropped.  I had a follow up appointment with my OBGYN on 2/3/2021 where they performed another transvaginal ultrasound and more bloodwork to confirm that I had miscarried.

I have never ever experienced any cycle shorter than 27 days before. However, this cycle lasted only 20 days. I had bad dizzy and could not stand  on my feet right when the period blood came out. I laid down and had some candies. The dizziness went away after 15 mins.

                                                I felt fine after the shot until about 7 pm when I started experience an intense, pressurized sensation in my head, jaw, chest, and arms. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ringing in my ears, and feeling flushed. Over night I felt some numbness in my hands and arms. The next day the feeling of  pressure and tightness was gone but the dizziness and nausea has remained. I have more energy but  am feeling concerned about the persistent vertigo.  I have a history of allergic reactions. I was also scheduled to begin my menstrual cycle this weekend and it has been delayed.

                                                1) Experiencing delayed period. My cycle is fairly regular and should have started within a couple days of getting vaccinated. As of 3/30/21 I have yet to start my period. Experiencing bloating, swollen breast, fatigue. Pregnancy test taken today was negative.  2) Suffered a fracture of upper left humerus, neat vaccine site. Injury was sustained during a fall while downhill skiing and may be unrelated to the vaccine, but the fracture was at the same spot as my vaccination.

Immediately upon receiving the vaccine I had uterine cramps and heavy bleeding with large clots continued throughout the day and into the next day. Had some dark bleeding/discharge about 4 days after my period ended for 2 days. This also happened during my first dose of Moderna, although my first dose was on the first day of my period so I didn?t quite register it since bleeding is normally heavy at the beginning of my period.  First period was also substantially heavier with clots and had some dark bleeding/discharge 4 days after my period ended

                                                2 weeks after my 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine I started spotting blood as if I was about to start my menstrual period however I was not due to start my period for 2 more weeks.  This bleeding was light and not heavy like a regular period. It did require a panty liner at times however. This bleeding lasted a little over 48 hours before it eventually stopped. My menstrual cycle has always been very regular. Before this episode I had never once spotted in between periods. This is very unusual for me.  It has been 24 hours since the bleeding has stopped.

It was on time, however, it was extremely heavy. On the 3rd day, I began to have very large blood clots. I spoke to my gynecologist and she started me on birth control that sane day in order to stop the bleeding.

I have been spotting/ bleeding for over a week straight now, when I should even be having a period at all. I also developed a slight yeast infection during the time between my two doses.

                                                My period was extremely late and has been completely unpredictable after getting vaccinated. I?ve been charting my cycle meticulously for three years (36&#43; cycles), and have always had a very even and predictable cycle of 25-26 days. My cycle remained a normal 25-26 days throughout the entirety of 2020 despite stressful events and changes in activity levels. After getting my covid shot, my cycle was as follows: 36 days, 18 days, 19 days. In the last three years I had my flu shot every season, and get all the recommended vaccines from my OBGYN when prompted. I?ve never had a reaction like this before.

Prior menstrual cycles lasted 4-5 days with few other symptoms. After the second dose of the vaccine on 2/2/21, my cycle returned on 2/19/21 despite still breastfeeding and no change in birth control. For the next 3 months, my period has been longer (8-9 days), heavier, and with new bloating, low back pain, and cramps.

I found out less than a week after my second vaccine dose that I was pregnant. At the time of the vaccine I was probably 3.5 weeks pregnant, but I didn&#39;t know yet. At my first pre-natal appointment, on 6/17/2021 I found out that I was having a miscarriage. The fetus had stopped growing about a week earlier at 7.5 weeks (around 6/10/2021) and had no heartbeat. There&#39;s no known cause for the miscarriage and I have not yet actually passed the fetus, so I&#39;m still in the process of miscarrying. It was a missed miscarriage.

I had it in the normally scheduled week of June, but my period was very heavier with lots of blood clots.  It lasted seven days, but my periods usually last around four days and my periods are usually very light. I also had lots of spotting . I went to the OBGYN and they prescribed me a hormone to try to restart my cycle and get it back to normal.

                                                After the second dose of the Moderna vaccine for COVID 19, approximately 14 hours after at 5am, I experienced the &#34;normal&#34; signs and symptoms to start. I had fever, aches, chills, fatigue. However, when I walked to my kitchen, I became extremely dizzy, started seeing black spots, and my ears were ringing extremely loud. I thought I was going to pass out. A heat wave came over me, and I had an overwhelming feeling that I was going to throw up. I stripped my clothes off in a hurry to try to cool down and my vision became black. I laid on the kitchen floor for a few minutes and tried to go back to bed. I fell into the bed and began shaking and shivering. My husband was scared. By this time, my vision had returned. The ringing in my ears had reduced but was still present. I slept for over 15 hours and was extremely dizzy any time I got up to get water or use the restroom. By 4pm, I felt slightly better but for a full four days, I did not feel well enough to do anything. Since taking the vaccine, my periods have been different and I lose SO much hair.

It happened one more time in the middle of the night, jolting me out of sleep. My period has not come since I took the shot.  It?s been two weeks. This is very unusual.

I have had to wear a pad ever since this dose although my period was not scheduled to return for a few weeks following the dose. The blood is dark brown suggesting that it is old. It has continued, and I am now going on 10 days of symptoms.

The patient&#39;s medical history included eczema.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included pre-natal vitamins.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) on 31 Dec 2020. On 28 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.

On 01 Feb 2021 her breast became hard, red, and sore.  On 02 Feb 2021 her breast symptoms resolved; however, her milk production was 65-70% of normal. She treated the events with acetaminophen and magnesium sulfate dissolved in water.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events clogged duct, possible mastitis, milk production dropped, and were not reported.  The outcome of the event, received vaccine while breastfeeding, was considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, flu like symptoms, was considered resolved on 31 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, breast was hard, red, and sore, was considered resolved on 02 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Fever, chills, sweats, body aches, could barely move my left arm, pain in my bones and joints, pain in my pelvis, couldn&#39;t sleep because my body hurt so badly.

I had no other issues or complications that would have contributed to my miscarriage.

I started to shake uncontrollably, have horrible body aches and chills, I went from hot to cold to hot again all through the night, i had a fever all night long, bad stomach cramps, super nausea all night long, and bad headache. This last all the way into the following night having me miss a whole day of work because I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. Since this second shot I have had severe heart palpitations, prolong period, blurred vision and severe body aches.

It comes and goes throughout the day unlike my normal period.

As I was walking home walking home within 5min I had heavy bleeding, I wasn&#39;t suppose to get my period for another 2 weeks. The heavy bleeding lasted full 2 days, that day within 5hrs I had body aching and later had a fever. I had the fever and body aching for about 24hrs and my period for 2days. Since then I have been having random spotting of light or heavy bleeding. I had my period on 3-6-21 to 3-16-21 full days bleeding. Now I still have random spotting of blood cloth and heavy bleeding for few hours and it stops.

However, my menstrual cycle also occurred 1 week late.  Also for the past 3 months since then, I have experienced spotting shortly before the onset of my cycle.  I have been trying to conceive, and I am wondering if the vaccine has had an impact on my fertility.  My menstrual cycle had always been regular prior to the second dose.

                                                I?m currently 11 weeks postpartum and exclusively breastfeeding my infant. I experienced typical vaccine adverse effects on day 0-1 (fatigue chills muscle aches weakness arm pain and fainting episode (I have a history of fainting and with other vaccines)) followed by mastitis on day 2 after my vaccine second dose.  Mastitis symptoms included fever chills muscle aches weakness breast pain swelling redness and decreased milk production from blocked duct(s). I had no symptoms of blocked duct prior to the vaccine or prior to day 2. My prescriber ordered an antibiotic and ibuprofen which helped.  We believe that the blocked ducts/mastitis occurred in relation to lymph node swelling that has been seen with the vaccine although we did not have a physical exam to determine if that is true.

I normally use light tampons and it?s rarely fully saturated after 6 hours, I was bleeding through supers within a few hours. There is a zero chance of pregnancy so it wasn?t a miscarriage.

                                                I am a recovering long covid patient (since March 2020). I improved greatly around December 2020. After the vaccine, my symptoms returned. Sinus tachycardia, brain fog, extreme fatigue, sleeping 20 hours a day, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation, SOB, joint and muscle pain, ocular changes. In addition, I started having terrible headaches, pain at injection site (left arm was virtually unusable for 3 weeks), and tinnitus. No menstruation since vaccination (2 confirmed negative pregnancy tests, and I was supposed to have my period right around the time I was vaccinated), intermittent uterine pain. Went to the ER and had 160 resting HR, and plan to go back on a beta blocker. Symptoms have waned somewhat, but I am still nowhere near where I was before the vaccine.

I have had a normal menstrual cycle for the past 19 years with no abnormalities. My menstrual cycle was supposed to start on April 14, but it did not start, and I had severe cramping and pain, bloating, and diarrhea for 14 days after April 14 when it should have started. During these two weeks I also gained 8 pounds, which is unusual for me. My menstrual cycle started 14 days late on April 28, and I continued to have severe cramping and also experienced heavy bleeding which is abnormal for me. My mentrual cycle is normally light and I don&#39;t usually have any cramps or pain.

For the period starting 4/4/2021, I woke up in the middle of the night in severe pain, went to the ER and had tests run with the thinking that my appendix had ruptured or my ovary had twisted. My period started shortly after leaving the ER with no diagnosis. Period starting 5/4/2021 was very heavy at onset, one regular tampon per hour for 4 hours. Severe pain and cramps in front and back. Bloating. Despite not eating because of the pain I gained 12 lbs.

I don&#39;t know if this is related to the vaccine, but it has never happened to me before.  ARound 11:30am, I experienced a series of the most intense anxiety attacks I&#39;ve ever had (I do have occasional anxiety attacks but not to this degree or duration), this went on for about an hour until I finally took half of a Xanax. My preferred methods of meditation, deep breathing exercises, and using essential oils didn&#39;t work, I haven&#39;t had to take a Xanax in over two years as these methods have prevented the need previously. It&#39;s been several hours and I still have a lingering sense of &#34;doom&#34; but haven&#39;t had another episode.

                                                Post vaccine I have not had a regular mensural cycle. The first cycle post the first vaccine was light and nearly clear. Then went to heavy and painful. I am tracking ovulation because I am trying to conceive and since the vaccines I have not reached peak ovulation. Regardless of what type of ovulation test I take my hormones never show there is a peak. My periods went from completely regular and ovulation very regularly, everything down to the same day or 1 day difference to now being sometimes a week off. This is without trying for the last 3 months due to irregularities post vaccine.

                                                I have been on the DEPO shot for 4 years and have had no menstral cycle or symptoms.  A month after I got the first vaccine and a week after, I started having light bleeding and cramps. It has been 4 years since I had experienced this. Now on today, May 15 - 2 months after my first dose of Moderna, I am having period symptoms again but with some stabbing pain in my uterus. I am very frustrated because these were NOT listed as side effects in the information given and I would not have gotten this vaccine had I known this would happen.

                                                Two days after my second shot I started my menstrual bleeding violently and two weeks early.  That night I woke in the middle of the night and my ears were ringing and my vision blacking at the edges and I was loosing a lot of blood. I started shaking so hard my teeth chattered, and was unable to get out of bed without feeling like I was going to pass out. My husband brought me juice and crackers, and it lessened within a half hour.

I got my vaccine 2/2/2021 while on my period and my period completely stopped the night after my second dose and returned two days later. Then 3 months after that (May 21, 2021), I was on day 13 of my cycle and I had a massive amount of bleeding out of no where. I took a pregnancy test to make sure there was no miscarriage and it was negative. I bled/spotted for another 3 days and it stopped.

I had a positive home pregnancy test the following day on 3/31.  On 4.29, I had my first confirmation ultrasound where a heartbeat was found, but the fetus was not measuring as expected. On 4.30, I received my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine. A follow-up ultrasound was done on 4.12, at that time, no heartbeat was indicated and the fetus had stopped developing shortly after receiving the 2nd does on 4.30. This was my first pregnancy.

                                                I was given the injection and immediately went to sit in the patient observation area for the required 15 minutes. I was feeling fine, made a quick phone call, and was just sitting and waiting. Then, 5 minutes after the injection, I noticed my arm at the injection site felt just the tiniest bit achy, but thought I was probably just imagining it. Then within several seconds of that observation, I could feel a blackout coming on--tunnel vision, ringing in my ears, general feeling of being unwell. I started to bend down to put my head between my knees, but that&#39;s the last thought I remember before waking up lying on the floor with the pharmacist tending to me. He said I had only been unconscious for several seconds. I was completely weak and still felt generally unwell. I also sustained a bump on my forehead and a hurt nose from hitting the floor when I collapsed. I recovered enough to walk out about 30 minutes later, and rested the rest of the day since the weakness lasted through the evening. I don&#39;t know if it was related or not, but I also started my period 4 days after that, which was 5 days earlier than expected, and it lasted a full 2 weeks (my period is typically 7-9 days).

                                                The morning before my second Moderna vaccine I took a pregnancy test and it was inconclusive so I figured I wasn&#39;t pregnant and got my second vaccine (1/26/21). I missed my period and took another pregnancy test on 1/30/21 and it was positive. I went to my first ultrasound on 3/2/21 when I should have been around 8 or 9 weeks and the baby was measuring small but it had a heart beat that was in a normal range. A week later on 3/9/21 I started spotting and I called my doctor and they told me to let them know if it got worse. I went to work but by the end of my shift the bleeding had got worse and my doctor made me go to the ER so I could have another ultrasound. The ultra sound showed the baby still had a heart rate but it was low. I stayed home from work the next day to take it easy and I ended up having a miscarrage that night 3/10/21. I had a follow up ultrasound on 3/11/21 that proved it. I wasn&#39;t planning on reporting this because really anything could have caused it but I signed up for the vaccine app when I got my vaccines and answered the follow up questions. Someone called me because of how I answered my question and she recommended that I report it.

I had a D&amp;C.  The delivery date would have been on September 20, other than that I have had a normal pregnancy.

A lot lighter than I usually experience but not light enough to be considered spotting filling 2 regular sized tampons a day. Opposed to my usual periods having to change a regular tampon every hour or two. Also no usual cramps or back pain, no blood clots that I usually experience. in a lot of ways it&#39;s the easiest period I&#39;ve ever had except for the fact that it is on day 27. I&#39;m very tired all the time which is usual when on my period but not for 27 days.

                                                Interrupted menstrual cycle- unusual hormonal changes not caused by pregnancy, menopause, other health conditions or stressors. First day of preceding period to first day of first period after vaccination was 50 days (patient?s average cycle lasts 28-32 days). Pre-menstrual symptoms leading up to first period after vaccination such as fatigue, body aches, breast tenderness, and mood swings were more intense and lasted for longer. Chose to ?wait and see;? period eventually started on it?s own, albeit much heavier than on average.   I am unsure how else to report this information, so please forgive me if this is inappropriate: I contracted COVID-19 sometime in mid-January of 2021 and spent the last two weeks of the month quarantining at home. The illness itself was mild, the kind that during a typical cold and flu season you might call ?the sniffles? and carry on with normal activities. However, a similar, extended portion of time between the period before contracting COVID-19 and the one after occurred.  Therefore, I am not filling this report to suggest a link between the Moderna vaccine and a ?late? period, but rather I?m reporting to suggest there may be a link between either COVID-19 or it?s affects on the immune system and a ?late? period. Other people who menstruate have mentioned similar effects via social media, so I know that I?m not the only one, even if this information is only anecdotal. I realize that COVID-19 and the vaccines against it are still very new to the medical world, but I feel that this is a topic worthy of further research and scrutiny.

                                                10 minutes after the injection my right arm was very heavy and tingle-y and my thumb throbbed. Almost 5 hours later, the sharp pain in my right arm has only intensified, though mostly concentrated about the injection site.  3.5 hours after the injection I felt a sharp pain radiate through my right hip to my inner right pelvic area. This sharp pain began pulsating, localized to the right inner pelvic area, nearly 6 times over the next 5 minutes and then dissipated. This same sensation was repeated about 1.5 hours later. That was when I decided to report my reaction thus far to the Moderna dose #1 COVID-19 vaccination.

                                                I got my 2nd Moderna shot on 4/22/2021 and had unexplained spotting on 5/17/2021, about a week before I would later start my period.  I saw my gynecologist and had a transvaginal ultrasound done and did not find anything concerning.  My gynecologist believes menstrual irregularities is the result of my body falling ill after the 2nd Moderna shot. About 12 hours after the 2nd Moderna shot, I developed chills and a fever of 102.7 F.  The fever lasted approx. 24 hours from onset.  I took a Tylenol which helped (otherwise, the fever and chills could have been worse/longer).  I also had headaches on and off until approx. 3rd day after the shot.  The injection site was also swollen, blue/purple, and itchy (with symptoms peaking about 5 days after the shot).

                                                I was experiencing what I understand to be one of the more common side effects: pain at injection site. This pain kind of traveled to other parts of my arm and eventually my arm pit. I noticed the pain travelling around the date of 1/2/2021, and by 1/6/2021 it getting more intense. As I was trying to massage out the soreness, I noticed a palpable, painful lump in my right breast. I did not immediately recognize it as a swollen lymph node at that time, but after several Dr exams, and the lump and pain decreasing, I believe that is what was happening. I do still have the lump, and it is tender, so I am currently monitoring it.

The rash continued to spread and almost completely wrapped around the entire arm. She also experienced heavy vaginal bleeding, and was not due to begin cycle. Last cycle ended 1/5 and bleeding began on 1/23, and she also experienced abdominal pain on 1/25. When rash was at its worst, she was extremely fatigued.

Later around 5pm I started to experience full body aches akin to the flu. Then I had chills and a mild fever of 100 and a headache. This lasted through the night. I slept until 11am today the 11th and awoke with only a headache. Then around 8pm I began experiencing menstrual cramps and breast tenderness despite my cycle (bleeding) ending 5 days ago. I usually do not experience menstrual cramps. This has been happening for the last 2 hours. It?s now 10pm

This was my first pregnancy and I had no complications up to that point. On 2/2/21 I began experiencing menstrual type cramps, which continued for a few days. On 2/5/21, my OBGYN suggested I be examined in Labor and Delivery, where it was determined I was in pre-term labor. Contractions were temporarily stopped, however my water broke on 2/7/21 and it was suggested that I be induced. I was induced on a later date at 34w1d pregnant and delivered my son, who weighed in at 4lbs. 15oz.

                                                1: the day after my first covid shot, in the evening, my heart rate jumped from around 70 to around 130 instantly when walking up the stairs in my house. This happened twice that evening and has never happened before. My pulse was pounding in my head and it took about 1-2 minutes of slow breathing to calm my heart rate again. I wore my heart rate monitor the rest of the evening and overnight, with no other adverse effects. Stairs had no impact on me the next day. I had also exercised that morning, and while my heart rate was higher than normal with that type of workout, I didn?t think anything of it at the time and didn?t have the pounding head issue.  Due to this issue, I?m a bit nervous about the second shot in the series.   2: I started my period the morning I got the shot; day 4 and 5 of my period were significantly heavier flow than normal. Day 4 also included cramps and nausea throughout the entire day, which is not normal for me.

                                                In the early afternoon of 3/25 I noticed pain in my breast while nursing my baby. After the feeding I could feel a hard lump on the underside of my breast that was tender to the touch and warm. I used an ice pack on the area, took curcumin and grapefruit seed extract, and nursed again on our regular schedule. The clog was resolved after the next feeding and after taking the supplements and using ice. Clogged ducts have happened to me frequently in the last ten months of nursing. I don?t know if this was related to the vaccine, but I figured I would report it in case it became a pattern in nursing mothers.

Then noticed that I had a significant delay in my menstrual cycle that was very abnormal for me. I was suppose to start my regular cycle 6 days after vaccination.  I am very regular and my menses were delayed by two weeks. In addition,  when it came back there was a change in my flow (very short duration). I am concerned about possible implications of the vaccine regarding my menses.

                                                I have a history of heavy periods which resulted in the need for an ablation in October 2018. Since the ablation my periods have been much more manageable. I got my period 13 days after receiving the shot and it started out much heavier than normal, by the second day I was bleeding extremely heavily, soaking an overnight pad in less than 2 hours with bright red blood and passing clots the size of dimes and pennies. Day 3 has started out the same as day 2. Prior to my period starting my back hurt and I had much worse than normal abdominal cramps. Nothing in my life has changed besides the vaccine, I am certain there is a connection between the two. I am not sure how long this will last, I was instructed to go ahead an report the adverse event.

I went to the ER and they could not identify the reason for the vaginal bleeding. I was discharged the same night. It reoccurred three days after when I had been on a walk. It did not happen again and I did not have any problems after the second shot. The baby seems to be fine. Due Date -09/17/2021 Pregnancy-First

The bleeding lasted 12 days total.

I did not have a visible rash, but my dermatologist said it was a histamine reaction. I was intensely itchy for three days and then it went away  after five days. I had a miscarriage five weeks after the second dose which was a week after the itch started. I saw my OBGYN, PCP ER , Gastroenterologist and Dermatologist.

                                                I got the moderna vaccine on 02/23/2021 1st dose. My LMP was 02/03/2021. On 3/5/2021, I took a pregnancy test due to nausea and it was positive. I was super concerned due to getting the covid vaccine around the time of ovulation and so I contacted my FNP  and started getting serial Hcgs due to right side pelvic pain which was confirmed to be a hemorrhagic corpus luteal cyst.  A couple of weeks later, My 4th Pregnancy was confirmed via trans vaginal ultrasound  with a strong heart beat on 03/30/2021 and a gestational age of 7 weeks exactly and  a due date of 11/16/2021.   I decided not to get the 2nd dose of the vaccination due to concerns of miscarrying in the first trimester and limited studies on covid vaccine and it?s safety despite having 3 healthy children and zero miscarriages in the past.  On to my next appt on 04/19/2021, the fetus should alreayd measure at 10 weeks. Without having any abdominal pain, bleeding, or spotting, the baby stopped growing and measured at 7 weeks and 5 days with no heartbeat. Again, I had no symptoms of miscarrying at all.  We decided for a d&amp;c and sent the fetal tissue for genetic testing. My d&amp;c was performed on 04/22/2021 at 12pm.  We are currently waiting for genetic testing results at this time.

I have never missed my period with the expedition of the pregnancies. I&#39;m never late on my period  but sometimes am early. This is not typical for me and I am meticulous on charting my menstrual cycles.

By Friday between 3-4pm I had completely stopped bleeding. I continued up until present day with no menstruation bleeding or spotting at all. I have taken pregnancy test on Monday, 4/26 that was negative. This is VERY unusual for me and my monthly cycle. I track every symptom, every sign, etc. leading up to my cycle each month. I know exactly when my body ovulates and when my body will start the cycle over again. This has never happened before.

                                                For the next three days, I got pretty sick. Low grade fever - around 100. If I took a Tylenol it would go away for a little bit but then come back. Pain in my arm. Nausea and major, major, major migraines. I had migraines consistently - couldn&#39;t move off my couch. Those symptoms mostly went away after the third day.  I saw my OB/GYN this week and they said that my fetus stopped growing about three weeks ago.  Pregnancy history - my third pregnancy; none have gone to full-term. I have had a miscarriage before that was very similar to this one.  Estimated date of delivery - December 2, 2021. I have recovered from the immediate side effects. I get the fetus removed next week.

                                                Customer experienced numbness that started about a half-hour when she arrived home. Then 5-6 days later, she felt an enlarged lymph node by left axillary and pain in that area. She felt more painful at night. Also, if she ate spicy food, more numbness. When she stopped, numbness left (or numbness lessened). She missed her period for 1 month. She was suppose to get her period around her vaccine day, but she still did not receive her period. She thought she was pregnant, and checked with her doctor&#39;s office. Not pregnant.

Through the area of ??the kidneys and the pelvis. The intense pain lasted about midnight, I took a pill of TYLENOL for pain and to be able to sleep, which helped me a bit but the next day the body and back pain persisted ... what hurt the most was my lower back and I could not bear to lie down in any way so I remained semi-lying or sitting in bed because when I lay down my back bothered me. I took natural teas to help me and I took water and electrolytes to feel better. gradually by the end of the second day my pain symptoms were decreasing. The dizziness in the head remained very persistent on the 2nd day. On the third day I felt a relief from my muscle pain but the discomfort or dizziness of the head was still there, it was not as strong as the last days, but when moving my head from side to side or sitting or standing up it was like a vertigo or a unstable that I felt was there. By the 4th day I felt better almost no symptoms just like body sweat ... like hot flashes.

After my second dose, I noticed I had the same PMS but each symptom felt much more intense and lasted for 3-4 days. The length of days of my cycle was not affected and it started when expected.

                                                Menstrual cycle started after the first dose of Moderna. Continued through the entire next month (daily). Received the second dose and the cycle continued daily with heavy bleeding and enormous blood clots. Lasted 10 weeks. Stopped for 3 weeks. Started again and currently on day 16 of continuous menstrual cycle.  Blood clots were as large as my palm with excessive cramping occurring. Using tampons made the clot presence and intensity worse too. Fainted twice in my bathroom after passing blood clots. Sometimes the blood clots fall into the toilet and sound like marbles hitting the water. The largest blood clot had smooth borders, could not be pulled apart, and was the size of my palm.

                                                Within 12 hours of receiving the second vaccine, I experienced flu-like symptoms (nausea, headache, body aches). They dissipated somewhat with Tylenol, but lasted roughly 48 hours. Additionally, since the first Moderna shot, I have had breakthrough menstrual bleeding. This is unusual given that I am taking oral birth control. The bleeding began roughly 10 days after the first shot, then I had a heavy menstrual cycle, and then the breakthrough bleeding began again roughly 10 days after my second shot. I called my OB/GYN about this, but they said their data was too limited to advise me on how long this is expected to last.

                                                I believe I was very early on in my pregnancy (as in, implantation or first week after conception) when I received the second dose of the vaccine. EDD was January 9th, 2022. I had brown spotting every day for the duration of my pregnancy, obviously concerning and something I paid attention to (though not altogether unusual in early pregnancy). I ended up miscarrying naturally at 6 weeks. I am strongly in favor and appreciative of this vaccine and would be surprised if there was a direct link, but I do know there is a growing conversation about its impact on women&#39;s menstrual cycles. I wanted to submit my experience just in case it was in fact a trend for other trying-to-conceive or early pregnant females.

I have recorded my periods over the past year because of my POTS. I had my period on April 2nd and it ended on the 10th. Four days after the shot, I had the shot on April 26th, I got my period for a 2nd time 19 days after my period just ended. The 2nd period ended on May 6th. I have yet to recieve my period. Medication, stress levels and diet haven&#39;t changed for me so those weren&#39;t the trigger.

The timing has also been irregular and unpredictable each month since. Longer PMS windows as well.

Menstruation time period is normal (5-7 days), breast tenderness/enlargement worse than before. Heavy days have increased. Cramps will wake me up in the middle of the night. Nausea and hot flashes also occur now. Cannot exercise/run during cycle due to cramps becoming so severe I&#39;m doubled over in pain until it subsides. Ibuprofen continues to help, though it feels like I take more than usual. This will be cycle number 4 post Moderna vaccine where periods have been noticeably different than before.

I am extremely regular and the only times I?ve ever been a week late were when I was pregnant. I knew I was not pregnant as I have my tubes tied. So it started late, then I bled for 2 weeks, which has never happened in my entire life. If it didn?t stop bleeding, I was going to make an appointment with my Gyno. I had no life changes, diet changes, or added life stressors during this time, so the only thing I can deduce is that the period changes were caused by the vaccine.  It has seemed to end, but I don?t know when my next period will be, or how long it?s going to last. I?ll have to wait and see next month.

GI issues persisted for the next 3 weeks and on Thursday evening, 2/25/2021 at about 6:30 pm. I was sitting on floor with children and almost passed out. I felt very faint, dizzy, and instantly started chilling. I had a fever of 102.8 and could not get warm. My husband was going to call paramedics, but I encouraged him not to. Discovered my right breast was red and inflamed/ swollen as well as all of my lymph nodes in my right arm pit. I could not reach my right arm forward. I noticed around 12:06 AM after not being able to get warm or break fever. I messaged my primary care clinic when I noticed the breast swelling, redness, pain, and lymph node swelling. I continually felt like I was going to faint/pass out and was very dizzy all night long. I was also extremely fatigued. The did a telemedicine appointment the next morning and diagnosed me with mastitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I am a breastfeeding mother and all of these symptoms came on suddenly and severely on the same side that I got the vaccine shot. I have been breastfeeding for over 7 months and my supply has been dwindling to nothing so I have no problems with engorgement or blocked milk ducts. Before this baby I had just got done breastfeeding a baby for 11 months with no issues of the like.

I believe I got it then bc I wrote on Feb 14 exactly 2 weeks after seeing our factory partners. My head felt shaken like astigmatism in my brain. So haven&#39;t had a real period for a year and then after the vaccine worst cramps in my life. Then I have stomach hurting and GI issues every hour or so. Lastly my eyes have been red at night a lot and I would keep getting headaches from time to time for no reason and I&#39;m not a headache person.

                                                I had an instant reaction. With in mins of sitting after vaccine. I starting feeling hot, and very itchy on my right arm (site). I then noticed I was very red, and  itching more and more, around the same time. The nurse had looked over at me that gave vaccine and said you look very red and &#34;are those hives&#34; I had hives on my chest, arms, back, butt, and you could see the red rash/hives visually spreading. Roof of mouth also was itchy. They gave me 2 benadryl and water, asked me to stay and be observed for a half hour or so. I started feeling relief soon after benadryl. But, not full relief until much later that night. I also Had very painful and swollen lymph nodes at injection site, through my right breast and neck. for 3 wks or more. they might still be slightly swollen, but no more pain. Very scary. I had Covid back in November, I had symptoms of not being able to control my body temp since./ After I received vaccine, I aslo developed covid toes for a few wks and now my feet get very cold and purple almost black from just the slightest cold.

                                                The day of the shot I had some pain on my right side body, right jaw... on Wednesday I was just very tired and slept a lot. Thursday morning I woke with pain in my hips and Pelvis, and around 9am pelvic pain started that felt as sever as the pain I felt giving birth (20 months ago). Thurs/Friday and today (Saturday) it?s been so painful I?ve had a hard time walking, laughing, coughing and caring for my toddler has been immensely challenging. My period began Friday afternoon, a heavier flow than usual. To be clear I have VERY mild periods and am a very healthy young woman. This is unlike anything I?ve ever experienced and the only thing that is different was receiving the vaccine and upon further research it seems MANY women of menstruating age have been experiencing abnormal periods. Today I am still in so much pain it?s debilitating however it is less sever than yesterday (Friday) and the fatigue also continues even after sleeping 10 hours last night.

I take aleve a day before my period which helps with my cramps.  My last period started April 9th and I am still on my period today April 15th. I had heavy bleeding and blood clots the size of quarters for the first 5 days. The aleve didn?t seem to help and my pain level was at a 10, I would pass out from the pain. My period usually last 4 days and I am on day 7 and still bleeding, but not experiencing any cramps. I?ve read that Covid effects the blood clotting process and also read other women are experiencing heavier menstrual cycles after their covid shot. I also read that moderna didn?t study any side effects related to the menstrual cycle.  I have an appointment today (April 15th) to get my second shot. I am not sure if I should get the second shot, due to the amount of clots I had.

All genetic testing on mom and additional health screens of baby were normal. On 4/25/21, lost mucus plug in the AM at 17 weeks pregnant with no other issues, concerns, abnormalities, etc. At 3:50AM on 4/27/21, ruptured membrane/water broke. Hospital testing confirmed 100% break of amniotic fluid with nothing left to sustain baby who had normal heartbeat and was still alive - measuring on target. Induced at 11:20pm on the 27th and delivered at 5:30am on 4/28/21 at 17 weeks and 3 days a baby boy measuring 8.25 inches and 5.6 ounces.   No placental infection or abnormalities. Pathology noted an abruption hematoma that could have resulted from induced labor. No trauma, blood work, or other explanations for early rupture of what was a perfectly healthy and growing baby.

                                                On 3/4/21, I was informed that I was pregnant with my 4th child. On 4/12/21, I was scheduled for my 1st dose of the Moderna as well as having a first trimester NCIT testing being done. At that exam, my provider was able to find a fetal heart rate (177), he was dated to be approximately 12 weeks and 6 days, and there were no concerns at that time regarding physical abnormalities or brain deformities. Additionally, I was sent out for bloodwork to rule out Trisomies and determined gender of the baby. The results of that lab work came back as negative and we were expecting our first son October 19, 2021. However, yesterday, 5/4/21, I attended my monthly prenatal appointment and the provider informed me that she could not find a heartbeat. She used a doppler scanner and then the in office ultrasound machine; neither of which detected a heartbeat. I was sent out to Radiology for a formal scan to refute or affirm the findings. Sadly, the results came back that I had lost my child. There was no heartbeat found and the results showed that my child stopped growing and remained 12 weeks in size. I am scheduled to have my pregnancy evacuated Friday, 5/7/21 at 1040a. While I am aware that miscarriage in 1 in 4 women, I cannot in good faith say that the vaccine may have contributed to my pregnancy loss. The only change in my routine was the addition of the vaccine. I am hopeful that this pain will not be felt by others and can be researched further to ensure fertility loss or future pregnancy loss isnt a norm following this vaccine.   Additionally, I have had 3 full term, healthy pregnancies prior to this miscarriage. None of these pregnancies had complications and the children were birthed without issue.

                                                With in seconds of receiving the vaccine I became really dizzy and light headed, my heart also began to race and my whole body felt really warm. The doctor was really nice and let me lay down and wait the suggested 30 minutes.  I also felt like I was stoned for 3 weeks after receiving the first dose. The best way to describe it would be a sense of tiredness/ fog like feeling with on and off feeling of vertigo whenever I moved my head to the right.  The vaccine also messed with my menstrual cycle. My period came 10 days early and I spotted 3 days prior to it actually starting with is abnormal for me. I also became very dehydrated, I drink more than 80 ounces of water day day so this was also a cause of concern. My lips became discolored, I had patched of red spots on my upper lips which I associated to the vaccine. I went to the doctor and they assured me that it wasn&#39;t due to the vaccine and brushed off the above mentioned. They said I may have an active case of COVID and they tested me. The results came back negative. Along with these symptoms I also experienced headaches and chills and a sore throat with in the first 3 days of receiving the vaccine, which was expected. The reason I&#39;m filing this report is because I feel I have no support from my doctor and these are the typical symptoms after receiving the vaccine. Hopefully you will find this information useful in your research.  And for the record I still don&#39;t feel normal.

                                                1 Week after my 2nd dose I developed a rash on my lower right leg. It became very itchy and red. I was prescribed a topical cream to use. Over the course of the next 4 weeks the rash got bigger and spread to the left lower leg.  I was prescribed different topical creams, had a Kenalog injection but nothing was working. The itch was temporarily relived by the Kenalog injection.  I ended up getting a punch biopsy and it was determined that I had eczema in parts of my leg. I was referred to a dermatologist and was also told I had hives as well and was put on a 2 week antihistamine regimen.   Also, 1 week after my 2nd dose my mentral cycle lasted 36 days and my period was about 7 days long. This continued for 2 months. My cycles usually are 24-27 days and my period is only usually 4 days, maybe 5 max.

On the evening of the second day I began severe diahrea and still have it on the third day. I have been nauseous since the evening of the first day. Pain in the injection site was minimal and nearly gone on the third day. I did experience some numbness in my arm immediately after the injection.

                                                Second shot was received on 4/30/2021. My very regular and predictable period was due on 5/7/2021. The shot delayed my period by 1 week and it started on 5/14/2021. 5 pregnancy tests were taken in that week and all were negative. I track and chart my cycle closely because of my endometriosis so I&#39;m able to plan my life around my debilitating symptoms. I did have the typical feeling really bad and stuck in bed the day after the vaccine. However, the day after that, 2 days after the shot, my typically debilitating premenstrual symptoms were stopped and I felt great, better than I have in a long time. Until the day before my period started on 5/13/2021 when I got a migraine (not typical for me) The migraine continued for 2 days. I was bed bound for those 2 days between the period pain and the migraine. The 3rd day and the last day of the period I felt much better and was able to resume regular activities. My period typically last for 5 days and is usually very heavy in the first 2-3 days. This period only lasted 3 days and was much lighter flow than is normal for me.

Does one on 4/12/2021 caused a period 10 days after administration when the normal cycle should if I stayed on track should have been 20 days later instead.  Dose 2 also caused an abnormal/early period 10 days after administration when the normal cycle track should have been 26 days after administration.  I do not typically have issues with my menstrual cycle, in fact, they are usually on time within 1 day and have been my entire life.  I do not take birth control or have any other issue that I am aware of that would cause this.

I was extremely weak. after I recovered from the two days of being miserable, my neck got really swollen and sore. I had mild soreness in my right arm at the injection site as well, but it wasn&#39;t as sore as the first shot. I drank a ton of water and took the tylenol muscle soreness medicine.  In addition to soreness on my left arm (injection site) from the first shot, my period also got heavier and I have spotting in between.

Patient was pregnant so was very concerned and went to the hospital.  Unsure how far along she was but she wanted us to know she had a miscarriage.  We are unaware if this is linked to the vaccination but patient is stating that&#39;s the only thing that has changed since her three previous pregnancies that had no issues whatsoever. Reporting this since she called the pharmacy so we were aware and since we are not aware if the hospital filed this report.

                                                I am still dealing with severely debilitating back pain, that is made 100x worse when I have my period.  This started after my boyfriend and I had intercourse for the first time after he received the Moderna vaccine for fear of losing his job and his employer was pressuring every one to get the experimental vaccine.   I did not receive the vaccine however my report is based on the following reasoning:  on april 27th 2021 he received the vaccine on may 4th we had intercourse for the first time since he has the vaccine. immediately after intercourse I could feel a burning stinging pain in my uterus/vaginal area that slowly started to radiate from the base of my tail bone to the base of my neck it feels like a burning sensation.   it is made 100 x worse when i have my period. my doctor has prescribed me physical therapy exercises which do some what dull the pain, but it back to the same level the next day. sitting hurts i can feel it all the time it hurts to hold objects such as my cell phone when walking from the weight  prior to this i was 100% healthy.  I am reporting this based on the following information:   1.Ex Pfizer lead scientist said that: &#34; The vaccinations are expected to produce antibodies against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. However, spike proteins also contain syncytin-homologous proteins, which are essential for the formation of the placenta in mammals such as humans. It must be absolutely ruled out that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could trigger an immune reaction against syncytin-1, as otherwise infertility of indefinite duration could result in vaccinated women.&#34;    In addition, another mRNA vaccine technology founder, has also stated that the spike proteins can be shed via bodily fluids:    &#34;The vaccinated &#34;shed&#34; tiny amounts of spike protein (in urine, etc.)&#34;   As well as this article that says that MRNA is transmissable via semen:   &#34;The existence of a complex population of mRNA in human sperm is well documented but their role is not yet elucidated.&#34;   In addition, there have been several females who have come forward from the vaccine trials who have had severe neurological issues from receiving the vaccine.

                                                I received the COVID-19 Moderna second dose vaccine on May 5, 2021, at around 1 pm. The night after the vaccine, I had the typical side effects from the vaccine, which are chills, arm pain, severe fatigue, headache, slight fever. By the second day, chills were subsiding but I still feel very fatigued until the afternoon. Then by the third day, which was May 7, 2021, at around 2 am, I started feeling some chest tightness, which at first I associated with back pain.  However, as the day progresses, I started feeling short of breath, on and off chest pain, and palpitations. I decided to go to the ED around 10:15 pm, due to shortness of breath, and chest pain was more pronounced. Upon my arrival in the ED, I was tachycardic at 110. I was triaged and the ED physician ordered did blood work including D-Dimer, EKG. EKG reveals sinus tachycardia. The blood work reveals an elevated D-Dimer which was 1.06. And due to elevated dimer, the physician ordered a CT scan chest which was negative for PE. Since I was still having some shortness of breath and chest pain, I was admitted as observation, for telemetry monitoring and repeat EKG. The following day, I was discharged since the chest pain was resolving. However, I continued to have palpitations for at least a week after the vaccination. At that time, the ED physicians were not sure if my symptoms and elevated dimer were related to the vaccination. I followed up with a cardiologist and my PCP a few days after the hospitalization. I followed up with the cardiologists because of my history of pulmonary hypertension 5 years ago which I believe was resolved, however, it was a concern for the ED physician, because at the time they were not sure of what is the cause of my symptoms. During my visit with the cardiologists, he believed that my elevated dimer was due to the vaccination (possibly due to the inflammatory response), as well as the symptoms I have which was pericardial pain. I did my echo last week, and I will need to do another blood test this week, to check my dimer, and cardiac enzymes.   And now, since I had the vaccination, I have not had my period for 18 days, which is very uncommon to me. I had my period a few days after the vaccine. All my pregnancy tests are negative. So I am scheduled to follow up with my OB-GYN. I believe that my delayed period is also related to the vaccine, but of course, I cannot conclude that until I see my physician and conduct all the tests needed.

Skipped my expected May period altogether. Definitely a result of the vaccine--I&#39;ve never fully skipped a period before outside of pregnancy (at most up to 2 weeks late). Just wanted to report it as FYI, since it doesn&#39;t seem to be being widely reported as something women can be prepared to expect. No need to follow up with me regarding results of any investigation, just adding my data point to the body of evidence.

This progressed to two open wounds where sutures began to surface and had to be removed. After my second dose of the Moderna vaccine I developed another area on my right areola scar line that opened up to reveal another suture that required removal.

I also started to have vaginal bleeding when I wasn?t due to have a period. The rash got progressively worse, to spread all over torso back and front.  Vaginal bleeding also continued to worsen. Went to ER to have labs checked, was told it looked like Pityriasis rosea- and that all lab values and clotting factors were normal. Sent home with prescription for Atarax if needed. Was told it would be self limiting but if worsened to come back.

Took OTC Tylenol (2) po and had no signs of relief. Pain , swelling, and skin redness lasted for 3 days. On February 10th, 2021 I had a positive pregnancy test (confirmed by bloodwork and urine) which indicated I was 6-7 weeks pregnant and had a miscarriage on March 2021, after giving live births 3 prior times. The cause of the miscarriage is unknown.  I also developed a blood clot on the arm that was inserted for an IV. I have no family history or personal history of needing blood thinners.

The estimated date of delivery would have been November 20, 2021.

                                                I had never been pregnant before and have been undergoing fertility treatments for about two and a half years (6 failed IUIs followed by 2 failed frozen embryo transfers via IVF).  I had my third frozen embryo transfer on 3/12, almost exactly the same time Alaska opened vaccine availability to anyone over the age of 16.  Our doctor?s advice along with everything we found online showed not much was known about the vaccine, but there was no firm reason to think there would be a problem with getting it in early pregnancy.  We also knew that being pregnant would mean higher likelihood of having severe symptoms if I got Covid-19, so I signed up for and was administered the first Moderna vaccine on the day of my first pregnancy test. 3/22 my beta HcG level came back at 72, confirming pregnancy.  As is standard, I was asked to come back three days later to confirm appropriate growth in those numbers.  By Thursday, March 25th my HcG level had fallen to 17, and by Monday, March 29th that level was less than 3. It?s impossible to know if the vaccine played a role in the early miscarriage, but I wanted to provide the data in case there are any trends or information can be learned from my experience.

The fetus was sent to pathology and I was informed that at 12 weeks when I miscarried that the baby had termed at 9 weeks which was the time of my first vaccine injection.

By Day 9, the rash was reduced in size. The rash is still red, raised and now itchy. Additional possible adverse event: mensuration started 4 days earlier than a normal cycle. As both possible side effects/adverse reactions are still ongoing, no outcome can be reported at this time.

                                                Sore arm at injection site for 2 days post vaccine. Large red, raised rash extending from the upper right arm (injection arm) down to the elbow, wrapping around the outer part of the arm appeared on Day 8 (4/13/21) at approximately 1845. By 0700 on 4/14/21 the rash was about 1/4 of the size, focused closely around the injection site. The rash was still raised, red and now itchy.   An additional and perhaps related adverse event was the start of menstruation approximately 3-4 days before the normal start date.   As both of these reactions are still on going, I can not report the outcome.

I will be contacting my regular family physician when they open to follow up.

Irregular menstrual cycle - period started on 3/19/2021, after only a 23 day cycle; next period started on 4/11/2021, after another 23 day cycle. Both periods were very early for me, more painful, but lighter flow. They also lasted a couple of days longer than normal.

Then 2-3 days later I began having nausea, and lack of appetite and began spotting (as if my period was beginning).  Light pink to red discharge that went away after 3 days.  My period was not due until the 19th of this month.  I developed a small headache that lasted approximately 12 days coming and going (rarely have headaches in past).  My hands have been achy like I have arthritis (which I&#39;ve never experienced this).  Also, diarrhea and disturbed sleep pattern.  My period is now late.  Its 4.23 and no symptoms of period or premenstrual syndrome.

I have a chronic GERD cough, but I cough a lot more than normal. Also, I was on my period and it made my normal cramps and low back pain much much worse. My entire lower body was in extreme pain. I usually have little to no cramps and my uterus pain was excruciating.

I got the injection of the second dose on 4/15/21 around 11 am and began bleeding and cramping due to miscarriage about 27 hours later. Miscarriage confirmed by OBGYN on monday 4/19/21.  I am blood type o-negative.  Will be tested for blood clotting disorder as possible cause of early pregnancy loss.  I should also state that I had a pretty severe case of &#34;moderna arm&#34; within just a few hours of the vaccination, maybe 4 hours, with approx 70% of my upper arm covered in deep red, hot, raised, swollen, and itchy skin that lasted several days.  I also got a fever of approx 101 degrees F about 20 hours after the vaccination.

                                                Estimated due date of pregnancy was november 2021. We experienced a miscarriage during the vaccine symptoms of the first shot. The second dose of vaccine was way worse than the first. I got a sore arm, aches, a headache, nausea, a fever, chills, pins and needles feelings in my hands and feet, heartburn, and dizziness. I kept feeling like I might throw up and I developed a great big rash on my arm again, called covid arm. I spent the entire day on the couch next to a bucket because if I got up, I was too light headed and nauseated to do anything. It lasted 24 hours or so. By day 3 after the shot, I felt okay other than soreness, a headache, and a big itchy rash at the injection site. We are concerned about the miscarriage but don&#39;t know if it was or wasn&#39;t related to the vaccine. I did have a big reaction and we wonder if my immune system gearing up targeted the very early fetus as an intruder. We are deeply saddened by our loss.

                                                I got my period when I should not have. I was on Day 12 of my cycle, which is very regular, and got my period again for the second time in two weeks. I started spotting the morning after getting ym vaccine and was bleeding heavily by the next day. My period lasted five full days and was heavy on each day.   When I received my second shot I also got my period right away, however, this was 28 days after the first shot so it as not as alarming.

                                                I am a nursing mother and ended up with an inflamed, painful red breast on the side I received the shot several hours later. Knowing that covid-19 vaccine has not been tested on nursing mothers, I wanted to report side effects as I have noticed nursing peers also stating similar things. I believe this should warrant further data collection so nursing mothers can adequately prepare for this side effect. I had two nights of chills and fever and swollen breast with bruising. Took ibuprofen as well as natural mastitis remedy: sunflower lethicin.  Pain has subsided and swelling has reduced.

I initially thought it was a carpal tunnel injury that occurred during my move, but then realized that it was most likely a vaccine injection related side effect.  The tingling/numbing sensation comes and goes.  It was at its worst about midway between my two Moderna shots.   I had the second shot on my right arm on 5/14/21, and have recently started experiencing some tingling/numbness in my right hand as well.  (2 of 2) My period came early after the first vaccine shot on 4/16/21.  It did not feel like a typical period.  Based on my online research, I think it is possible that the vaccine caused &#34;the womb lining to shed, and lead to spotting or earlier periods.&#34;  After the second vaccine dose/shot on 5/14/21, my period is quite late (currently, by about a week).

                                                The same day right after the vaccination I felt weird but I left the mall after the 15 minute period and after I went home i vommitted and had back pains and just couldn&#39;t sleep at all. At last I took Advil because I had chills. My temperature at that time was 103 I felt tired and for the next 36 hours my temperature was between 99-100 and I was in the bed the whole time I took Advil and Tylenol. I had an appointment with my doctor just to make sure everything is okay I couldn&#39;t even go. I had diareeha for the longest time and then I had nausea and it went through for the longest time and I still have most of the symptoms my stomach hurts and I have headaches constantly. My blood tests are normal but i still can&#39;t past the symptoms and my doctor says it can be related to the vaccination. On April 12 I had my periods but it was not that I just understand what that was it was really bad the blood was all over my body I went to the doctor and still nothing. I went to the emergency room for that and they gave me some medications to stop the blood but it didn&#39;t help. my doctor did a dnd procedure because of the bleeding after the procedure I got the results and my tissue was of a pregnancy and I had a miscarriage and I didn&#39;t even know.

According to the patient, her menstrual cycle is very precise and she should have started on Saturday, June 6/12/2021.  She has only spotted the last three days and that is very unusual for her.  She also reports she is sexual active and not on any birth control.  She was planning on calling her OB, after speaking with me because she was concerned that she may also be pregnant.  Unknown the result of that conversation.

                                                I had my second dose of the Covid19 vaccine on March 24, 2021. I didn&#39;t know at the time that I was pregnant, it was very early. Received a positive confirmation on April 14, 2021. At this time I was about 6 weeks along. Due date was estimated for the beginning to mid- December.  On May 7th I had my first appointment with an OB, at that time she was unable to find a heartbeat. HCG quants were checked and I was sent for a more extensive ultrasound on May 11. Miscarriage was confirmed that day. Scheduled a D&amp;C for May 24th, on the 21st I spiked a fever and was exhibiting signs on sepsis. That evening an emergent D&amp;C was performed. Seemed to be on the mend the next morning and was sent home with oral antibiotics. On the 25th I spiked another fever and was advised by my physician to get to the emergency room. Spent the next three nights in the hospital with IV antibiotics. Came home with a couple different oral antibiotics (Flagyl and Clindamycin)  for the next 2 weeks. This seemed to cover the infection.

She did not think she was pregnant. On Thursday 1-7-2021 around 4 AM she started experiencing severe abdominal pain. She did not go to work that day but did go in on Friday 1-8-2021. On Saturday 1-9-2021 she woke up with significant vaginal bleeding. On Monday 1-11-2021 she went to the OB/GYN and there she had a positive pregnancy test. The diagnosis of miscarriage was made at that time. A couple of days later, a repeat pregnancy test resulted in a negative reading.

I was due for my menstruation cycle but when it came, I began to bleed heavily. This is not a norm for me - my periods are usually light with spotting at the beginning of my cycle. It was so heavy when it began on Friday that I bled through my pants. For the rest of the day, Saturday and the beginning of Sunday my blood flow was very heavy and I was constantly changing pads. I was going to contact my GYN doctor but then my flow slowed down later in the day Sunday thankfully. I just wanted to let your office know just in case other woman are reporting the same issue. Thank you.

Based on lab trends over the next 9 months, medication was weaned down and after labs on 12/28/20 (below), I was taken off medication as my physician felt that this condition was resolved .  I received my first COVID vaccination on 12/31/20.  Over the next month, I felt progressively more tired.  On 1/25/21 @noon I started having symptoms of hypotension unrelated to dehydration. These symptoms were intermittently persistent for the next  2 weeks.  On 1/27/21 @0400 I started having profuse uterine bleeding (menorrhagia) which resulted in a call to the MD later that day who recommended high dose ibuprofen and rest.  I omitted AM ibuprofen dose on 1/29/21 and received the second COVID vaccine on 1/29/21.  Repeat thyroid labs were drawn on 2/8/21 (below) and were  completely unexpected given previous lab trends.  My physician placed me back on medication and I will get my labs drawn again in a month.  Acknowledge that there isn&#39;t data with the COVID vaccine and autoimmune conditions; however, I am wondering if the vaccine induced the TPO antibodies  along with the COVID antibodies.  This may be something to look more into for other autoimmune disorders as well as more patients are vaccinated.

It has also been much heavier than normal with unusual cramping in both my lower abdomen and lower back, much like my contractions I had with my first child during childbirth.

                                                Early menstruation approximately 10 days early. Due to having PCOS, I have never had an early period in life, only &#34;regular&#34; or very late, usually skipping multiple months at a time. Also it is very heavy and painful compared to my regular period. I am also feeling dizzy.

                                                The Moderna vaccine induced my menstruation. I am currently breastfeeding and had not been menstruating since becoming pregnant in January 2019. I had a baby since then and due to nursing on demand my period had not returned. Less than 24 hours after getting vaccinated I woke up to a moderate menstrual flow, bright red blood. I am still menstruating and experiencing mild cramping and bloatedness in my abdominal area. There was no prior indication this would happen before the vaccine. I had not even spotted before. My cycle has historically been very regular and I am certain the vaccine had something to do with stimulating my endocrine system and thus causing my menstruation.

                                                At day 13 after the shot, I noticed that my left breast was swollen, had pitted skin like an orange, was red, and had a large ridge through it. I am nursing and though possibly I had an infection, but never developed severe pain or fever as with mastitis. On  able to consult with a doctor on 5 March. He ordered an ultrasound of the breast to rule out any malignancies. The ultrasound found a superficial thrombophlebitis in the breast under the exact area of swelling, discoloration, and skin puckering.  After 3 weeks, the swelling has disappeared and the breast only remains slightly discolored the chorded vein is no longer able the be felt as it was previously.

I am taking an oral contraceptive and my periods are  are normal frequency, length and flow, until this last period.  The clots could fill an entire maxi pad that needed to be changed every 2 hours, for about 48 hours.  After that single clots were discharged every 2 hours for another 2 days (and still occurring as I write this).  I sent my PCP (an OBGYN) a direct message in patient portal also reporting symptoms.

                                                Increased signs of PMS, off schedule. The Nexplanon makes them mild and I don&#39;t have a period, but still get PMS-ish symptoms such as mood swings, increased arousal, sensitive breasts, increased hunger, increased tiredness. I got all of those just two days after receiving the first dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine, but they weren&#39;t due until later this month, and they were worse than usual. It&#39;s a mild thing, and has subsided, but with the J&amp;J throwing clots on some women who are likely on birth control, I thought it was worth mentioning. Thank you for your time!

Another day I woke up from sleeping on my side because my breast was sore.  I also had some menstrual cramps.

                                                On May 7, 2 Days after receiving the Moderna shot, I started to get breast tenderness, indicating an upcoming menstruel cycle, despite not being due until May 17. It is important for me to note here that my period is always on time (within a day or 2). On May 9, I began to have some cramping. When I got out of the shower on the morning of May 10, I had begun bleeding. At this point, the cramps began to worsen. Often leaving me doubled over in pain (while common for some women, this is completely abnormal for me. I normally don&#39;t have any cramping at all.) The bleeding itself is heavier than usual. I&#39;m also extremely exhausted compared to usual.

My cycle went from the 4/21-4/26. I then started another menstrual cycle on 5/2 which went until 5/7. I then started another cycle on 5/12-5/16. In the last 27 days, I have been on my period for 16 of them. I went to donate blood on 4/29 and my hemoglobin was 1.5 pts lower than usual, and I&#39;ve had two periods since then.

My next period is starting in a few days and my cramps are much heavier than they?ve been since I received the IUD.

I had three ultrasounds prior to my shot and all showed that the baby was normal and healthy. We also had normal genetic testing results with this pregnancy. We found out in 6/1/2021 that we lost the baby and based on the size of the baby when it passed, it was determined that the baby passed on 5/17/21 - the date I received my first Moderna vaccine.

I received my second dose on March 28th at 11:00am. My arm was less sore than the first time. Around 9pm I developed a fever, chills and body aches. I slept most of the next day and felt much better by the following evening. By Tuesday, March 30th I was fatigued/brain fogged but otherwise felt much better. On Saturday, April 17th I noticed three small itchy blisters on my left ribcage below my breast along with tingling on my left side. On Sunday, April 18th I did a telehealth appointment and was diagnosed with shingles. I took Valtrex for 7 days and after about 2 weeks the blisters began to heal.  My period was supposed to start on Wednesday, May 12th and usually lasts 5 days (end Sunday, May 16th).  This cycle I began spotting on April 30th and bled straight through to May 13th (approx 2 weeks).  I just completed my next cycle which came as expected on June 9th and ended 5 days later on June 13th.

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced extreme breast tenderness in both breasts. They felt sore to the touch all over, had the sensation of being full and heavy, and had to be supported in a bra in order to be tolerable. I liken it to postpartum pain associated with breast feeding and milk engorgement. I would list the symptoms the first night as moderate to severe. It limited my ability to do certain tasks because of the pain and discomfort. The breast tenderness has decreased in severity since then but it is now 1/11/2021 and both breasts are still tender. The severity is now mild. It&#39;s uncomfortable but does not limit my daily activity. Of note, I have had a tubal ligation and ablation and am not pregnant but I cannot track the timing of my cycle to know if the vaccine affected my cycle or caused hormonal changes that could explain the breast sensitivity.   I had arm soreness at the injection site for the first 48 hours but that has gone away. No other symptoms to report.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

That day was my 5th day of my period and there were very few brown spot during the day time as normal.  After dinner, I started feel abdominal cramp and suddenly a lot of blood came out. The bleeding lasted about 1 hour and soaked 5-6 pads.  The next few days had small amount of blood. This situation never happened in my past 20 years period experience before. I had very normal period always lasted about 5-6 days.

                                                I was trying for a pregnancy and was likely pregnant but not detectable at vaccine number 1. Found out about pregnancy a week or so before vaccine 2.  (I was likely about 5 weeks pregnant then based on LMP of dec 22 with avg cycles of 35 days. Decided to get vaccine due to general advice that it is okay during pregnancy. (No known adverse effects). After dose 2, had about 10-12 hours of chills without fever and general fatigue. Shortly afterwards experienced mild cramps. This is my 5th pregnancy and I have no history of complications of any sort. Cramps are not usual for my pregnancies but I know it can be normal so I did not think anything of it. Mild spotting occurred but again did not think anything of it as I know it can be normal. I was scheduled for a first OB visit  Mar 3 where I should have been 10 weeks. (Initial positive pregnancy test was Jan 29). Ultrasound showed empty 5.6 week gestational sac with a yolk sac and subchorionic hemorrhage.   OB suspected pregnancy failure. We followed pregnancy with ultrasound of better quality 10 days later which showed a possible fetal pole and yolk sac but no heart beat and gestational sac measured at 6.0 weeks. Today March 18 awaiting repeat ultrasound tomorrow but started bleeding and cramping. Consistent with the start of the miscarriage. With no histories of abnormal pregnancies and with the gestational  sac consistently measure at 6 weeks (matching to about the time of shot#2), I am inclined to believe that the second covid shot stopped the progression of my pregnancy. I am a huge pro vaccine health care provider but would recommend now an investigation into first trimester covid vaccinations and possibly not recommend this during that time period.

                                                -About 3 minutes after receiving the shot mouth and throat felt itchy.  The itchiness lasted until the following day. -Later that day in the afternoon around 3pm I had heavy breakthrough bleeding like I got my period which lasted for several days.  I finished my birth control pill pack the following weekend and got my normal period.   - In the afternoon of the 7th day after the shot my mouth was itchy again.  Later that night my arm was sore, hot to the touch and had a rash.  The next day the rash had spread down my arm.  My throat, tongue and eyes were itchy.  I called my PCP and spoke to a friend is an a doctor.  I took Advil and Benadryl which helped.  The rash and itchiness persisted from Mon - Thurs.   - 15 days after the shot I got a bloody nose that lasted for about 45 minutes.  I have not had a bloody nose since I was a child so thought this was worth mentioning.   - Around the same time I had headaches in the back of my head that felt like burning.

                                                The day I got my injection I started my period and it was the heaviest and the worst cramps I have ever had in my life. Ive had two kids and these rivaled contractions. The second day I spent about half of my day just laying in bed trying to but some pressure on my cramps so they didn&#39;t hurt so bad.   I believe the first shot threw off my cycle and I was about a full week late for my period by the time I got my second shot. My periods aren&#39;t super regular so that isn&#39;t so out of character but I can handle a lot of pain and this was more than ive felt in a long time. Im 3 days out and today I woke up with normal menstrual pain and still heavy bleeding. But was able tp function normally.

                                                My period started February 7th and was insanely painful to the point where I was throwing up and cramping so bad that I could not walk for two days! February 8th and 9th I had to call in sick from work due to the pain.  My family doctor believe that I was miscarrying due to the amount of pain I described.

                                                I keep extensive records of my period, especially since my surgery (uterine ablation). I was supposed to start on 4/14/2021. After my 1st shot on 3/17/2021, I started my period as normal. After the 2nd shot, I felt no symptoms that I generally have (cramps/headache). Around 9 pm on 4/14/2021, I began to experience the symptoms of the 2nd shot, which I expected. The symptoms (sore arm, headache, nausea, extreme fatigue) lasted until 4/16/2021. When I woke up on 4/16/2021 at 7 am I felt great and I started my period within the hour. I am not sure if receiving the shot and not getting my period for 2 days is related. Possibly stress. Not sure but thought it was worth noting for future studies.

                                                Saturday beginning at 11:00 AM - Severe headache over entire head and neck, extreme joint and bone pain especially through my back, hips, pubic bone, and knees. The pain reminded me of pre-labor. By the time I reached the urgent care facility around 1:30PM, I was experiencing weakness, dizziness, and fainting, and fever around 102. I was also having trouble breathing but that was due to my anxiety and fear from pain. Urgent care sent me directly to the ER. I arrived at the ER around 2:30 PM. I feel like I waited in the waiting room forever crying out for help because &#34;help me&#34; was all that I could utter. I was finally treated with IV fluids, a few rounds of toradol, Phenergan, benedryl, steroid, morphine. I was also given a spinal tap and kept over night for pain management and observation.

                                                Within a half hour of receiving the vaccine, I had a headache. Within 1 hour of receiving the vaccine I also began feeling body aches, fatigue, and joint pain. On day 3, I developed severe diarrhea,  which lasted for about 24 hours. On day 4 after the vaccine, I had some lymph nodes on the left side of my neck inflame.  They were tender and it would hurt to turn my head.   Also on day 4, I forced myself to go to work, exhausted.  On day after the receiving the vaccine, I started my period 10 days early. My cycle had always been predictable and regular. The headache continued for more than 6 days, the body aches and joint pain continued for 6 days. The lymph nodes in my neck have decreased but are still a little bit inflamed still today (4.25.2021) Also, still experience fatigue on a daily basis since the vaccine.

                                                After the first shot I had the typically named symptoms. But after the second shot (4/27/21) I have other symptoms. Starting 2-24 hours after shot I had paid and swelling under my arms, in the lymph node area. 48 hours after shot I have irregular menstrual bleeding. Not sure if it will be a once time thing, or turn into a full menstrual cycle.

                                                A few days after my shot I began the most painful heavy period ive ever experienced. Extreme cramping lasting 2 days and extremely heavy flow. Normally my periods are light and last only a day or two due to my birth control which ive been on for 2 years. I am also still experiencing extreme fatigue 5 days after receiving my first dose and a throbbing localized pain in one part on the left side of my forehead making it hard to keep my eyes open.

About a month after that first bout of light spotting, I&#39;ve had another &#34;period&#34;, which included heavier menstrual bleeding, cramping and back pain, all of which resolved after 3 days. I can&#39;t say with certainty that I&#39;ve &#34;recovered&#34; from the adverse event until the cycling bleeding/cramping stops.

                                                About  a day after vaccine, I developed body aches which got worse after few days down to extreme pelvic pain, lower back pain, ovary pain and breast pain. That last about 10 days, then few days after that, I developed chest wall inflammation which lasted about a week. Then about 5 days or so after that, I developed vestibular hypofunction, and still experiencing vertigo and extreme fatigue.

However, she stated that she was in her 1st trimester and she had miscarried due to placental problems - spontaneous bleeding, leading to miscarriage.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

                                                Approximately five days after the injection, I had my first period since 2013.  Due to a combination of pregnancy (delivered 2/2014) and subsequently two Morena IUDs, I have not even had spotting since 2013.  For three days, I had period-like blood and cramping.  I reported this during my routine rheumatologist appointment who told me to report it here. Additionally, I had pain in the arm for three days as expected from the literature about side effects from the trials.  I am scheduled to have my second dose on 2/4/21 and will report any other side effects.

In February, unusually, I had two menstrual cycles. I had my second dose of Moderna (Feb 1, 2021, Lot 038k20a, same injection location, L arm). I was sick for 2-3 days after (normal reported symptoms of fatigue, nausea, aches). I had  normal menstrual cycle last month but am on my second one for this month. It&#39;s abnormal for me, and I know there could be a million causes, but just in case, I thought it may be worth mentioning.

Injection site pain, small (quarter-sized) rash right next to injection site.  1 week after injection, I developed lymph node pain, mostly in both underarms.  I had spotting the week prior to my menstrual cycle for (so far) two cycles.  Fatigue began about 2 days after the injection, and continues to linger.

                                                I was already on day 4 of my regular menstrual cycle when I got my first dose (3/19/21). That night I felt warm but never had a fever, had usual arm soreness and my tongue was a little swollen but possibly from the food I ate too. No other symptoms that I could tell. The weekend after my bleeding was SUPER heavy although I didn&#39;t have cramps that usually are associated with my heavier times. The amount slowed to a &#34;normal&#34; period day but I kept bleeding for days after it should&#39;ve ended. I dismissed my symptoms after discussing it with an RN who suggested maybe it had more to do with my age than the shot. I was still bleeding although it had lessened to a small amount the weekend of April 9 and 10th and then on the 11th I started bleeding like a normal period again. The bleeding during this cycle was the most I&#39;ve ever bled, in my life (!) and continued for 5 days. (Usually I have 1-2 heavy days in a 4-7 day  &#34;normal&#34; cycle). I was supposed to get my second shot April 16th but cancelled and scheduled an MD appt instead. At that point I had been bleeding for 31 days straight. They suggested I come in so they could do blood tests to make sure I wasn&#39;t getting anemic. I saw an OBGYN on Friday 4/16, they did an ultrasound 4/22 and all results have come back normal. I started a round of ibuprofen and my bleeding cycle seemed to cease around April 22nd.

Today my period just unexpectedly started. I  am still breastfeeding so this is not great. Breastfeeding may not be able to continue with the return of my period so this is a huge deal for me and likely other women.

                                                I received the first shot on Saturday, March 27, 2021. Out of the blue on  Monday, April 12th I woke and had developed a raised hive at the injection site. It was warm to the touch, sore and lasted for five days. I was exhausted during that entire time and had brain fog.  Within three hours of having received the second shot, I was in bed utterly exhausted - napped for three hour straight. I stayed in bed the rest of the day. I woke up on Sunday morning exhausted, I ate and took a two hour nap. When I woke up I had a fever of 100.9. My menstraul cycle completely stopped after receiving the first vaccine it finally started 46 days later on May 2, 2021. I took five pregnancy test all of which were negative. I&#39;ve never had a late period in my life!

Normal effects after both shots included fever, fatigue, head ache and body aches. The first shot was worse and lasted about 4 days, and the 2nd shot was more mild, lasting about 2 days.

On 05-12-2021 I found out I was 11 weeks pregnant. I underwent  a radiology ultrasound where it showed my fetus died at 8 and half weeks.

All symptoms subsided within a few days, but my next cycle was 3 days early. I have no history of any type of cycle irregularity or bleeding and no familial history of uterine/ovarian cysts or anything else that could explain the bleeding and cramping.

Next cycle was slightly longer than average (30 days instead of 28). Subsequent cycle was 35 days, one full week longer than standard (27-28 days, regular, for YEARS, menopause not anticipated until age 55&#43; based on family history &amp; personal health). All periods since vaccination have been increasingly symptomatic; June menses came with migraine (first time ever), general malaise, stronger than normal cramping (that did not respond to ibuprofen, also for the first time ever) and bouts of dizziness/vertigo. General pre-menstrual symptoms are mild, with moderate cramping easily controlled with a single regular-strength ibuprofen.

                                                I took Benadryl 5 minutes before  getting my vaccination since I had had a moderate allergic reaction to the first dose (itching at vaccine site, puffy lips, elevated heart rate, nausea, coughing). Within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I presented with a rash on my face, chest, elbows, and knees. After 30 minutes, I began feeling unwell and the nurse on site suggested I go to Urgent Care or an ER. My husband drove me to an Urgent Care nearby. As I was filling out the paperwork, I felt a rapid pulse, extreme nausea, confusion, trouble with motor skills like filling on intake paperwork. After completing the  paperwork at the Urgent Care, they informed us that they didn&#39;t want anything to do with the covid vaccine. My husband found an ER nearby and we went there. The ER offered me a wheel chair to wheel me back because I was feeling unsteady on my feet. They gave me intravenous fluids, steroids, and pepcid, and monitored me for about an hour until my rash dissipated  and my heart rate returned to normal. The doctor then gave me a prescription for 4 days worth of oral prednisone and  7 days of famotidine.  If I had had an epi-pen at the time (I now have one for my wheat allergy), I would have epi-penned myself while I was at the Urgent Care.  Additional effects post-vaccine:  the rash  and racing heart rate reappeared several times throughout the following week, increased cough and shortness of breath for 2 weeks, my following menstrual cycle began 5 days early (my menstrual cycle is typically very regular at 28 days).   After a 2-week recovery period from the vaccine, I saw some improvement in some of my long covid symptoms such as  cough and shortness of breath.  Likely related to long covid, I continue to have symptoms of chest pain, racing heart rate/palpitations, nausea, dizziness. Due to these symptoms, I am undergoing continued testing by my doctors and I had two ER visits during the month of June on 6/16/2021 and 6/18/2021. So far, we have no diagnosis or treatment plan.

                                                My period was due approximately the day of or day after I received my first Covid19 Moderna vaccine.  My periods are regular, and almost never vary more than a few days. Since I developed a regular cycle in my mid-teens, I&#39;ve only once skipped a period, and that was only for one month. I have not had a period since I received my vaccine, so my last period was in March. So, it now has been 4.5 months since my last period. There is no possibility of me being pregnant.
