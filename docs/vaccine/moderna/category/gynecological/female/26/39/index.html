Lymph nodes stayed swollen after first dose, got worse after second dose, and have been swollen since.   Swollen lymph nodes in neck, hard to breathe, went to hospital, told it was just the vaccine and to wait it out. Lymph nodes in neck went down in swelling after 2-3 days.  Irregular menstrual cycle, started approximately 2 weeks after first dose. Have had a menstrual cycle for 5 days every 9-12 days since first dose.  Hospitalized for stroke-like symptoms (lost vision, couldn&#39;t form sentences) on 5 Feb 21. Discharged after CT scan and MRI came back fine.

                                                My menstrual cycle following the vaccine (March) was late and I experienced much more severe painful symptoms along with it. I track my period regularly and start between day 28 and 30 every month. My period did not start until day 36 and cramping was severe. All of these symptoms were abnormal and I had no other unique changes to my diet, stress, environment, etc. within the month. The next menstrual cycle (April) was back on track with a 28 day cycle.

                                                Woke up realizing that I had started my period and was experiencing horrible menstrual cramps (pain scale of 9 out of 10) and nausea. Took ibuprofen but vomited from pain. After applying a heated pad I managed to fall asleep. Continued to take ibuprofen regularly over the next 3 days as my cramps continued. Normally my cramps are between 4-6 on a pain scale out of 10 and only last the first day. I have never vomited from menstrual pain before, so this was very unusual.

Change tampons  after 2-3 hours of wearing them. Rest of cycle is light.  (After Vacation) Day:1-spotting , light cramping. Day:2- very heavy flow, needing multiple super tampons. Cramps are painful-needed a painkiller.   I had to leave work because of the bleeding and pain. Uncharacteristic of me. I haven?t had to ask to leave my job because of something like this before.  Last month was a little heavier than usual but I didn?t think much of it. This month is just really bad.

The manufacturer instructed us to reach out to the patient to let them know they have received a higher dose which may have the potential for increased local and or systemic side effects. Mariah reported that her period was 8 days late and she is normally very regular. No other side effects reported by Mariah.

It started a few days late after vaccination. I have not stopped bleeding since. It has been nearly 2 months of continuous bleeding resembling a menstrual period that just won&#39;t stop. Some days it is just spotting, others it is heavy. I have felt lethargic, low-energy, mentally foggy because of this. I have experienced menstrual cramps during this time as well.

                                                I was supposed to get my period a couple days prior to getting the covid vaccine. My period never came and now I&#39;m 26 days late. I&#39;ve taken three urine pregnancy tests and they have come back negative. I&#39;m supposed to get my period once again around the time I&#39;m supposed to get my second covid vaccine. So I&#39;m wondering if the covid vaccine could have  an effect on my menstruation.

                                                I received the vaccination on Friday and on Sunday my bleeding increased. I already had some mild bleeding that had been constant since Feb 23rd or 24th. But I had an appointment on Feb 26th that confirmed I had a baby with a healthy heartbeat. I was also diagnosed with a very small uterine cyst. They told me the cause of the bleeding was pro ant implantation bleeding.  I had light bleeding (bleeding just needing one or two pant liners each day) until Sunday the  7 when I saw an increase in bleeding. I called my doctor on Tuesday (I decided not to call Monday because I felt I would get the same answer I had already gotten, which was that everything was fine) and they had me come in die an urgent same day appointment. At that appointment I learned my baby did not have a heartbeat. The baby was measuring at just over 8 weeks.  The due date given to me based on my last period was October 12th. So I was exactly 9 weeks when I went into the appointment Tuesday to find out the baby didn?t have a heartbeat.  I officially miscarried the embryo and the placenta on Friday March 12th.  This would have been my second baby. My first is a male and he is 18 months old. My first pregnancy didn?t have any complications. I do not have a history of miscarriage in my family, and this was the first one I have had.  I did have to take 150mg of Clomid to get pregnant with this baby.

                                                on 4/3 I experienced a fever (ranging between 99.5 and 100.3), headache, fatigue, and body aches. This began when I woke up around 7 AM and continued until about 9:00 PM. The next day on 4/4 I noticed a rash on my upper thighs and butt. They were just a bunch of red spots with white circles around them.  I took benadryl and it was resolved in a few hours.

                                                Menstrual period with significant bleeding lasting almost 8 weeks. Started off irregular for a few days, stopped and came back with an exorbitant amount of blood - needed a super tampon and pad every hour. Lasted about 7.5 weeks in total by using progesterone to stop the bleeding. Also significant cramping and pain. Both the heavy bleeding and pain with cramps are out of the norm for me.

They did said I was at high risk because I had a copper IUD that was removed.

I take birth control tablets the correct way and the Saturday when I started bleed, I had taken my tablet at my regular time that day.  I also usually don?t have heavy periods at all so the amount of blood so early was unusual for me.

                                                Irregular menstrual bleeding starting in the middle of birth control pill cycle (spotting with increased flow for 14 days), headaches/migraine, fatigue, joint pain (left knee and right fingers), blotchy discoloration and veins can be seen in a &#34;lace-like&#34; pattern on the back of both legs, some sharp pains in lower leg especially at night, return of rash/inflammation on arms particularly on right arm.   Went to a clinic on 4/12/21 to ensure discoloration on legs was not a symptom of blood clots since my primary Dr. had to move my appointment out a week. Determined discoloration was not a concern and gave me a prescription for migraines. I have not taken the migraine medication as of 4/26/21.  Primary Dr. appointment on 4/19/21. Determined symptoms were not a side effect of the birth control, but possibly the COVID vaccine. Ordered blood work. As a result, a CT chest scan was ordered due to high D-Dimer test results which was completed on 4/20/21 at the Hospital to check for PEs. Was also instructed to stop taking the birth control (still currently not taking ad will not start taking again). Follow-up with Dr. on 4/23/21 CT scan came back normal, but following up with additional blood work and ultrasound of both legs (scheduled for 4/26/21) to determine what the issue could be. Follow-up to discuss results scheduled for 4/28/21. Instructed to postpone second dose of COVID vaccine and take one baby aspirin a day.

                                                My menstruation cycle began on March 28, approximately 15 days after my second COVID-19 vaccine. I have been experiencing a longer and heavier period than what is considered normal for me.

                                                My menstrual cycle has been consistent (occurring every month) and there have been no changes for the past 10 years. One week before the 1st Moderna COVID-19 vaccine date, my period arrived like normal. Exactly one week after taking the first dose, I received my period once again (twice in 1 month). This is very abnormal. There were no other factors affecting my lifestyle. I believe the vaccine has contributed to my abnormal period and this should be made aware to all volunteers prior to receiving their vaccine.

                                                My first menstrual cycle post 2nd vaccine was extremely abnormal. I had very painful cramping prior to my period and during the period. In addition, I had the heaviest period of my entire life. I was bleeding so much I had to use ultra sized tampons and change them ever 1-2 hours. This has never happened to me before and was very concerning. The heavy bleeding lasted 3-4 days.    My second period post 2nd vaccine has still been a little heavy but is mostly back to normal.

                                                Received the first Moderna vaccine on April 8th. I started my period as per expected on April 29th. My period lasted twice as long as my normal period. Typically my period lasted 3 days. My period then lasted 5 days and much heavier than usual.  I received the second vaccine May 7.  I started my period today and have debilitating cramps. Per usual I rarely have cramps and if so are mild enough to knock out with 1 ibuprofen. I have taken OTC and am still in a lot of pain. Unlike any period I?ve experienced. I also have menstrual cup, so I am able to see my flow is 2-3x heavier than usual.  There have been no other changes in my life other than the vaccine. My younger sister also experienced similar issues and we got the vaccine at the same time. I reported because I saw other women were experiencing this as well.

Also during this time I had experienced fever, chills and was very fatigue. I sought care from my ob/gyn and she ordered for me to receive a trans vaginal ultra sound to make sure everything was okay, and the results came back everything was fine I was just experiencing abnormal bleeding.

This time, I have cramps for 48 hours and very heavy bleeding for 48 hours. During my period I was nauseous off and on, lightheaded most days and extremely fatigued the first two days enough so I couldn&#39;t work or get out of bed. This is all very different from my usual menstrual period and nothing changed in my diet or lifestyle from the previous month other than receiving this vaccine.

                                                Dizziness and rapid heartbeat five minutes after shot with lightheadedness continuing for a few days after.  Sore throat and swollen throat glands twenty minutes after shot that continued for a couple hours after.  Swollen breasts leading to back pain twenty minutes after shot continuing for a week following.  Headache, fatigue, and joint pain for 48 hours after shot.  Nausea and acid reflux for several days after shot.  Menstrual spotting occurring one week after shot (had period the week before).  I saw a doctor at an urgent care and he suspects I may have anemia that was worsened due to being on my period right before shot and that likely contributed to the dizziness and rapid heartbeat.  No explanation for other symptoms but I am healthy.

Symptoms mostly disappeared the next day except for body aches, sensitive inner ears (some difficulty draining the eustachian tube, they randomly pop, and some pressure is released). 3rd day most symptoms gone except still cannot fully release eustachian tubes, still mild swelling in arm light, and started menstrual spotting (day 15 of the cycle, my previous cycle started 4/1 and was regular.). 4th-day post vaccine and I am starting to spot more heavily, I think the cycle is about to start. I wonder if my body was stressed enough I did not ovulate. I experienced a change in discharge on days 2 and 3 but when I took an ovulation test it came up negative on both days,   After the first shot, I felt like I couldn&#39;t take a full breath and I felt like something was in my lungs like phlegm or something ( I don&#39;t Smoke FYI) but I noticed the symptoms went away after the second dose.

The morning after getting the shot I began to have vaginal bleeding. I went to my OBGYN to have the baby checked. I was referred to a specialist for a level 2 ultrasound. Everything was found to be normal with the baby. The cause of the bleeding is still unknown by the timing aligns perfectly with my vaccine. The bleeding increased and has now began to slow.

                                                When i got my first dose March 27, 2021 it was fine about 2 weeks later I had a rash on my arm where I got vaccination. Around the same time (April 5th) it was due for my menstrual cycle and I did not get it until a week late. I am an individual who&#39;s cycle is right on track so this was very weird.  I only thing I did different was getting the vaccine

                                                I got my period even though I am on the IUD. I have not really had my period since getting my IUD.  Normally I would not report this. But I am worried that the Moderna vaccine may have impacted the efficacy of my birth control since I do not get my period on the IUD. Will take a pregnancy test at appropriate time to determine fully.  This must be researched as it has very frightening implications for unexpected pregnancy if it is impacting the IUD. Otherwise, my body was simply stressed enough by the vaccine that I have my period. It is odd either way.

I contacted my provider and I was instructed to take a pregnancy test, which was positive. I went in for an exam on the 12th and they confirmed that I was indeed pregnant. They tested my Beta Hcg twice. I didn&#39;t get my results immediately due to one site being closed due to COVID. I could&#39;ve gone to the hospital and received the results immediately, but my doctor didn&#39;t want to take the chance due to the hospital having a lot of COVID. They confirmed that I was pregnant on the 19th or 20th. I bled for a few days after that. The final Beta Hcg was done and my level was 0.

                                                3 days after the shot, I experienced menstrual cramping and bleeding two weeks before normal period start date. Four days of unusual spotting, discharge, and cramps have followed. Black discharge with a foul smell. I know this is highly unusual for my body. No other stressors and no history of irregular period. I will see my doctor soon, but my bloodwork from a few months ago was normal. I&#39;ll continue to monitor, but this is a concerning side effect and I hope it is temporary. I wish I&#39;d known this was a possibility.

Two days after first dose: I started mensturating heavily and suddenly with severe menstral symptoms.  I continued to sporadically have light bleeding for 3 weeks. Prior to this event, I had not had a period in almost a year due to my birth control method. I have cramps, bloating, breast pain, irregular bleeding and weight gain. I received the second dose on 03/25/21 and by 03/30/21 I was experiencing yet another round of extreme PMS symptoms like severe breast pain, severe cramps that leave me bedridden, and intense food cravings. I have not had cyclic periods for several months prior to either of these events. It was jarring enough for me to start tracking my period symptoms because it was so out of the normal. I have been filtered into thinking any issues with my period are just something to deal with and to not seek medical attention, but I have missed approximately 6 days of work due to various symptoms after both of my doses.

                                                At around 0100 I began developing body aches, severe headache, chills,  and joint pain. I also developed a mild fever of 101.3. I took Tylenol, took a warm bath with epsom salt and began feeling better around 0500-0700. I then slept 9hrs. Woke up ran some errands went home and was extremely tired. I then napped for 5hrs. After that I felt a lot better. I did have a pretty sore arm for several days but it was tolerable.  The more concerning adverse effect I experienced from Moderna was after my first dose on 2/12/21, my period following  that dose which was to be 02/23/22  was essential non-existent. I then had pregnancy tests done to confirm I was not pregnant.  My period has since seemingly returned to normal.

I&#39;ve never been pregnant before and the estimated date of delivery would have been November 2021.

                                                The first Moderna shot caused me to miss my next menstrual cycle, which had never happened to me prior to receiving the shot. In the week I received the 2nd shot on 3/13/21, I had uterine cramping that same day within a few hours of getting the shot. I also noticed a change to my cervical mucus during my ovulation cycle 2 weeks later. I then became pregnant the following month and was found to have a missed miscarriage at 6 weeks 1 day. It seems like their is a strong correlation between the side effects from the Moderna shot and the miscarriage.

I started feeling achy and took 1 more Tylenol around 11:45 pm before going to bed. I woke up around 2 AM (May 29) with extreme shakes, fever of 100.4. I tried to drink some tea / water and I began having uncontrollable vomiting / diarrhea for about 3 hours. At that point I was lightheaded, and my arms and legs both became numb / tingling. My husband drove me to the ER and I was given 2 bags of IV fluids, nausea medication and pain meds. I am also on the tail end of my period and began having cramping. The doctors were very concerned about an elevated heart rate and believe I was possibly also having a panic attack

Some days it is heavier, and other days it is very light.  I have had a period for 4 months now.

Acute pain and numbness has worn off, but there is still moderate pain when using the arm. About a week post-dose, began spotting.

Bleeding has increased daily, and is now fairly heavy. Accompanied by cramps.

                                                I believe that the vaccine could have affected my monthly menstrual cycle (particularly ovulation), which (if it is documented by enough women) I feel should be looked into more so more women are aware. I&#39;ve been tracking my period/ovulation for months for family planning purposes. I had 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 1/20/21 and my next period on 1/28/21. I&#39;ve been using OPK tests to track ovulation over the past few months, which have been positive on cycle day 18 or cycle day 19 (it&#39;s never been outside of those days before). When  I tested using the OPK twice per day on 2/10/21 (Cycle day 14) through 2/17/21 (cycle day 21), I got all negatives. I have no idea when I actually ovulated in February and think that the vaccine may have moved the date up earlier (which never happened). I know that I ovulated sometime, since I got a very happy surprise positive pregnancy test on 2/25/21 (which conflicts with the infertility myths!). While our family is thrilled with the news, I wanted to report it to VAERS in case there could be a possibility that the covid vaccine could throw off somebody&#39;s menstrual cycles/ovulation. If there is a link between those two, I feel like women of childbearing age would want to be informed of that possibility!

Pain at injection site for 3 days (red and swollen lump)- This has subsided 3. Tightness and pain in left neck (same side as injection)- This has subsided 4. My period was supposed to end on Saturday 3/20/22, but I am bleeding more heavily and this is unusual for me so I wonder if it is related to the vaccine somehow. Still bleeding as of today 3/22 Note: I treated the symptoms with ibuprophen and tylenol.

I had never had so much blood and fluid before in my life. The size of the tissue that I was menstruating was very very large and the pain and heavy menstruating went on until the end of the week (it never decreased or became better). Then after the second dose the same thing happened - not even 24 hours later I got my period with extreme pain, very large chunks of tissue, and extreme flow of blood. Then my third period the same exact thing has happened, extreme pain, very very large chunks of tissue, and extremely heavy flow.

Occurred again two days post-vaccination just over 24 hours after first occurrence. Intermittent abdominal cramping noticed as well. I am a female that regularly tracks menstrual cycles, has a consistent 29 day cycle with a period lasting an average of 5 days. I have good knowledge of my ovulation window and am certain this is not related to any ovulation/implantation occurrences. It is too early in my cycle for that to occur.  I am reporting so that you have this information but also out of concern that this could represent the onset of any other bleeding issues that may be developing as a result of getting vaccinated.

Later in the evening after receiving vaccine, noticed bleeding that resembled normal menstrual bleeding. Bleeding ended within 24 hours.  Menstrual period did not formally begin/return(?) until April 12. Experienced heavy flow going into the 5th day now, expect period to end soon as cycle normally lasts no more than 5-7 days. Suspect radiology and/or vaccine could be cause for delayed period.

                                                Starting around 7 hours after the shot, I started to fell fatigued. My head also felt foggy. I went to sleep at 11pm, and awoke about every 3 hours. At 5 am, a terrible migraine set it. I took 1000 mg Tylenol and laid in bed for about 45minutes until it kicked in. At this time I also had complete body aches, but nothing hurt worse than my arm. The I slept another 3-3.5 hours. In the morning, the headache was less intense, the fatigue was still there but not debilitating, and the brain fog was present but minimal. I had nausea hit 3-5 times, but usually subsided within 5-10 minutes. 24 hours after the shot, I started spotting, mostly dark, chunky bits of uterine lining. I am not scheduled to start my period for 12 days. The spotting has increased - I?m now on my second tampon before heading to bed. I?ve also developed a small rash about 1-2 inches below the injection site, which feels warm, and is red in a rough square shape about 2?x2?. I still have a faint headache.

My menstrual cycle previously has always been very regular. Typically my menstrual cycle would be 28 days apart with heavy bleeding that tapers at the end of my cycle. I am now experiencing menstrual cycles that last only 20 days and little to no bleeding. I am only ?spotting? while on my period now.  Something is wrong and other women I know  who have taken the moderna vaccine are having this issue just exactly the same as myself.  It?s like my body cannot have a proper menstrual cycle. To add, I have confirmed that I absolutely am NOT pregnant.

The next day (4/25/21) the cramps continued, along with a massive appetite.  The following day (4/26/21) at about 3:50am I woke up to heavier cramping and started my period a week early. I usually start my period at the same time of the month, but after the vaccine shot, period symptoms started and my period began earlier than normal.

April 27, first ultrasound measured fetus at 6w1d (behind what was expected given LMP, should have measured 7w2d), embryonic cardiac activity was present, but could not be documented by M-mode. Provider warned 60% chance of abnormal pregnancy. BetaHCG testing results: April 27 was 28,247H; April 29 was 29,925H. A follow-up ultrasound on May 6 showed no fetal heart tones, and and fetus still measured 6w1d, unchanged from last visit. Provider prescribed misoprostol which was taken same day (May 6) to complete the miscarriage.

                                                Flu-like symptoms for the first 3 days: fever, chills, body aches, headache, itchy skin, pain in injection site (left arm). A few days later I started my period. It was irregular with severe PMS, panic attacks, anxiety and depression, severe cramping, more bleeding and blood clots than usual, period lasted longer than usual. Every day since I have been having PMS symptoms (anxiety, depression, panic attacks) and cramping. The cramping feels like period cramps but I am no longer on my period. The cramps last all day long and are not going away. I also had severe eye pain in my right eye about 1 week after the injection. The pain lasted for about 2 days, and was a throbbing pain behind my eyeball. I have never experienced any issues with my eyes before. I also had covid January 2021 and did not experience any of these symptoms then.

                                                The day I received the shot I had fatigue and pain in all my joints as described though I am not sure if it was normal as I returned home at 10am and proceeded to fall asleep till 7pm even though the night before I had my regular 8hrs of slumber. The following week I was supposed to have my period. Instead I had abdominal cramping and the period did not come. It came 2 weeks after that (so 3 weeks total of abdominal cramping) aka my period was 2 weeks late. The period also did not discharge as normal (bloody mucus pieces over 5 days), it came out in one go as a decidual cast (with some bloody spotting for half a day tops). Honestly if I wasn&#39;t abstinent for 2021 I would have thought I got pregnant and just miscarried. After the  decidual cast left my body the abdominal cramping ceased. I have previously never had a decidual cast and at most in my entire life, my period has been 5 days late.  In addition, just 24 hrs after receiving the 1st dose and still ongoing today is that I erupted in cystic acne on my face, chest, shoulders, and back. I do have adult acne but on average I would have 2-3 pimples on my shoulders at any given time. After the shot I was sporting 15&#43; pimples in each of these locations. This may be hormonal acne due to the strange menstruation situation from above. I work from home and had to forge wearing a bra as the straps and bands would irritate the acne and cause them to form a &#39;head&#39; and then rip open and burst from contact.

I took Tylenol and a 3 hour nap. I woke up with terrible joint pain, particularly in my knees, hips, ankles and wrists. All day I continued to have breast pain. I went to bed at midnight still I?m hurting. I woke up this morning still noticing the breast pain, but joint pain is gone.

It was liquidly bright red and a lot of blood -- and I haven&#39;t experienced this in a decade. I feel like it reset the way my cycles have been in decades. And now I&#39;m  I was diagnosed with Endometriosis when I was 25 and for years now I&#39;ve been super regular without pain. But now I am getting intense pain to the point of feeling like I would fainting with periods after vaccination and this hasn&#39;t happened in years.  This started on my next cycle after my vaccination. I went to the Doctor May 27th to explain what was happened.

                                                after receiving vaccine on Wednesday 4/21, got positive pregnancy test on Saturday 4/24, 1 day after missed period. Estimated due date was 12/31/21. Began spotting on May 1 - approx 5 weeks pregnant. Spotted brown/pink with some clots until May 5, when I started lightly bleeding red.  Beta tests on May 5 and May 7 showed 6228.7 and 6529.0, respectively.  May 10 went in for viability scan - ultrasound showed gestational sac with 2 yolk sacs and 2 fetal poles, one measuring at 6 weeks and other measuring at 6w1d. No sign of misscarriage, no reason for bleeding was seen on the scan. Scan was perfect on paper. Bleeding picked up after scan and I lost the pregnancy on May 11 around 4:30pm. Bleeding continued for one week and HCG levels were low enough to show a negative test at my followup appointment 2 weeks later on May 26.

Pregnancy tests were negative prior to receiving the first vaccine and then turned positive on 12-29-2020 (5 days after getting first vaccine.)

Also some very light clotting, which rarely happens for me. I was not due for my period for 2.5 weeks. My cycle is extremely regular and has never deviated from 28-31 days in the last 6&#43; years. I have a copper IUD (for 6 years), and have never been pregnant.

No history of drug or alcohol abuse. No s/sx of other causes of a early 2nd trimester miscarriage. Of note the 1st trimester genetic testing was unable to be performed due to low fetal free cell DNA when she was at 10w. We were in the process of repeating the labs when the miscarriage happened.  No history of COVID infection, no s/sx of COVID infection at the time of the miscarriage or subsequently. She was not tested.

The doctor told me the baby wasn?t developed normally and a miscarriage had already started.  I believe the gestational sac measured about 5 weeks 3 days.

                                                Vaccine Saturday evening. Noticed ball of left foot feeling numb Sunday morning. Numbness spread throughout left leg during the day.  Some aching but mostly numbness in the subsequent days. No loss of function. Left arm went numb Wednesday. Right foot and right hand developed some tingling/numbness Wednesday night/Thursday morning  (today). Right leg has progressively gotten more numb today (Thursday). Vaginal spotting started Tuesday 3/9, only 1.5 weeks into my current cycle and current pack of birth control pills (highly unusual).

                                                This is my first pregnancy. I had a normal ultrasound at my 8-week appointment, showing heartbeat and movement. My estimated delivery date was October 12, 2021. Four days after my second COVID shot, I had my 12-week checkup. They ran a urine test and asked me questions about my progress, all seemed normal. I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any side effects that would lead me to believe that I had miscarried. The OBGYN attempted to listen to the heartbeat but couldn&#39;t hear anything, so she wrote me a prescription to head over to the imaging site to get an ultrasound just in case. I drove there immediately and was given an ultrasound. They couldn&#39;t hear anything so we went ahead with a TVA. After approximately 45 minutes and no updates, the technician said that the results would be forwarded to my doctor and that they would reach out to me about the results. My doctor informed me that they could not hear a heartbeat and that I must have miscarried within the past couple days because the fetus length was as expected for 12-weeks of gestation. I am now scheduled for D&amp;C on 4/5/21.

                                                Approximately 30-45 mins after vaccine injection, I began menstrual bleeding.  I suffered a miscarriage 3 weeks prior to the vaccination, and was not expecting to start my menstrual cycle.  Since the miscarriage and up to the day of vaccination, I had light and inconsistent spotting (brown in color).  However, after the vaccination I have had a light flow of blood, red/pink in color.  My best guess is that an anticoagulant in the vaccine caused my blood to thin to the point where I began bleeding again from the recent miscarriage.  The bleeding is ongoing as of the time of this report.

                                                2 days after the first dose of the vaccine, I started cramping. The cramping was followed by 5 days of spotting just like the first dose. After 5 days of spotting, I then began my normal period (I?m on birth control). My flow so far has been way more intense then usual. My birth control tends to keep my period light, but at the moment I am bleeding heavily and cramping really bad. The cramping is intense (which I typically do not get during my period). I am again having cluster migraines. The PMS is more intense as well.

                                                I have the nexplanon implant as birth control, and my body stopped having periods two years ago because of that. After my second dose I experienced spotting for about three weeks and then it turned into a full blown menstrual cycle. It is very weird. It doesn&#39;t feel like a big deal but I also think it is important to note considering my BC reacts with my body reliably in such a way that I do not menstrate.

I attribute this to the vaccine as this has never happened before. I have also read other women?s periods have been impacted. I had the vaccine on 3/1 and still have not had a period.   When I got the vaccine I had 103 fever, terrible chills, fatigue, and a headache. The fever started 8 hours post vaccine and lasted about 30 hours. The headache lingered for 5 days. These symptoms have since subsided.

                                                Extremely unusual menstrual cycle. Usually my menstrual cycle is 6 days long. First day is light, second day is heavy, and then it wains from there. After receiving the Covid shot I started my period and heavily bled for four days to the point that I was soaking through super plus tampons every hour to two hours and having to wear heavy night pads. It was similar to bleeding after birthing a child. Then after the four days my bleeding stopped. On the fifth day I had severe leg pain in the upper right hip area. Then on the sixth day I started bleeding again. I?m on day 8 of my period.  My period has never been this long.

                                                Ever since the completion of both COVID-19 vaccine doses, my menstrual cycle has been overly painful, long, and extremely (to an almost uncontrollable state). This has never been the case since I was 13 years old. My 2nd COVID-19 vaccine was the beginning of February, any by the end of February when my cycle started my period was out of control. It is now May, and has not resolved at all. Every month my cycle is worse and worse. It went from 4-5 days pre-COVID vaccine, to 7-8 days post- COVID vaccine. The menstrual cramps are so awful, which I have never had before. The flow/heaviness is so extreme and uncontrollable, I can&#39;t even leave the house for the first 2-3 days. This needs to be looked into. The ONLY thing with me that has changed, in the past couple of months is getting the vaccine. Nothing else would cause this. I have read some articles that are saying post-menopausal women are getting periods again and younger women are experiencing unusually abnormal periods. Please look into this and research it, as this is definitely not right

Now I&#39;ve not had menstration for 40 days. After multiple at home pregnancy tests. I went to a physician and was tested and results are negative for pregnancy. She stated she is seeing multiple patients who are having multiple periods early or no periods and has asked me to report my experience to CDC.

After second dose dated: 05/4/2021 we went for first scan on May 13th ,2021 and doctor suggested that the baby growth is not as per the weeks being calculated .They suggested that this might lead to miscarriage and asked us to come after 1 week date: 05/21/2021 .But soon after the visit I started noticing bleeding and spotting , we went back on Friday next week and there was no heart beat ,so they diagnosed it to be a miscarriage and gave  medications following that. My blood reports and urine reports are normal. Wanted to report the event .

                                                My menstrual cycle has always been a little irregular but it has gotten substantially worse since the vaccine and I am unsure if it is related so erring on the side of caution and reporting. On may 9th I had profuse mid-cycle bleeding and was going through super tampons every 15 minutes for at least 6 hours. I went to the emergency room and tested negative for pregnancy (thus not a miscarriage) and my IUD was in place so my IUD that I have had for 2 years was not the cause of the bleeding. My period came back 2 weeks after that bleeding episode and has lasted for 13 days.

                                                There was very little pain until before bed the day I received the vaccine. At that time, I started feeling tenderness in the shoulder where I received the shot. The next day (today) the pain, inflammation, and swelling started moving down from my shoulder through to my fingers. I was barely able to get my wedding ring off because of the swelling. The tenderness now goes note my whole arm, under my arm pit, down my shoulder blade, and even my left breast. I have taken Benadryl for the swelling and tried to get it elevated, and I have taken ibuprofen for the body aches that I?ve had today as well.

                                                At the time of administration of the first does of Moderna vaccine, I was 6 weeks pregnant.  I had confirmed pregnancy with home positive test and missed period. I had an estimated due date of 9/24/2021.  This was my 4th pregnancy. I have had two uncomplicated pregnancies to term. In September 2020 experienced a chemical pregnancy with early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks.  The first 24 hours after 1st dose of vaccine I experienced extreme arm soreness in the arm that was vaccinated,  causing  headache and unable to sleep. After 24 hours I felt &#34;normal&#34;. 2 weeks and 3 days following the first dose of Moderna, I  had a miscarriage. On the night of 2/15/21 I lost the pregnancy with vaginal bleeding, bright red  blood, passing tissue, clots/ sac. I had an uneventful pregnancy up to that point, feeling well as I had with prior pregnancies.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna COVIDI19 vaccine on 12/29/2020 not knowing I was pregnant.  I took a home pregnancy test the week of 1/3/2021, which came back positive.  On 1/17/2021, I started having some spotting and saw my OBGYN on 1/18/2021.  My OBGYN did a transvaginal ultrasound and estimated I was about 5 weeks pregnant.  I went for bloodwork prescribed by my OBGYN on 1/18 and 1/20 to measure my HcG levels.  By 1/20-1/21 the bleeding became heavy and my HcG levels dropped.  I had a follow up appointment with my OBGYN on 2/3/2021 where they performed another transvaginal ultrasound and more bloodwork to confirm that I had miscarried.

                                                I felt fine after the shot until about 7 pm when I started experience an intense, pressurized sensation in my head, jaw, chest, and arms. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea, fatigue, ringing in my ears, and feeling flushed. Over night I felt some numbness in my hands and arms. The next day the feeling of  pressure and tightness was gone but the dizziness and nausea has remained. I have more energy but  am feeling concerned about the persistent vertigo.  I have a history of allergic reactions. I was also scheduled to begin my menstrual cycle this weekend and it has been delayed.

As of 3/30/21 I have yet to start my period. Experiencing bloating, swollen breast, fatigue. Pregnancy test taken today was negative.  2) Suffered a fracture of upper left humerus, neat vaccine site. Injury was sustained during a fall while downhill skiing and may be unrelated to the vaccine, but the fracture was at the same spot as my vaccination.

Immediately upon receiving the vaccine I had uterine cramps and heavy bleeding with large clots continued throughout the day and into the next day. Had some dark bleeding/discharge about 4 days after my period ended for 2 days. This also happened during my first dose of Moderna, although my first dose was on the first day of my period so I didn?t quite register it since bleeding is normally heavy at the beginning of my period.  First period was also substantially heavier with clots and had some dark bleeding/discharge 4 days after my period ended

                                                2 weeks after my 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine I started spotting blood as if I was about to start my menstrual period however I was not due to start my period for 2 more weeks.  This bleeding was light and not heavy like a regular period. It did require a panty liner at times however. This bleeding lasted a little over 48 hours before it eventually stopped. My menstrual cycle has always been very regular. Before this episode I had never once spotted in between periods. This is very unusual for me.  It has been 24 hours since the bleeding has stopped.

                                                I had diarrhea about 20-40 minutes after receiving my first dose. I then got my period a few hours later. It was on time, however, it was extremely heavy. On the 3rd day, I began to have very large blood clots. I spoke to my gynecologist and she started me on birth control that sane day in order to stop the bleeding.

This was accompanied by night swears and then a migrane that onset the following day along with usual symptoms of fatigue and a sore arm.

I have been spotting/ bleeding for over a week straight now, when I should even be having a period at all. I also developed a slight yeast infection during the time between my two doses.

For the next 3 months, my period has been longer (8-9 days), heavier, and with new bloating, low back pain, and cramps.

It happened one more time in the middle of the night, jolting me out of sleep. My period has not come since I took the shot.  It?s been two weeks. This is very unusual.

The patient&#39;s medical history included eczema.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included pre-natal vitamins.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) on 31 Dec 2020. On 28 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient received the vaccine while breastfeeding and reported having a clogged duct and possible mastitis.  She began to experience flu like symptoms on 29 Jan 2021.

On 01 Feb 2021 her breast became hard, red, and sore.  On 02 Feb 2021 her breast symptoms resolved; however, her milk production was 65-70% of normal. She treated the events with acetaminophen and magnesium sulfate dissolved in water.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events clogged duct, possible mastitis, milk production dropped, and were not reported.  The outcome of the event, received vaccine while breastfeeding, was considered resolved on 28 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, flu like symptoms, was considered resolved on 31 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, breast was hard, red, and sore, was considered resolved on 02 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I had no other issues or complications that would have contributed to my miscarriage.

As I was walking home walking home within 5min I had heavy bleeding, I wasn&#39;t suppose to get my period for another 2 weeks. The heavy bleeding lasted full 2 days, that day within 5hrs I had body aching and later had a fever. I had the fever and body aching for about 24hrs and my period for 2days. Since then I have been having random spotting of light or heavy bleeding. I had my period on 3-6-21 to 3-16-21 full days bleeding. Now I still have random spotting of blood cloth and heavy bleeding for few hours and it stops.

However, my menstrual cycle also occurred 1 week late.  Also for the past 3 months since then, I have experienced spotting shortly before the onset of my cycle.  I have been trying to conceive, and I am wondering if the vaccine has had an impact on my fertility.  My menstrual cycle had always been regular prior to the second dose.

                                                After receiving the second Moderna vaccine, I (the patient), began light spotting/menstruating for 7 days before beginning my period, then bled (my period) for 5 more days.  After 4 weeks, I started lightly bleeding again for 11 days, then began my period. I?ve bled 29/55 days. This is extremely unlike my body which usually bleeds 4-5 days/month, about 32 days apart.

                                                I?m currently 11 weeks postpartum and exclusively breastfeeding my infant. I experienced typical vaccine adverse effects on day 0-1 (fatigue chills muscle aches weakness arm pain and fainting episode (I have a history of fainting and with other vaccines)) followed by mastitis on day 2 after my vaccine second dose.  Mastitis symptoms included fever chills muscle aches weakness breast pain swelling redness and decreased milk production from blocked duct(s). I had no symptoms of blocked duct prior to the vaccine or prior to day 2. My prescriber ordered an antibiotic and ibuprofen which helped.  We believe that the blocked ducts/mastitis occurred in relation to lymph node swelling that has been seen with the vaccine although we did not have a physical exam to determine if that is true.

I normally use light tampons and it?s rarely fully saturated after 6 hours, I was bleeding through supers within a few hours. There is a zero chance of pregnancy so it wasn?t a miscarriage.

                                                I was given the injection and immediately went to sit in the patient observation area for the required 15 minutes. I was feeling fine, made a quick phone call, and was just sitting and waiting. Then, 5 minutes after the injection, I noticed my arm at the injection site felt just the tiniest bit achy, but thought I was probably just imagining it. Then within several seconds of that observation, I could feel a blackout coming on--tunnel vision, ringing in my ears, general feeling of being unwell. I started to bend down to put my head between my knees, but that&#39;s the last thought I remember before waking up lying on the floor with the pharmacist tending to me. He said I had only been unconscious for several seconds. I was completely weak and still felt generally unwell. I also sustained a bump on my forehead and a hurt nose from hitting the floor when I collapsed. I recovered enough to walk out about 30 minutes later, and rested the rest of the day since the weakness lasted through the evening. I don&#39;t know if it was related or not, but I also started my period 4 days after that, which was 5 days earlier than expected, and it lasted a full 2 weeks (my period is typically 7-9 days).

For two days after the first dose I had intense uterine cramping (already reported) and then today, two weeks later, began a VERY heavy  period. Heavier than I can remember having ever before.

                                                Miscarriage; Received vaccine when pregnant; A spontaneous report was received from a 34-year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) when pregnant and experienced a miscarriage.  The patient&#39;s medical history included three prior pregnancies, with two live births and one miscarriage. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included prenatal vitamins and doxylamine succinate/pyridoxine hydrochloride.   The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 011J20A) on 30 Dec 2020. On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 028L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  At 7 weeks gestation, the fetus had a normal heart beat. She reported that she had no complications with the pregnancy.  On 08 Feb 2021, the patient had a miscarriage. Treatment information was not provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The events received vaccine when pregnant and miscarriage were considered recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This report concerns a 34-year-old, P2G4 who experienced miscarriage 1 month 9 days post administration of first dose and 12 days after the last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine. There is not enough information such as the last menstrual period, estimated date of conception and delivery and gestational age at the time of miscarriage. In addition, the patient&#39;s detailed medical history including any trauma  and reason for previous miscarriage is lacking. Vaccine exposure during pregnancy is assessed as not applicable.

This was my first pregnancy and I had no complications up to that point. On 2/2/21 I began experiencing menstrual type cramps, which continued for a few days. On 2/5/21, my OBGYN suggested I be examined in Labor and Delivery, where it was determined I was in pre-term labor. Contractions were temporarily stopped, however my water broke on 2/7/21 and it was suggested that I be induced. I was induced on a later date at 34w1d pregnant and delivered my son, who weighed in at 4lbs. 15oz.

                                                1: the day after my first covid shot, in the evening, my heart rate jumped from around 70 to around 130 instantly when walking up the stairs in my house. This happened twice that evening and has never happened before. My pulse was pounding in my head and it took about 1-2 minutes of slow breathing to calm my heart rate again. I wore my heart rate monitor the rest of the evening and overnight, with no other adverse effects. Stairs had no impact on me the next day. I had also exercised that morning, and while my heart rate was higher than normal with that type of workout, I didn?t think anything of it at the time and didn?t have the pounding head issue.  Due to this issue, I?m a bit nervous about the second shot in the series.   2: I started my period the morning I got the shot; day 4 and 5 of my period were significantly heavier flow than normal. Day 4 also included cramps and nausea throughout the entire day, which is not normal for me.

                                                In the early afternoon of 3/25 I noticed pain in my breast while nursing my baby. After the feeding I could feel a hard lump on the underside of my breast that was tender to the touch and warm. I used an ice pack on the area, took curcumin and grapefruit seed extract, and nursed again on our regular schedule. The clog was resolved after the next feeding and after taking the supplements and using ice. Clogged ducts have happened to me frequently in the last ten months of nursing. I don?t know if this was related to the vaccine, but I figured I would report it in case it became a pattern in nursing mothers.

Then noticed that I had a significant delay in my menstrual cycle that was very abnormal for me. I was suppose to start my regular cycle 6 days after vaccination.  I am very regular and my menses were delayed by two weeks. In addition,  when it came back there was a change in my flow (very short duration). I am concerned about possible implications of the vaccine regarding my menses.

                                                I have a history of heavy periods which resulted in the need for an ablation in October 2018. Since the ablation my periods have been much more manageable. I got my period 13 days after receiving the shot and it started out much heavier than normal, by the second day I was bleeding extremely heavily, soaking an overnight pad in less than 2 hours with bright red blood and passing clots the size of dimes and pennies. Day 3 has started out the same as day 2. Prior to my period starting my back hurt and I had much worse than normal abdominal cramps. Nothing in my life has changed besides the vaccine, I am certain there is a connection between the two. I am not sure how long this will last, I was instructed to go ahead an report the adverse event.

                                                One week after the first dose of the vaccine I had breakthrough bleeding. It was enough to soak a sanitary pad. I went to the ER and they could not identify the reason for the vaginal bleeding. I was discharged the same night. It reoccurred three days after when I had been on a walk. It did not happen again and I did not have any problems after the second shot. The baby seems to be fine. Due Date -09/17/2021 Pregnancy-First

I did not have a visible rash, but my dermatologist said it was a histamine reaction. I was intensely itchy for three days and then it went away  after five days. I had a miscarriage five weeks after the second dose which was a week after the itch started. I saw my OBGYN, PCP ER , Gastroenterologist and Dermatologist.

By Friday between 3-4pm I had completely stopped bleeding. I continued up until present day with no menstruation bleeding or spotting at all. I have taken pregnancy test on Monday, 4/26 that was negative. This is VERY unusual for me and my monthly cycle. I track every symptom, every sign, etc. leading up to my cycle each month. I know exactly when my body ovulates and when my body will start the cycle over again. This has never happened before.

                                                For the next three days, I got pretty sick. Low grade fever - around 100. If I took a Tylenol it would go away for a little bit but then come back. Pain in my arm. Nausea and major, major, major migraines. I had migraines consistently - couldn&#39;t move off my couch. Those symptoms mostly went away after the third day.  I saw my OB/GYN this week and they said that my fetus stopped growing about three weeks ago.  Pregnancy history - my third pregnancy; none have gone to full-term. I have had a miscarriage before that was very similar to this one.  Estimated date of delivery - December 2, 2021. I have recovered from the immediate side effects. I get the fetus removed next week.

                                                I believe I was very early on in my pregnancy (as in, implantation or first week after conception) when I received the second dose of the vaccine. EDD was January 9th, 2022. I had brown spotting every day for the duration of my pregnancy, obviously concerning and something I paid attention to (though not altogether unusual in early pregnancy). I ended up miscarrying naturally at 6 weeks. I am strongly in favor and appreciative of this vaccine and would be surprised if there was a direct link, but I do know there is a growing conversation about its impact on women&#39;s menstrual cycles. I wanted to submit my experience just in case it was in fact a trend for other trying-to-conceive or early pregnant females.

I have recorded my periods over the past year because of my POTS. I had my period on April 2nd and it ended on the 10th. Four days after the shot, I had the shot on April 26th, I got my period for a 2nd time 19 days after my period just ended. The 2nd period ended on May 6th. I have yet to recieve my period. Medication, stress levels and diet haven&#39;t changed for me so those weren&#39;t the trigger.

The timing has also been irregular and unpredictable each month since. Longer PMS windows as well.

GI issues persisted for the next 3 weeks and on Thursday evening, 2/25/2021 at about 6:30 pm. I was sitting on floor with children and almost passed out. I felt very faint, dizzy, and instantly started chilling. I had a fever of 102.8 and could not get warm. My husband was going to call paramedics, but I encouraged him not to. Discovered my right breast was red and inflamed/ swollen as well as all of my lymph nodes in my right arm pit. I could not reach my right arm forward. I noticed around 12:06 AM after not being able to get warm or break fever. I messaged my primary care clinic when I noticed the breast swelling, redness, pain, and lymph node swelling. I continually felt like I was going to faint/pass out and was very dizzy all night long. I was also extremely fatigued. The did a telemedicine appointment the next morning and diagnosed me with mastitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I am a breastfeeding mother and all of these symptoms came on suddenly and severely on the same side that I got the vaccine shot. I have been breastfeeding for over 7 months and my supply has been dwindling to nothing so I have no problems with engorgement or blocked milk ducts. Before this baby I had just got done breastfeeding a baby for 11 months with no issues of the like.

I believe I got it then bc I wrote on Feb 14 exactly 2 weeks after seeing our factory partners. My head felt shaken like astigmatism in my brain. So haven&#39;t had a real period for a year and then after the vaccine worst cramps in my life. Then I have stomach hurting and GI issues every hour or so. Lastly my eyes have been red at night a lot and I would keep getting headaches from time to time for no reason and I&#39;m not a headache person.

                                                I had an instant reaction. With in mins of sitting after vaccine. I starting feeling hot, and very itchy on my right arm (site). I then noticed I was very red, and  itching more and more, around the same time. The nurse had looked over at me that gave vaccine and said you look very red and &#34;are those hives&#34; I had hives on my chest, arms, back, butt, and you could see the red rash/hives visually spreading. Roof of mouth also was itchy. They gave me 2 benadryl and water, asked me to stay and be observed for a half hour or so. I started feeling relief soon after benadryl. But, not full relief until much later that night. I also Had very painful and swollen lymph nodes at injection site, through my right breast and neck. for 3 wks or more. they might still be slightly swollen, but no more pain. Very scary. I had Covid back in November, I had symptoms of not being able to control my body temp since./ After I received vaccine, I aslo developed covid toes for a few wks and now my feet get very cold and purple almost black from just the slightest cold.

Thursday morning I woke with pain in my hips and Pelvis, and around 9am pelvic pain started that felt as sever as the pain I felt giving birth (20 months ago). Thurs/Friday and today (Saturday) it?s been so painful I?ve had a hard time walking, laughing, coughing and caring for my toddler has been immensely challenging. My period began Friday afternoon, a heavier flow than usual. To be clear I have VERY mild periods and am a very healthy young woman. This is unlike anything I?ve ever experienced and the only thing that is different was receiving the vaccine and upon further research it seems MANY women of menstruating age have been experiencing abnormal periods. Today I am still in so much pain it?s debilitating however it is less sever than yesterday (Friday) and the fatigue also continues even after sleeping 10 hours last night.

                                                I have endometriosis and my periods are heavy with painful cramps first 2 days and my period is done by the 4th day.  I take aleve a day before my period which helps with my cramps.  My last period started April 9th and I am still on my period today April 15th. I had heavy bleeding and blood clots the size of quarters for the first 5 days. The aleve didn?t seem to help and my pain level was at a 10, I would pass out from the pain. My period usually last 4 days and I am on day 7 and still bleeding, but not experiencing any cramps. I?ve read that Covid effects the blood clotting process and also read other women are experiencing heavier menstrual cycles after their covid shot. I also read that moderna didn?t study any side effects related to the menstrual cycle.  I have an appointment today (April 15th) to get my second shot. I am not sure if I should get the second shot, due to the amount of clots I had.

I was on my period/cycle on my shot date- March 27, 2021.. I starts very light bleeding on Saturday April 17th- the bleeding has increased and is very heavy today (4/21). I have symptoms of my normal cycles but the symptoms seem more painful/intense- stomach ache, fatigue,  and cramps.

All genetic testing on mom and additional health screens of baby were normal. On 4/25/21, lost mucus plug in the AM at 17 weeks pregnant with no other issues, concerns, abnormalities, etc. At 3:50AM on 4/27/21, ruptured membrane/water broke. Hospital testing confirmed 100% break of amniotic fluid with nothing left to sustain baby who had normal heartbeat and was still alive - measuring on target. Induced at 11:20pm on the 27th and delivered at 5:30am on 4/28/21 at 17 weeks and 3 days a baby boy measuring 8.25 inches and 5.6 ounces.   No placental infection or abnormalities. Pathology noted an abruption hematoma that could have resulted from induced labor. No trauma, blood work, or other explanations for early rupture of what was a perfectly healthy and growing baby.

                                                On 3/4/21, I was informed that I was pregnant with my 4th child. On 4/12/21, I was scheduled for my 1st dose of the Moderna as well as having a first trimester NCIT testing being done. At that exam, my provider was able to find a fetal heart rate (177), he was dated to be approximately 12 weeks and 6 days, and there were no concerns at that time regarding physical abnormalities or brain deformities. Additionally, I was sent out for bloodwork to rule out Trisomies and determined gender of the baby. The results of that lab work came back as negative and we were expecting our first son October 19, 2021. However, yesterday, 5/4/21, I attended my monthly prenatal appointment and the provider informed me that she could not find a heartbeat. She used a doppler scanner and then the in office ultrasound machine; neither of which detected a heartbeat. I was sent out to Radiology for a formal scan to refute or affirm the findings. Sadly, the results came back that I had lost my child. There was no heartbeat found and the results showed that my child stopped growing and remained 12 weeks in size. I am scheduled to have my pregnancy evacuated Friday, 5/7/21 at 1040a. While I am aware that miscarriage in 1 in 4 women, I cannot in good faith say that the vaccine may have contributed to my pregnancy loss. The only change in my routine was the addition of the vaccine. I am hopeful that this pain will not be felt by others and can be researched further to ensure fertility loss or future pregnancy loss isnt a norm following this vaccine.   Additionally, I have had 3 full term, healthy pregnancies prior to this miscarriage. None of these pregnancies had complications and the children were birthed without issue.

I was extremely weak. after I recovered from the two days of being miserable, my neck got really swollen and sore. I had mild soreness in my right arm at the injection site as well, but it wasn&#39;t as sore as the first shot. I drank a ton of water and took the tylenol muscle soreness medicine.  In addition to soreness on my left arm (injection site) from the first shot, my period also got heavier and I have spotting in between.

Patient was pregnant so was very concerned and went to the hospital.  Unsure how far along she was but she wanted us to know she had a miscarriage.  We are unaware if this is linked to the vaccination but patient is stating that&#39;s the only thing that has changed since her three previous pregnancies that had no issues whatsoever. Reporting this since she called the pharmacy so we were aware and since we are not aware if the hospital filed this report.

This progressed to two open wounds where sutures began to surface and had to be removed. After my second dose of the Moderna vaccine I developed another area on my right areola scar line that opened up to reveal another suture that required removal.

I also started to have vaginal bleeding when I wasn?t due to have a period. The rash got progressively worse, to spread all over torso back and front.  Vaginal bleeding also continued to worsen. Went to ER to have labs checked, was told it looked like Pityriasis rosea- and that all lab values and clotting factors were normal. Sent home with prescription for Atarax if needed. Was told it would be self limiting but if worsened to come back.

Took OTC Tylenol (2) po and had no signs of relief. Pain , swelling, and skin redness lasted for 3 days. On February 10th, 2021 I had a positive pregnancy test (confirmed by bloodwork and urine) which indicated I was 6-7 weeks pregnant and had a miscarriage on March 2021, after giving live births 3 prior times. The cause of the miscarriage is unknown.  I also developed a blood clot on the arm that was inserted for an IV. I have no family history or personal history of needing blood thinners.

I had my third frozen embryo transfer on 3/12, almost exactly the same time Alaska opened vaccine availability to anyone over the age of 16.  Our doctor?s advice along with everything we found online showed not much was known about the vaccine, but there was no firm reason to think there would be a problem with getting it in early pregnancy.  We also knew that being pregnant would mean higher likelihood of having severe symptoms if I got Covid-19, so I signed up for and was administered the first Moderna vaccine on the day of my first pregnancy test. 3/22 my beta HcG level came back at 72, confirming pregnancy.  As is standard, I was asked to come back three days later to confirm appropriate growth in those numbers.  By Thursday, March 25th my HcG level had fallen to 17, and by Monday, March 29th that level was less than 3. It?s impossible to know if the vaccine played a role in the early miscarriage, but I wanted to provide the data in case there are any trends or information can be learned from my experience.

On 2/5/21 I miscarried the baby and ended up hemmoraging thus requiring a blood transfusion. The fetus was sent to pathology and I was informed that at 12 weeks when I miscarried that the baby had termed at 9 weeks which was the time of my first vaccine injection.

By 0700 on 4/14/21 the rash was about 1/4 of the size, focused closely around the injection site. The rash was still raised, red and now itchy.   An additional and perhaps related adverse event was the start of menstruation approximately 3-4 days before the normal start date.   As both of these reactions are still on going, I can not report the outcome.

By Day 9, the rash was reduced in size. The rash is still red, raised and now itchy. Additional possible adverse event: mensuration started 4 days earlier than a normal cycle. As both possible side effects/adverse reactions are still ongoing, no outcome can be reported at this time.

Around 2 hours post injection my flow was increased **substantially** and I continue to have some pretty intense cramping, which is not my normal. I will be contacting my regular family physician when they open to follow up.

                                                Headache, fatigue - 3/15/2021-3/17/2021. Irregular menstrual cycle - period started on 3/19/2021, after only a 23 day cycle; next period started on 4/11/2021, after another 23 day cycle. Both periods were very early for me, more painful, but lighter flow. They also lasted a couple of days longer than normal.

Then 2-3 days later I began having nausea, and lack of appetite and began spotting (as if my period was beginning).  Light pink to red discharge that went away after 3 days.  My period was not due until the 19th of this month.  I developed a small headache that lasted approximately 12 days coming and going (rarely have headaches in past).  My hands have been achy like I have arthritis (which I&#39;ve never experienced this).  Also, diarrhea and disturbed sleep pattern.  My period is now late.  Its 4.23 and no symptoms of period or premenstrual syndrome.

I have a chronic GERD cough, but I cough a lot more than normal. Also, I was on my period and it made my normal cramps and low back pain much much worse. My entire lower body was in extreme pain. I usually have little to no cramps and my uterus pain was excruciating.

I got the injection of the second dose on 4/15/21 around 11 am and began bleeding and cramping due to miscarriage about 27 hours later. Miscarriage confirmed by OBGYN on monday 4/19/21.  I am blood type o-negative.  Will be tested for blood clotting disorder as possible cause of early pregnancy loss.  I should also state that I had a pretty severe case of &#34;moderna arm&#34; within just a few hours of the vaccination, maybe 4 hours, with approx 70% of my upper arm covered in deep red, hot, raised, swollen, and itchy skin that lasted several days.  I also got a fever of approx 101 degrees F about 20 hours after the vaccination.

                                                Estimated due date of pregnancy was november 2021. We experienced a miscarriage during the vaccine symptoms of the first shot. The second dose of vaccine was way worse than the first. I got a sore arm, aches, a headache, nausea, a fever, chills, pins and needles feelings in my hands and feet, heartburn, and dizziness. I kept feeling like I might throw up and I developed a great big rash on my arm again, called covid arm. I spent the entire day on the couch next to a bucket because if I got up, I was too light headed and nauseated to do anything. It lasted 24 hours or so. By day 3 after the shot, I felt okay other than soreness, a headache, and a big itchy rash at the injection site. We are concerned about the miscarriage but don&#39;t know if it was or wasn&#39;t related to the vaccine. I did have a big reaction and we wonder if my immune system gearing up targeted the very early fetus as an intruder. We are deeply saddened by our loss.

                                                I am a nursing mother and ended up with an inflamed, painful red breast on the side I received the shot several hours later. Knowing that covid-19 vaccine has not been tested on nursing mothers, I wanted to report side effects as I have noticed nursing peers also stating similar things. I believe this should warrant further data collection so nursing mothers can adequately prepare for this side effect. I had two nights of chills and fever and swollen breast with bruising. Took ibuprofen as well as natural mastitis remedy: sunflower lethicin.  Pain has subsided and swelling has reduced.

I initially thought it was a carpal tunnel injury that occurred during my move, but then realized that it was most likely a vaccine injection related side effect.  The tingling/numbing sensation comes and goes.  It was at its worst about midway between my two Moderna shots.   I had the second shot on my right arm on 5/14/21, and have recently started experiencing some tingling/numbness in my right hand as well.  (2 of 2) My period came early after the first vaccine shot on 4/16/21.  It did not feel like a typical period.  Based on my online research, I think it is possible that the vaccine caused &#34;the womb lining to shed, and lead to spotting or earlier periods.&#34;  After the second vaccine dose/shot on 5/14/21, my period is quite late (currently, by about a week).

                                                The same day right after the vaccination I felt weird but I left the mall after the 15 minute period and after I went home i vommitted and had back pains and just couldn&#39;t sleep at all. At last I took Advil because I had chills. My temperature at that time was 103 I felt tired and for the next 36 hours my temperature was between 99-100 and I was in the bed the whole time I took Advil and Tylenol. I had an appointment with my doctor just to make sure everything is okay I couldn&#39;t even go. I had diareeha for the longest time and then I had nausea and it went through for the longest time and I still have most of the symptoms my stomach hurts and I have headaches constantly. My blood tests are normal but i still can&#39;t past the symptoms and my doctor says it can be related to the vaccination. On April 12 I had my periods but it was not that I just understand what that was it was really bad the blood was all over my body I went to the doctor and still nothing. I went to the emergency room for that and they gave me some medications to stop the blood but it didn&#39;t help. my doctor did a dnd procedure because of the bleeding after the procedure I got the results and my tissue was of a pregnancy and I had a miscarriage and I didn&#39;t even know.

                                                Besides the normal arm ache, slight headache and some tiredness, the following day after receiving the Covid Vaccine, my menstruation cycle began. I was due for my menstruation cycle but when it came, I began to bleed heavily. This is not a norm for me - my periods are usually light with spotting at the beginning of my cycle. It was so heavy when it began on Friday that I bled through my pants. For the rest of the day, Saturday and the beginning of Sunday my blood flow was very heavy and I was constantly changing pads. I was going to contact my GYN doctor but then my flow slowed down later in the day Sunday thankfully. I just wanted to let your office know just in case other woman are reporting the same issue. Thank you.

                                                I was diagnosed with post-partum hypothyroidism 4/6/20 (labs below) and put on medication (levothyroxine).  Based on lab trends over the next 9 months, medication was weaned down and after labs on 12/28/20 (below), I was taken off medication as my physician felt that this condition was resolved .  I received my first COVID vaccination on 12/31/20.  Over the next month, I felt progressively more tired.  On 1/25/21 @noon I started having symptoms of hypotension unrelated to dehydration. These symptoms were intermittently persistent for the next  2 weeks.  On 1/27/21 @0400 I started having profuse uterine bleeding (menorrhagia) which resulted in a call to the MD later that day who recommended high dose ibuprofen and rest.  I omitted AM ibuprofen dose on 1/29/21 and received the second COVID vaccine on 1/29/21.  Repeat thyroid labs were drawn on 2/8/21 (below) and were  completely unexpected given previous lab trends.  My physician placed me back on medication and I will get my labs drawn again in a month.  Acknowledge that there isn&#39;t data with the COVID vaccine and autoimmune conditions; however, I am wondering if the vaccine induced the TPO antibodies  along with the COVID antibodies.  This may be something to look more into for other autoimmune disorders as well as more patients are vaccinated.

I had fever to 102 that started on the 22nd. The fever ended on 23rd. I took Tylenol - it didn&#39;t help on the 22nd but by 23rd it did. I felt fatigue -22nd and went away on 24th.  I miscarried 27th-29th -30th- that timeframe. The miscarriage prompted care. I went to Medical Center. I was not pregnant at time first vaccination. Estimated date of delivery had been - September 22, 2021; I have no prior pregnancy history.

I also had nightly episodes of hot flashes that lasted 5 days 4 weeks after my 1st dose.  I have never experienced a hot flash before in my life.  After my second dose, I began my period 6 days later which was 10 days earlier than expected.  It has also been much heavier than normal with unusual cramping in both my lower abdomen and lower back, much like my contractions I had with my first child during childbirth.

                                                Menses occurred halfway through my cycle. Which I have always been regular 28 day on the day cycles. This period began with spotting and progressed to a heavy, painful, period with heavy clotting. The clots were bigger than quarters, numerous,  and lasted a few days. This was unlike any period I have ever experienced. My periods do not give me any trouble and this one is as so bad. I almost called off work. I had to take a heating pad with me. It was not normal. My next period came early as well and now I?m over a week late. I took a pregnancy test and I?m not pregnant. To be concluded...  the conclusion of possible effects are yet to be determined

                                                The Moderna vaccine induced my menstruation. I am currently breastfeeding and had not been menstruating since becoming pregnant in January 2019. I had a baby since then and due to nursing on demand my period had not returned. Less than 24 hours after getting vaccinated I woke up to a moderate menstrual flow, bright red blood. I am still menstruating and experiencing mild cramping and bloatedness in my abdominal area. There was no prior indication this would happen before the vaccine. I had not even spotted before. My cycle has historically been very regular and I am certain the vaccine had something to do with stimulating my endocrine system and thus causing my menstruation.

                                                At day 13 after the shot, I noticed that my left breast was swollen, had pitted skin like an orange, was red, and had a large ridge through it. I am nursing and though possibly I had an infection, but never developed severe pain or fever as with mastitis. On  able to consult with a doctor on 5 March. He ordered an ultrasound of the breast to rule out any malignancies. The ultrasound found a superficial thrombophlebitis in the breast under the exact area of swelling, discoloration, and skin puckering.  After 3 weeks, the swelling has disappeared and the breast only remains slightly discolored the chorded vein is no longer able the be felt as it was previously.

                                                I completed my Moderna vaccine series on 2/5/21 to protect myself against COVID-19.  I also tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-December.   This past week I had a menstrual cycle, and I discharged a high volume of blood blots.  I am taking an oral contraceptive and my periods are  are normal frequency, length and flow, until this last period.  The clots could fill an entire maxi pad that needed to be changed every 2 hours, for about 48 hours.  After that single clots were discharged every 2 hours for another 2 days (and still occurring as I write this).  I sent my PCP (an OBGYN) a direct message in patient portal also reporting symptoms.

I thought that the breast on the same side (left) that I received the vaccine was more sore than the other breast (right).  One day I thought that I had put my sports bra on wrong it was so sore.  Another day I woke up from sleeping on my side because my breast was sore.  I also had some menstrual cramps.

It is important for me to note here that my period is always on time (within a day or 2). On May 9, I began to have some cramping. When I got out of the shower on the morning of May 10, I had begun bleeding. At this point, the cramps began to worsen. Often leaving me doubled over in pain (while common for some women, this is completely abnormal for me. I normally don&#39;t have any cramping at all.) The bleeding itself is heavier than usual. I&#39;m also extremely exhausted compared to usual.

I had three ultrasounds prior to my shot and all showed that the baby was normal and healthy. We also had normal genetic testing results with this pregnancy. We found out in 6/1/2021 that we lost the baby and based on the size of the baby when it passed, it was determined that the baby passed on 5/17/21 - the date I received my first Moderna vaccine.

                                                About 24 hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced extreme breast tenderness in both breasts. They felt sore to the touch all over, had the sensation of being full and heavy, and had to be supported in a bra in order to be tolerable. I liken it to postpartum pain associated with breast feeding and milk engorgement. I would list the symptoms the first night as moderate to severe. It limited my ability to do certain tasks because of the pain and discomfort. The breast tenderness has decreased in severity since then but it is now 1/11/2021 and both breasts are still tender. The severity is now mild. It&#39;s uncomfortable but does not limit my daily activity. Of note, I have had a tubal ligation and ablation and am not pregnant but I cannot track the timing of my cycle to know if the vaccine affected my cycle or caused hormonal changes that could explain the breast sensitivity.   I had arm soreness at the injection site for the first 48 hours but that has gone away. No other symptoms to report.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

                                                I was trying for a pregnancy and was likely pregnant but not detectable at vaccine number 1. Found out about pregnancy a week or so before vaccine 2.  (I was likely about 5 weeks pregnant then based on LMP of dec 22 with avg cycles of 35 days. Decided to get vaccine due to general advice that it is okay during pregnancy. (No known adverse effects). After dose 2, had about 10-12 hours of chills without fever and general fatigue. Shortly afterwards experienced mild cramps. This is my 5th pregnancy and I have no history of complications of any sort. Cramps are not usual for my pregnancies but I know it can be normal so I did not think anything of it. Mild spotting occurred but again did not think anything of it as I know it can be normal. I was scheduled for a first OB visit  Mar 3 where I should have been 10 weeks. (Initial positive pregnancy test was Jan 29). Ultrasound showed empty 5.6 week gestational sac with a yolk sac and subchorionic hemorrhage.   OB suspected pregnancy failure. We followed pregnancy with ultrasound of better quality 10 days later which showed a possible fetal pole and yolk sac but no heart beat and gestational sac measured at 6.0 weeks. Today March 18 awaiting repeat ultrasound tomorrow but started bleeding and cramping. Consistent with the start of the miscarriage. With no histories of abnormal pregnancies and with the gestational  sac consistently measure at 6 weeks (matching to about the time of shot#2), I am inclined to believe that the second covid shot stopped the progression of my pregnancy. I am a huge pro vaccine health care provider but would recommend now an investigation into first trimester covid vaccinations and possibly not recommend this during that time period.

The itchiness lasted until the following day. -Later that day in the afternoon around 3pm I had heavy breakthrough bleeding like I got my period which lasted for several days.  I finished my birth control pill pack the following weekend and got my normal period.   - In the afternoon of the 7th day after the shot my mouth was itchy again.  Later that night my arm was sore, hot to the touch and had a rash.  The next day the rash had spread down my arm.  My throat, tongue and eyes were itchy.  I called my PCP and spoke to a friend is an a doctor.  I took Advil and Benadryl which helped.  The rash and itchiness persisted from Mon - Thurs.   - 15 days after the shot I got a bloody nose that lasted for about 45 minutes.  I have not had a bloody nose since I was a child so thought this was worth mentioning.   - Around the same time I had headaches in the back of my head that felt like burning.

                                                3/15/2021 - Went to my midwife for my first prenatal visit and that&#39;s where I learned there was no heartbeat.   4 weeks along at the time of the vaccine and the heartbeat ended at 8 weeks along. This was my third pregnancy - and my first miscarriage. Estimated date of delivery was in October.

                                                The day I got my injection I started my period and it was the heaviest and the worst cramps I have ever had in my life. Ive had two kids and these rivaled contractions. The second day I spent about half of my day just laying in bed trying to but some pressure on my cramps so they didn&#39;t hurt so bad.   I believe the first shot threw off my cycle and I was about a full week late for my period by the time I got my second shot. My periods aren&#39;t super regular so that isn&#39;t so out of character but I can handle a lot of pain and this was more than ive felt in a long time. Im 3 days out and today I woke up with normal menstrual pain and still heavy bleeding. But was able tp function normally.

February 8th and 9th I had to call in sick from work due to the pain.  My family doctor believe that I was miscarrying due to the amount of pain I described.

                                                I keep extensive records of my period, especially since my surgery (uterine ablation). I was supposed to start on 4/14/2021. After my 1st shot on 3/17/2021, I started my period as normal. After the 2nd shot, I felt no symptoms that I generally have (cramps/headache). Around 9 pm on 4/14/2021, I began to experience the symptoms of the 2nd shot, which I expected. The symptoms (sore arm, headache, nausea, extreme fatigue) lasted until 4/16/2021. When I woke up on 4/16/2021 at 7 am I felt great and I started my period within the hour. I am not sure if receiving the shot and not getting my period for 2 days is related. Possibly stress. Not sure but thought it was worth noting for future studies.

Within 1 hour of receiving the vaccine I also began feeling body aches, fatigue, and joint pain. On day 3, I developed severe diarrhea,  which lasted for about 24 hours. On day 4 after the vaccine, I had some lymph nodes on the left side of my neck inflame.  They were tender and it would hurt to turn my head.   Also on day 4, I forced myself to go to work, exhausted.  On day after the receiving the vaccine, I started my period 10 days early. My cycle had always been predictable and regular. The headache continued for more than 6 days, the body aches and joint pain continued for 6 days. The lymph nodes in my neck have decreased but are still a little bit inflamed still today (4.25.2021) Also, still experience fatigue on a daily basis since the vaccine.

Starting 2-24 hours after shot I had paid and swelling under my arms, in the lymph node area. 48 hours after shot I have irregular menstrual bleeding. Not sure if it will be a once time thing, or turn into a full menstrual cycle.

                                                A few days after my shot I began the most painful heavy period ive ever experienced. Extreme cramping lasting 2 days and extremely heavy flow. Normally my periods are light and last only a day or two due to my birth control which ive been on for 2 years. I am also still experiencing extreme fatigue 5 days after receiving my first dose and a throbbing localized pain in one part on the left side of my forehead making it hard to keep my eyes open.

                                                After my second dose my next period did not start. I took pregnancy test every day for 10 days starting 2 days prior to period as my husband and I are trying. I am not pregnant and have yet to start a period. It is now 9 days late. I spoke to my OBGYN and after a series of questions she concluded its probably a side effect from vaccine.

But I thought it was just my menstrual cycle being funny. During t next 7 days my menstrual bleeding was extremely heavy.btoday I received my 2nd dose and approximately 2 hours after I started to have vaginal bleeding and this time I also have an extremely painful migraine on the left side of my head.

                                                Pt received first dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/2020. Initial question of whether vaccine was administered correctly - administering nurse never felt arm before administering and did say she thought she gave the injection &#34;too low&#34; and not on deltoid. The nurse mentioned that someone else had gotten a reaction from receiving the dose &#34;too low.&#34; Pt developed a red lump the next day at site of injection.  For first week or so, patient&#39;s symptoms decreased although she still experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness. Day 8 or 9 (1/6 or 1/7), pt woke up to arm being red, swolen, and sore again. Pt talked to infection control nurse at hospital, who advised her to go to clinic to get it seen by a provider because it looked like it might be cellulitis.  Pt presented 1/7/2021 with complaint of possible infection in right arm where she received the vaccine. Area was red, swollen, warm to the touch. Pt also had some breast tenderness. Pt was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IM x 1 in clnic and discharged.  Pt followed up the next day, 1/8/2021. At that appointment, symptoms had decreased. Redness and firmness of area had decreased and range of motion had increased. Pt continued to endorse soreness that traveled from right side of neck all the way down right elbow, but states it had decreased since 1/7.  1/12/21 pt followed up in clinic and stated arm was much better. Swelling almost gone and erythema much improved. Pt was able to use arm normally. Axilla still a little swollen, but no fever/nausea/vomiting/rash. Pt thinks she had ANA positive in past and c/f collagen vascular disease, in part because she has muscle ache flares for days to weeks.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

                                                Approximately five days after the injection, I had my first period since 2013.  Due to a combination of pregnancy (delivered 2/2014) and subsequently two Morena IUDs, I have not even had spotting since 2013.  For three days, I had period-like blood and cramping.  I reported this during my routine rheumatologist appointment who told me to report it here. Additionally, I had pain in the arm for three days as expected from the literature about side effects from the trials.  I am scheduled to have my second dose on 2/4/21 and will report any other side effects.

Today my period just unexpectedly started. I  am still breastfeeding so this is not great. Breastfeeding may not be able to continue with the return of my period so this is a huge deal for me and likely other women.

                                                I was pregnant when I got my second dose vaccine. I was on my first trimester when I had a miscarriage. I also had high fever which I took Tylenol for pain medication even though I had hard time bringing my fever down, I also do not know if it was related to the Modena vaccine or my miscarriage.  On 05-12-2021 I found out I was 11 weeks pregnant. I underwent  a radiology ultrasound where it showed my fetus died at 8 and half weeks.
