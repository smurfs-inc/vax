Onset of symptoms occurred in the early morning hours the day after receiving the vaccine.  Symptoms completely resolved by the next morning.  Treatment was conservative with Tylenol, rest, and hydration.  I missed one day of work due to this brief episode.  I am a SARS COVID survivor who had a very severe / life threatening case of SARS COVID 19.    I was hospitalized and treated from March 28, 2020 to May 16, 2020.

Insomnia that night accompanying whole-body aches/pains/malaise.  Pain most notable in extremities. Nausea more significant at 12 hours (i.e. 6AM) but no vomiting. Significant lethargy all day 1/22/2021. Pain/nausea gone by 6PM but lethargy remained.  Slept most of the day. Symptoms gone by following morning (1/23/2021), so roughly 36 hours.   Overall these were symptoms consistent with a really bad case of the flu, minus the respiratory symptoms.  I often work through illnesses like the flu.  Couldn?t work through this.

Within 48 hours I experienced flu-like symptoms (body aches, low grade fever of 100.1, chills) and then overnight experienced sweats . Woke up the following morning feeling better and now, 72 hours after receiving the vaccine, I am no longer experiencing any side effects.

These symptoms lasted for 48 hours and gradually subsided.  His wife (me) was so frightened that I will not be getting the Moderna series since it&#39;s so dangerous and will caution friends and family as well.

                                                I woke up approximately 2am 2/5/2021 the night after receiving the vaccination 2/4/2021 (about 13 hours afterwards) with severe chills, shoulder, knees &amp; most joints aching badly, bones in both feet aching with any movements, both arms sore along with severe stomach cramps &amp; nausea, these all lasted through the night and day with a fever of 101 at 7am but by 4pm all but the stomach cramps were replaced by just nausea but severe headache and weakness all over were felt.  I remained in bed until about 4pm 2/5/21 &amp; soaked in a hot bath which relieved the joint pains.  Headache, nausea &amp; weakness continued 2/6/2021 &amp; 2/7/2021 with the headaches coming if any sudden movements such as coughing or standing up too fast &amp; nausea irritated by eating anything but saltine crackers.  Today is 2/7/2021, took sick days from work 2/5, 2/6 &amp; 2/7.

At 7:06 am I noticed  left side facial swelling and slightly obstructed throat.  Swelling worsened only slightly from 7am to 9am. At 9am I took 100mg Benadryl and withing 45 minutes swelling was subsiding and breathing was normal. Arrived at ER at around 11:am. Was treated with EPINEPHrine, methylPREDNISolone and saline IV. Released after a few hours

                                                Temporary paralysis of left eyelid which was a symptom of Bells Palsy.   At the same time I experienced a very disturbing sensation of having  no saliva in mouth or throat.  I was completely dry and unable to produce saliva.  This is my description of the event: I woke up around 3am with rapid heartbeat, lightheadness, and upon opening my eyes I realized my left eyelid was drooping and I was unable to open it. At the same time I experienced extreme dryness in my mouth and throat where i had absolutely no moisture/saliva and was unable to produce any for approximately 20 minutes.   I walked to an emergency, which was just 2 blocks away,  to get checked out.  I told the attending nurse and physician what my symptoms were. Luckily by the time I was admitted to the ER the symptoms began to dissipate. My eyelid was slightly droopy but moving and i was able to produce saliva again.  I explained that I&#39;ve never experienced symptoms like this before in  my life and that I believed this was from the vaccine.  I had been experiencing symptoms every day since receiving the shot.... from headaches, to fatigue, to tightness in my chest, a cough,  pain in my larynx that towards my chest,  pain in my upper left abdomen, strange sensations in my legs, brain fogginess, and some swollen lymph nodes.

Went to ER and was given EKG, Chest X-Ray, and blood tests to check for heart attack. Symptoms subsided after a bit. Labs were inconclusive. Sent home. Continued to have lingering aching in the heart region the next day. Throughout the weekend, continued to experience alternating sweats and chills, nausea and increased pain in hip joints causing difficulty to walk.  Stayed home from work on Monday, March 8, 2021 with the same symptoms continuing.  Tuesday, March 9, 2021 began experiencing excruciating thigh and knee pain to the point of barely being able to stand or walk. Returned to the ER where they administered Torodol and pain subsided. Will be seeing primary care physician Tuesday afternoon.

                                                On March 16th at roughly 1:30pm, the patient received his first dose of the COVID19 Moderna vaccine. Afterward, the patient experienced no adverse side effects. About 48 hours later, however, at 2pm on March 18th, the patient&#39;s spouse attempted to wake him from a nap. The patient seemed much groggier than normal and his expression appeared vacant. When pressed by his spouse, the patient could not say who he was, or who his wife was. He agreed to travel with his wife to the hospital. At the hospital, a healthcare professional asked the patient who he was. He answered with his correct name. He also correctly identified his spouse by name. But when asked where he was, the patient gave a long and incoherent response. After this initial screening, doctors at the hospital evaluated the patient for a stroke. They ruled this out as a possibility. Next, they suspected the patient&#39;s MS lesions may have contributed to his &#34;cognitive event.&#34; However, after comparing his 2018 scan to a current scan, they determined this was unlikely the cause. After about 24 hours at the hospital, a neurologist hypothesized that the patient had experienced a seizure. Another doctor at the facility concurred with this assessment. By late Friday (more than 24 hours after the episode), the patient had regained most of their cognitive functioning, though he still experienced mild confusion around the week&#39;s events (even preceding the &#34;cognitive event&#34;). Prior to now, the patient has never had a seizure before.

First severe gout flare up in 18 months, I take allopurinol and get gout in both ankles, right knee and right big toe.  At approximately 3:30 am started feeling gout starting in the left ankle and took Indomethacin. Pain started to subside around 7 am, took another Indomethacin at 9 am. by noon started feeling close to normal with some fatigue. I cannot think of any of my gout triggers in the past week that could cause the attack. Did not see possible gout flare up as a side effect until I researched the web as my knee was on fire.

                                                Patient with prior Covid infection Nov 2020, fully recovered, received first dose Moderna vaccine on 3/13/21 and next day developed body aches, fevers, chills, shortness of breath. Admitted 3/17/21 due to hypoxia, had ground glass opacities on CT. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x 2.  Vigorous immune response could have caused lung inflammation and hypoxia, similar to a covid infection, but from the vaccine. 60YM with a history of a chronic inflammatory arthritis on methotrexate, hospitalization in November 2020 with Covid pneumonia, he was discharged on 1 to 2 L of home oxygen, and reports that he was told by his PCP about a month after discharge that he was able to come off the oxygen as his oxygen saturations had normalized.  He returned to his usual state of health and activity with no issues until he received the first dose of his Moderna covid-19 vaccine through his primary care office on 3/13.  The next day he developed arm pain and then progressive body aches, headaches, fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.  He presented to the ER and was found to be febrile with hypoxia and admitted for treatment and evaluation.   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with ground glass opacities on CT : oxygen 87% on RA in ER, 84% on room air 3/19, resolves with oxygen support of 2lpm.  CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x2 as well as respiratory virus panel, CT shows ground glass opacities, patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for empiric treatment for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although procalcitonin was negative.  BNP was elevated at 458, so an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was given 2 doses of furosemide during the hospitalization and BNP normalized. Patient was started on prednisone to calm down a possible inflammatory response triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine in a person who likely already has antibodies, causing hypoxia.  With this patient significantly improved and at discharge is on room air at rest, but still requires 2 L/min with exertion.  CRP was markedly elevated, supporting an inflammatory process.  Autoimmune lung disease panel was sent and is in process at time of discharge.  Patient requested discharge home, Discharged on a slow prednisone taper to avoid rebound with abrupt discontinuation of steroids.  Patient will complete 2 additional days of Augmentin and doxycycline at discharge.

                                                In summary this is a 60 year old male who was normal functioning presenting to hospital 4 days following second moderna COVID-19 vaccination with AKI, Rhabdomyolsis, Confusion/Delirium with agitation, multiple acute brain infarcts, DVT, and multilobar pulmonary embolism.  24 hours following vaccination patient began to become slightly confused while driving his wife to her vaccine appointment.  Symptoms progressed and included severe fatigue and muscle aches.  Patient was taking tizanidine and oxycodone to manage muscle / body aches which had been prescribed for his chronic back pain issues.  Patient was noted to be excessively sleeping, and also had fallen twice between vaccination and hospital presentation. 4 days following vaccination he presented to the emergency department with severe lethargy and confusion.  He was admitted with presumption of overdose of medication, given activated charcoal.  A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218. PT was 10.6, INR 0.99.  ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.22, co2 45, HCO3 18.4.  Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

                                                I haven?t had the chills like that in forever! It came in waves. You just lie there, hot, and ache all over, then this wave of chills hits for maybe 5 seconds then dissipates. The 2 mins later, it happens again! And this goes on for  an hour or more! I had to pee but was worried I?d be too cold to stand still. So I waited until I could not wait anymore. OMG! Trying to stand up! It?s as if my joints no longer worked! And when I did stand up I was dizzy as hell! The next day, utter exhaustion. I am so weak, it takes effort to move. Even breathing took work! I didn?t sleep all night as every position I lay in was uncomfortable and had twinges of chills. The amount of energy it takes to physically get up and walk to the bathroom is dumbfounding! This morning I am achy, hot and cold, exhausted, and just had a bout of dry heaves. I?m hoping to be able to get some sleep today.

The patient did not complain of any ADRs or fever immediately following the injection. However, the next day the patient fell in his room and when vitals were collected, he had a temperature of 102 F. Since the patient was febrile, him and his roommate were given rapid COVID tests, both of which were negative. The patient&#39;s PCR test has not come back yet. Per nursing report, the patient did not experience fever again over the weekend, it was a 1x occurrence. His temperature returned to normal on Saturday 1/2/21 and remained normal through Monday, 1/4/21. Besides fever, the patient did not complain of any other ADRs.

Pain when closing mouth resulting in some drooling from keeping mouth open.  Also some nasal drainage and feeling of unwell.  Telehealth appointment occurred on 1/8/21. Both corners of his mouth would raise when smiling so a stroke was ruled out.  Could possibly be a coincidence with the vaccine timing but healthcare professional advised us to report it here.

                                                10 days after receiving vaccine I experience spread hives and throat itchiness. Went to ED. Took Prednisone for the next 7 days with hydroxixyne which totally alleviated all symptoms. Also I went to my Primary Care MD for f/u. After treatment hives started again, then I started to take benadryl orally which kept my symptoms in check but today it came back worse again despite medication.

I had a moderate case of COVID in May 2020 and had positive IgG AB in August. The symptoms started with heavy shaking chills, lasting 1 1/2 hours , fever and most concerning sustained tachycardia with heart rate of 180&#39; to 200&#39; over hours, which then destabilized into runs of Vtach and complex ventricular dysrythmia, low BP, profound weaklness, head aches and joint and muscle pains ( similar to the experienced COVID symptoms )

The right sided headache continued for days. On Saturday evening Jan 16th it became the worst headache of my life. Like a fool I didn&#39;t go to ER until Monday morning when I developed left handed weakness. I was visiting my son and presented to the Medical Center ER where I was diagnosed with an acute sub-dural brain bleed and airlifted to Specialized Hospital. Was admitted to the Neuro-Neurosurgery Unit.

My resting heart rate was at 100 for a few hours.  Normally, it&#39;s around 76.    I noticed on deep breaths, I felt the need to cough (no phlegm, just a dry cough.  One or two coughs per attempt).  No medical care sought.    Those symptoms dissipated and I felt good.  Then on January 20 and 21, the chills returned.  They lasted about 8-10 hours, then they were gone.  I also developed a headache during the 20 and 21 episodes.  I checked yes in the below adverse recovery box, but I am uncertain as to what tonight and the rest of the days have in store.

                                                2/20/21-61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness and hypoxia. I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient was having low oxygen saturations this AM and required oxygen. He needed only 1.5-2L by NC but was mouth breathing so mask was used and 4L due to mask. This brought his saturations back up. He has been quite drowsy since receiving his second COVID vaccine on 2/17/21 and has not been eating and drinking much. Today he is not responding to nursing staff in a coherent fashion. I met with him in his room along, RN. He did not wake to my voice or touch. On examination he is sleeping and using accessory muscles to breath, especially his abdomen. NC/AT, face symmetric. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally anteriorly with no wheeze heard. No pretibial edema. 61 year old male with decreased level of consciousness. I will send patient to the ER due to his decreased level of consciousness and difficulty with breathing causing accessory muscle use despite normal respiratory rate of 17 but with hypoxia. I do believe his fever of 103 this AM was due to the COVID vaccine. I am concerned that he could be having a COPD exacerbation on top COVID vaccine symptoms and his bladder cancer is dragging him down along with dehydration from poor intake the past few days. I did call and speak with the ER provider and the EMS crew. They reported seeing a lot of this with the second COVID vaccine.  2/21/21-I received a call from nursing staff indicating that patient had worsening hypoxia with need for 8L of oxygen by mask. He was very restless and not making a lot of sense. He had receive Tylenol PR for a fever of 103 that was now only down to 101 and not budging. He was in the ER yesterday and diagnosed with possible Right middle lobe pneumonia on CT. He is already taking Levaquin. Due to his Oxygen need I did call to see about possible direct admission as he had a full work up the day before. The hospitalist was concerned that he might need BiPAP and so I did call and speak with the ER provider and she agreed that due to his new oxygen requirements he should be sent to the ER there and likely would need ICU. She was advised of the work up from yesterday so as not to repeat what wasn&#39;t needed. He was sent by ambulance due to his inability to sit up well. I received a call later that night from the intensivist in the ICU indicating that patient was reacting to the COVID vaccine most likely. He felt that there really was not much in the way of a pneumonia diagnosis as that has really not shown up on their imaging and all labs are normal including white count, CMP and blood gases. He is still requiring oxygen and is able to answer in sentences but is very drowsy and may be a bit confused. He has a minimal UTI and they will keep him given his low level of consciousness and hypoxia.

Due to past history of allergic reactions, gave him diphenhydramine at 3:42pm. He felt okay for a short period of time and then started to have tightness in his chest.  He could still breathe fine, but called 911 due to past anaphylactic reactions.  While on the phone with 911 he stated feeling more tightness in his  and then decided to give epi-pen shot in left upper left thigh at 4:02pm.  The EMT showed up immediately after and took patients vitals.  EMT advised if wanted follow up monitoring could take him to ER. Patient wanted to go to ER for further monitoring.  We followed up with patient&#39;s wife and she said he was still not feeling very good and had follow up appointments with his cardiologist.  He also came in the store on 2-26-21 and all his test were normal, but still was not feeling like himself.

                                                Was find 1st and 2nd day.  3rd day morning dizzy and loss of energy.   A little nausea caused me to lay down, stay home from work.  Rested.  Took Tylenol  and slept throughout the day.  Got up around 12:30pm, felt better, did decide to go for a jog to get body temperature  up.  Jogged for 60 minutes, returned, ate and rested again.  4th day, felt much better, no dizzyness, still a little tired but maybe 85% energy level.  5th day back to normal.

But  about Friday, my  right hand began to ache a bit. It became excruciating by Sunday.  My right elbow and my right ribs also hurt, but the joints in my right hand were on fire. I could not open, close, or flex it without severe joint pain. It was sore even to the touch especially at the joints.  The hand appeared to be a bit swollen as well. I took ibuprofen and it helped a bit. By Monday morning it was much better, but my hand still aches some.

I woke up at 2:30 a.m. and thought I&#39;d been hit by a truck, my whole body was aching like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced. I also got chills and was shaking I thought I was on one of those machines that shake paint cans. I also had (and still do) a headache. The body aches subsided about 10:00 p.m. (03/03/2021). It is now about 5:00 p.m. on Thursday 03/04/2021 and I still have a slight headache and I am fatigued but starting to get some energy. On my left arm where I got my shot it is very warm, red, and about the size of a goose egg in the area I got the shot.

I called them and they had me marked down for no show but once I explained they set up another follow up appointment.

Daily diarrhea, watery stool, cramping and bleeding lasting one month.  Currently slowly resolving.  Treated with a variety of remedies over the month, individually and in combination.  ( Pepto bismol, charcoal capsules, imodium, rice, tumeric, and Xifaxin)  Imodium would stop the cramping but not the wateriness of the stool.  Unlike any diarrhea over the course of my life. I will not be taking any booster shots.

                                                After first shot in series, I developed slight headache, minor weakness, minor shoulder pain.    After second shot in series, 8 hours post-injection, I developed headache, moderate to severe joint pain throughout, fever around 100, extreme fatigue and weakness, slight difficulty breathing.  Went to bed for 19 hours and began to feel better with recovery in two days.  14 days post-injection, I developed a systemic rash throughout my body. Consulted with my PC physician. Was prescribed  Medrol Dose Pack.  This had very minor effect on rash.  Returned to physician for consult upon completion of steroid series.  I then received a steroid shot intramuscular in right hip and one week oral steroid protocol.  This achieved a more positive result, almost clearing up the rash.  I had a consult with a dermatologist on 03/02/2021 who confirmed the opinion that the rash was probably a side effect of the Moderna vaccine.  The rash has returned fully as of 3/14/2021.

Symptom&#39;s then were- chills, complete body sweats (soaking), fever (spiked to 102F, but would subside quickly), intense body aches and pain, lost taste and smell.  All symptom&#39;s lasted for apprx 3 weeks, except sense and smell, that took  3 &#43; additional weeks to return to almost pre-covid.  I drank pedialyte and cranberry juice, took EmergenC, a daily Multi as well as extra vitamins C and D everyday.  For pain a took 6-800 mg of Ibuprofen as needed.  Did not lose my appetite.

                                                Received vaccine, and no reactions.   Nine days after the vaccine slowly had drooping on the right side of his face, numbness on the right side of his face, mainly around the mouth, a little on the eye, hard to close the right eye.  General soreness around his mouth when he tries to eat or talk a lot.  Limited movement of his face do to swelling, difficulty closing his eye, and headache.   Went to the ER on 3/7/21 and admitted him as they believed he had a blood clot, diagnosed him with Bell&#39;s palsy on Monday 3/8/21.  Was given corticosteroids for 9 days Prednisone 60 mg.  The symptoms are slowly improving but still has the Bell&#39;s palsy.

                                                The night of my vaccination I went to bed early. I was tired and a little achey. I woke up about 2:00 AM with significant discomfort in my chest. My chest felt heavy and when I inhaled it felt like someone was squeezing both lobes of my lungs. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to urinate. I went back to bed and tried to get back to sleep. The discomfort in my chest continued and seemed to get worse. I got back out of bed at about 2:45 AM and went downstairs where I walked around my living room to see if that would help me feel better. I continued to feel severe discomfort in my chest and lungs. I did not otherwise feel bad. I was not congested. I could  still take a deep breath but it hurt to do so.  I took my temperature and I did not have a fever. At about 3:00 AM I woke up my wife and she drove me to the emergency room at Medical Center. On the car ride to the hospital I started to feel much better. By the time I checked into the emergency room most of my discomfort had dissipated and only a very slight feeling of heaviness remained in my chest.

My wife sad she heard a loud noise and came into the bathroom to see what had happened. She called my daughter and son-in law to come over and get me up I couldn&#39;t move at the time, I must have hit my back and neck because they are sore. Then Saturday night I had sweats all night, today I fell a little better except for my back and neck, I have a doctor&#39;s app. Friday. I am concerned about the 2nd shot if the 1st shot did this to me.

While in bathroom, became dizzy, broke into sweats, and felt I was about to faint. I went to my knees holding onto counter. My wife came in to help me in bathroom. She observed I was incoherent but uttering moaning sounds and breathing heavily. She called 911. While on phone I came to and vomited into sink. It appeared I had not digested anything from dinner that night. After vomiting (1x) I felt much better.  First responders reported normal vital signs. I did not go to E.R. that night but went to Urgent Care later that morning and all seemed fine.

                                                started having intermittent headache on 03/08/2021 which he describes as dull pressure starting in his frontal sinuses and working the way posteriorly on both sides.  They are intermittently present and range from 2?5/10 in severity.  No associated photophobia. He has been taking Tylenol at home which provides moderate amount of relief.  He saw a provider on 3/15 and was prescribed high-dose Augmentin at that time which he has been taking without improvement.  He endorses subjective fevers and chills but his body temperature was 99 F.  Mouth ulcers started a few days ago. With that, it became very difficult for him to eat or drink due to excessive pain.   He became concerned because he was also on immunosuppression for transplant and ended up coming to the ER for further evaluation where he was admitted.   Of note, he was switched from Tacrolimus to Sirolimus 3 days prior to his vaccine  3/20 while inpatient, developed fever of 101. Blood cultures negative. Around time of drug changes and vaccine, patient also had a tooth repair.

                                                Abscess on the liver; missed his second dose; Fever; A spontaneous report  was received from a consumer (patient&#39;s wife), regarding a 61 years-old male patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced abscess on the liver (liver abscess), fever (pyrexia) and inappropriate schedule of product administration.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications was not reported.  On 13 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 19 Feb 2021, the patient developed fever and was hospitalized because of abscess on the liver. The patient was hospitalized for eight days and missed his second dose because doctors said that the patient was still weak to take the second vaccine dose. The patient was discharged on 27 Feb 2021. Treatment for the events included unspecified antibiotics.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, abscess on the liver, and fever, were considered as unknown.  The event, inappropriate schedule of product administration, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, and there is lack of patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications, based on the known risk and etiology of liver abscess, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 administration.

These symptoms have continued for 3 months after vaccine.  Initially after vaccine became acutely ill with high fevers 102-104 f.  Also became severely weak with severe muscle aches and  severe headaches.  This lasted for 7 days with worst at the beginning.  Then I have had the memory loss and equilibrium and loss of ability to spell simples words that I had no issues with before.  I have had these symptoms for 3 months.  I thought it would all get better but it has not.  I thought I better let you know these problems.  I did not want to but because they have continued I thought I better tell you.

                                                Onset yesterday (1/21/21) after stretching left shoulder.  Felt like itching and mild burning in left deltoid.  Rapidly increased to mild pain/discomfort/aching.  Went for walk.  Upon return, muscle tested and stretched arm to see if I had injured arm.  Afterwards, there was onset of pain, swelling, redness, increased itching.  Redness generalized over left deltoid with pronounced scarlet redness at site of injection, about 3mm diameter.  Today (1/22/21, Day 2 of flare-up, about 22 hours after onset of symptoms):  increased aching over entire left shoulder/trap/scapula with pronounced redness over slightly greater area on deltoid, itching at deltoid, hardness and swelling of deltoid.  Almost a burning sensation over the deltoid, but not quite.  Tissue feels irritated and hot.  Limited loss of range of motion.  Pain increases with use of left arm, pushing arm through ROM movements. Moderate headache at waking, relieved with 25mg Sumatriptan.  Still mild headache.  Mild lethargy and fatigue.

                                                He received the vaccine on Thursday.  The left nostril started running, then his eye started getting vision issues on Saturday.  He went to sleep and thought it would be better.  On Sunday morning he could not stand the sunlight at all, and pain on top of the eye.  He went to the ER and they called the eye doctor in.  He didn&#39;t know what was going on, had blood work done.  He told him to FU with his doctor.  Gave him eye drops, Ibuprofen and eye cream to go into the eye.  He is feeling better today, but when the light hits it a certain way the pain is bad, but it clears.  In the morning he has to get used to the sunlight.  His eye is red.  He is to FU with his PCP.

                                                On Feb 16, day 26 after dose 1, at around 7:30pm I started having continuous Chills suddenly and felt my body temperature rising. I confirmed with Thermometer every 15 minutes, going from 99.1F to 101 F in  the span of 2 hours. I took 2 Tylenols (500mg each) at around 9:30pm and started drinking  over 1 liter of water, fortified with Electrolytes... My temperature gradually started to go down  by 10:30pm and back to normal 98.7 F by midnight... I was worried that I have COVID (my Dose 2 was scheduled on 2/18). I went and did a COVID PCR test which thankfully came out &#34;Negative&#34; in the evening of 2/17.  I re-established my Dose 2 appointment  for today 2/18 same facility as Dose 1.  It is worth mentioning that on 1/29, 8 days after my first dose, I developed  sudden itching and redness at the site of the vaccine injection (right arm) and my skin was hardened around the site. Also,  this reaction lasted  24 hours and as if nothing happened in next day.

The chills lasted approximately 3 hours.  The body aches were not severe but lasted 24 hours, as did the shortness of breath.  I did go to work on the the 18th (the morning after the shot), but had to leave work early because I was too short of breath to stand up for very long and I also had trouble focusing on my work.

I needed to take Tylenol through the night which did help with headache.  The symptoms were significantly decreased by 6 pm that day (Feb 24th).

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA: I received my second dose of this vaccine about 9:45am on 2/24/2021.  About 7:00pm that same day I began to feel achy.  A few hours later I began running a low-grade fever.  The worst period of side effects was about 11:30pm - 1:30pm during which I had a fever of over 100,, with aches and frequent chills (pretty much every minute during those 2 hours I would shake with chills even though I felt extremely hot).  I was taking ibuprofen at the time (at 7pm and 11pm) yet did not experience any significant relief from the chills &amp; fever until about 1:30am.  I continued to feel achy the rest of the night with an off-and on low-grade fever (99-100), despite regular appropriate use of OTC NSAIDS (ibuprofen &amp; tylenol).   The fever went away by about 8:00am, and the overall achiness largely went away by 10:30am.  At no time did I require any other medical attention.

Patient breathing improved and skin became dry. Patient did says he was nervous because this is the first public event he has done since before COVID.

                                                I had the Covid virus early in November 2020 I had a bad reaction to my 1st Covid shot and wanted to ask if I should get the second one? I was able to get an appointment for a Covid vaccination thru store/pharmacy. I had the shot about 4:00 on Friday. On Saturday about noon I started not to feel right; head ache and stomach. About 4:00 I started to get an increase in my temperature. At 5:30 I started getting uncontrollable shaking. Over a span of about 30 minutes I had 4 or 5 episodes that lasted 30 - 45 seconds. I had a temperature at one point that reached 102.3 I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen every three hours before falling asleep for the night. On Sunday morning I still had a slight temperature (99.9), but it seemed like all my body joints ached. I ended up feeling better about 4:00 on Sunday. Reply

As the symptoms progressed, I felt aching in my lungs on the backside, and flu-like symptoms with no fever, and spasms in my feet and stomach region. Other symptoms have been dizziness, facial puffiness and tingling, with continued aching and tingling in the left arm. The  stiff neck and headaches and general malaise has persisted throughout even until now.   As a school teacher, I have taken the appropriate precautions and received a Covid19 test: Results negative.

He then reported having a strange taste in his mouth about 15-20 minutes after receiving the vaccine which lasted for 10-15 minutes. All of these reactions resolved on their own by about 30 minutes after the vaccine before he left the facility.

They continued through  the next 36 hours. Today (Sunday, 03.21.2021) the headache subsided, but the nausea and fatigue remain, albeit less so than yesterday. I had similar symptoms in the first 24 hours of receiving the first dose but understand that to be a very common experience.

                                                I woke up at 3:10 am feeling cold and chilling. I took by temperature and it was 98.4. I normally have a temperature of 97.1 - 97.7. I take it daily multiple times. My hands were cold. When I got up and started moving around I didn&#39;t have any more chills. When I got up at 6:30 am. I just didn&#39;t feel well in general. Slight feeling of sniffles, congestion.  I would get some aches that went away in a few seconds. They were at various points in my body, knee joints, muscles, and my head. They were simply a nuisance. I felt tired all day. My blood pressure was up 15-20 points on both numbers during the day. I&#39;ve told my doctor when my blood pressure is higher, I&#39;m having more aches and pains as though I&#39;m fighting a virus. I tolerated the symptoms most of the day, letting my immune system try to work it out. My symptoms seemed worse at 5:45 pm, so I took two ibuprofen. My temperature was 98.9 at that point. The highest it&#39;s been. All my symptoms got better until 1:15 am. I woke up feeling like I was chilling, but not as bad as yesterday, so I took two more ibuprofen. I feel 50% better today and haven&#39;t taken any ibuprofen. Here is the really strange part. I had these exact symptoms and similar temperature ranges twic last year. In July and October I think. I didn&#39;t get tested last year because they were minor symptoms. They were just nuisance symptoms. I took ibuprofen right away last year.  I followed the masking guidelines, social distancing, etc. So, is it just coincidence I had similar symptoms last year two times, that I had when I getting the inactive Moderna vaccine? I had no reaction to the first shot.  I just wanted to provide the information in case it is helpful. Very strange. I expect no other symptoms in a couple of days.

Patient monitored by EMS provider x 1hr, no s/s adverse reaction. Patient started walking out of facility on his own and came back reporting he felt dizzy. He was initially hypertensive with a pulse of 70, respiratory rate 12, systolic BP 188.  We had him lay down and about 10 minutes later his blood pressure was 140/70.   After another 10 minutes or so we had him sit and drink water but his dizziness, while improved, did not go away and he started to have chills and was visibly shaking so 911 was called as we did not feel he could drive himself home. Patient was monitored in the emergency department at Hospital x 1hr and released with blood pressure WNL.

                                                Thursday Nite starting at 11 PM:  A warm feeling at the top of my head like a heat lamp.  Lasted 15 Minutes.  Then Left Leg, Two Toes start pulsating/shaking uncontrollably.  I rubbed with the right foot...it would stop...then start back up.  Lasted 30 Minutes.  Then my chest started feeling like I had a bad sunburn on my skin.  Lasted 30 Minutes...all the while these strange things were going on, I noticed I had asthma.  I ONLY get asthma if I have a cold or flu.  I thought to get up and take an inhaler but decided against it worried about an adverse reaction to the vaccination. I fell back to sleep and awoke with no asthma and all strange symptoms gone. Then Friday afternoon I developed chills and a queasy stomach (belching and gas and loose stools.)  I checked my temperature (on multiple occasions) and it was normal. These two conditions lasted until  Saturday.  Also on Saturday, I developed aches in my neck. Then very late Saturday Night, I awoke to a sweat drenched tee shirt but chills were gone. Sunday...today....I feel perfect.

Found approximately 10 red, raised spots or &#39;welts&#39; on skin that he had never seen before. They were sporadic, NOT clustered. He described as not quite hives. He checked bed for &#39;bugs&#39; but didn&#39;t find anything. He had taken metaxolone for only the second time in his life before bed. Prior use did not elicit any type of &#39;rash&#39; as described. He applied no topical nor ingested any oral medication at this time. He mentioned he has IBS and also had 1 instance of diarrhea. He then took 1 imodium. He was able to eventually fall back asleep. When he awoke the next morning, all but 1 spot were gone and no indication this had ever happened. He has experienced a mild headache off and off since injection, but nothing significant that keeps him from his normal business.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included asthma and unspecified allergies. Concomitant product use included unspecified allergy medication and asthma/bronchitis inhalers.   On 02 Jan 2021, the same day as the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 02 Jan 2021, the patient experienced coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and sinus congestion. The patient tested positive for COVID-19. The patient was taken to the hospital where he was treated with an infusion.  On an unspecified date, a computed tomography scan showed bronchitis. Additional treatment for the events included unspecified antibiotics and steroids.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events COVID-19 and bronchitis was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report concerns a 63-year-old male patient who experienced the serious events of COVID-19 and bronchitis. The event occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot #: Unknown, expiration date-Unknown). Treatment administered included antibiotics and steroids. Outcome was unknown. Although a temporal association exist, there is not enough information to adequately assess the causal association between the reported events and mRNA-1273 vaccine administration.  Critical details such as diagnostic test for COVID infection prior to vaccination was not ascertained. Causality is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Main field defaults to possibly related&#39;

If I do anything at all other then set my oxygen levels would drop into the low 80&#39;s.  I have also been monitoring my sugar levels.  I am not diabetic but did so because in ICU was using steroids which elevated sugar levels.  I continued to monitor it at home because I had to do injections for several weeks after leaving the hospital.  Have not had to use insulin til the other day.  Vision is very blurry.  Had that problem in the hospital but it has gone away but since I had the first vaccine everything is now blurry.  Left leg hurts to put weight on the heel. I have nerve damage to the left leg but this is a unique issue.  I&#39;m running a low grade fever 100.2 - in the morning it is normally 96.5-97.6 and this temperature was in the morning the day after the shot.  Neck is very sore.  I have rods from C3-C6 and the pain is in the muscle glands closer to the surface.  It is almost like it is attacking all areas of the body I previously had issues.  I spent October 25 - November 13 in Hospital, majority of time in ICU.

Muscle aches and pains, joint pain, lower back pain right side, headache.  Fever broke after 24 hours.  Some continued weakness for a couple days.  Then back to mostly normal.  10 days later, mild fever returned in the evening of 2/9, and 2/10, temp of 101.  These second rounds of fever went away during the day.  And temp was between 99.8 and 101.2. My question is:  Is it normal to get a mild fever 10 days after 2nd vaccine shot?

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Jan2021, the patient tested negative for COVID-19). On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, and feeling weird/funny.

No death certificate was issued at the time of the report but the reporter believes it will list cause of death as COVID complications.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided. Based on reporter&#39;s causality the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19

                                                Patient is meeting diagnostic criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome post-vaccination.   He received his 1st Moderna COVID vaccination on 12/31/2020 (037K20A) and his second COVID vaccination on 2/5/21 (029L20A).  He began developing high grade fevers on 1/22/21 and was admitted to our facility on 2/8/21 due to &#34;fever of unknown etiology&#34; associated with hepatitis and coagulopathy on laboratory studies.  He underwent an extensive evaluation which failed to reveal any other infectious, rheumatologic, or hematologic explanation for his clinical syndrome.  He was ultimately discharged to outpatient care with ongoing supportive care for his fevers.  His liver associated enzymes were improving at discharge.

                                                I had a nasty reaction to 2nd dose of Moderna 8-12 hours after. Began with body aches and chills so severe it was hard to breath. No fever. When I got under covers and warmed up so chills subsided and breathing returned to normal it felt like I was being squashed in a Panini press. Every cell in my body felt like it was vibrating in pain. I had to get up ever hour or so to urinate. I would be back in sever chill mode before i made it to the bathroom and it took about 5 minutes back in bed for chills to stop and breathing back to normal. I was also nauseous the whole time but did not vomit Then. The room temperature was 72F. This continued for 12-14 hrs.  I then tried to drink cranberry juice and eat 3 bites of a banana which  I immediately regurgitated. The rest of the day I was drained of energy. No sleep 48hrs. 3 days

It almost like little shocks going thru my body. I had a video appointment with my Dr. and he prescribes doxycycline and prednisone.  The next day the fever went away and started to feel better (48 hours later).  I also tested positive for Covid on 12/24/20, I didn&#39;t wait 90 days before I got my vaccine.  I felt awful with the second dose, almost worse than being in the midst of Covid. I&#39;m currently on Workman&#39;s Comp. I&#39;m constantly out of breathe and have no energy, I use to have tons of energy. From my atoms apple to my sternum I have tons of pain. My lungs feel like I&#39;m smoking and have tons of pressure.  My Dr. ran test because I have the worst head aches. I&#39;m like slow motion.

Nausea and slight headache during the  night at about 3:00 AM that went away in a couple of hours. Arm pain persisted the next day. The following day the pain also involved the armpit, possibly lymph glands. Lesser pain at the injection site and arm pit areas the following day and was very slight the third day after the injection. Can?t wait for my second dose and despite the side affects will happily stand in line for my next dose.

But approximately one week later I developed rashes on the back on my neck and both wrists. They aren&#39;t conspicuous, but they do itch. I&#39;ve had them for about two - three days. The rashes are slowly subsiding.

Pain is substernal, radiated to the left arm, associated with lightheadedness.  Denies diaphoresis or nausea.  Per EMS there were short runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia  3/18: - remains inpatient admission as of 3/18/21 @ 0900 63 y.o. male with a past medical history of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.  He states he was lifting a couch yesterday and his heart started beating fast.  He did not really have any chest pain, but felt a little bit lightheaded.  He called an ambulance and they brought into the ER.  In the emergency room his EKG did show some frequent PVCs.  However, he did not really require any intervention.  He was given 3 nitro, but it really did not make any difference in the way he was feeling.  The patient denies multiple times that he actually had chest pain.  He states he just felt like his heart was beating funny.  The patient&#39;s most recent stress test was a nuclear stress test in May of 2019.  Overnight, the patient has felt very well.  He denies any significant chest pain.  He denies any further heart palpitations.  On the monitor he would occasionally going to bigeminy, which is not abnormal for him.  EKG this morning was unremarkable.   After speaking with the patient&#39;s wife, she told me that he has had a several month history of very limited exertion.  She states every time he exerts he becomes extremely dyspneic and has heart palpitations and sometimes almost passes out.  She states last night he was extremely diaphoretic and very nearly passed out.

After 5PM mainly 101 fever, tired, muscle aches, headcahes, chills, hair follicles hurting ( had this when I had COVID-19 mid-March 2020); My symptoms from the 1st shot brought back memories of how the COVID-19 virus felt, except I did not have the congestion and sinus issues.  Fever broke at 3AM morning of March 13, woke up soaking wet, entire body and hair drenched as if I stepped out of the shower, did not dry off and got into bed. Felt fatigued Day 3 but feeling a lot better, able to be more active. Today is March 19, 8 days since shot #1 and my arm at the Vaccine site is still a bit sore, redness has subsided however.  Worried post shot 2 may be worse.

                                                In November of 2020 I was diagnosed with COVID 19 and subsequently recovered.  This was my first Moderna shot.  I took the shot in the right arm and completed my work day with no side effects.  I went to the gym that night - as usual - and wanted to &#34;work that arm&#34; a little.  I had a good workout, no issues.  Went home, ate and went to bed.  About 1 or 2 am I woke up with the hottest raging inferno flu-like fever I can recall having as an adult.  I did not want to alert my wife, so I simply stayed in bed and did not measure my fever level.  My guess is it was &gt;102.  Fever continued until a.m. and deep body pain hit me.  At dawn my fever measured 101.  I took acetaminophen and took a cold shower.  Fever subsided for a short while.  Then it came  back.  I felt weak and flu-pain so I stayed home from work and simply slept it off.  Symptoms slowly subsided by 7pm day 2.  Day 3 I was not 100% but I went to work and was fine.  No other symptoms since.

I put a heating pad on the bed and even though the bed and pad felt warm, the chills continued for about 10 minutes. Later in the night, my daughter came and checked my temperature. It was 105, even though I didn&#39;t feel like I had any fever. I took some Ibuprofen and my daughter put a cool damp cloth on my forehead. I never felt hot. In the morning, the area in the bed where I was sleeping was completely soaked!  My temperature was normal.

I couldn&#39;t sleep, my thinking patterns were little confused, I was confused. I was also having adverse dreams.  By Monday the fever went down, and the body aches and tiredness went down some. On Monday I went and got a COVID test and got a positive. Up to time of vaccination I have tested negative. The place that gave me the COVID test said it could be a false positive due to recently being vaccinated. The person from the COVID test said it was safe to get the 2nd dose. I feel okay right now and I am out and about.

                                                36 hours following the vaccine I was having a bad headache, moderate to severe pain at injection site, and severe diarrhea.  The diarrhea lasted about 12 hours.  I also felt general discomfort over entire body as if I had flu.  This discomfort lasted for approximately 2 to 3 days.  I was unable to perform normal activities during this time.

Not horrible, but enough that I didn&#39;t feel like moving. I got up to go to the bathroom, and was uncovered, and then I got chilled. I went back to bed, and now at 07:30 am, I don&#39;t feel much better. My temperature is 100.6. It&#39;a normally 96 to 97.

                                                I left the vaccination feeling nothing at all. I awoke the next morning with a moderate pain/discomfort in my left upper arm at the vaccination site. I went to work because I felt okay.  I have five years of recovery.  As a result every 8-12 moths I undergo an episode of about three days where my brain forgets how to sleep properly.  So the morning after my injection, I was on my second day of irregular sleep. Around 10 am, the side effects started kicking in.  I had a slight to moderate pain above my ear on the right side of my head.  I probably had a slight fever as I felt warm and sweaty for about four hours.  I felt slight to moderate chills during the height of my discomfort for about four hours.  I could hardly walk the five blocks to my girlfriend&#39;s home because I was very conscious of my breathing.  (I have been a heavy cigarette smoker for 4o years and an developing a heightened awareness of my breathing and pulse as I feel that I am overdue for a stroke or heart attack after 40 years of heavy smoking.)  Therefore his side effect was largely hypochondriacal.  I took off work yesterday even though the side effects had subsided. Today, I feel great. I feel so great that I laughed at the entry below - &#34;Patient Died&#34;.

Hospital where the ambulance took him initially diagnosed it as Bells Palsy and prescribed prednisone and an anti-viral.  After an MRI the next day on Monday, he was diagnosed correctly as a stroke.  On Tuesday, he was airlifted to another hospital and was in the ICU for more than 2 days. Patient spent the next 7 days in the neuro-trauma step-down unit with the results of the debilitating stroke.  He is unable to swallow and his entire left side is affected as well as vision and hearing.

                                                Eight minutes after the shot, I started felling unwell so I started my Apple Watch to see my heart rate.  It was at 86 and a minute later it was at 116 and a minute after that it peaked at 119.  It fell to mid 90&#39;s a couple minutes later, then went up to 105 fell back to mid 90s, then rose to 117, fell back to 80, and kept rising and falling until about 3pm.      The technician told me before my shot that it would be a few minutes as they had to do something the vaccine.  I don&#39;t recall what she told me.  I think she said they had to switch a vial or something.  You&#39;d have to ask her what happened before I had my shot.  This morning I have tingling in my thumb, forefinger and middle finger in the arm I got the shot.  I did sleep on the arm that had the shot .

                                                I experienced body aches and major fatigue right after receiving the vaccine on 03-04-21.  It was worse on the second day.  On the third day my right hip area and right leg was very sore and tender to the touch and noticed a rash on my hip area.  The rash spread all over my right leg and foot and the pain got worse.  My toes and foot became numb.  I took Tylenol and Aleve to relieve the pain for a few days however I did not improve for a week.  I visited an emergency care on 03-13-21 and was diagnosed with Shingles and I was prescribed Famiclovir.  I started taking  the meds as of yesterday and I am still experiencing pain all over my leg and numb foot.

I received the first dose of the Moderna Anti-COVID19 vaccine at the Outpatient Clinic on Feb. 17, 2021 at 1:31PM. I have been suffering from Gulf War Illness (GWI) for over four years. a. My condition is a combination of ME/CFS and Fibromyalgia. Please review these CDC pages for details: https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm. b. GWI a neuro-immunologic disease that is still not well understood by the medical community.   2. Feb. 17, 2021. I received the FIRST MODERNA VACCINE SHOT on my right arm on Wednesday, Feb. 17, 2021. The injection site hurt for two days (Feb. 17 &amp; 18, 2021).

Feb. 19, 2021. I had a headache. 5. Feb. 20, 2021. On Saturday, Feb. 20, 2021, I walked one mile in 29 minutes.  I felt tired, weak, short of breath, and I had to stop walking on 4 separate occasions. I produced phlegm. The phlegm secretions were white, very thick, and extremely sticky.  I started Mucinex 1200MG (guaifenesin) and Neil-Med Saline Solution nose irrigations this day.  6. Feb. 21, 2021. On Monday, Feb. 21, 2021 between 1AM to 7AM, I had itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and swollen neck glands. 7. Feb. 22, 2021. From 8AM to 4PM my side effects were itching at the injection site (right arm), chills, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, swollen neck glands, coughing, and stomachache.  At 5PM I had difficulty breathing.  It lasted until 8PM. I took albuterol via nebulizer and was observed by my wife and son to ensure that I did not get worse.  8. Feb. 23, 2021. No side effects. 9. Feb. 24, 2021. I had a headache and a runny nose. 10. Feb. 25, 2021.  It has been 8 days since I received the first dose of the Moderna COVID19 EUA.

Mar 3, 2021.  I had four explosive vomiting episodes starting at 10AM. Initially, I thought that the vomiting had nothing to do with the Moderna vaccine. However, my son ate the same food that I did and he did not vomit. I vomited so hard that my son wanted to take me to the Emergency Department, but I refused.  I vomited four times today Saturday, March 3, 2021. Every time I vomited it sounded horrible to my family members. The vomit had an extraordinarily strong nasty smell.  13. March 4, 2021 to the present. I have not experienced any Moderna vaccine side effects side March 3, 2021.   In conclusion, for any questions regarding this Adverse Event Report please email me.

This side effect has continued a second day causing me to notify my primary care provider and preparing this event report.  Other side effects experienced after the second vaccination were soreness at the injection sight, mild fatigue, and slight fever which were all anticipated. These side effects have passed.

The patient&#39;s medical history included history of congestive heart failure; triple bypass surgery done in 2017. The patient received dialysis on (Mon, Wed, &amp; Fri), and was on oxygen 24 hours a day. The patient has allergy to valsartan and morphine. No Relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Mar 2021, approximately within one hour prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: Unknown) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Mar 2021, while at home, within an hour of receiving the vaccine, the patient started to experience chills and feeling freezing. The patient was taken to the hospital. The patient also experienced vomiting, complained of chills, developed abdominal pain, and had difficulty in breathing. The patient was currently in the intensive care unit. The patient&#39;s carbon level was high, needed a pit line and under bypap. The patient also had developed fever. Treatment medications included unspecified antibiotics and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) given to the patient at the hospital.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, chills and feeling freezing, vomiting, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, fever were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                On 03/26/21 received my shot and about 20 minutes later i started to have side effects. My lower back started to hurt, a bad taste came into my mouth, I started to feel woozy like i was looking through a glass gallon jar. A PA came in and took my blood pressure which was very high for me. I walked around for awhile and felt a little better. Took a trip to  to pick up a Discharged patient but had to stop several times because my heart was racing causing me to start sweating. On 03/27/21 around 02;30 am i woke up to a left arm swollen down to my finger tips. Both of my legs had severe muscle cramps in the upper and lower muscles. It took 2 hours to come out of that. My leg strength was almost gone and now I had a severe pain in the ball of my left foot.  The site were I had to shot was  burning like it had been branded.  I had brain fog couldn&#39;t remember what i was doing up.  Though I had no breathing problems I was sweating like I had a bad fever. I noticed also that my vision became light sensitive! It was hard to watch the tv with the screen light which looked too bright to me. The site on my left arm were I strained the muscle hauling 70 lb sandbags became a very sensitive area.  the swelling on my left hand was so bad I had to put lotion on the creases to relieve the stretching pain I felt. The headaches are a constant now even with my ears starting to ache too. Also the my eyebrow hair was very sensitive to touch.  Had to go to the bathroom a couple of times but not as much as i thought I would. Both shoulder blades are constantly aching like my left hand fingers.

                                                I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye; painful stiffness in the injection site arm; felt a little tired; joint pain in the injection site arm; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) in a 64-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 038A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Cataract (cataract surgery, left eye) on 26-Mar-2021. Previously administered products included for an unreported indication: SHINGRIX in 2020.    On 27-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 28-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (painful stiffness in the injection site arm), FATIGUE (felt a little tired) and ARTHRALGIA (joint pain in the injection site arm). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, OPHTHALMIC HERPES ZOSTER (I developed shingles around the outside of my left eye) had not resolved and MUSCULOSKELETAL STIFFNESS (painful stiffness in the injection site arm), FATIGUE (felt a little tired) and ARTHRALGIA (joint pain in the injection site arm) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       Treatment for the ophthalmic herpes zoster include sulfamethoxazole 160mg BID and valacyclovir 500mg 2 tablets TID. Company comment: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and recent history of cataract surgery the event eye herpes zoster is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. For the other events the causality cannot be excluded.   On 05Apr2021, his eye Dr assessed the area with shingles and thought that the shingles was most likely due to the trauma to the eye from the surgery.

I put the thermometer on my nightstand thinking it prudent to have it handy. In bed under covers I kept feeling cold and started shivering/teeth chattering, within an hour or so my forehead thermometer read 102. My recollection of the time between midnight and 2 to 3am is vague as I was very disoriented, I recall taking my forehead temp several times during those hours - that took a lot of effort, and I saw several readings of 105 and I believe one over 106. I remember thinking I should be in the ER, then thinking how could I get there, then thinking I would call 911 but that I could probably not get my mind/body to be able to physically make a phone call. I believe that during this time span I had brief periods of consciousness when I was somewhat aware that I was having a high fever event, but that there wasn&#39;t much I could do about it (I live alone). By 4am I was more aware, forehead temp reading was 102.something - I got up and made my way to the kitchen, I was unsteady on my feet and remember telling myself to be careful and not to fall. Temp gradually dropped throughout Tuesday, mostly back to normal on Wed.

The event of death occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. The events of fever, body pain and loss of appetite occurred an unspecified period of time after the first dose of mRNA-1273.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Definitive causal association is confounded by age and medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia.

                                                Flushing and pressure feeling in my head/face and ringing in my ears increased immediately after injection. Then proceeded to get a slight noticeable increase in heart rate.   After setting for approximately 15 minutes I was released to leave. I mentioned to them that I just lived down the street and told them if I had any further issues or symptoms I would call them.  Approximately 30 minutes later I was having a slight lightning of the throat or airway and some slight tightness in breathing.  This tightness continued for approximately 2 hrs. I called the clinic and was attempting to get there recommendations but the nurse had left. I was told to get the ambulance personnel. As a prior EMT I felt that an ambulance was not needed at this time. I took 2 ea   Benadryl tablets and those symptoms lessened. Some numbness in lips and face, and felt heart beating in lips. That all subsided as well after taking Benadryl.  Still trying to get with a provider that could give me advise moving forward. The doctor was busy with an Emergency.

                                                Within #12 hours after receiving vaccine shot,  uncontrollable chills followed by fever.  took #2 tylenol regular dose to reduce fever.  It appeared to work during the night.  The following day 1.28.21,  incurred uncontrollable chills again at appr 3pm with fever that followed.  Unfortunately after four hours, chills &amp; fever came back. Treated again with tylenol to control fever. This lasted from 3pm on thursday 1.28.21 to Friday morning 7.30am.  Once again I took tylenol ever #4 hours since that was the time I woke up with chills again.  Note that I had Covid in October 2020 and the lasting effects remained in my system until 12.17.20.   I was healthy on day of vaccine shot 1.27.21.  At the time of this writing , I am hoping that after #48hrs after the shot the adverse issues will stop.

Four hour after injection, patient exhibited extreme bilateral pain in muscles in the thigh. I would rate the pain as 9/10.  Pain lasted 5 minutes and resolved.  An hour later the pain returned this time for more than 20 minutes.  Twenty-four hours later, same muscles are exhibiting a strong burning sensation. Patient was also somewhat dehydrated at the time.

                                                At approximately 20 hours following injection developed high fever (102&#43;) rapidly. Fever ceased at 12:00 pm. Accompanied by severe body aches and uncontrollable shivering. Today I have extreme muscle soreness in mid to lower back and in joints of my limbs. Also severe headache that ibuprofen could help. I had covid in July of 2020 with moderate symptoms.

                                                History      Chief Complaint Patient presents with ? Elevated Blood Pressure ? Dizziness     multiple times a day   Patient who presents to the emergency department today for evaluation of hypertension, head pain, blurry vision, and neck pain. He states about 6 months ago he had open heart surgery. Since that time he states that he has been having intermittent episodes of blurry vision usually lasts a few minutes and resolve on their own. Today however, he notes that the blurry vision lasted for greater than 5 minutes and he started to become concerned. During that time he also began to experience some pain in his neck and a headache in the back of his head. He took his blood pressure at that time and noted that his systolic blood pressure was in the 190s. This alarmed him and so they called EMS. When EMS arrived they rechecked his blood pressure again and his systolic blood pressure was over 200. Upon arrival here to the ER he states that he is feeling much better and his blood pressure appears to be better as well. At this time he states he still having some right shoulder pain and a little bit of right-sided neck pain but he does state that he had his Covid vaccine yesterday in his right arm. Currently patient states he still has a little bit of a posterior headache but it is much improved. He denies any fevers, body aches, chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, or swelling of the lower extremities. He has no known drug allergies.       ? ED Course: I discussed physical exam finding with patient. Apparently most of his symptoms have already resolved at this time. His blood pressure is back down to 142/98. I still advise since he was having some weird blurry vision I would like to get a CBC, CMP, troponin, EKG, and a chest x-ray. Patient agreeable to this plan of care. We will also continue to monitor his blood pressure to ensure that it does not spike back up.     Patient&#39;s work-up was unremarkable. His blood pressures down to 123/60 and states he is feeling much better. This point time it sounds like what happened was a hypertensive urgency. I advised him he needs to contact his PCP and schedule close follow-up discuss if anything further needs to be done. At this time though he is safe to be discharged home with strict return precautions.

                                                I awoke at 3:00 a.m. this morning (Feb 16) with itching in my skin beginning to be felt. By 3:30 am it was widespread and developing a rash over much of my torso and arms. This appears now to have run its course. My nose and lips swelled. My nose became hard and numb. Both now less swollen than early on. My body temperature was 95.4 degrees. I felt dizzy when standing, and there were waves of mild nausea. I had major nasal congestion and could breathe only through my mouth. My CPAP machine (which I use all night every night) was on before the 3 am wakeup, and I donned it again when I returned to bed at around 4 am. Nasal congestion now has improved a lot. On two occasions  (maybe around 4 am) I noticed a minor wheeze. On a couple of occasions I coughed lightly, and it was a sore one from the chest. I still have some dizziness, and now an intermittent headache. Before going to bed last night I took two Naproxen Sodium PM tablets for some neck pain.

This subsided in appx. 30 minutes however I suffered a very poor night?s sleep. Following day, Feb 20, 2012, I felt as though I had a very mild virus with achiness in neck and shoulders primarily with lesser discomfort in back and legs. Was a mildly fatigued with mild headache as well. Did not check temp but never felt feverish.  On 2/21/2021 I felt symptom free until evening when a slight trace of achiness returned. I slept very well that night and woke symptom free, encountering  no further reactive symptoms.

                                                For 2-3 days after the 2nd dose (given on 2/10/21), I had a sore arm, aching and weakness all over my body, tired, nauseous and no appetite. I remaining in bed off and on for about 36 hours and then worked my way back to eliminate most of the symptoms.  However, after that and continuing at this time, i continue to be achy, particularly in my joints and my hands, fingers and neck, and I find that my lower jaw seems to be moved forward when I awake in the morning.  The achiness is particularly acute when waking in the morning, particularly in my fingers..  The pain is by no means debilitating, but it is noticeable.  I would rate the pain 3 or 4 when waking and 2-3 throughout the rest of the day.     I have not sought any treatment.

                                                Patient hospitalized for fever thought to be related to 2nd dose of covid vaccine. See hospital a/p from H&amp;P.  Assessment/Plan: Fever, myalgias and headache, I think this is all secondary to his recent Covid vaccine yesterday, dose 2.  I would anticipate his symptoms should resolve over the next 24 to 48 hours.  He was started on vancomycin in the emergency room given history of MRSA.  We will continue for now, though I think less likely secondary infection.  He is on Cipro for SBP prophylaxis.  He does not seem to have significant ascites.  I think bacterial peritonitis is less likely.   End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.  I spoke with individual.  Plan is to dialyze him here today.   Cirrhosis -he was evaluated by the transplant center at Hospital on February 25.  His meld was 25 at that time.   History of type 2 diabetes.  His last hemoglobin A1c&#39;s have been all 5.  Can remove that from his problem list.

                                                I received my #2 vaccine at 6:55 PM on March 02, 2021.  I got up at about 2 AM March 03, with my left arm hurting rather badly.  I also got severe chills.  I went back to bed and about 30 minutes later, both the arm pain and chills were gone.  Neither has returned and I feel fine now.  It is now 09:50 PM March 03, 2021.

                                                Began feeling very weak with a constant headache that later led to blurry vision on March, 2, 2021.  On the morning of March 4, 2021,  I was still experiencing a right sided headache as well as double vision.  I was no longer able to drive at that point.  I took my blood pressure digitally at the local pharmacy twice where it was 200/104.  I went home to call my physician and also have my wife take my blood pressure manually.  My blood pressure at that time was 214/106.  I went to the hospital where they examined me and then discharged me with a General Headache without a know cause.  I contacted my PCP and he advised me to quadruple my Lisinopril until my BP came down to normal range and see him the morning.  My visit the next day showed an elevated blood pressure, double vision, and a continuing headache.  My meds were adjusted to Lisinopril 10 mg qd and an addition of Norvasc 5 mg qd.  Later that day my blood pressure was down, but still not in the normal range.   The following day, March 6, 2021, I was still having the same issues despite the changes in medication.  I took my blood pressure at 6 pm and it was 199/104.  I immediately went to another hospital where I was admitted as  a &#34;stroke alert&#34; patient in hypertensive emergency.  I am presently being followed as an inpatient in order to get these issues under control.

Not as strong as before but still going. Has tried to self medicate with extra Norco, and tylenol but did not help  For many people the headache, fatigue, and aches tend to happen after receiving the vaccine.  The pain radiating from your pelvis to your clavicle is not a symptom I have seen and can be something unrelated to the vaccine or COVID, if symptoms persist check with PCP or go to ED.

                                                65 Y male who is referred for c/f dyspnea and chest pain.  Per clinic notes: &#34;Brief summary covid vaccine 1/21 with side effect within 12 hr lasting 3 d By around 1/26-1/29 had cp w/ exertion and sob TST 2/2 w/  Minor ekg changes and min workload per pt (mod workload per note) nuc study pending.  Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

Have had a high pitched ringing or hissing in ears since receiving the vaccine; did not make the connection to the vaccine because tinnitus was not disclosed as a side effect, and no questions about this side effect were raised in follow up surveys. Yesterday, while reading an article about someone, committing suicide, I saw a reference to tinnitus.  Only now do I see many reports online of this side effect.

He is still having to use his nebulizer, but not as often, as his usual inhalers have not been ineffective.

                                                About 7 days after injection, left deltoid muscle became swollen, hot and tense to touch.  Initially after injection has local tenderness and small swelling but seems to resolve after 2-3 days. Was feeding tired the first two days.  Then on Saturday a week after injection, felt a slight itchiness on left deltoid area and then as the day progressed, the swelling became more prominent. Still confine to the deltoid area.

                                                Just wanted to touch basis regarding side effects to the Moderna vaccination.  I received the first vaccine yesterday evening, today I have experienced a low grade fever, tiredness, chills, weakness and a headache.  BP was 129/67 this AM. I understand these are some typical symptoms but thought it would be good to communicate.  Unfortunately the test samples were low in this ethnicity, low in senior citizens, and kidney disease is not listed.  Only a very small percentage had two extenuating conditions; while I have diabetes, CKD, hypertension/previous heart related disease.  I understand that the second vaccination could present even more severe side effects.  Any thoughts?

                                                On Jan 11, 21 immediately after the vaccine I felt my heart wad high. Then after an hour I felt dizzy for couple hours.  At night on the same day, I had chills, temperature 101 F.  Had Tylenol.  Next day on January 12, 21 felt feverish, body pain, tired and lost some food taste.  So slept all day.  Same later in the evening started coughing.  January 13 and 14, 21 felt tired and dizzy when I stand up.  Had cough syrup and today it has improved.  However, still feel dizzy but hope to recover gradually.  Daughter is listed as my doctor.  She is my daughter. She watches me but she is not my official physician.

                                                3 or 4 days after receiving the first Covid Vaccine I developed a rash/hives on my torso as well as constant chills. My Dermatologist biopsied the rash (awaiting results) and treating with Allegra and Benadryl. After 3 days of the symptoms seem to be slowing getting better. My question is: Are hives &amp; chills a reaction to the vaccine? And if so, should I get my 2nd vaccine that is scheduled for 2/17/21?

Prior to this time all of my symptoms had been very minor. I am submitting this because of the long timespan between injection and onset of discomfort.

My father received his first dose on 1/21 after 3 days on Sunday evening of 1/24 he started chills and fever till 1/31. He experienced persistent fever as high as 104.7 even 105 at one point followed by fatigue and body-ache. He no longer had any fever on 2/1, just mostly fatigue and not having much energy and also couple episodes of coughs. As of 2/2 he is doing much better looks to be fully recovering. I wanted to know if you would advise if he should get his second shot as well.

Decided to get into bed to warm up.   Walking up the stairs and holding both rails - left and right - I blacked out, fell forward and hit my mouth on the edge of one stair, and my ribs on the edge of another stair.   Lots of blood,, chipped a tooth, lots of swelling in my mouth, deep laceration on my face and very sore ribs.   Saw doctor the next day.   No stitches required and ribs are bruised only.  I will need dental work done to repair my teeth.

                                                I had COVID19 Vaccines EUA on 1/12/21 &amp; 2/9/21. Most adverse effects I had after the first shot. On the same day around 7:30 p.m. head started to burn and the rest of my body shiver. Whole body skin became super sensitive - it hurt to move sharply. I took Tylenol 1300mg and Advil LiquiGel 400mg. Temperature was up &amp; down (97 to 100.7) for 2 days. Friday 1/15 temperature became normal, but my body started to feel severe muscle twisting aches and that continue for 4 days straight. I&#39;ve continue to take Tylenol and Advil every 4-6 hours. After muscle aches subsided on Tuesday 1/19, all joints started to hurt (two days of nagging &amp; strong pain, most-knees &amp; hands). Suddenly I started to cough for no apparent reason.

The sensation lasted for about 15 minutes then completely subsided.  About 4 hours later upon retiring to bed before falling asleep, I began to experience a abnormal sound in both my ears.  I covered my ears and the sound remained unchanged.  I do suffer tinnitus and am used to ringing in my ears.  This was more of a rushing metallic sound similar to the rushing water but high pitched and metallic.  This anomaly lasted for around 30 minutes.

I felt fine when I woke on Saturday, and felt pleased that my immune system was apparently working properly  Seeing nothing in the Moderna fact sheet about avoiding alcohol,  at dinner I had 3 and a half cocktails. Had no problem walking home and walking the dog, but after getting in bed, I had a much stronger reaction to the alcohol than I ordinarily would - vertigo, and the next day, extreme tiredness.  Though I don&#39;t ordinarily drink that much, I&#39;m a large man, and it doesn&#39;t affect me as  much.  I&#39;m concerned that the alcohol may have affected the efficacy of the vaccine, and wonder if avoidance of alcohol should be mentioned in the fact shett.

                                                My first vaccination was given at Medical Center, on 1/27/21.  Medication was Pfizer, Lot # EL3302.  At time of scheduling I was told that I could get my second vaccination at facility, which was  about 50 miles closer to my home.  The scheduler verified that facility administered both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.   On 2/16, when I reported to facility for my second shot, I reminded the intake person and the one who escorted me to the vaccination station that I needed the Pfizer vaccine, and was told by both people that  Pfizer was in the record and that I would receive that vaccine.  The person who escorted me to the vaccination station brought the syringe to the vaccinator, who asked me my name and date of birth, administered the shot, and handed me the post-administration paperwork.  While seated in the waiting area I read over my paperwork and reviewed my dosage record card and discovered, that I had been  given the Moderna vaccine., against the CDC guidance and without prior notification to or authorization by me.  I have subsequently experienced shortness of breath, an unusually high level of  nasal congestion, nad a serious lack of energy.  These symptoms began about 72 hours after the second vaccination.

                                                Seven days after receiving my first Moderna shot for Covid-19, I developed a large pink colored oval rash around the injection site on my left arm.  The rash also itched.   Doing some online research I believe I developed a case of &#34;Covid-Arm&#34;.   I am treating the rash with a cortisone cream.   I have had the rash now for two days.  It is not getting worse but is still very prevalent.   My initial side effects from the injection consisted of a sore arm for two days and a mild, dull headache that responded to one dose of Tylenol.  Otherwise I had no initial side effects from the first dose.

                                                I started by getting a modest headache in the early afternoon.  About 3 PM feeling fatigued.  About 5 PM I began getting chills. By 7 PM headache became a bit stronger, and loss of appetite; becoming more fatigued; generally just feeling &#34;crummy&#34;. About 8 PM I took prescribed amount of regular strength Tylenol, and went to bed, easily falling asleep. Woke about 7 AM next day feeling noticeably better. I took another dose of Tylenol, just as a precaution. I would say by 11 AM all illness was gone.

Okay next day and night but then next two evenings chills (not lasting as long) with eventual headache (more treatable). Okay again today, and will contact Clinic about it in case they want me to get a Covid test before the second vaccine. Concerned that the &#34;reactions&#34; have been so long after the vaccine, and that it was only the first vaccine. Can find no info matching this course of events....

                                                Fairly strong headache in the middle of the night. Took 500mg acetaminophen, which worked well. Awakened Saturday morning to the call of diarrhea. After four additional visits to the toilet in the next two hours, I started keeping track of these episodes. Over a period of 24 hours (Sat 8am-Sun 8am) I HAD to visit the toilet 31 times. Each episode was accompanied by a serious need to evacuate my bowels. Lots of pressure and pain in my intestines, every time. The first 4-5 sessions had considerable content, but after that, the almost-liquid movements could have been captured in 2 tablespoons (not a lot of content). After about 12 visits, which required vigorous wiping to remove the gelatinous remains, my long-dormant hemorrhoids started bleeding bright red and rather profusely. By the 18th visit they had reduced to pinkish smears, and remained that way until the present. I also became very tired and sluggish after about 8 hours of repeated toilet visits. The diarrhea episodes continued all night, allowing me only short cat-naps in between episodes of gnashing pain. After 24 hours (Sunday morning), the diarrhea episodes reduced in intensity and frequency, but the near-liquid consistency has remained through till just now (Sunday evening) where the content is slowly growing (about 1/2 cup) and beginning to have a little more solid appearance. I have been napping all day.

                                                I had very severe cf starting in 1996.  It remained severe for approximately 5 years after which it was semi acute for another 5 years.    After that i would have periodic relapses several times a year for varying lengths of time.  For the last 10 years irt has been much better with occasional symptoms.  However i received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine on february 23, 2021 and had a strong flu like response.  I am now experiencing a mild to moderate relapse of my cf.   brain fog, difficulty tracking with my vision, chills, etc.  when i had severe cf i had this symptom where my scalp would feellike it was in a spasm.  That has returned.  I have dealt with tcf long enough to know when it occurs and this is definitely a response to the covid vaccine.

I then experience stomach cramps and a brief bout of diarrhea. All of the above symptoms resolved within three days, however the stomach discomfort and cramping persisted for more than a week. Upon going to my local ER I was subsequently diagnosed with appendicitis. I am suspicious that this was triggered by the vaccine, as there is growing evidence that the appendix plays a role in the immune system, the response of which was exploded by the second shot. I have never had stomach issues in the past, confirmed my medical exams and preventative colonoscopies. I am extremely healthy, eat well and my bowel habits are quite regular and reliable.

His blood pessure was very low and he had a fever , so I called paremedics, and they took him to the hosp.  After many tests, they found blood in the urine, and his blood platelets had dropped to 121.( Now he had blood work done in June of 2020 and his platelets were 225.)  After a few days, his platelets began to creep back up, and are now around 165, back to normal range. He is currently at a rehad facility for physical therapy to regain strength.

By 9:50 AM my temperature had risen to 101.4 and remained above 100 until 6:00 PM.  I experienced body aches, joint aches, and moderate exhaustion.  Walking 30 feet was very tiring and I needed to return to bed.  I took two Acetaminophen at 5:00 PM.  That was the only medication that I took.  By 10:15 PM my temperature was back to normal.  During the day my oxygenation levels were about 93% where my normal level is 97&#43;.  Breathing exercises improved my oxygenation to 95%.  It should be noted that I had COVID 19 in April, 2020.  I never had a positive PCR test but since May, 2020 I have tested positive for COVID 19 antibodies on at least 6 occasions.  Several of these tests were associated with blood donations and others were simply antibody tests done separately.  My most recent antibody positive test was in late January associated with a blood donation.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after receiving my first Moderna vaccine I developed a cough, fever, chills, runny nose. I assumed these were  some of the symptoms as a result of the vaccine. I monitored my fever for several hours. The cough persisted for the next 9 plus days and I didn&#39;t have any desire to eat or drink liquids. I lost my taste and smell during this 9 day period. On February 25 my wife and I took a Covid-19 self test at pharmacy. Also on this same date I went to urgent care My wife was concerned about my labored breathing.  My vitals were checked and I requested a chest xray. I was given 2 prescriptions. 1 for Prednisone 20mg and Ventolin.

I drank liquids all day and about 4 p.m. took  two 650mg acetomiaphin pan killers.  At 6:30 p.m. the fever broke and the pain and agony went down.  This was  a very intense  pain event (top 5 in my life!).  Now, at 8:16 p.m. I am coming back to normal.

Then 6 days later had itching bumps/hives that turn red, and just erupts on his hips, groin, arms in places, abdomen, most parts of his body including his scalp and has persisted.   He had it for 4 days and she began giving him Benadryl, which has helped.   He still has these areas and reaction.  He has been having headaches since he&#39;s had these reactions.    In Jan/Feb he was having some symptoms, COVID toe, hives, blood shot eye and intestinal problems all at the same time, which they believe he had the COVID virus due to articles that they had read about.  He went to a podiatrist who did not know what he was looking at.  These reactions are similar to the reaction he had when he believes he had the COVID virus.  They live in a ski resort area and they have people coming from all over, and had a lot of friends who had &#34;the flu&#34;.    He tried to call his doctor twice to get some advice, and was never able to speak to her and the nurses misunderstood what he was calling for.

                                                About 9:30 PM on March 17, 2021 (the day that the vaccine was administered), patient began experiencing chills with shivering. Went to bed shortly thereafter. Woke two or three times in the night. Began feeling somewhat warm instead of chilled (except for extremities, which remained cold to the touch). Felt weak and temporarily dizzy each time of getting out of bed. Awoke at one point with a headache, so took one Excedrin migraine tablet. Took a second Excedrin migraine tablet later in the morning of March 18, 2021, since headache persisted. Other than that, took no other prescriptions or supplements until the evening of March 18, 2021. Throughout March 18, 2021, patient felt occasional periods of weakness and took bedrest for it. Probably slept an additional 3 to 4 hours during the day. By evening of March 18, 2021, patient was feeling more normal. On March 19, 2021, patient experienced no adverse effects.

The pain got worse by 8:00 pm. I though I might somehow got it hurt somewhere.  I massage the pain area and place the foot and lower leg in a bucket   filled with warm water. Those did not help. I went to bed at ~8:30 pm and felt the whole right leg  very uncomfortable. The dull pain came from the foot and extended to the whole leg,  I felt the foot and leg were swelling but they were not. By 12:00 am the pain became less and totally gone by 7:00 am, I urinated four times over night and had severe sweating in the second half of the night.   I  feel alright the next day, just some kind joint/musel  uncomfortable.

Not that high I know but for me it is and gave me a very bad headache and body aches.  I did not feel good enough to try to sleep until about 1:00 am after using a heating pad and hot tea to try and chase the chills away and Ibuprofen for the aches.  My shoulder was so sore from the shot that I could not lay on my left side.  The following day I was about 50% better. No more chills but still slight fever and no appetite.  Didn&#39;t feel good enough to do anything except take a nap.  The following day I was pretty much back to normal.

Then sleep interrupted by chills, and then sweats (so much so that  had to lay down a towel and another towel for my pillow). The next day was dominated by body aches and headache (I rarely get headaches). Loss of appetite.  This general condition of malaise lasted all day (the day after injection) and it was at times horrible. The symptoms  started to subside by the evening hours and I was able to have a better night sleep. By the next morning I felt better.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 16 hours after the injection, I felt tired. As the day progressed (within 2-3 hours), I experienced a feeling of malaise and body aches and no appetite and a slight runny nose.  I took two (2) OTC Tylenol to relieve the pain (worked very well!) and consumed two (2) 12 oz cans of ginger ale over the next 8 hours.  Upon waking up (about 40 hours after the injection), I felt rested, alert and about 95% of great. No symptoms or other side effects whatsoever since.

                                                I have reported adverse reaction to the first dose of vaccine, and was told to simply endure. I discussed those terrible adverse effects to two of the persons administering the second dose, and was assured with their theorizing that my second dose should have minimal side effects. Six hours after receiving the second dose I felt an unusual pressure buildup in the frontal area of head/brain. By the time I go home I was in full blown headache, and immediately laid down in bed for an hour. Felling a bit better I got up to watch TV, and went downhill rapidly from there. The headache would not respond to acetaminophen. I also could not eat anything, so drank cranberry juice and V8. Evening sleep was awakened with sweaty pillow and sheets. I had to sleep with towels on bed and pillow. Next day was headache and overall malaise all day. I washed two acetaminophen at 4:30pm with orange juice. An hour later as I vomited the orange juice. That evening was the same as the previous. But by the time I finally got up at 8:30am that second day, I was feeling much better. I will never, ever accept a corona-virus vaccine ever again.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine dose #1 on 3/3/21 at approximately 0900.  In the afternoon of 3/4/21, patient had sudden onset shortness of breath while at home, as well as fatigue and low energy. Patient knew that a potential side effect of vaccine was fatigue, so he assumed this was just a normal side effect to be expected. States that his difficulty breathing and fatigue continued for about a week. After continued urging from wife to seek medical care, patient visited urgent care center on 3/15/21. The urgent care did a D-Dimer lab, and an x-ray of chest. X-ray &#34;showed something abnormal&#34; so they did a CT scan as well, which showed a &#34;huge pulmonary embolism.&#34; D-Dimer lab was elevated. Patient was transported to hospital by ambulance and had immediate surgery to remove blood clot from lungs at approximately 2100 on 3/15/21. Per patient, the surgeon said the clot was about the size of his palm. Surgeon reported that there was &#34;100% blockage to left lung from the aortic artery and 90% blockage to right lung from aortic artery.&#34;  A DVT in popliteal vein was identified, and the surgeon assumes the clot started in the popliteal vein and broke off and traveled to lungs. Patient was admitted and hospitalized until he was discharged home on 3/18/21. During course of hospitalization, genetic testing was done and it was determined that the &#34;genetic marker for clots was negative, so they think the clot is from a one-time event--patient&#39;s family does not need to be concerned that they have clotting issues.&#34; Patient states that he was started on heparin in the hospital, and was discharged home on Eliquis blood thinner, which is being tapered. Patient states that the doctors think he will be on Eliquis for about 6 months and will not need to be on it for life. Doctors say the DVT in leg will dissolve on its own. During hospitalization, an echogram and cardiac cath was performed, which showed &#34;an old heart attack on the left side, but that collateral vessels have built up already.&#34; Right side of heart was weaker from having to work so hard due to blood clots in lung, but prior to discharge from hospital, the right side of heart was already showing improvement. A heart cath was done to check vessels and it was determined no stents were needed, although there was a small clot in left anterior descending artery. Patient was also newly diagnosed during course of hospitalization with Type II Diabetes in a non-obese person, HTN (which patient had never had before), Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia, 1st degree AV block. Was discharged home with metformin, losartan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and Aspirin. The chlorthalidone was discontinued, due to &#34;blood pressure dropping too low--they think his high blood pressure was situational&#34; per wife of patient. Medical doctors advised against receiving the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. Patient being followed by Internist at hospital.  Patient&#39;s shortness of breath resolved &#34;immediately after clot was removed&#34; but is continuing to be followed while on new medications and blood thinner dosing.  The above information was provided during telephone interview of patient and his wife.

                                                He got his vaccine, within 24 hours later he had hives, his lips and face swelled up, he had a low grade temp of 99.8 having chills and wanting to stay warm and lay in bed with multiple  blankets.  After his daughter noticed it about 2 hours later they went to the ER, and they gave him a steroid, Benadryl and a steroid and gave him IV Pepcid until the swelling went down and he felt better.   They gave him 6 days worth of Benadryl, and steroids which he did take for that.  After 6 days and after 24 hours he broke again in the same manner and they told him that it was okay as long as he was breathing well.  He then went to the UC and he bought OTC Benadryl which he continued.  Then exactly 30 days after he went to the ER on 4/24/21 he broke again with the lips swelling, hives, temperature was normal but feeling achy and the same symptoms he had from the beginning.  He went to his PCP and he has him now on steroids, Benadryl and the Pepcid when needed as well.  He takes the Benadryl as needed and then the symptoms subside and the reaction comes back.   If he does not do the Benadryl until later this evening then his lips will start tightening and then swell.

Six hours after having the Moderna vaccine on 4/23/21, I started experiencing fever which rose to over 101 over the next few hours.  Also experienced chills, muscle &amp; joint pain, headaches, slight difficulty breathing and fatigue.  Took Tylenol every 6 hours after fever started but temp at one point rose to almost 103.  Took almost 48 hours for symptoms to subside after waking up the on the morning of the 25th drenched in sweat.  The symptoms I experienced were very similar to symptoms I experienced with the virus.

                                                Injection was given very close to the shoulder joint in my left arm, as a result within a few hours a very sharp pain in my shoulder caused me to be unable to lift my left arm without extreme pain, not muscle pain. By 4:00 pm I was sapped of energy. During the night I developed chills and ran a fever of 100.4 F. By Sunday morning I felt nauseous, but did not vomit. At 2:00pm 12/10/2020 my fever has lowered and the nausea has subsided, but the shoulder joint is still very sore.

Similar reactions were shared with 6 co-workers who received the vaccination at about the same time. My concern is that if this second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination is making people ill, then it is imperative that CDC and FDA advise the public what to expect and maybe how to ameliorate.  Otherwise people who become ill will tell their friends and family.  This disclosure will make members of the public disinclined to get the shot which would be a public health nightmare.  I have used this adverse report as the forum to ensure that the FDA and CDC are aware of these reactions and will consider their consequences.  Thank you.

                                                Had a little bit more than normal soreness in the shoulder, felt like bruising.  The day after the injection started getting flu symptoms, fairly severe, fever, coughing, runny nose, no energy at all.  Felt like he had a the worst case of flu he ever had.  He is getting better, but still has some of the symptoms.  The only thing he has taken for it is Nyquil and took a Sinutab.   Did have nausea, diarrhea, everything that comes with the flu.  Sinuses are drying up, energy is coming back and able to eat again.  He did call his doctor and he recommended that he call us and report this event.  He did have to postpone a procedure that he was scheduled for on Monday.

                                                I woke up feeling head ache with pain in my throat and upper section of my chest while breathing. My blood pressure and pulse was unusually high. I went to Hospital . I was checked for Covid, Chest x-ray and blood test.  Covid test results were negative, and X-ray results was normal with no problem.  All blood test results (including those for heart)  were normal. EKG test result was normal. They ruled out any problem with my  heart, but could not say for sure that it was not a reaction to Covid Vaccine .  However they said it might be a sever allergy.  (However I do slight allergy once a while with some congestion, but I have never had this sort of pain in my trout and upper part of chest).  I was dismissed after 3 hours, and was advised to get in contact with my Primary physician within 3 days

Myalgia and headache waned over following 24 hours. Weakness and fatigue lasted till four days after vaccine.  I was in bed for three days. I took Aleve and Tylenol and stayed well hydrated. If I had fever, I would have thought it was a severe case of flu.

About 11 hours after injection (9:00 pm) there were chills/shivers for about 6 hours. Temperature was 97.6. General fatigue and malaise the next day. Again at 9:00 pm there was less severe chills/shivers for about 2 hours. No other effects after that. Minor soreness at the injection site.  Perhaps minor reaction but I thought it would be beneficial to report.

                                                One week post injection, on February 18, I developed  chills and a fever starting around 9 PM. I experienced diarrhea starting around 10 PM. Fever was approx 100.4 F and was accompanied by a splitting headache and significant body aches, to the point where I was unable to get any sleep that night. I noticed Covid arm the next morning. Fever, headache and body aches continued until Monday morning. I took only Extra Strength Tylenol. Most of the time Tylenol was effective only for the first 2-3 hrs before the discomfort overcame it. I was tested twice for COVID, both Friday AM and Monday AM. Both came back negative. Starting Monday the body aches and fever began to subside but I was left with a feeling of exhaustion and required continuous sleep.  Today is the first day I feel back to normal. I still have a large Covid arm rash, two weeks post injection. It causes no discomfort whatsoever.

Began experiencing steady pain and stiffness in left shoulder injection site within an hour of injection and continued throughout rest of day, night and next day (2/25/21).  Began feeling run down and sore in back, neck and right shoulder at bed time (12:30 AM 2/25/21).  Had difficulty sleeping all night due to musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by pre-existing anxiety (which I took 50 MG of Sertraline for during the night).  Very lethargic when woke up on morning of 2/25/21 and had slight fever.  Laid in bed for 2-3 hours after woke up; did not get up until 12:30 PM due to no energy.  Not nauseated, but have no appetite.

He wasn&#39;t able to speak for 3 days.  On 2/17/2021 he went to the hospital.  They thought he may have Bell&#39;s Palsy so the they did a XRAY and CT.  They were not able to find anything other than facial swelling so he was discharged and told to come back if he did not get better and they would make him an appt w/ an ENT.  He started taking Aleve.  He no longer has constant pain but his mouth still hurts when he opens it.  He will contact his PCP to let her know what happened and to let her know that he will not be taking his 2nd covid vax dose.

When I awakened (about a minute later) I was unable to stand so I crawled to from the shower to bedside, but passed out again when I tried to pull myself up from the floor into bed.  My wife called 911 and the local fire department responded.  The EMT took my blood pressure while I was lying on the floor with my feet elevated and it was 78/34.  The EMT called an aid car and I was transported to a local ER.  At the ER, I received 2 liters of fluids over the next 4 hours.  I had an EKG, chest X-ray, blood work, and urine analysis which all were clear.  After 4 hrs, I was released and returned home.

Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

                                                Received moderna 3/1/21 5:30pm, while waiting in post obs @ ~13 min - daughter rushed to our door said they thought patient was having reaction (543pm). Per wife - patient became clammy, very warm, unresponsive, gurgling at the mouth. I ran out to check on patient Pharm.D.  They asked if they could remove his mask , i told them YES! he had a cloth mask over an n95 mask! Upon inspection, patient was not talking to me like he was prior to vaccine. They said patient gets tired and can become out of it, so they were not sure if this was a rxn to vaccine or just one of his episodes.  Patient has prior hx of 3 times stroke and is on dialysis. He did not appear to be in anaphylaxis and was breathing (when looking at chest). We called code white to pharmacy, and  Manager called EMS 5:44pm. Pharm.D came out to assist me 5:45pm. It was difficult to get a pulse using fingers, so we used BP cuff and got 83/57, with 87 BPM 547pm. I had epi pen ready to go in case we needed to use it but wanted to wait since patient was still breathing. While waiting for EMS, patient became responsive and began to talk. EMS showed up and took over. At this time Patient was talking and joking. 550 pm We decided we wanted patient to be checked out prior to sending him on his way. EMS asked us what we had done, and we discussed the above. EMS took over from there 555pm. Everything turned out ok, EMS left without further intervention. Before they left, I went to speak to family, and they were very happy due to the care they received. Event ending @ 6:15pm

Woke up the next day feeling all of those plus coughing and sinus congestion/draining. Went to urgent care the following day and tested negative for Covid and flu. Returned to urgent care on Saturday for a chest xray and was diagnosed with pneumonia.

Around eleven that evening, severe headache; nausea; muscle aches arms &amp; legs; and most serious two seizures (spasms??) about 5 seconds apart.  I?ve only had a few muscle cramps in my life so the seizures were unusual to say the least. They started in my lower abdomen (seemed like a small band going full circle around my body) and moved incrementally up towards my shoulders.  Rapid movement upward...kinda like squeezing a tube of toothpaste. Each one was only about two seconds long but fairly violent. If I had anything in stomach, it would have been on the floor.  Everything was gone (except the sore shoulder) by five in the morning.

                                                ?I recd the first moderna vaccine 2-13-2021 at 11 AM.  Headache, right side only, started same day at 7:30 PM, sore shoulder at vaccine site about 10:30 PM same day.  Both were gone the next morning.  I recd the second dose of the moderna vaccine 3-13-2021 at 11 AM.  By 2 PM I had a ranging head ache, again right side only.  I drove four hours to the vaccination site, hospital.  I was driving home when this started.  I stopped to purchase Tylenol about 3 pm which it turns out had no effect.  I was driving west into a setting sun, as the headache got worse, my eyes became more and more sensitive to the sun, I stopped a second time to purchase a second pair of sunglasses that I could wear over the first pair, that didn?t help, I ended up stopping at a rest area until the sun set.  I got to my house at about 6 PM, by then I could no longer wear my prescription glasses, besides the headache I was now very dizzy.  At about 9 PM the pain started, between my shoulder blades first, never at the injection site.  From that time on, including today, the pain has constantly moved around my body, the worst pain is associated with areas that arthritis affects me, hips, knees, hands, ankles.  I have had a mild fever, ranging from 100.9 Saturday night to 100.3 now at11 AM 3-15-2021.  Yesterday, 3-14, my head was swearing, my feet were ice cold.  I had an electric blanket from my waist down and an ice pack on head.  If I have ever felt worse in my life I don?t remember when that would have been.  The pain has moderated today, I expect the worst is now over.    If as the health specialists are suggesting a booster will be required this fall I will undoubtedly have incredibly significant reservations with this vaccine.

I woke up at 02:00 AM in sweat and when I tried to walk the vertigo was so bad I couldn&#39;t walk. was disoriented and very nauseous. Was not improving and was taken by ambulance to ER.  Given medication IV and orally, slowly improved enough to go home by 11:00 AM. Still dizzy on March 16th and occasional bouts of vertigo. I seem to be slowly omproving.

                                                I suffered a heart attack on March 11, 2021, at approx 145pm, while sitting at my desk - WFH.  My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

After 24 hours from the injection, a low grade fever; 99.9  I was hesitant to even report it, as I considered the adverse events not being a major concern. I really hope reports of adverse effects do not deter people from the Covid vaccines.  Even had I considered beforehand this minor effect, I would still get the vaccine. I probably should also note that this was my second dose. I had zero adverse events after the first.

Wednesday temperature fluctuated between 101º and 104º with chills off and on and no appetite. Thursday temperature stayed about 1º above normal all day, but my appetite came back in the afternoon. Had the runs that evening and night - a lot of water came out. Friday temperature back to normal and no runs. Treatment was to take Tylenol, turn up heat, get under extra blankets and sleep/rest as much as possible. Only drank water and grapefruit juice, and only ate clementines (didn&#39;t want to eat anything else until Thursday afternoon).

Further into the evening and past midnight I started experiencing shortness of breath and extreme headache pain above the eyes. Extremely Sharp pain in the right arm and shoulder, felt like my arm was being aggressively yanked.  I then became panicky and decided to call a 24 Hour nurse service and describe what I was experiencing.  After spending 20 minute on the phone with the nurse she concluded that an emergency room visit was necessary but that I should contact my doctor at the beginning of the next business day.  The pain still exists.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

                                                On Sunday March 7, I experienced typical soreness and fatigue.  On Monday March 8, I started to feel muscle soreness and fatigue, primarily in my shoulders and other major muscles.  The soreness and fatigue grew progressively worse during the week, and peaked on Friday and Saturday, March 11 and 12.  On Sunday the 13th I felt somewhat better, with pain and muscle soreness primarily in my shoulders and large muscles in my legs.  The pain level has remained approximately the same since.  The pain is impacting my mobility.  Prior to the shot, I exercised on a regular basis but have not been able to exercise since.

                                                When I got home around 5:30pm on Saturday I had a 5 minute coughing fit (dry cough) which seemed to come out of nowhere.  I was fine for the rest of the evening and when I woke up Sunday morning my arm was sore (from the shot) but I had no other side affects other than coughing occasionally.  I noticed my throat was raw.  I ran 3 miles, did my stretches and carried out my day without any apparent side effects.  I slept poorly but that is not that unusual, doing a full exercise routine Monday morning.  Other than the cough and raw throat, I seemed fine until the late afternoon (48 hour after the vaccination) when I started to ache all over--including a mild headache (which I rarely get) with the cough continuing and my throat raw.  I went to be early last night in the hopes that it would be over by morning, but it wasn&#39;t.  I still ache all over, including the headache, am still coughing a bit, my throat is still raw, and I feel completely dragged out.

Since the second vaccination I have daily pain in my arm and a headache at least every other day. The pain in my left arm is painful at times excruciating. The headache is also much concern to me. I have not been to a doctor guessing that they may not do anything for me.

Then had a mild headache that evening. Then nothing else noticeable the next day I did feel some chills and still tired so I slept . But the different reaction I had started either late in the evening of the day after shot or early morning of the 2nd day after shot. I noticed the top of my left forearm, (the same arm in which I received the shot) started itching a bit and when I looked in the morning I had some minor red blotches like one gets from a rub against poison ivy. The itching stopped in about 3 more days the redness in about 6. No additional issues arose. Everything back to normal. Just thought I&#39;d share in case others notice same reaction which in the end was inconsequential.

I started having chills. I have a fever, still with aches and pains. The soreness at the injection site is about gone. Yesterday, 01.03.21, I was running a fever between 99-101 all night long. Last night I took one Tylenol to help slow it down a little. It&#39;s been pretty severe up until now. Right now my temp is 98.1.  I did not go to the ER and my wife has the lot number in her purse with her right now.

                                                As a physician for over 40 years I tend not to pay attention to my symptoms if I develop the flu or a virus. I just put up with it  I received a COVID-19 Moderna vaccination on January 7. Approximately 12 hours after I started to develop adverse reactions. These of Inc. severe myalgias, fever to 102, chills, headache, severe fatigue (to the point where it is difficult to get out of bed)  Not much reaction at the injection site. Hydrogen saturation  in the 90s and pulse in the 70s.  I did contract Covid in March 2020. I was alone for two weeks. However no respiratory problems or hospitalization.  I?m currently speculating that having had covered in March has resulted in a significant immune reaction from this vaccine.  I would appreciate your input on this.  Can I expect this again when I receive my second vaccine in one month?  Thank you

                                                Felt fine after injection, walked 5 miles home &amp; assured loved ones before going to bed that vaccination went fine with no side effects. After midnight I woke in the dark with many of the same symptoms as when I had COVID in March/April 2020: extreme allover body aches, terrible thirst, extreme weakness.  Next day (Wednesday) symptoms continued; too weak &amp; achy to watch all but the core parts of the inauguration; too uncomfortable to read or to concentrate on music or anything else.  Absolutely no appetite so I didn&#39;t eat.  Wednesday night I tossed &amp; turned all night with a chill that I couldn&#39;t lose even with the heaviest down comforter &amp; supplementary blankets.  That night &amp; the following day I also noticed a distorted sense of time, where hours seem to pass v-e-r-y  s-l-o-w-l-y.  On Thursday night two more symptoms appeared: a tremendous cough that I couldn&#39;t stop or assuage with the normal remedies (e.g., lozenges, tea with honey), and that kept me from falling asleep till dawn; and diarrhea (which was limited because I hadn&#39;t eaten since Monday dinner so I didn&#39;t have much food in my system).  The cough felt like it might develop into a sore throat (which had been my first symptom when I had COVID) but it never did.  Yesterday (Friday) I felt as if my symptoms (other than residual weakness) were abating, and Friday night I got a full night of unbroken sleep.  I awoke on Saturday morning with no symptoms, and felt well enough to challenge myself by attempting my usual 90-minute yoga/stretch workout, which proved to be no problem.  Now, at 4 pm on Saturday--about 100 hours after my shot--I feel fairly normal &amp; seem to have no further symptoms.  I do plan to lie low &amp; take things easy, and to have as little outside contact as possible between now and my second shot (scheduled for 2/16) in order to minimize the possibility of re-infection.

After 2 weeks my GP prescribed a medrol dose pak that got rid of symptoms immediately and for the duration of the treatment. When the meds were over the symptoms came back to a lesser degree. The symptoms are persistent to this day. I presently take 2 tylenol usually twice a day and I am comfortable but still have slight malaise. I am due for second shot on the 29th. A little worried

I have an oxygen/pulse thing. My pulse was very high for me, it was in the high 90s and then it would occasionally go to 100-105 to 115 but then would go back down into the 90s and it stayed that way for approximately for 60-65 hours after the shot. It was all over the map, I even had some heart rates in the 40s-50s. Finally it broke after about 60-65 hours and it returned to normal. My normal resting heart rate is in the 60s-70s and occasionally in the 80s but never the 90s. On Saturday approximately 9:30 I had no appetite, I didn&#39;t want to eat anything, I felt like I was going to vomit and didn&#39;t eat anything but just felt nauseous.

Could not stand in shower so sat down, then fell asleep for a few minutes, awoke still lightheaded so got back to bed and slept until 10 am. Awoke feeling much better. Aches gone, sinus fine, low energy. Rested for the day. Slept normally that night. Following morning all symptoms gone. Normal.

                                                Beginning about 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I started having really bad headaches, behind my eyes radiating to the back of the head. At about   15 hours post vaccine I had chills, fever. The chills and fever were bad enough that in addition to sleeping under two blankets I had to put on a thick fleece ?hoodie? and pulled the hoodie over my head. I developed about 48 hrs of nasal congestion, and some retrosternal chest pain. I had one episode of nausea with vomiting about 8:00 am the next morning. I had to take two 325 mg Tylenol every 4-6 hrs to deal with the headache and fever. The most severe symptoms of  headache and fever subsided in about 24 to 36 hrs after the vaccine was administered. I had a lot of fatigue for several days, along with aches and pains. It took me about 5 days to really start feeling normal again, but the fatigue lingered for a few more days.

                                                Nearly completely incapacitated.  Head spinning, very weak limbs, barely able to get out of bed and stand after extreme effort, no arm strength, could only move to the bathroom via baby steps with while holding on to whatever was available to steady myself.  I ended up on the floor and was barely able to get up and back into bed after considerable effort.  My arms and legs were like rubber.  I had fever and severe night sweats.  I was virtually unable to function.  This lasted from the night of 02/03 and continued through 02/04.  Finally 02/05 I was able to get out of bed and shakily stand. But I couldn&#39;t stay up long, as I had the aches and pains and a headache still.  Finally 02/06 I was able to get out of bed and stay out.  I hope my description describes the magnitude of my symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to survive.

Feb 3 about 13.5 hrs after second dose Moderna (3 AM), I showed no symptoms from getting shot at 1:30 pm Feb 2 until going to bed, but at 3 AM woke due to significant headache and arm soreness.  Laid there about an hour until I got our of bed at 4 AM, got Tylenol from hall closet and went in bathroom to take Tylenol.  I was fine until I tried to open Tylenol, and suddenly started sweating, dizzy, feeling faint.  Managed to get to floor with my wife&#39;s assistance, lay for awhile but couldn&#39;t get up to walk so crawled back to bed.  Had severe chills for over an hour until fell asleep.  Spend next 36 hours in bed due to headache and dizziness, very fatigued napping off and on, but chills never returned.  By evening of Feb 4 I felt stable enough to walk around the house and eat dinner meal at dining table.  Saturday, Feb 5 stayed home fatigued napping off and on.  By Sunday morning Feb 6 I felt good enough to play a round of golf without incident and felt 100% recovered by Sunday afternoon

                                                I started feeling fatigued on Sunday Feb 14. I started feeling this way in the afternoon. Next I felt like I had indigestion so I took some tums. At about 1:00am on Monday morning I woke up and felt really bad and thought I had indigestion so I tried to take some more tums and vomited. I was really weak and short of breath. I laid back down and tried to go to sleep but my heart felt like it was racing. Within an hour I was back up vomiting again with shortness of breath, weakness, heart racing. I tried to lay back down but within another hour I vomited again. This went on until 8:30am Monday morning. My pulse was everywhere. 97 to 112bpm. I was having chills all day and weak. I slept a lot Monday and also had diarrhea on Monday morning. I couldn&#39;t eat all of Monday and finally ate some soup on Tuesday. I am feeling much better today but still a little fatigued.

Chills and general body/joint aches started approx 26-30 hrs post injection.  Fever (101.2F) peaked ~ 36 hrs after 1st injection.  Mild but obvious headache ceased after 48 hrs.  No injection site rash, just soreness of the arm (like all of my previous flu vaccinations).   Second vaccination was followed with chills and peak fever of 101.4F along same time interval.  Current 02/25/21 at 2:30 pm pacific fever has ?broke? with some sweating.  Feeling much better.  I know these symptoms are positive evidence that body is geared up building the protection system for which we are vaccinated. Self-medicated with acetaminophen (500 mg) to relieve aches. Thank you!!

                                                My wife had IPF and passed away. We have an Oximeter Plus here at home. I began to feel extremely tired and decided to check my O2 sat. I was roughly 2 hours following my shot. My O2 sat is normally 97-98. When I checked it it had dropped to 84. This is abnormal for me. It remained at this level until about 4 hours after my shot when I checked it had returned to my normal level. This does give m some concern about my follow up vaccine.

                                                Approximately 11 hours post-injection, general tiredness crept over me.  Decided to call it a night early and before I could get in bed, the chills and shaking began.  This continued for approximately 4 hours.  I was thirsty and struggled to get up and get water, as I was getting weak and unsure of my stance.  No fever, but headache and general joint aching began around midnight.  Sleep was practically nonexistent.  Got out of bed around 7 a.m. to eat and take acetaminophen for headache.  Also prepared and started pushing electrolyte sports fluids (drink tabs).  Ate a piece of toast with jelly and could not taste it.  Had lost my sense of taste.  Went back to bed for my first of 2 morning naps.  After my second nap, approximately 11:00 a.m., most of the symptoms had abated although I was still weak.  Had oatmeal with protein powder (standard breakfast for me) and more electrolytes.  Recovery was rapid and by 3:00 p.m., all symptoms except loss of taste had resolved.  Taste finally return the next day.

Next day had fire arm which progressed to muscle ache all over, headache, chills. By Thursday night had fever of between 100-100.8.  Friday felt somewhat better but still slight fever and very tired. By Saturday morning I was back to 100%. No fever, all aches gone. These were symptoms I would have expected after second dose. I have given convalescent plasma eight times, last was in November. Still showing positive for antibodies.  Not the worst  Experience overall, just unexpected.

On the 4th day after the second vaccine, I started experiencing dizziness. First time when I laid down to sleep at 10pm, I felt dizzy when I turned my head right or left. I slept on my back with head propped up for 3 nights, because the sensation continued when i moved my head right or left.  By the 7th day, most of the dizziness was minor and rare. After 10 days, I have felt slight dizziness on a rare occasion.   I don&#39;t recall have dizzy symptoms  prior to the vaccine.

I had 1 to 2 episodes while driving, but the reality discontinuity were only 10th-of-Secs, so no impairment.

                                                My reaction occurred approximately 12 hrs. following the injection.  I awoke on the night of Jan. 8 after rolling over on my right arm where the injection site was.   I immediately awakened with sharp burning pain and as I became more awake, I realized that I was confused, slightly disoriented and very diapheretic.  I alternated between having a chill to sweating profusely.  My head was throbbing as in a migraine and the orbits around my eyes hurt as well.  I was extremely nausea to the point of gagging but I had not eaten anything so I did not throw up.  Later that night I also at watery diarrhea.  All of my joints ached and my pelvic region seemed to hurt more than the rest of my body and joints.  When I got up, I found that my equilibrium was off and that I was dizzy. My temperature 100.2 but over the next 2 days it went as high as 102, but continued around 100.8 for several hours.  Early in the a.m. I called my PCP service and later spoke with the physician on call.  We discussed in depth.  At that point, my panic had subsided somewhat and he told me to take Tylenol for my fever and I also had Benadryl available and I took 50 mg.  I hydrated myself (I did not have an appetite) but forced my to drink fluids and eat a serving of fresh fruit.  By mid-day on 1/9 I was feeling less anxious and was able to sit and watch t.v.  I continued to take Tylenol and Benadryl and slept for almost 16 hours.  On Sunday I was more improved.  Since then, I have continued to feel dizziness and tire very easily.  Today, my equilibrium is still off and I have difficulty focusing.  I have spoken with my PCP twice this week and I will be going into the Covid research clinic next week as they want to examine me and draw blood samples close to the two week period after the first injection.

Received Moderna vaccine # 2 shot through the same setting on 1/27/2021 @ 1400.  Felt flush and fatigued through the early morning, took his temp this a.m. at 0930 and reported temp ranging to 100.4 F  Pt states that his usual baseline body temp is 97.  Pt states aside from a bit of fatigue he is otherwise without symptoms.  He works part time as a mental health counselor.  Pt was screened for COVID 19 and as well for influenza, those test results are pending at the time of this submission.  I did discuss with the patient that a bit of fever following receiving vaccines is not an uncommon side effect.  I did also encourage the patient to participate in the V-Safe registry program.

                                                The morning after the vaccine I started getting chills, fatigue and a headache (which I was pretty much expecting) but then in the afternoon I was converting face to face appointments to telephone appointments, and suddenly I couldn&#39;t remember how to do it.  It took about 15 minutes to do the first one (which I can usually do in 2 - 3 minutes) and about that long to do the next one.  After that, it came back to me, but it was a bit scary.

                                                The patient had received the moderna vaccine and about four days later he started to develop persistent fevers and, within one week, had developed a diffuse, blotchy, erythematous rash. Bloodwork was obtained by PCP which had revealed eosinophilia (AEC peaked 4250) without evidence of end organ damage. He underwent skin biopsy which revealed:  Superficial and mid dermal perivascular infiltrate. Additionally, there are focal interface changes where lymphocytes approximate the dermal-epidermal junction and are associated with vacuolar alteration. A few eosinophils are noted in the infiltrate but they are not numerous. Vasculitis is not seen. These histologic features are not entirely specific, but are most suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction.  Initially treated with topical steroids. When eosinophil count was noted to be above 4,000 the patient was started on 60 mg of prednisone daily (this was on 1/26/21) and repeat CBC with differential are pending. The rash is improving and fever curve is also improving (on tylenol q8H PRN).  He was referred to hematology/oncology for consideration of bone marrow biopsy, as hypereosinophilic syndrome is also on differential diagnosis.

Wife heard a loud crash and found me in bathtub.  I don&#39;t recall falling but shower curtain fell down and have minor neck and back discomfort at this time.  Wife assisted me to crawl out of tub and she reported I &#34;passed out&#34; two more times for short durations as I crawled back into bed. Had profuse cold sweating episode for about 15 minutes.  Much less weakness now at 10 am, no dizziness but still a mild headache.

                                                patient states that immediately following administration of covid vaccine on 2/5  he began to experience profuse sweating, dizziness and nausea. He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

Of concern, blood pressure spiked to 149/78 (usually 120/70) and stayed elevated all day.  I contacted my cardiologist  late in the afternoon and he advised me to come in if the blood pressure did not return to normal the next day.  The next day, all symtoms disappeared and I felt normal.  When I received my second shot yesterday the doctor giving the injection said the blood pressure spike after the first shot was unusual and asked me to submit a VAERS  report.  My symptoms after the second shot  were a much more significant loss of mobility in the arm, which has returned to near normal.   but no blood pressure issue

Vertigo and dizziness made getting to the bathroom extremely difficult. Headache and body aches too. Woke up at 4pm on Sat. 2/27.  The headache may also have been a caffeine withdrawal effect since I slept through all day Saturday without having any coffee.  I was not warned not to overexert myself but 7 hours before I fell sick I was pushing a 8hp. Snowblower through heavy melting snow. I tired quickly so i stopped after ~ 30 minutes.  Felt much better Sunday morning

                                                Got shot Friday afternoon and reaction started Saturday night. Injection site had a blue coloration about 1/4 inch and began feeling like 1.5 inch of pencil was in my arm. I was feeling very warm and cold at the same time with a normal core temperature. Extreme pain on any movement of arm that caused to muscle to tense. Having a fan on me  really help my heat/cold sensation be normal.  Most of symptoms went away Sunday afternoon, pain in arm reduced and I felt lethargic but OK. Pain in arm had subsided a lot and just felt like injection pain. most range of movement pain free but it did hurt if I moved my left arm up across my chest. Monday morning  had no issues with anything and injection site had no pain on movement or touch. I could just tell I had the shot there and the discoloration was lighter.

My other two really bad reactions were as follows: Eight hours after shot I was shivering and cold no matter how many clothes I put on or how high I turned up the heat. This lasted 6 more hours. One hour after the shivering stopped I was overheated and sweated PROFUSELY. This lasted another 8 hours. Then the overheating and sweating just stopped and I was fine. Ps. my sister and I got the same shot, same Lot#, same day and she had the same shivering for 6 hours but not the sweating.

                                                Approximately 10 days after the vaccination I began to develop muscle and joint pain on my left side. two days later I started to have problems breathing and the muscle pain, all on my left side, worsened. A day or two later I developed a fever of 102 and the muscle and joint pain became worse, again all on the left side of my body. To treat the fever I took Motrin, this also helped with the headache. I also had a lose of appetite as these symptoms progressed and lost about 7 pounds. I developed a cough that persisted for about 7 days. These symptoms were intense for about three days and persisted at varying intensity for about 10 days.

                                                Because of the absurd character limit in this field, I am putting my adverse reaction statement on the continuation page. About 10pm, about 9 hours post injection, I was feeling weak and fatigued.  I went to bed and was starting to feel chilled, but not shaking.  I hopped into bed and turned on my electric blanket in a room that was 75° (from passive solar house heating during the day) and wearing only a T-shirt, sweat shirt, and sweat pants.  The first post-vaccination symptom I experienced was when I laid down and my right upper arm (at the point of the injection) was very sore; it was too painful to lie on my right side.  The injection area felt hard. I fell asleep about 11pm and woke up about midnight; I am generally a very light sleeper, rarely sleeping more than ~3± hours (most less than) at a time.  At 1:30am, I could not sleep so I watched a recorded movie.  All the while, I was feeling progressively worse.  About 2:30am, I felt really chilled, so I cranked up the electric blanket to its highest setting and put on some heavy wool socks, a pair of long-johns under my sweat pants, put on another heavy sweatshirt over my existing sweatshirt, and placed another blanket on top of my electric blanket: very cold / chilled but not shivering.  The movie ended about 3am, and my stomach was excruciatingly aching.  I did not feel I could eat anything which I really felt a need to do, but was concerned that I would just vomit.  However, I did take two, 500mg Tylenol tablets with a half a glass of water.  I might have slept for an hour or so, but was quite restless.  I remember looking at the clock at 4:00am.  By 5am, it was considering calling 911; my stomach ached so badly.  It was then, that I had the feeling / recollection I had this &#34;illness&#34; before.  About 5:30am, my stomach symptoms started to ameliorate; by 7:30am, they were gone.  However, I still felt miserable.  I then wondered whether my stomach symptom was just a concomitant bout with &#34;stomach flu&#34; where I experienced (severe) abdominal cramps and pain; nausea; and low-grade fever.  I have had the stomach flu a limited number of times before and, after 6± hours, it all went away: I just had to suck it up in the meantime.  Before I filled out this report, I wanted to consider whether my stomach flu was a reaction to the vaccination or incidental to the vaccination.  However, after talking with my neighbors and my sister&#39;s friend, who also had the Moderna vaccination, three of the four &#34;victims&#34; had similar symptoms to me.  Thus, I deduced I did not have a bout with stomach flu.  Additionally, a dog walking partner, who is a rescue worker, also noted folks she knew also had similar symptoms with the Moderna vaccine.  I then started wondering what kind of artificial cocktail, a.k.a.: antifreeze, was the suspending medium for the vaccine.  If this has to be stored at absurdly low temperatures I commonly have negative reactions to artificial chemicals.  The minor surgeries I have had are uneventful but for the anesthesia chemical concoction I am given.  I commonly takes me more then 2-3 days to detoxify that and feel normal.&#39;  As in this case, I pretty much laid in bed for the next 2½ days, with no energy or desire to attend to personal issues, including walking my dogs.  However, my subclinical temperature was pretty much gone after the second day.  The notable soreness in my arm was mostly gone after two days, but the injection point was still sensitive to pressing on top of the injection site: I could still feel it.  I have a very high tolerance for pain and have never experienced anything like this.  &#34;Pain&#34; from flu, etc., shots rarely, if ever, lasts more than 10-15 minutes post injection.  There was definitely something in the suspension media that reacted with my body chemistry / biological processes.  I am NOT looking forward to the booster shot; most seem to have a reaction to the second shot that is worse than the first  unless their first shot was uneventful and the second shot had considerably milder reactions than my first shot.  The next time I will definitely have a bowl or two of jell-O in the refrigerator to help quell any (expected) gut reactions; jell-O has always been a comfort food for me in those situations. What a horribly designed survey.  This is next to impossible to complete online.  After timing out twice, I had to start over and opted to download the fillable form PDF.  Even then, I am not given the option to select the subdirectory _where_ it should be downloaded.  Fortunately, I saw the option to open it directly. If you are going to make the &#34;adverse reaction&#34; field so limited, relative to field size and the absurd online time limit, how can you expect meaningful, complete reporting of post-vaccination reactions?  This form CANNOT be fully completed in the time allotted without timing out.  This is, most certainly, a deterrent to adverse reaction reporting.  One has to wonder how many folks just gave up after getting timed out the first time. With this kind of disincentive, how good or complete or meaningful is the adverse data collection procedure?  Have you purged all the supporters?  They do not like real, accurate, objective data, particularly information that is not consistent what they want to believe or the narrative they want to spin.  No respectable scientist or decent journalist would accept third-rate data.  How can public interest decisions be made with a shoddy data collection effort?

                                                The shot at first just made me tired and a little dizzy a few times.  About a week later I noticed a rash and hives after showering all over my body.  I went to the doctor and he gave me prednisone.  I have finished the prednisone which didn&#39;t help.  I am wondering wether it is safe to get the second shot.

                                                69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology.   Outside Hospital: Seen at ED where a stroke code was called for headache, RUE weakness, dysarthria with a CT and CTA that were negative for any acute changes. He he was febrile to 102.2, tachycardic to 130s, hypotensive with pressures in the 80s systolic unresponsive to fluids, leukocytosis to 15 and lactate of 3.5. He was started on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. Additional workup including an LP, UA, and CXR were all unremarkable. He was transferred here due to a lack of beds. Of note, the patient received his second COVID-19 vaccine dose on 3/10 and had been febrile since the morning of 3/11.   Hospital ICU: Patient is hemodynamically stable and has been fully weaned off pressor support. His hyperglycemia is decreasing satisfactorily to insulin and is receiving IVF. Repeat lactate for PM of 3/12 and workup for TIA initiated.      Assessment and plan :   69 year old male with a PMH of hypertension and T2DM who was admitted on 3/12/2021 for lactic acidosis, hyperglycemia (to 580s), RUE weakness/dysarthria/weakness (now resolved), and septic shock of unknown etiology requiring vasopressors, antibiotics, and TIA workup. I have personally reviewed the daily labs, imaging studies, cultures and discussed the case with referring physician and consulting physicians.  My assessment and plan by system for this patient is as follows:   Neurology/Psychiatry:  # RUE Weakness, headache, dysarthria Presented to Hospital with RUE, headache, and dysarthria with negative CT and CTA. The patient has a known hx of diabetes and hypertension with a recent elevated A1c. His hypotension as a result of sepsis may have revealed territories in his cerebrum particularly affected by his likely vascular disease. Will initiate TIA workup. Pending results, will consider Neurology Consult. Plan: - ASA 81 mg PO daily - Echocardiogram - Fasting lipid panel - Bilateral carotid artery ultrasound   Cardiovascular: # Hemodynamics, Rhythm, Ischemia # Septic Shock Weaned off NE, still on Vasopressin 2.4. Monitor shows NSR in the 70s. Has now been weaned off vasopressors. Plan: - Weaned off pressors   # History of hypertension Plan: - HOLD PTA lisinopril   Pulmonary/Ventilator Management:  # Airway, Oxygenation, Ventilation, Mechanics: No airway in place. Unlabored breathing on room air without assistance with sats in mid-90s. Plan: - Monitor   GI and Nutrition :  # BMs/Gas/Feedings: Reports having diarrhea. No enteral feeds. Plan - Monitor electrolytes   Renal/Fluids/Electrolytes:  # Electrolytes, Acid/Base, Volume Patient is septic and requiring pressors. He is also having diarrhea, so monitor electrolytes, creatinine, UOP. Glucose responding to insulin, most recently 159. If this afternoon&#39;s lactate and creatinine normalize this afternoon 3/12/21 and the patient continues to eat/drink ok (which he has been), then we can turn off his IVF. Plan: - HOLD Metformin given elevated creatinine and risk of metabolic acidosis - Lactated Ringers at 75 mL/hr continuous - Trend BMP - Monitor UOP - Venous Blood Gas - Electrolyte replacement per ICU protocols - Generally avoid nephrotoxic agents such as NSAID, IV contrast unless specifically required - Adjust medications as needed for renal clearance - Follow I/O&#39;s as appropriate   Infectious Disease:  # Septic Shock # Leukocytosis # Lactic Acidosis # Recent Covid-19 Vaccine Patient was tachycardic to the 130s, hypotensive with systolic pressures in the 80s, and febrile to 102.2 F. Worked up extensively at outside hospital with the following perfomed: Negative CT/CTA, unremarkable lumbar puncture, unremarkable CXR, and unremarkable UA. His pressures were not fluid responsive at that time, so we will continue some further workup here as below. In addition, there remains the possibility that this patient&#39;s current status may be a result of the Covid-19 vaccine and cannot be ruled out given its temporal relationship to his presentation. Will document this potential reaction with the Department of Health. Patient&#39;s most recent lactate returned at 6.5 and likely reflects his critical illness in combination with decreased clearance (given that his creatinine was 1.7, unclear baseline).    Plan: - MRSA Swab, nares - Stool Ova and Parasite - CSF Culture - CSF HSV (from outside hospital, pending) - Continue piperacillin-taxobactam - Trend procalcitonin - Trend lactate - Report possible Covid-19 reaction with DH   Endocrine:  # Hyperglycemia # Recent Diagnosis of T2 DM not on Insulin Was found to be hyperglycemic in the high-500s on arrival. At least part of his hyperglycemia is a result of receiving dexamethasone at the hospital. However, his most recent A1c on 3/12 was 8.8 and his diagnosis of T2DM is recent. Plan - Diabetic diet - Nutrition consult - Insulin bolus 5 U - ICU insulin protocol with goal of BG &lt;180 - HOLD PTA metformin   Hematology/Oncology:  # Hgb, Platelets Within normal limits. - Monitor as appropriate   # Leukocytosis Leukocytosis to 15.4 here. Plan as above. Plan - Trend CBC   MSKL/Rheum: # Right Shoulder Pain Reports having some right shoulder pain over the last few weeks, exacerbated by shoveling snow. Pain with right arm abduction. Pain is greater in arm and forearm than shoulder itself. Plan: - Tylenol PRN for pain - Outpatient f/u as needed.   IV/Access:  1. Venous access - Left brachial PICC, left wrist PIV 2. Arterial access - None   ICU Prophylaxis:  1. DVT: Hep Subq/ LMWH/mechanical 2. VAP: Not applicable 3. Stress Ulcer: Not indicated 4. Restraints: Not indicated at this time 5. Wound care - per unit routine  6. Feeding - Diabetic Diet 7. Family Update: Updated wife who was at bedside on AM 3/12/21. 8. Disposition - ICU pending further workup, treatment, and continuation of vasopressors.

He is very very fit so it is very unusual for him to not be outside doing major work in the yard or out running. Instead he does anything for a short period like 30 minutes and he comes in and goes to bed middle of day and retires to bed right after eating dinner even as early as 6 pm.  His appetite is less than usual.

I was not sure if I should be concerned  about this.

                                                On March 13, I woke with a headache, a sinus pain, and generally feeling exhausted and groggy.  This persisted through Sunday.  On Tuesday March 16 I awoke and could not focus my eyes: I was seeing double.  This got better during the course of the day but I could not work on my computer.  On Wednesday March 17, I woke with double vision again.  During the day I gradually became able to focus if I looked at an object, but as soon as I move my eyes, it was back to double vision.  I felt much better physically that day.

Ten days later he awoke feeling dehydrated and drank some water which he immediately vomited back up. No food had been consumed. He then developed a cutting sore throat (as in the feeling of strep throat) and developed a fever of 101&#43; along with general joint aches. In about four hours the fever dropped abruptly along with the sore throat. Patient felt tired the rest of the day then awoke the next day feeling fine.

                                                His symptoms began at 9PM of the day of the second dose of Moderna vaccine (gat 10AM 3/11/2021. He was well prior to the vaccine. He had no antecedent infection like the previous events of asthma attacks. He took Zyrtec the night before and the day of the vaccine of both doses of the vaccine.  He has not been any asthma medication for six years except 3-4 uses of albuterol during the fall Wildfire season. Vaccine lot numbers: 1st 041LZ0A, 2nd  003AQ1A. H ehad similar incident in 2012 after Reclast second dose. Had flushing first and then asthma flare. Lasted a couple weeks with just inhalers then had to do prednisone to calm it down. When tapered off he relapsed and had to do three iterations over a couple months.  After the second vaccine on Thursday AM, he was well until about 9PM that night, he developed sore throat and coughing that progressed through the night. On Friday AM he started using his nebulizer with albuterol and budesonide. His symptoms were manageable over the weekend. On Monday he coughed up a large collection of clear mucus and felt much better. On Wednesday 3/17, symptoms returned with cough and shortness of breath. He was started on a single dose of prednisone 40 mg and on Thursday he was seen in clinic. His symptoms seemed to be a mix of laryngeal and chest irritation. He was given an 8-day tapering course of prednisone and albuterol-ipratropium nebs every 6 hours. On follow up 3/25, he was much better except for side effects of the steroids. He is still being followed so I will provide updates if there is some change. He had a very similar reaction to Reclast in 2012 but has tolerated all other vaccines previously.

                                                This my second dose. Within five minutes I experienced lightheadedness and balance difficulties. These abated after twenty minutes. The injection site arm was very sore and grew even more sore throughout the evening and I had a slight headache about 7:00 PM, a rare occurrence for me -- I often only have one or two per year. The headache disappeared within about an hour after manifesting. By about 10:00 PM I was beginning to feel a general achiness all over, mostly manifested in my joints.  By the time that I awoke on Thursday, 03/25/2021, I was aching quite badly all over. By 5:00 PM on that date I felt as if I had chills and a fever but a check with a digital thermometer showed that my temperature was 96.4F.  By evening I was aching  even more severely and in pain - mostly in my joints and hands -- took to my couch and covered up where I dozed in and out. I took a generic acetaminophen around  7:00 PM.  When I got up from my couch around 10:30 PM on the 25th, the aching had abated quite drastically and by midnight the worst was over. My temperature registered 98.0F at 10:30 PM.  When I arose from bed around 11:00 AM on Friday the 26th, both my hands were still aching and paining badly but most of the other aches in my joints had dissipated. By 6:00 PM on the 26th  the severe pain in my hands had decreased to my customary levels of pain from arthritis.

Went to ER; they ran labs, did EKG, chest X-ray, covid test (negative).  Their conclusion was unspecified virus.  The next day he had slight fever and body aches, with pins and needles pain in arms and back.  Still having difficulty urinating.  Next morning still unable to urinate and having severe pain in abdomen.  Very weak and unable to walk.  We called 911 and had him transported to ER.  They inserted catheter and drained his bladder, attached bag to his leg.  Their diagnosis was inflamed prostate.  They did not address his weakness and inability to stand.  He was instructed to see his primary physician and a urologist after the weekend.  As that day progressed, he became unable to control his left leg.  By the next morning, he couldn&#39;t move either leg.  Called 911 and he was transported back to ER.  They attempted to do an MRI but the machine broke down.  He was transferred to a medical center that evening, where he had an MRI and was admitted.  The initial diagnosis was inflamed spine, but the 2nd day the neurologist told us he had a spinal stroke.

Also had used a chemical using his bathtub and the nosebleeds have occurred every morning for the last 3-4 days.  Anytime he gets ready to go to the doctor it stops.  Just first thing in the morning upon wakening and only after he blows his nose.  Which he called the 24-hour nurse line and she instructed him on how to stop the bleeding, and told him not to blow his nose.  He was examined by his ENT in Oct/Nov was told that he was normal other than the balloon procedure.  Is going to FU with his ENT.

Tylenol was finally able to reduce the fever, but the next day it rose to 102,  and the following day also to 102, still having pains in his legs. On day 4, his oxygen level dropped to 80 (he did have congestive heart failure exactly one year ago, but it was corrected in ten days and his oxygen level had been perfect until the vaccine). We are now on day 6 and his oxygen is slowing improving after increasing Lasix. His body had an awful shock with this vaccine which medical people feel contributed to him almost sinking to congestive heart failure again. Even with all his medications he presents as a healthy individual usually.

                                                On the evening of the 15th day after my vaccination and a couple of hours after reporting once again that I was perfectly fine, I had a sudden shaking of my body which lasted about 30 minutes. it was so bad I couldn&#39;t hold a glass of water without spilling it. I got up and walked around, did some deep breathing, tucked my hands under my armpits and tried to resume watching TV. After about 30 minutes it calmed down but did not go away. I wasn&#39;t chilled. my temp was 100. I took to Tylonal and went to bed, shivering. Earlier this same day, around 4pm, I had started dry coughing quite bit but didn&#39;t think much about it. In the morning, after a restless night, my temp was 99. I felt sluggish, and weak but not sick. No activity, no walking that day of Saturday. Took 2 more Tylonal mid day. Temp was down to 98. That night, temp 98, I took Niqual and slept soundly. Sunday morning temp was 97.3 and I was feeling a lot better and continued to feel better to normal by Monday morning. A reaction to the drug 15 days after I thought was strange. I had no vaccination site redness or pain t any time. I wondered if I had actually contracted the virus. I&#39;m ok now. Did not call for medical help. I have never been tested for he Covid 19 virus.

                                                2/16/2021:  Telephone call to PCP/DR: I.  This is all a little strange. Especially with the fever. I would like him seen by NP if we can get him in with fever. I am OK with office visit since we likely have a source in his wrist and he has had first Covid shot.  We need to worry about shingles or gout or cellulitis. If no sign of infection, he may benefit from some prednisone unless shingles.   2/16/21 11:08 AM You routed this conversation to, MD    2/16/21 11:08 AM Note:Saw Dr on Friday.  He was told to go back on Mycophenolate which he started on Friday. Left hand pain from palm to wrist on Saturday.  Some shoulder pain on the left and right side.  Sunday pain got worse.  Went to the ER at hospital yesterday.  Dx&#39;d with carpal tunnell syndrome and gave him a wrist brace. He is taking tylenol/ibuprofen (200mg two tabs q 8 hours) as directed. Temp was 99.8 yesterday.  Temp is 99.5 this morning altho he is taking ibu/tylenol as directed. His wife reports he has traveling pain.  Today is pain is in the Right hand and right shoulder.  No left sided pain today.  Today he is able to hold a spoon in the left hand. He had a &#34;real rough night last night&#34;, didn&#39;t sleep much. She has called Rheum but hasn&#39;t heard from them. Okay to put him in with NP? For ER follow up?  Or should something else be done? 2/19/2021: Call to office PCP/DR. His wife called saying that he went to the emergency room for severe pain in his left hand and swelling he could not hang on to anything.   The pain started on Friday and kept getting worse all weekend . The er told him that it was carpel tunnel and gave him a wrist splint.  His wife says that she call his rheumatologist and they started him on prednisone 40 X 3 days, 30 X3 days, 20 X 3 days, 10 for 3 days then stop.  She states that now he is having traveling pain it went into his left shoulder and arm. Now it is in his right shoulder and hand the right hand is very swollen can not make a fist. This am she states that he is limping on the right leg the cord in the back is very painful,  She then states that now that she thinks about it over a week ago in the evening he told her several nights that he was having difficulty swallowing first it was on the left side then the right side of his throat he did salt water gargles and was fine in the morning but it has continued to come back every night she states now he is saying that it fells like there is something in his throat.

                                                After receiving the 1st dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine about 11:30 am on 2/18/21: 1. About 4:00 pm that same afternoon I started to feel some soreness around the injection area and a slight headache. 2. By about 7:00 pm that same evening the soreness and headache had increased and I was feeling general body achiness. It was much worse sitting or standing so I ate a small dinner and then went to bed to lie down. I felt much better to be prone. 3. I normally go to sleep between 11 pm to 1 am but fell asleep around 8:20 pm. When I go to sleep that early I often wake up during the night and will be awake for a few hours before falling asleep again. That is what happened. I slept about 3.5 to 4 hours then was up for about 3 hours then went to sleep again for about 3 to 4 hours. I think I got about 7 hours sleep which was good since my typical is about 6 hours. 4. I woke up the morning of one day after and still felt the same, that is, my arm was very sore, and somewhat swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness, and it was worse sitting and standing and much better lying down prone. Other than getting something to eat I stayed prone most of the day until later afternoon when I did manage to be sitting up for several hours. 5. By the time I went to sleep that night, again a little earlier than normal but maybe around 10 pm, my arm was very sore, and pretty swollen, around the injection area, and I had a headache and general body achiness. 6. By the time I awoke on the morning two days after the vaccination, that is 2/20/21, everything was reduced but still there, that is, my arm was still sore and swollen but much less from the peak, and I had a mild headache and the body aches were pretty much gone. 7. By the time I awoke on the morning of 3 days after, that is 2/21/21, I felt normal.

While on the toilet I felt a little nauseous.  For a minute or so, I thought I was going to throw up as well.  The nausea passed after a few minutes, but I felt very fatigued.  Got home and have been laying down.  It&#39;s now 5:20pm, 3 hours later, I&#39;m feeling better, but still a little tired.  I have a slight &#34;flu like&#34; feeling that I feel &#34;off&#34;.  I blessed with good health but I feel a little &#34;off kilter&#34;.  I thinking I&#39;ll feel better tomorrow.

                                                Vertigo the morning after the injection; took 25 mg meclizine; rested for a few hours after which symptoms resolved to point where I could walk and function. Very slight effects  (like a heavy head - no headache) lingered for a few days. No medical attention sought.  Not sure if this is a consequence of the vaccination or a coincidence because I took the injection around 10:30 am and proceeded directly to join my relatives for a full day (eat, drink, beach, etc). Arrived home around 8:30 pm -   Around 3 yrs ago, I had dehydration induced vertigo (had to go to ER). Not sure if lack of hydration was the culprit here.   My concern is that with &#34;dizziness&#34; being a more common side effect of the vaccine (and vertigo also mentioned in some studies), I am concerned with the potential reaction after the second dose, when almost everyone we know who had side effects, got hit much harder after the second dose.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Early Sunday afternoon about 19 hours after the shot, I was reading the paper, and every time I read an article, it was as though it was totally different, but I couldn?t quite remember how. I truly read one article five times, and each time it was as though I was reading something completely new. It unnerved me a bit, so I unloaded the dishwasher without any problems, spoke aloud to myself and was coherent, and looked in the mirror to be sure my face wasn?t lopsided. You can see what I was thinking. My wife was downstairs, so I thought I?d probably better let her in on this. She immediately suggested taking my blood pressure (a very good idea), and it was perfectly normal. I took a nap that was about three times longer than any others (I rarely take one at all), but not before I worked a simple crossword puzzle to reassure myself. Woke up, read the same article twice with a five minute interval between, and sure enough?it looked like the same article. It was not simply being fatigued, at least not like any fatigue I have ever felt before. It was temporary, I was fine later Sunday and have been fine today (Monday).

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  After about 4 days from my second COVID shot, my left leg begin to feel uncomfortable when walking.  I try and walk 3 miles every day, but began to notice left leg discomfort and slight pain from my hip to my ankle when walking.  Do not notice this discomfort when sleeping or if my leg is propped up.  Feet are both fine and my right leg is fine, no pain.   Also notice that it is harder and slower getting out of bed in the morning and I get drowsy earlier at night than I used to.  By 9 PM I feel like I want to go to bed.

                                                After an adverse reaction to the Covid 19 Vaccine, the emergency room Doctor suggested I contact you for a follow-up visit.   Dateline and symptoms:  03/01 Received first Moderna Covid Vaccination at 3:45 p.m... 03/02 No symptoms until 6 p.m. When blood pressure started to go up from my normal level of 116/68 to 179/82 by 10 p.m..  During this time I had what felt like mild electric currents from the left side of my chest down my left arm and into my hand.  These systems subsided around 11 p.m. and by midnight my blood pressure was almost back to normal. 03/03 Felt sluggish all day but no blood pressure problems. 03/04 Felt great all day then around 6 p.m. my blood pressure started to rise, by 9:30 p.m. it was 190/90.  At this time I started to feel like my body was shutting down, my face felt flush, and experiencing long distant vision problems, so I had my wife take me to the emergency room. At 10:00 p.m. I went to the emergency room  EKG  showed no heart problems, the blood test showed no heart problems, and after 11:30 p.m. my blood pressure started going down and I was released at 1:30 a.m..  Blood test did show high levels of Blood Urea Nitrogen 26.0, Bun/Creatinine Ratio 33.0, Aspartate Amino Tranf (AST/SGOT) 43, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) 59 and Alkaline Phosphatase 189, all of which are higher than my last blood test on 10/22/20. 03/05  As of 10:30 a.m. my blood pressure is 126/62.  I feel fine except I&#39;m very tired from not much sleep last night.  1p.m. Starting to feel some more chest and arm symptoms as described before, blood pressure now 146/66. Events happened twice, 2 days apart.

Lasted almost 2 whole days, better by Sunday (felt guilty for not going to church).  SIDE NOTE, when I described my side effects to my  brother he went ballistic saying that the government is lying to us, the vaccine was not suppose to contain live virus and me getting sick was proof that it did. I explained that my symptoms were a result of my immune system gearing up for a fight once it had been given the instructions as to how it should fight the battle, but no explanation would convince him otherwise (he falls for every conspiracy theory that comes along).

Fortunately, the vomiting relieved the nausea, and Acetaminaphen broke the fever. Happily, after a very long night&#39;s sleep, the only remaining side effects are continuing fatigue and slightly sore arms.  Note: Form did not allow me to answer below about mild side effects from second shingles vaccine dose I had during the past year. Effects included chills, mild fever, headache, body aches, fatigue. The shots were given at the pharmacy in our local store, but I don&#39;t recall the date our other details.

                                                I had a horrid reaction to my second covid shot. I got it on Monday 3/15 and was fine Tuesday. I even walked for an hour on he beach with the dogs so I said ?this wasn?t that bad? ON THE MORNING OF 3/17. I woke up about 3 AM with a fever OF 104 and basically an inability to stand. I tried to get ofF the bed to go pee and fell to the floor from which I could not get up as I had no muscle control or ability to lift myself uo and using a small ladder t took a long time for me to be able to manage to get on my feet with my wife  assistance.  On the way to the bathroom i banged into walls almost falling again.  told me later I looked as though I had a stroke. I made it back to bed and my temp was 104.  Then 20 minutes later the process started all over again it?s me falling to the floor and not being able to get up. This time when i was finally  and my O2 at 80  heart rate 112 was able to get up after about 7 tries I again walked into walls making it to the bathroom. This whole process happened one more time but this time i took a cool shower to cleanup and get my temp down.  Got back to bed and took a Vicodin along with two Advil.  I woke up at 10 am. No fever, able to stand and walk no problem  I sure hope this is over. but tonight will tell. form Item below is checked patient died and there was no death

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

I called my doctor due to my symptoms of not feeling well. At the time of vaccine, I was also on immunotherapy trial for prostate cancer. My doctor states it could been an interaction with the medication I am receiving for my immunotherapy which was Keytruda in combination with the Moderna vaccine. I took Ibuprofen for pain and about 24 hours later I began to feel better.   I also had my second vaccine on 02-10-2021, lot#: 02520A, left arm, dose:2. I only had chills, six hours after my vaccine and no other symptoms.

The muscle aches and pin prick sensations have awakened me repeatedly for the past two nights, resulting in poor sleep. After 2 1/2 days, the fatigue and muscle aches are mostly gone, but the itching\pin prick sensations (somewhat like the sensations one gets with a case of shingles, which I had once 25&#43; years ago, or when warming extremities after being exposed to extreme cold) are still intermittently present.

Upon getting up I got real dizzy after urinating, decided to go back to bed, but could not figure out how to get back in, so I stood beside my bed until the dizziness went away.  At some point I must of figured I was ok as the next thing I know I&#39;m on the landing of the steps upstairs, which is 6 steps, and my son is saying to my wife &#34;I&#39;m calling an ambulance&#34;.  Upon arrival at Hospital. I heard them say he&#39;s severely dehydrated and his blood pressure is extremely low.  I also had a fractured right clavicle.  I was kept in the Hospital for 3 days.

He felt weak but otherwise well enough to perform normal day-to-day activities/work.  12 days after that, on 3/20/21, he developed the exact same symptoms &amp; went to bed immediately &amp; took appropriate Tylenol.  His fever, this time, only went to just under 100.  He is scheduled for his second shot on 4/2/21.  Should he get it?  If not, what does he do???

                                                Patient is a 70 y.o. male w/ h/o CHF,HTN, sleep apnea on CPAP and 2 L O2 at night, IDDM, CKD stage III-IV, prior tested positive for SARS-CoV2 (12/2020) presented to SAMC ED w/ the complaint of SOB.    Pt states he received his 2nd dose of Moderna SARS-CoV2 immunization 4 days prior to arrival and developed SOB since then. He states that the SOB progressed and included coughing productive of bloody/blood-tinged sputum. The main reason he decided to come to the hospital was because of his shortness of breath and associated chest tightness which he says radiated into his abdomen.    In the ED he was found to have new RBBB and troponin 7.2. He was seen by cardiology d/t concern for NSTEMI, started on heparin gtt, and taken to the cath lab. There he was found to have RCA lesions x2: the more proximal underwent stent placement, the more distal lesion was unable to be stented. Post-procedure pt&#39;s respiratory status was tenuous and therefore CCM was consulted. Patient discharged 9 days after admission after somewhat rocky course of recovery.

                                                On 3/24 by 9:25 PM I had mild shakes. At about 10:00 PM my lips stared to tingle and become numb. Subsequently I began to have difficulty swallowing as well as experiencing some sub sternal pain. Went to get my Epipen and put it beside me in bed. Difficulty swallowing got a bit worse but as I was not experiencing shortness of breath I held off the Epinephrine injection. (What on earth was I thinking?!)The &#34;semi anaphylaxis&#34; was self limiting and by 11:00 PM symptoms had subsided completely. But by approximately 11:30 MP I had severe rigors lasting about 3 - 5 minutes. On 3/25 I developed a severe headache and a low grade T (T-max 99.9). Took Tylenol 825mg with good effect. The following night I had severe night sweats, drenching 3 sets of pajamas. Today, on 3/26 I have been experiencing several cold sweats and I am altogether feeling &#34;strange&#34; (can&#39;t put my finger on it - maybe dehydration?). Have vegan to aggressively hydrate. Notified my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office. Agreed to &#34;ride it out&#34; for now. Shall see my PPP on

                                                How the Vaccine affected my Sleep Apnea  Diagnosed: Severe Sleep Apnea Obstructive &amp; Central 2 ½ years ago with 55 events/hour Machine: BiPap ResMed AirCurve 10 ASV with Memory Foam Full Mask  Vaccine: Moderna  My first shot had little effect with minimal soreness in my arm and a slight headache. The second shot had much more effect on me. I was very active the day of the second shot and the next day. Then it hit me hard. One of the greatest benefits of my Bi-Pap is how it works on my depression and anxiety. I was really sick with headaches, fever, no energy, body aches and really being in bed all day. Unfortunately the depression hit me also. It is like a lead blanket (like the dentist uses for x-rays) over you as you ball up in bed as your mind thinks why do I exist and how to end it with more feeling of anxiety. It really felt like I would die but knew from my experience that it may pass. Luckily it did but it took 10 days before feeling alive again. I also wondered why my events/hour increased at this time and concluded that the vaccine affected my Sleep Apnea.  My Data:  30 day average: 6.34 events/hour  90 day average: 4.64 events/hour 365 day average 3.89events/hour  As you see I have a good events/hour average but it has really increased this month since I got the Vaccine. Here are my numbers.  First Vaccine February 2021 18th  3.0 events/hour (day of shot) 19th  8.6 events/hour 20th  5.2 events/hour 21st  3.1 events/hour 22nd 2.2 events/hour  Second Vaccine March 2021 18th 4 events/hour (day of shot) 19th 6.8 events/hour 20th 15.5 events/hour 21st  5 events/hour 22nd 7.1 events/hour 23rd  5.3 events/hour 24th  5.2 events/hour 25th  6.9 events/hour 26th  3.6 events/hour 27th  2.9 events/hour

Concomitant product use was not reported. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event(s); therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event(s) is not applicable. The causality assessment was not provided.  Patient called on 03MAY2021 to report that on 20JAN2021 he received his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine and 23FEB2021 he received his 2nd dose. After the 2nd dose he experienced chills, fever and had been throwing up. He said he had been having trouble keeping food and water down and it has gotten worse. He also lost 40 pounds.

                                                The next day after the second dose I experienced severe fatigue. About 48 hours after the vaccine I started with muscle aches mainly in across the back and shoulder area. Also noted there was a rash on both legs (no itching and no pain, no bleeding) within a week of vaccination. That is when I decided to see dermatologist who said it would disappear in about 2 weeks.  I am not getting any new rashes so far. As a precaution I took regular Tylenol 1-2 hours after second dose to minimize any side effects.  Injection site was red and sore (more than first dose) for about 2 days.

                                                Pneumonia; coughing up blood; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 71-year old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pneumonia and coughing up blood.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included COVID-19. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 19 Jan 2021, approximately 1 day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient began to cough up blood and was seen and treated by a healthcare professional. A chest x-ray was done and revealed pneumonia. Treatment for the event included doxycycline, prednisone and an inhaler.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pneumonia and coughing up blood, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old male subject, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Pneumonia, and non-serious unexpected event of Hemoptysis. The events occurred one day after the first dose of the mRNA-1273 administration. Treatment for the event included doxycycline, prednisone and an inhaler. Since Pneumonia has insidious onset rather than acute onset, the event was possibly related to underlying condition confounded by elderly age of patient. Very limited information regarding these events have been provided at this time. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event of Pneumonia and Hemoptysis, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Yesterday around 1:30PM I received my 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine. All went well between the time I got the shot to the time I went to bed at about 10PM. I thought I had it made. At midnight I awoke with intense shivering. I absolutely couldn&#39;t stop. I wasn&#39;t cold as my body was hot. I had plenty of covers, but I was hot and shivering cold. Include a severe headache in this picture. This went on for a good hour and I finally settled down and dozed off again. This morning I have a mild headache and a really sore shoulder where I received the vaccine.

At on or around 8:45 PM my dad called my sister that he was having trouble breathing and felt very short of breath. My sister was there in about 7min by the time she got to him my dad was gasping for air he would lift his head up trying to breath. They got him to the hospital shorty after about a 7 min drive. My dad was taken into hospital we were not able to go in due to restrictions.

I took 2 Tylenol in the middle of the night. and felt fine in the next day. I am reporting due to the DELAYED onset of symptoms. While the symptoms of fever and chills were expected, the fact that they came on 5 full days after the fact were a surprise. I thought this would be of interest to put in your data base, that there can be a later-delayed response to the vaccine.

By early Friday evening, the night after the vaccination, I began having severe steady pain in my left kidney, along with sharp shooting pain at the same location.  I also had the expected headache and fatigue. I took Tylenol during this time, and still am. I was pretty much totally bed-ridden for 4 days.  I called my doctor on Wednesday, February 17th to report the severe reaction in my left kidney. The nurse told me that as long as I felt better each day then to weather it out and get  the second shot (scheduled for March 11).  Although I am feeling a little better, I am still taking Tylenol for the pain in my kidney. My exhaustion is lessening.

At 24 hours post dose: Temperature normal, but sinus drainage and coughing began (similar to seasonal allergies). No medication taken. At 72 hours post dose: Urticaria appeared over one hour on the inside of both arms and legs and scalp.  My scalp itched moderately. I took Benedryl 25mg po q6h x 2, then Loratidine 10mg po before bed (No further medication was taken). Coughing and sinus drainage resolved after beginning the antihistamines. The urticaria had resolved on my arms and legs by 96 hours post dose. The scalp itching was resolved in another 24 hours.

He couldnt put words together to make a sentence.  He got up to go into the kitchen and then urinated all over himself.  He was worried about falling sleep, scared he would die in his sleep.  The 3rd woke up and was feeling some better but still foggy headed.  Pt went to the ER about 5 days later.  They did a CT and blood work.  He thinks the tests results came back negative. They wanted him to stay longer and maybe see a Neurologist but since there wasnt one available to see at that time the pt decided to go home.  He has blood work and urine labs to be done at the facility on 2/23/2021.  Pt states he is feeling better at this time.

Developed bad headache which prevented sleeping. The next day, it seemed this was over, but still had no appetite and in the evening the shaking and shivering resumed. Developed another bad headache that prevented sleeping again. Next morning  (today) still no appetite and continued to feel cold. Have eaten some even with no appetite, so I could take ibuprofen which seemed to help a bit.

It improved over next week only to reappear after second vaccine and in this case took 6 weeks to disappear. It was painful and verified by two dentists who saw lesion.  I also develop three days after second vaccine, pain in right calf region and numbness in my right foot involving lateral toes and heel region. the pain disappeared within hours but the numbness has remained, now 6 weeks ater though is less than initially,   After both the first and second vaccinations, I had hemorrhagic sinusitis that lasted at least two weeks with significant drainage resulting in cough.   I had two negative Covid tests after first vaccine to confirm this was vaccine related and I had not contracted Covid.

                                                I am normally symptom free and in excellent health except for some osteoarthritis symptoms in my knee and wrist for which I receive physical therapy.  From this generally healthy state I experienced 9 days of symptoms. Nothing the first day then mild fever on days two through 4 accompanied by headache and backache. Symptoms stronger in the afternoon and evenings.  More severe backache on days 3 through 10.  Days 2 to 7 or 8 very tired.  Took hot baths to be warm all 9 days.   Was able to sleep.  Backache helped with heating pad.

                                                Starting with malaise and tiredness at about 5pm, this progressed to notable muscle tremors within 1 hour, getting progressively worse over the next hour or so.. Malaise and tremors continued for about 2 hours (approx) until sleep at about 9:30. The next day, tremors completely resolved but malaise and tiredness continued. This mostly resolve after 2 days, but notable I became tired more easily for the next couple of days, with no other change in routine. My wife, who received a vaccination at the same time (and from the same lot) as I did suffered similar symptoms but hers resolved somewhat more quickly and did not apparently last over days.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

Son helped me get up and clear liquid (water?) came out of eyes, nose, and mouth.  Passed out.  Son helped me to car and I passed out again getting in the car.  Son drove me to the emergency room at hospital.  In severe pain and very weak.  Test done- Fever, Blood, Urine, CT-Scan.  After about 4 hours I was given something for pain through IV and  felt much better in about 10 minutes but still weak. Outcome- Doctor said it was reaction to vaccine and that I have a gallstone  but it was not causing any problems.  Referred to a doctor for the gallbladder.

                                                Waking up with severe tinnitus in both ears and echo sounding in L ear. Head sounds like inside a bucket or down at bottom of a pool. Sometimes there is a repeat echo from inside the L ear. Extreme loss of hearing this morning. The first time this happened it cleared up after an hour or so last Sunday but this morning it is not getting better. I have had tinnitus for many years but never this bad or severe sounding where hard to hear everything and this horrible echo sound.

The next day my legs started to feel funky, but I had a strong 4 wheel rollator and I continued on to assist my wife with getting her first shot at . By the time we got to the  elevators, after walking about two blocks the legs were feeling worse. On the way out my wife noticed me walking poorly and after about one block my legs &#34;gave out&#34; completely and I collapsed.

                                                tested positive for COVID-19; feeling bad; pneumonia; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 71-year-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced feeling bad (feeling abnormal), tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID-19), and pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included a heart operation and pulmonary problems and respiratory insufficiency since then.  Concomitant medications included salbutamol sulfate.  On 14 Jan 2021  prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient reported that after receiving the vaccine, he travelled outside the country.  He was feeling really bad and thought it could be due to the vaccination.    On 18 Jan 2021, he tested positive for COVID-19.  The patient consulted a healthcare professional while abroad, who detected pneumonia.  The patient was &#34;feeling well&#34; at the time of this report.  Treatment for the events included cortisone, an antihistamine, and isolation.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events of feeling bad, tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID-19), and pneumonia were considered resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The patient&#39;s COVID-19 is unlikely to be due to Moderna&#39;s mRNA vaccine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-053411:

                                                Headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 71-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced headache.   The patient&#39;s medical history was provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt headache. He contacted his HCP and due to the location of the headaches was told he should go to the hospital to rule out a stroke. He was admitted to the hospital and stayed for 2 days. He was started on 40mg of steroids prophylactically. Caller states many different tests were performed but an MRI ruled out a stroke. He was then allowed to taper off the steroids. Prior to hospitalization, he was scheduled to have his second Moderna COVID-19 vaccination on 15 FEB 2021. He consulted his neurologist who told him to go ahead with the vaccination even though he would not complete his steroid taper until 19 FEB 2021. He was advised to also have an antibody test done 2-3 weeks after the vaccination. He has received the lab results and believes it is negative, but is confused by the results.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of event headache was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                28 days (March 20th) following 1st Moderna shot which was given on Feb 23rd, felt dizzy, weak and lightheaded leading to fainting (syncope).  Ambulance arrived and determined to take me to hospital after having 2nd syncope in their presence.  Remained in hospital overnight.  All vitals, heart and bloodwork were fine as seen by cardiac doctor and  determined it was dehydration.  Followed up with primary physician and told him I was urinating excessively.  He put me on Flomax 0.4 mg.  I had the 2nd Moderna shot on March 23rd and again was taken to the hospital on March 31st with same symptoms and near syncope and again was told it was clinical dehydration.  They told me to drink a combination of pedialite and water which I have been doing and I am still experiencing the dizziness, lightheadedness and weakness.  Woke up on April 4th and felt like my soul was being ripped from my body.  I honestly thought I was going to die. Looked on line and found forums of people experiencing similar symptoms.  Went to pharmacy and they recommended meclizine and have taken a clonipin for anxiety.  I am feeling better now, but worried about how long I will be experiencing these symptons.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

                                                about 2 days after the 1st dose of the moderna vaccine, felt very tired and unwell for several days. He felt okay for about 2 weeks then on January 29, 2021 he felt intense chest pain. Concerned it was a heart attack, he was brought to the hospital. He stayed one night and the hospital ran several tests like EKG, stress test and others. Found his results to be normal and was released on January 20, 2021. Even the moment he was released, he felt very dizzy but hospital was not concerned and thought maybe side effect of medication. He continued to feel dizzy, fuzzy brain and hard time staying awake during the day and sleeping through the night for the rest of the week. He passed sometime in the early hours of February 6, 2021. Doctor&#39;s suspicion is a blood clot. He has no history of blood clots, heart problems or any health issues.

                                                When I received the vaccine I did not feel anything, 12hrs after the vaccine my arm suddenly became very sore. I developed severe chills and low grade fever, muscle and joint pain, my hands and feet were cold, headache, and uncontrolled yawning, I suppose my body&#39;s attempt to cool the brain. I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and the symptoms mostly abated, but returned about 4hrs later. I am treating myself with ibuprofen and acetaminophen. I have not seen my PCP, I feel the symptoms will resolve with time, if not I will follow-up. I cannot find anything in the literature but do people that have had covid get a stronger reaction from the vaccine?

The nurse entering the patient data told me I could take the vaccine since I had not been hospitalized or given plasma.  My initial Covid 19 symptoms were diarrhea for two days, mild confusion (couldn&#39;t remember an often used password, and weakness.  I had a very mild case.    after the injections I had: Fever of 102.2 for first two days Redness at injection site 2 inches by 3 inches, swollen, pain if pressed; but did not ache, area hot to the touch .  This lasted 7 days.   Felt a low level of disorientation for a second several times.  Bright lights tended to be a factor is causing that to happen..  Made me react to steady myself for just a second.

                                                I began feeling feverish about 12 hours after the vaccination.  Fever went above 101 deg, at times for about 24 hours.  I took one 650 mg Acetaminophen at 0330 the following morning to reduce the fever and continued taking this at 6 hour intervals until 1/22 (today).  Also I had a headache, sore muscles and symptoms similar to the flu during this entire period.  During the first night just before taking the Acetaminophen my pulse was up to 104 bpm.  It went down during the following day to about 84 and is now at 72 bpm (9am/Jan22); my normal pulse is usually between 58 and 64 bpm.

                                                Started with normal sore arm, ache, tired the day after.  These symptoms went on for a week.  Called Dr and they said they last longer in some people. By the week of the 11th my wife and I were both getting worse.  By Sunday morning, 1/10 we couldn?t get out of bed.  We tested positive for Covid around the 18th  My question is we are supposed to get our second vaccination on 2/3/21, a week from tomorrow.  Given the first vaccine, then testing positive for Covid, should we get the second shot as planned or should we try to delay a week or so to get more strength.  This report is identical for both my wife and myself.  Also, we mask, social distance, no restaurants, etc.  Thank you

                                                Narrative:  Patient experienced cardiac arrest with PEA and a witnessed collapse upon arrival to the emergency department on 1/24/21. Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

Felt just as bad as when  I had Covid 19.  Very little strength to get out of bed and slept all day into the night.  Took shot on Monday, then sick all day the following Tuesday.  On Wednesday I was better , but was still very fatigued and had mild headaches . By Thursday was back to normal.

Next few days felt fine during the day but had a runny nose in the evening. Wednesday (day 4) felt front head stuiffiness and fogginess similar to a head cold. Want to know if this is a side effect I didn&#39;t see listed or the possiblility of coincidentally acquiring the virus. I had no symptoms prior to the injection.

                                                Syncope; Diarrhea; Low pressure; Flu-like symptoms; A regulatory report  was received from a consumer concerning a 72-years-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine, and who experienced flu-like symptoms, head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, diarrhea and low pressure.  The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Metoprolol succinate.  On 24 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (042L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 25 Jan 2021, the patient reported flu-like symptoms. Treatment information was not provided.   On 26 Jan 2021, the patient reported head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, diarrhea and low pressure. Treatment information was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The event, flu-like symptoms was considered recovered/resolved on 25 Jan 2021.  The events, head went back, eyes went white, jaw move left to right, made a last breath, thought he died, and diarrhea was considered recovered/resolved on 26 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the event low pressure was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 72 year old male with medical history of hypertension on metoprolol, who experienced a serious unexpected event of syncope and non-serious unexpected events of flu-like symptoms, diarrhea, and low blood pressure. Event onset was 1 day after first dose of mRNA-1273. Flu-like symptoms resolved. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On Thursday the knee didn&#39;t get any worse but my lower back and shoulders were sore. On Friday, there wasn&#39;t much change. On Saturday the knee seemed to stabilize and the back and shoulders were tolerable. On Sunday, my stomach was queasy. On Monday, sore joints and queasy stomach. On Tuesday, sore joints especially anything injured back in time, diarrhea started. On Wednesday upset stomach, just a piece of toast to eat, diarrhea, chills, sore joints everywhere, miserable. Thursday was the same as Wednesday plus I vomited twice in the evening with sweats and a 101.1 temperature which went back down. I was miserable. I slept well last night and feel better this morning. The diarrhea seems be abating. I feel like I&#39;ve turned the corner this morning but wanted to mention due to the vaccine shot as a possible cause.

                                                On the morning of Friday, Feb 5, I had a shaking chill and headache, and my blood pressure was 206/78, pulse 93.  I did not have a fever.  I went to the emergency room, and by the time I got there and was examined, my blood pressure was down to about 175/ 90.   After the brief exam and blood draw / EKG, I was left in the waiting room.  After about 3 hours, I felt better, and asked the nurse about leaving.  She took a final blood pressure, which was about 165 / 90, and I left.     I had a similar, slightly less severe episode a week later, Thursday, Feb 11, and went to urgent care.  Additional testing, including thyroid hormone was all normal.

                                                It began this morning with pain  in the muscle of my left arm just below the shoulder. I received the vaccine in my right arm. Then I began having pain and soreness in my scalp. Tonight the pain has become a headache, and my right eyelid is very sore. The area of pain and soreness in my scalp has grown larger. I am feeling kind of fluish.  Because I had polymialgia rheumatic a several years ago. My wife and I are concerned that I have Giant  Cell Arteritis. I am praying that this is not the case, and these symptoms are a temporary  reaction to the vaccine. But it is worrisome, because GCA needs to be treated early to avoid the possibility of blindness.

On 3/5/21 at 3:00 am woke from sleep with extreme chills, goosebumps on the skin, and physically shaking to warm up. I had on the bed a sheet, quilt, and heavy comforter. I used the toilet to urinate and was not sure that I could walk back to my bed due to nausea and weakness. After resting, I placed another wool blanket on the bed on top of the comforter. Eventually, I began to warm up. Nausea and fever continued.  Muscles and joints ached. I slept on and off until 7:00 am. I did not eat any breakfast due to continuing nausea. I drank coffee, sat in my reclining chair most of the morning. at 12:00 noon, I ate a bowl of potatte and chicken soup.  My tempereature at this time was 99.5. I did sleep in the afternoon. Later in the evening my temperture had gone down to 99.  Today, 3/06/21 at 8:00am, I feel normal, tired but normal.

Soreness and aching throughout my body, not unlike when one experiences influenza; however, I had no other flu symptoms, no nausea or indigestion.  There were occasional headaches, and a few times, light-headedness.  Weariness, and lack of physical drive continued, on and off, for another ten days.  On one day, one week later, during this period, I was able to function fairly normally, but I may have over-extended..  The next day, Friday, the weakness resumed.  Last night when I went to bed, I felt light-headed again, but slept soundly for seven hours.  Today, I feel much better, and I feel that I am returning to normal.

I don&#39;t remember when exactly the fever started, but it last until the 36th hour after the vaccination.  It was 101.3 most of the time.  101.7 was the high point.  I also had stomach pain at that time.  After 3 days I was fine.  With the 1st shot I also had a sore arm, but not this bad.  I also ran a fever, but it was around 100 then.

Also had some abdominal cramping, which I often have due to colitis so probably unrelated to vaccine. Treated fever with acetaminophen at about 2 p.m., temperature went down to 98.7 but continued to have chills most of afternoon. Second morning after vaccination still have chills but milder. Temperature of 98.7 in morning. Not medicated.

                                                Got the vaccine and had soreness in the arm and felt great, and on Saturday 3/6/21 late afternoon his head hurt to touch his hair.  He knew what it was from previous experience.  Was on the top of his head to the right rear predominantly, probably 4&#34; or so.  It was painful and tied into his right eye as he was photophobic with this as well and sunlight would affect that and would get a spasm of pain/2 second or so in the top of his head.  These events continued intermittently until Tuesday 3/9/21 when it was gone, but on his right tricep has a scraping sore feeling on it, which still continues as of today 3/16/21, but only faintly.

                                                Immediate soreness in left arm.  That evening, I felt flue like symptoms  of severe ache of upper shoulders and back . Of more concern, when I lay down for bed, I felt a heavy weight in my upper chest, making breathing painful.  Use of my CPAP machine allowed me to get some sleep.  these symptoms continues for 4 days, after which they subsided.

It came up the day after receiving the vaccine and has lasted 5 weeks and the Valicyclovere isn&#39;t working. it went away by 03/10/2021. I also experienced fever and weakness 03/06/21 and then when it resolved the herpes came up. Went to the doctor at a walk in clinic on 02/24/21 because I had high fever and nausea and weakness for about 10 hours. I got an infected tooth(root canal and crown on this tooth) and an infected jaw. Dentist put me on antibiotics and I have to have the tooth pulled. I went to the dentist on 02/11/2021.

Now a week or two after the 2nd shot, I&#39;m having significant shortness of breath after very little exertion. I did NOT have breathing issues when I had the COVID back in NOVEMBER. I called my Doctor on 03/15/2021 and he prescribed WIXELA and MONTELUKAST , so far though and it&#39;s only been a few days, I see no improvement. I just felt like since it might be COVID related, I should at least let someone know about it. I feel fine other than when I do minor physical stuff, even tying my shoes will leave me gasping for air.

On 16th March at 7:30 am I started to feel dizzy and out of balance and then suddenly my hearing in my right ear went and I had a sort of wind noise in my ear but no hearing. At approximately 1:00pmmy wife called our Doctor and he said that this could be a rare side effect of the Covid Vaccine and to allow up to 24 hours for the effect to resolve itself. By 4:00pm.the effect did resolve itself but returned at 10:00amon 18th March and lasted for 4 hours. Since then I have been OK with no further effects.

It was difficult to walk.  I stayed in bed most of the next day with right leg elevated, and using ice to help pain and swelling. My wife and I suspected Gout, however it would have been a first for me to have it.  By 3/19 it felt a little better, but right foot still swollen, and my wife and I noticed a pronounced vein from the right knee down. She got scared that it could be a blood clot, so we called Dr and he ordered ultra sound, which was done on 3/19 in afternoon, but technician said that saw &#34;nothing&#34;.  Today (3/20) foot still sore and it&#39;s hard to put wight on it still.

                                                Numbness in lower lip and numbness and slight trembling in right side of face (similar to Bells Palsy?) after four days of being administered the first shot in the right arm. After a video consult with my PCP it was recommended that I go to the hospital and get a CT scan to rule out a possible minor stroke. The CT scan was negative. The numbness became better after two weeks but has not subsided.  After consultation with the doctor in charge of the vaccine operation for the site it was decided that I go ahead and take the second shot but instead of the right arm I should take it in either the left arm or the left thigh. The second shot was administered in the left thigh. I experienced the typical symptoms on the second day - fever, chills and aches and pain but they went away towards the end of the second day. However, exactly on the fourth day I experienced increased numbness in my lower lip and on the right side of my face. Today is the fifth day and it is still there. I expect that this numbness will continue for several weeks as it did with the first shot and so far it has not subsided after the first shot and has now increased after the second shot. I am totally convinced that this is a direct result of the vaccine.

He got the second dose on 3/16/21 and after 10-12 hours had fatigue, myalgias and nausea which resolved within 10-12 hours.  HOWEVER, one week after second dose, on 3/23/21, my husband took a shower and noticed shortly thereafter around 8 AM a itchy rash on face and neck.  NO rash over Vaccine Site.  Over the day the rash got more intensely red and noticed blotches over his upper chest (symmetrical oval patches just beneath each nipple region).  He took 2 Benadryl Tabs at night and in morning of 3/24 the rash has improved considerably..  The rash was macular and erythematous and never raised with no blistering.   His first dose of Moderna was on 2/16/21 and lot number was 011M20M.

Drank water before retiring to bed. Woke up around 9 am and was not feeling well at all. Felt like heart was beating  fast but was very light headed and nauseous. Next is very hard to describe, my wife and daughter found me passed out on the kitchen floor. This lasted approximately 20 minutes until EMT arrived. I do not remember anything from that point. EMT told me I passed out again while enroute to the hospital. Do not remember arrival to hospital nor admittance over night.

She was fine after about a day.  My father reported  arm soreness and fatigue that lasted about three days after the shot.  He thought he was rebounding from the shot and continued his usual activities.  Though, he started complaining of being &#34;winded&#34; and difficulty breathing.  He slept a lot and continued with fatigue and shallow breathing.  A week after his shot he felt he needed to go to the ER because of difficulty breathing and being exhausted after walking up a flight of stairs (we live in a raised ranch style house).

Strangely my right hand was frozen open.  Was unable to make a fist or grasp a water bottle.  When I tried to close my right hand I had a weird sensation in my hand.  It felt like electricity flowing down my hand and into my 4 fingers.  Left hand was not effected.   Had the same effect when I woke up a couple times during the night.  When I got up on Saturday morning the problem with my hand was gone.  Still a bit stiff, was fatigued, headache and body aches.  Sore arm for a few days.

                                                MY REACTION TO THE FIRST DOSE: In March of 2020 I suffered Covid pneumonia and was on oxygen and too weak and short of breath to work for three months.  It took over seven months to return my breathing and strength to baseline. I just checked my lab and I still have IgG antibodies and a negative nasal screen for the virus. One month ago at 9 AM I received the Moderna Vaccine.  About 12 hours later I developed shaking chills and a fever of about 103, pain in my arm from the injection, and severe cough and a VERY WATERY RUNNY NOSE with severe post nasal drip which caused aspiration of the discharge.   I took Tylenol, Afrin Nasal Spray, and a Dulera inhaler and fell asleep.  I woke up at 3 AM and felt well, but at 4 AM I developed an intolerable intractable cough and severe watery nasal discharge lasting about two hours and severe dry heaves from the aspiration.  Afrin nasal spray helped somewhat but I was absolutely miserable for  two hours.    Three days ago I received the one month booster for the Moderna Vaccine at 10AM.   My arm began to become painful but it was tolerable and not relieved by Tylenol. Every time I rolled over at night the pain woke me up but I was able to tolerate it.  Yesterday I woke up with severe constant chills but my temperature was normal.  I felt very hungry and diaphoretic and felt like I had a low blood sugar,  and ate a bowl of rice chex cereal. I felt a little better but a half hour later VOMITED everything up.  I then felt somewhat better and went to the hospital to make rounds.  The nursing staff reported that about half of them called in sick due to the vaccine with severe fatigue, fever, joint pains and headaches.  One nurse reported that all her joints felt like they were on fire.  Four nursing supervisors also called in sick that day.   I then went to my office and my staff said I looked GREEN and insisted I go home.  I did not eat anything but while resting I again had SEVERE VOMITING of my breakfast at about noon.  When I felt stronger I drove home at about 1:30 PM and fell asleep until about 5 PM, still not having eaten anything nor taking fluids. My arm pain went away.  By 7 PM I finally drank some tea and felt stronger and felt like I was not going to die.   It seems that those of use who had the Covid in the past do not tolerate the vaccine and suffer severe reactions. I was unable to find any studies with the vaccine given to patients who already have antibodies.  This lack of data is a real problem.

                                                On the 8th day post injection I developed a erythematous rash ,baseball sized , at the injection site.  There was increase in local temp with severe pruritis and induration. The rash gradually spread and later diminished in size.  There is still erythema and occasional pruritis and a small area of induration which is tender on palpation approximately 3 finger widths proximal to my elbow on the lateral left arm. No other systemic manifestations are noted.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA  I received a Moderna covid-19 vaccination (Lot # 007M20A)  at 10:20 AM on Monday 02-01-2021 at the VA Clinic .  Between 3 and 4 minutes later I began to experience difficulty breathing, sweating and feeling warm, and then I passed out behind the steering wheel of my parked car, while sitting with my wife.  I came to after few minutes as people were attempting to get me out of my car and into a wheelchair, but I had difficulty breathing, couldn?t move, and had to be pulled out.  After being put in the wheelchair, I passed out again and came to after I had been taken out of the wheelchair and laid on my left side on the ground by Fire Dept. EMT?s.  I then began to retch, but did not vomit.   My wife said that one of the EMT?s pumped my chest a couple of times. They lifted me onto a gurney and put me in an ambulance, hit me with an EPI pen, and placed an oxygen mask on my face, as I was having great difficulty breathing.  I was unable to move or lift my arms to help them place a blood pressure cuff on my arm, a pulse monitor on my finger, and lift my shirt to help them attach EKG pads. Atthat point I realized that I had also lost control of my bladder at some point. I continued to have difficulty breathing, and started to experience extreme shivering all the while to emergency Room. Once in the Emergency Room, I could not move myself off the FD gurney, and they had to lift the sheet that I was laying on in order to move me onto the hospital gurney. I had great difficulty helping the technicians remove my shirt so that they could administer another EKG and start an IV (LR 1,000ml bolus).   I continued to have difficulty breathing and kept shivering and sweating for some time.  I was advised that the EKG?s both appeared normal.  After a lengthy period of I gradually reached a point where I stopped shivering and sweating, and returned to almost normal breathing.  I was finally released around 1-1:30 PM.

Within the next 24 hours a raging gingivitis and swollen submandibular lymph nodes followed.  No cough, chest congestion.   .         At this time my flu like symptoms remain at gradually reducing levels - mostly resolved.  My gingivitis symptoms also re reducing but it is still very painful to attempt brushing my teeth.

                                                I had no issues with the first Moderna dose, but 5 days after the 2nd dose I experienced chills, dizziness and slight nausea when up and moving.  This lasted 2 days and started going away on day 3, but the dizziness is still slightly  present.  Also, during this time I?ve continually monitored my BP and pulse.  My BP has been elevated averaging around 165/95 (my normal is close to 145/85).  Pulse has been steady averaging around 66-68 which is normal for me.  Today,  my BP is around 150/90 so it?s slowly getting back to normal on day 9 (post vaccine #2).   Also, I had no other symptoms and my temperature was steady at 97 degrees since the vaccination.

By Wednesday morning (2/10) the symptoms persisted, but I went to work. By noon   I had many of the same symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID in December (9th). Headache, body aches all over, severe fatigue, loss of appetite and chills. Only this time it was worse than I remembered from December. I went home at noon, went to bed. Got up around 6PM and tried to eat, but had no appetite at all. I went to bed at 6:30 PM Wednesday and woke up at 7:00 AM Thursday with only a couple of bathroom trips. Today (Wednesday) symptoms have subsided significantly. Almost gone. Will work tomorrow.

Later, I noticed that the muscles on my right side over my ribs were tightened and later the intercostal spaces of my ribs started hurting very badly and it made breathing very painful and difficult and the pain stretched around my ribs and to my back. If I drew a deep breath I would experience a sharp stabbing pain. Lying down vertically was very painful and uncomfortable. I took my temperature and it was 97.5 which is a little high for me. my blood oxygen level was 99 which was good. on the 16th I woke up and the stiff neck was gone and my headache was a little better. My temp was 98.5 which is 1.1 degrees of fever for me.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.  The outcomes of the events, seizures, mini stroke, and tired, were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack and concomitant medication use can be confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

I did some exercise and checked my pulse afterwards, found the pulse elevated and missing beats. That night it returned to normal.  My resting pulse has been steady at 58 beats per minute for the 2 weeks after the first vaccine.  I checked it yesterday afternoon before going for my second vaccine and it was a steady 58 beats per minute.  This morning I have a fever of 100F and resting pulse is 93 beats per minute and skipping 3 to 4 beats per minute. I&#39;ve never had this problem in the past

Neck pain that goes down my arm (R), extreme fatigue and achy. I&#39;ve lost 5lbs in 3d.&#39; MEDS UTD  History of Present Illness     &#34;I had that COVID shot Thursday (l arm).  Friday I started having cramps in my neck--base of my skull, R arm, into the base of my jaw.&#34;  Worse with laying down, sleeping on L side.  &#34;Hurt too much to get up&#34; (had wife help him up to bathroom).    Tried?  Bayer back and body only.  Tried some topical ben gay (made worse), vibration therapy.  Hot shower seemed to help.  Review of Systems     &#43; for chills, HA, diarrhea.  Worst yesterday.  Missed work yesterday.  Had been eating/drinking well until recently.    Assessment/Plan      1. Adverse reaction to vaccine T50.Z95A    2. Myalgia after COVID-19 vaccination M79.10     1.  Adverse vaccine response will be reported.  This seems to be fairly significant due to being 5d after.  2.  Will try Tyl 1000mg up to tid and Ibu 400 up to tid-qid for next 3 days--try to get dose of each at hs tonight.  Push fluids.  Prednisone 20mg/d x 5d.  Call report tomorrow on status.  3.  At this time, will likely avoid 2nd Moderna covid vax in this pt due to reaction.  4.  Note provided for off work yesterday through tomorrow.

There was no itching or pain, just swelling and hives.  The next day the swelling subsided, hives got smaller, but the area of sking was still red and warm. That same day, I also got chills and felt like I was coming down with a cold, but that went away by the next day.

                                                History of Present Illness  The patient presents with weakness.  The course/duration of symptoms is constant.  The character of symptoms is generalized.  The degree at present is moderate.  Associated symptoms: abdominal pain.  73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. PT states that he was feeling well until after he went to bed tonight. around 1 am he attempted to get up and go to the bathroom and his wife had to help him. She was able to get him up and he went to the bathroom but he seemed more shakey than usual. He then tried to get back up around 230 am and he was very shakey, said he was cold, and he could tno stand. She attempted to stand him up and she was not able to get him up and move him at all because he was so generally weak. No fevers that he knows of. He did recieve his first dose of the covid vaccine this afternoon. He was well after that and went to dinner and was well until he went to sleep. He has a h/o HTN, HLD, and tremor. Pt did have covid in early december as well. .    Notes: 73 y/o M who comes in from home for generalized weakness. Pt is alert and awake but slower to respond than his usual per his wife. Labs are overall reassuring. His etemp is elevated but afebrile. CXR with possible atelectasis vs infiltrate but pt has no cough, no fever, and a normal WBC Coutn so I favor atelectasis. His CT head shows possibly artifact vs cortical hypodensities. Will await formal read this morning. Pts UA is clean. He is no longer shaking after a dose of tylenol and ativan. I suspect the pts generalzied weakess is 2/2 his recent covid vaccine yesterday afternoon. Despite this the pt cannot stand and move around on his own and his wife cannot care fo rhim at home given his current situation. Pt discussed with Dr and will be admitted for further care. .

He received his second dose on 3/9 and came to our Emergency room the same day with altered mental staus and very lethargic. He had a temp of 102.9 upon arrival to the ER. He was hurting all over. He was hospitalized from 3/9-3/12 and was found to have agonal respirations during his hospitalization and a code blue was called and he was moved to the ICU. He did not have to have any code blue medications and only minimal chest compressions were performed. He was discharged home on 3/12 without further complications.

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

                                                Patient woke up around 3:30am feeling extremely nauseous, shaking, drenched in sweat but with a normal temperature (97.6, which is normal for him), and feeling overall terrible.  Food had tasted weird to him the day before, but he still ate. At 3:30am, he felt like he was having a major allergy attack - lots of phlegm, runny nose and eyes. He spit up a lot of thick phlegm (which can be normal for him, due to IBM). After 15 mins, the sweat and shaking died down, and he felt better enough to think about going to sleep. But 5 minutes later, the nausea returned, and he threw up about 25 mL of black &#34;coffee grounds-like&#34; fluid. (The smell was HORRIBLE). After getting through with that (about 15 minutes), he wretched up more thick mucus with a few flecks of black cells in it. After awhile, he felt okay enough to go back to sleep.  Around 6am, he had another major allergy-like attack, but did not vomit.  Around 8am, after being awake for awhile, he vomited again with more black liquid, about 50mL this time. He felt weak and horrible and was shaking. At the recommendation of the advice nurse, he was taken to the ER by ambulance. Upon arriving, he waited around an hour for an ER bed.  They put him on an IV, did a physical inspection and did blood work. His sodium was a bit low, but in normal range. Potassium levels were fine. He was mentally clear the whole time, but physically very weak.  He was kept overnight after a hemochrit test in the afternoon showed low levels of hemoglobin. He was stabilized in the morning, but was barely able to eat anything the whole time. He was meant to get an endoscopy, but they decided to allow him to eat and sent him home after noon bc they hadn&#39;t yet been able to schedule him for it and he was in pain and massively hungry.  When he got home, he still barely ate,  and still isn&#39;t eating almost anything a day later. His stool was incredibly black and thick and SMELLY immediately upon arriving home (he had not defecated for 48 hours at that point), and he has not been able to defecate since, which is extremely abnormal (he usually goes each day in the morning upon waking).  They believe that he may have bleeding in his stomach or upper GI or esophagus, but we are waiting for an endoscopy later this week.  He is still very weak and frail and fatigued.

At some point during the night he wound up on the floor and eventually yelled for help. He was unable to get up by himself and was down there for an unknown amount of time. His spouse believes a few hours. He then continued the same symptoms and wife gave him crackers, sprite and fluids. He slept Saturday night in his recliner, He was still unwell Sunday morning so she called an ambulance who took him to ER. He was then sent to another hospital.  Initially thought he had kidney and liver failure as well as heart attack but she states the muscle damage is what cause the labs to look similar to a heart attack and his kidneys and liver were trying to expel toxins/waste from muscle damage and he was very dehydrated. His liver and kidneys recovered  in about 2 or 3 days and he received IVF and  spent 7 days at the hospital and is still in Rehab recovering.

Three days later on Saturday morning 6 Feb 2021 I noticed a bad rash on my back, under my left shoulder, and on the middle of my chest.  I went to my doctor office later that morning and they told me I had Shingles.  They put me on an anti-viral medication called Valacyclovir.  (1 gram tablet every 8 hours for seven days.)

Effects lasted 48 hours with arm redness and slightly sore lasting still through 2/6/2021, but subsiding.   My main concern was that I experienced blood in my urine on the second day after the shot, Thursday, 2/4/21 at 3:30 PM. The blood continued in varying amounts until Friday AM, at which time I did not notice any blood (could still be microscopic).

The entire room was spinning and I could hardly walk due to poor balance.  Every time I moved my head, the vertigo would recur.  This caused nausea and vomiting so I spent much of the day in bed.  In the late afternoon, the vertigo lessened after I took an anti-emetic drug.  I only ate clear liquids the first day.  Since then, I have improved but still have mild morning vertigo.and mild fatigue.

                                                6 pm 2/10 I started experiencing severe chest pain. I went to the ER for the pain (no cardiac history). They did all the cardiac tests which were negative and administered morphine for the pain (not effective) and then fentanyl which was effective. I was admitted overnight and discharged at 2pm the following day (2/11). The attending cardiologist could find no explanation other than the vaccine. Although I felt fairly good in the morning (the pain had subsided after the fentanyl administration the previous night) I was tired and went to bed when I got home.  Almost immediately severe chills started with violent shaking for several hours, followed by vomiting large amounts three or four times. About 7pm when I attempted to get out of bed to use the bathroom, I fell on the floor as I could not support myself. I was unable to get myself up due to extreme muscle weakness. My wife had to call my stepson to come over to help get me back into bed. A couple of hours later I tried to get out of bed very carefully and at that point I was able to stand with no problem. There then were no further symptoms other than headache. The following day (2/12) I felt much better but spent the day in bed. 2/13 I was up much of the day but still felt somewhat weak and tired. 2/14 (today) I am still much better but somewhat tired with slight malaise.

One additional symptom was muscle spasms in my upper back between the shoulder blades. This experience I had never had before. Now that it has been 7 days after the vaccine; all the after effects were gone after the second day. All is well. Thank you.

Several hours later I noticed that I had flu like symptons and my bones seemed to be painful.  Eventually I began having intermittent rapid heart beat.  I thought this may have been induced by tea (caffeine).  This rapid heart beat lasted until Monday (Feb. 15) I think.  As I mentioned it was intermittent.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

                                                At approximately 24 hours after his vaccine, Pt started to have problems with his vison and headache on the right side.  It took 2 calls to 911 before I could convince him to go the the ER. While there, he suffered 2 grand mal seizures and he was transferred to another hospital for further treatment.

Thereafter I have no recollection of the rest of the day till about 10:15 pm when my wife took me to bed. During the afternoon I called my sister &amp; sent her a garbled text. I tried to talk to my wife but couldn&#39;t get the words out &amp; didn&#39;t know  how to ask for what I wanted. I had a dazed look.  I have absolutely NO recollection of any of this. slept well that night. The next day Feb 27th I woke feeling largely improved, not feverish &amp; still a bit heavy headed. But I was quite clumsy most of the day, dropping small items &amp; bumping into things.

Monday I couldn&#39;t go in for treatment, and so Tuesday I went to the ER. I had a 100 degree fever. They did some tests. The ER doctor gave me prednisone treatments.

                                                About 8:00 pm the day of the injection I had trouble staying awake. I ended up sleeping almost continuously until about 9:00 pm of day two. I was awakened perhaps 20 times to urinate throughout that time, which is extremely often compared to my normal. I would lay back down and be asleep almost immediately. I tried to eat and drink during one of my awake times, but I had no appetite and no desire to drink. Throughout day two I had a fever. I was totally unable to function on day two. About 10:00 pm of day two my appetite returned. About 11:00 pm I returned to bed and had a full night&#39;s sleep.

Additional Details: Pt reported being lightheaded and wanted to lie down. Tried to assist him to our breakroom so he could lie down in private, but he lost strength and slowly went down. 2 pharmacists were on either side of him and gently laid him to the ground. He was alert and responsive but extremely bradycardic. The ambulance came and took him away.

                                                I received the first Moderna injection on Feb. 4 and the second on March 10 both in 2021.  My side effects from both injections were identical.  Left arm (site of both injections) was minorly sore.  Headache, body ache and feverish sensation were severe and comparable to having Type A influenza and seemed to last around 35 hours.  I had to resort to taking the maximum dosage of Tylenol to somewhat suppress the side effects.  I am feeling slightly better from yesterday&#39;s injection and expect to be back to normal tomorrow.

                                                Saturday, Marth 5th -- day after vaccination.  Upon awakening, extreme pain head-to-toe, in muscles and joints.  Severe headache (very rare for me), Hands could barely move (like severe arthritis),  Slightly elevated temperature (98.9 when my normal is 97.8).  Overall symptoms faded slightly and then returned to full strength two or three times during the day.  Unable to eat (not nauseous, just not hungry) and only drank water.  No bowel movement and very little urination during the day.  By about 18:00, headache was gone and pain was receding .  Around 21:00 started getting very cold and could not seem to get warm.  Started shaking severely from cold.  Put on sweat suit, turned on bed heater, and added blankets, then went to bed around 22:00.    Woke up Sunday morning (March 7th feeling absolutely perfect!  None of the previous day&#39;s pain was present, no temperature, no limits to hand/finger movement, and was very hungry.  Ate a normal size breakfast with no problems, urination was normal,   It was like the reaction had never happened, but my wife assured me that it had.   Other than slight constipation, I have no had any problems since.

It was 102. that evening I was dizzy and vomiting and I was shaking terribly. My temp went up as high as 103.2. It eased with 2 tylenol  I run a temperature for 3 days. I lost my sense of smell and taste. I had not been anywhere where I could have had contact with someone who had covid to my knowledge. My sense of smell has come back but my taste of food has slowly coming back. I would rather report it here then to say anything in public. My partner can tell I was bedridden for several days and still get and stay very tired.I did not go to emergency room only called them

                                                I got out of bed at my normal time of 5 AM and proceeded to the bathroom to urinate, feeling fine. Just before starting to urinate, I started sweating profusely and shaking and so turned around and sat down on the toilet. I then sweat even more as if I was in the shower, and shook violently. I then started feeling very nauseous, but I was shaking so badly that I had to very carefully  hold the toilet  to turn around to kneel down in front of the toilet. I heaved a number of times, but nothing came up. I finally stopped shaking and sat on the floor in front of the toilet for a while, and the sweating got less. After a short time, I got up and walked slowly to a recliner, about 30&#39; away. The nausea had gone away by then and the sweating had subsided. My wife brought me blanket and I rested till 7:30 AM.  I had a cup of coffee about 8 AM, and a bowel of cereal at 9 AM. I have been fine ever since then, no more reactions, thank goodness. That one was horrible.

                                                He received his vaccine in the right arm and the next day it was very sore, could feed himself but that was eat.  That morning he had a temp of 99&#43; fever, and then went up to 101.4 which lasted for the 2nd day.   He had fatigue like the flu, which he just rested and slept.  He had chills 5/10, headache as well 7/10 that was with him the entire day and on the 3rd day he had minimal headache.  Had minimal muscle pain and joint pain 5/10.  Just surprised that he was affected by it, and is concerned if he&#39;s going to have the same symptoms with the 2nd vaccine.  He had COVID in October 23rd and that his symptoms were severe and he was going to have a bad time of it.  He remained severely sick for 16 hours and went to see his doctor who told him to go home and wait it out.  These symptoms were similar to but not as intense as the symptoms he had with the COVID virus.  He did not take anything for the symptoms that he had from the vaccine.  He did take some CBD oil one day and he did not take it again.  He has resolved now from the symptoms.

Stayed in bed all day.  Was able to eat small meals, a bit queasy stomach, more loose BM.  Went to sleep 30 hr after shot.  Work up the next day without fever.  Was fatigued the entire day.    Had loose bowls/diahrea  off and on for the next 5 days.  Got back to normal BM a weeks after the shot.  Left arm soreness was pretty much gone by end of week.

                                                I received the vaccine on Monday. Tuesday I felt like I had the virus again-tiredness, slight temperature, chills, intense pain at injection site, slight stomach discomfort. What surprised me and the reason I am reporting this is the symptoms, though gradually better, persisted until Friday-4 days. I was expecting to be down for a day or two, but length of the aftereffects surprised me. I had a strong case of Covid in January 2020.

                                                I vaccinated the pt who stated he only had a sore arm with the first vaccine and no other reaction and that he had never had any kind of severe reaction to drugs, vaccines, or foods.  Approximately 5-10 minutes after vaccinating Client, I was informed that his top lip was swelling as he sat in our Waiting Area.  I immediately went to check on him and observed visible swelling of the middle of his top lip.  I asked if he had noticed any other swelling, trouble swallowing, or breathing, to which he replied he did not.  I then when to check with the pharmacist running the clinic to verify the best way to proceed.  I was prepared with an Epipen a few feet away from pt to use if needed. Another pharmacist, brought over an ice pack. Pharmacist again questioned the pt who affirmed he had no other symptoms and that the swelling did not appear to be spreading.  We offered to call 911 and the pt declined, insisting that we not make a fuss.  We insisted that we wanted to make sure he did not have any trouble breathing or any other reaction and to sit for 30 minutes of observation.  Pt accepted the ice pack and reluctantly agreed to sit for &#34;a while&#34;.  I sat with the pt monitoring him closely for about 30 minutes and engaged him in conversation.  Pt had no issues breathing or speaking and repeatedly stated that it was not itchy or painful and the swelling had receded minimally after 30 minutes.  He experienced no other symptoms, but was tired and wanted to go home,  He explained that he had his colon removed this past Monday and was in some discomfort and was very tired.  The patient was eager to leave and again declined further medical treatment.  I provided the patient with generic benadryl tablets since he he did not have any at home.  I instructed him to go home, take 2 tablets with a big glass of water, and take his nap. I asked if I could call him later this afternoon to follow-up with him and he approved.  I told him that I would report the incident here.  I also told him that if his symptoms worsened and if he had any trouble breathing to call 911.  The patient then left the Waiting Area.

                                                I just wanted to report what appears to be a minor delayed reaction to the Moderna vaccine. I received my first dose on Monday 1/18. I had only a sore arm and a minor headache for a day or two afterward. However, this Monday (day 7) I had what felt like a mosquito bite at or near the injection site and it itched quite badly that night. Yesterday (day 8) I didn?t notice much, but last night it started to itch again and I noticed that it had developed into more of a rash around the injection site (nowhere else). It was pink and somewhat warm. I put ice on it and took a Tylenol and it was much improved and it hasn?t bothered me much since then. It is calmer today, but still pink.  I am not really concerned about this, but I thought I should let you know just in case there is something else I should know or do. I plan to go ahead with my second dose which is scheduled for 2/15.

Now (3 days after injection) it is sore when touched, but not painful otherwise.  After a day the soreness did not interfere with normal activity including splitting wood.  Other than that there were no noticeable side effects except that I might have been a little sleepier that than normal.  (Answer to question 20 should be &#34;mostly&#34;.

                                                This gentleman was hospitalized with dyspnea, found to have a leukocytosis and probable right lower lobe pneumonia, hospitalized for IV antibiotic therapy.  He is still hospitalized but improving as of the date of this report. His COVID-19 test was negative on the day of admission. He had no symptoms out of the ordinary on the day of his vaccination. I am reporting this as it occurred in the week after his first dose of vaccine though would suspect the timing is likely coincidental rather than directly related to the vaccine.

                                                Approximately 20 hours after the injection I began to suffer from flu-like symptoms; headache, fever, chills, aches, and extreme weakness. I was also very tired and spent the afternoon through the night in bed. I had heavy covers but needed a sweatshirt with a hood up to stay warm.  I am not sure when I went to sleep, but when I awoke the next morning most of the symptoms were gone.   Except for being somewhat tired, I felt fine.  I was completely recovered by about noon, so I would estimate that my symptoms were less than 24 hours in duration; no recurrences to date.

The patient did not tell me this was his second dose. Somehow, he had an appointment to receive the vaccine on 02/9/21. I did not know that he had gotten the first dose on 01/21/21. I missed the information on the consent form and administered the vaccine 19 days after the first dose (9 days earlier than the recommended 28 days). Patient did not have any significant adverse reactions other than sore arm, chills, and body aches (which are common with the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine). The patient received the vaccine earlier than recommended by guidelines.  Patient came in today because they received a call that their appointment had been cancelled due to shortage of vaccine. Patient&#39;s wife comes in confused since the patient had already received both doses. I apologized to the patient&#39;s wife, asked if he had any serious reaction and the wife said, &#34;no significant reactions&#34;.  Advised patient that I would report this mistake.

Approx 13 minutes after receiving the dose, patient became weak, dizzy, and extremely diaphoretic.  Rapid response was called.  Patient was wheeled into exam room.  BG checked immediately and was 110.  Initial vitals showed HR 39 with BP 83/48.  Patient was transferred to exam table w/o incident.  He did not complain of CP or SOB.  Denies any throat swelling or itching.  He felt very weak and tired.  He continued to be extremely diaphoretic.  An 18G IV was introduced to the left forearm without incident.  He was connected to 1 L bag of 0.9% Normal Saline which was hung to bolus, running well without pressure.  EKG obtained and showed sinus bradycardia with a rate of 43.  Possible ST changes in V1 and V2, but not diagnostic of ST elevations or depressions.  There is IVCD noted.  Patient has hx of AFib - not in Afib currently.  Reports on Eliquis instead of Coumadin.  EMS was contacted.    Physical exam performed revealed a bradycardic HR which was regular. No murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  Patient is extremely diaphoretic and pale.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He is not in respiratory distress and shows no signs of oral swelling. No hives noted on his skin.  Vitals were rechecked at 3 mins and showed SaO2 at 95% and then 92%.  NC O2 applied at 2 L/min continuous and there was improvement to 95%.  He still denies any respiratory distress and was not manifesting any signs of respiratory distress.  Still denied any chest pain.  NS continued to infuse at bolus dose and BP recheck improved to 108/65 - patient was lying supine.  HR remained between 40-42.  At this time, the patient reported improved symptoms and he was not sweating as profusely as previously.  At this time EMS arrived.  Atropine was not administered in the clinic, but was prepared in expectation as a possible next step.  As patient&#39;s symptoms improved, but his vital signs remained altered, he was agreeable to transport to the hospital by EMS.  He was placed on stretcher and care was relinquished to EMS team.  Patient transported out of clinic in guarded condition.

                                                Vaccination at 9:00am. Some discomfort but not real pain in upper arm throughout the day, but became really tired later in the day and went to bed early. Got up to use the bathroom at about 11:30pm.  Swung my legs out of bed to the floor and went to stand up but fell forward to the carpet.  I had no strength in my legs or arms.  I laid on the floor about 10 minutes and could not roll over or sit up or get up to my knees.  My wife came around and helped me get up and back on the bed.  She then helped me down the hall to the bathroom, then back to the bedroom.  She helped me back to the bathroom one other time that night.  I stayed in bed for several hours and was very week and mostly sat all day,  I regained my strength over the next three days to where I could stand and walk, although I was very fatigued.  I am now about 9 days later and feel pretty much normal but get fatigued and my balance is not normal.

These symptoms lasted for for 24 to 36 hrs. I took tylenol and fruit juice. Fever reduced to 99 degrees after 24 hrs and all symptoms were completely gone after 48 hrs. I did not seek medical treatment. I looked online and found this was a common reaction especially to the 2nd dose of the vaccine.

                                                Possible Stroke; Unable to speak/Lack of pronunciations; Fatigue; A spontaneous report was received from a health care professional concerning 75-years old male patient who experienced stroke (Cerebrovascular accident), unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations (Speech disorder) and fatigue (Fatigue).  The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack. Concomitant medications included included Metoprolol, HCTZ, Irbesartan, and Aspirin.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 012L201A) intramuscularly in the Anatomical location for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 05 Feb 2021, approximately four days prior to the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 030L20A) intramuscularly in the Anatomical location for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Feb 2021, the patient experienced fatigue.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced the events stroke and unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations. The events resulted in hospitalisation as seriousness criteria. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 09 Feb 2021. The patient was moved to ICU for 24 hours, and was the patient was discharged from Hospital on 11 Feb 2021. Treatment for the event included Eliquis and 80 mg chewable aspirin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events stroke, unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations and fatigue were considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, a temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Of note, the patient has a pre-existing history of heart attack which is a strong confounder for the reported CVA and speech disorder. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                The day after (3/11/21) the vaccination at 9:30 PM I experienced shakes, as though very cold.  My pulse oximeter showed low blood oxygen (between 80 and 85%) and elevated heart rate (high 70&#39;s/low 80&#39;s).  [I took multiple readings to make sure the numbers were accurate.]  By 10 PM my temperature started to increase rapidly.  Max was around 101.5 to 102F.  Sweat profusely.  By about midnight the fever &#34;broke&#34; (dropped back to normal range).  This will sound odd, but I felt like I had been shown what a severe Covid-19 infection/disease would look like if I were to become seriously ill with the disease.  Felt light-headed on Friday (3/12/21).  [I had no reaction, other than some muscle soreness, from the first dose.The same day as and after the second injection I had soreness in my entire left bicep all day.  No other reactions that day.]

No temperature, but skin was highly sensitive to clothing like when you have a high temperature with the flu.  Worst side effect, though, was a highly exacerbated episode of my restless legs syndrome. Even though I was on the verge of exhaustion and desperately needed to sleep, it made the restless legs so bad that I couldn&#39;t stay in bed. Sat up half the night trying to sleep in a chair. This was the worst RLS episode I&#39;ve ever had by a factor of about 10.

After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported). Concomitant products included ALLOPURINOL for an unknown indication.   On 10-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 07-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONTROL OF LEGS (again he lost control of his legs in the middle of the night) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and disability) and CHILLS (pretty bad chills). On 08-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (acute renal failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and BLOOD CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE INCREASED (elevated CPK) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 08-Apr-2021 to 11-Apr-2021 due to ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY and LOSS OF CONTROL OF LEGS. On 11-Apr-2021, ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY (acute renal failure) outcome was unknown, BLOOD CREATINE PHOSPHOKINASE INCREASED (elevated CPK) had resolved. At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONTROL OF LEGS (again he lost control of his legs in the middle of the night) and CHILLS (pretty bad chills) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-Apr-2021, Blood creatine phosphokinase: 22,000 High. On 10-Apr-2021, Blood creatine phosphokinase: 10,000 High. On 11-Apr-2021, Blood creatine phosphokinase: 6,412 High.   Acute renal failure was due to something in the vaccine that attacked the muscles in his legs.
