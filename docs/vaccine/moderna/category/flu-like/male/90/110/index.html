                                                Syncope; Shaking; Struggling to breathe; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 90-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.

On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient stayed at the vaccination site for fifteen minutes to watch for any reaction, he had none, so he left. Later that night the patient began shaking and struggling to breathe, so 911 was called. At the hospital, the patient was diagnosed with syncope.

No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The outcome of the events, syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe, was resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 90 year-old, male patient, who experienced events of syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.  The events occurred the same night after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.

Medical history, as provided by the reporter, included COVID in July 2020 from which he fully recovered, slight dysrhythmia, Parkinson&#39;s (tremors only), and slightly elevated blood pressure.  The reported stated the patient&#39;s baseline health had been pretty good and he was usually mobile, active, cognitive, and had speech.  Concomitant medications included carbidopa monohydrate (&#43;) levodopa, losartan, beta blocker (unspecified), and liquid morphine.    On 20 Jan 2021, one day prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number: 028L20A) intramuscularly in his right (dominant) arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021, around 2 pm, the patient had &#34;a very harsh&#34; dysrhythmia and his Parkinson&#39;s symptoms worsened with joint contractions, stiffening, and confusion.  He had also been napping more than before.  Since getting the vaccine, his blood pressure &#34;has been haywire&#34;, sometimes going high and sometimes low.  Treatment information was not provided.  The action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, a very harsh dysrhythmia, Parkinson&#39;s symptoms got worse with joint contractions, stiffening, and confusion; napping more than before, and blood pressure has been haywire, sometimes going high and sometimes low, were considered not recovered/not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                2/14 Emergency room HPI Patient is a 94 y.o. male who presents with complaint of cough that started about a week ago, and was seen by primary care provider on the 9th February 2021.  Patient was started on Augmentin and has taken it for about 5 days but said the cough is worse and productive of clear sputum.  Patient in ER to get checked for pneumonia.  Patient denies a fever or chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea vomiting and no headache or dizziness. Transferred to another facility h&amp;pHistory of Present Illness:  94-year-old former smoker with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not currently on anticoagulation, coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, CKD 4, prostate cancer on surveillance, TAVR 2/17, with a son who is a doctor and a caregiver who is a Radiology NP by his report, who presents in transfer from previous Hospital due to a large right pleural effusion.  He has had a cough for some time now, but thinks it may have worsened, at least per his caregiver, over the last 4-5 days.  He was seen by his PCP on February 9th and placed on Augmentin, but nothing changed.  He himself denies being short of breath, having any chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, change in appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea.  Of note, on a chest x-ray in June he had bilateral pleural effusions, and on an MRI in July to investigate a renal mass, he was noted to have a small right-sided pleural effusion.        On arrival to facility this morning, he was afebrile, normotensive, had a normal heart rate, sometimes mildly bradycardic, normal respiratory rate and saturations of 97% on room air.  Labs demonstrated chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, stable stage 4 kidney disease creatinine of 2.6, BUN 64, glucose 187.  Chest x-ray demonstrated a moderate right pleural effusion, noting that underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  He was also felt to have bibasilar atelectasis.  CT of the chest without contrast showed a large right pleural effusion with most of the right lower lobe being collapsed.  Superimposed infection could not be excluded.  He had a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and a small pericardial effusion as well.  EKG and procalcitonin were not performed.  He was sent to our facility for thoracentesis.         On arrival here, vitals remained stable.  His bedside RN informed me that upon returning from the bathroom, he appeared to be a bit dyspneic, but the patient himself denies any shortness of breath or ?huffing and puffing?. 2/25 admEd to hospital admission

The pt&#39;s COVID-19 01/13/20  was positive and he was admitted. He was started on treatment with remdesivir &#43; dexamethasone on 1/14. The pt initially required supplemental oxygen via low-flow NC, however his oxygen requirements increased to 100% NRB. On 01/16/21 his MPOA elected for hospice care.  The pt passed on 01/17/21.
