He experienced arm soreness and fever up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit for 48 hours including chills, fatigue, and lethargy. Since that time he has experienced confusion, loss of mental acuity,, loss of appetite, confusion, loss of short and long term memory. His ability to provide for his needs on his own have greatly diminished. Prior to the second injection my dad was fully supportive of his own care and mentally sharp. He does seem to be recovering at times, is once again able to take care of his personal needs, but doesn?t eat and is still confused. He doesn?t want to leave his chair..

Resident began to run a fever of  99.7, by 18:45 it was 100.3, and then he was administered tylenol and nausea medications since he was vomiting. He vomited both of these up and retemp check was done and it was up still, but then went up as high as 101.5. Tylenol was given again and this time he was able to keep it on his stomach. Fever was finally reduced and has not returned to that extreme. He was weak and a fall rick, so a sitter was placed in the room with him to keep him safe from falling. He would not wear his normal CPAP machine during sleep time. Feeling much better today.

                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included Alzheimer&#39;s, hypertension, arteriosclerotic heart disease, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, covid-19, allergy to aricept and exelon. The concomitant medications reported included atorvastatin, tamsulosin hydrochloride, paracetamol, macrogol 3350, furosemide and ipratropium bromide/salbutamol sulfate for unspecified indications.  On 29 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 26 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k208) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient was on droplet isolation due to possible exposure of Covid 19 and received duoneb treatments for chronic nonproductive cough. The patient also received honey consistency fluids.  On 19 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s droplet precautions were discontinued.  On 26 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced difficulty breathing, cyanotic, cough and sounded congested following which the patient was repositioned. The  lab findings included oxygen saturation at 78 percent on room air, so oxygen was applied at 2L which increased oxygen saturation at 88 percent, so oxygen was increased to 4L and oxygen saturation increased to 95percent, body temperature at 103.1 degree Fahrenheit, blood pressure 188/110 mmHg, respiratory rate at 28 breaths per minute, pulse rate at 128 heartbeat per minute. The patient was then sent to the Hospital emergency room (ER) where he was diagnosed with right sided pneumonia.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome for the events, right sided pneumonia, difficulty breathing, cyanotic, cough and sounded congested was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 92-year-old, male patient. The patient&#39;s medical history od Alzheimer&#39;s, hypertension, arteriosclerotic heart disease, prostate cancer, covid-19, on duoneb treatments for chronic nonproductive cough remains as contributing factors.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included pulmonary fibrosis, sleep apnea, acid reflux and prostatitis. Concomitant medications reported included aciphex and ativan.   On 20 Jan 2021, approximately two weeks prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 027L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, the patient experienced immediate flushing with red hot ears which persisted throughout the day and mild soreness at the injection site lasting approximately 24 to 48 hours. He experienced two instances of right-sided cramping neck pain accompanied by shoulder pain radiating to the head, lasting 5 to 10 minutes per episode between 20 Jan 2021 and 04 Feb2 021. These episodes were brief and have not returned and awaking to both legs and his back &#34;filled with pains&#34; on 23 Jan 2021.

On 04 Feb 2021, the patient&#39;s whole body became ice cold at approximately 3PM. By 3:15PM he was experiencing chills and shivering that lasted approximately one hour. Patient called his physician, and was directed to the Emergency Room (ER) immediately. There he received blood tests and prophylactic broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy immediately upon admission. Patient reports that Infectious Disease confirmed there were two strains of bacteria present in his bloodstream. From the patient additional samples were collected for culture to tailor antimicrobial therapy accordingly. He also said he was hospitalized for six days and discharged on 10 Feb 2021 with at home Iintravenous (IV) infusion device to administer continuous (24 hour) antibiotic therapy for a full 14 days. He was released from the hospital to his daughter&#39;s care.  He had no history of significant adverse events or allergic reactions post vaccine administration. He is concerned about the origin of the infection, as no source could be confirmed per Infectious Disease. The patient is concerned the infection could have stemmed from the vaccine or it&#39;s administration. He attests that his physician wants him to proceed with his second dose of Moderna.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events is unknown.   The events, flushing with red hot ears, mild soreness at the injection site, right-sided cramping neck pain accompanied by shoulder pain radiating to the head, leg pain, back pain, body became ice cold, chills and shivering were considered resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Medical history, as provided by the reporter, included COVID in July 2020 from which he fully recovered, slight dysrhythmia, Parkinson&#39;s (tremors only), and slightly elevated blood pressure.  The reported stated the patient&#39;s baseline health had been pretty good and he was usually mobile, active, cognitive, and had speech.  Concomitant medications included carbidopa monohydrate (&#43;) levodopa, losartan, beta blocker (unspecified), and liquid morphine.    On 20 Jan 2021, one day prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number: 028L20A) intramuscularly in his right (dominant) arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Jan 2021, around 2 pm, the patient had &#34;a very harsh&#34; dysrhythmia and his Parkinson&#39;s symptoms worsened with joint contractions, stiffening, and confusion.  He had also been napping more than before.  Since getting the vaccine, his blood pressure &#34;has been haywire&#34;, sometimes going high and sometimes low.  Treatment information was not provided.  The action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, a very harsh dysrhythmia, Parkinson&#39;s symptoms got worse with joint contractions, stiffening, and confusion; napping more than before, and blood pressure has been haywire, sometimes going high and sometimes low, were considered not recovered/not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Another customer in the store called over to the technician and pharmacist on duty stating the patient looked sick. He had dropped his timer that was counting down his 15 min post dose wait time. Pharmacist approached patient and asked him how he was doing. He was initially non-responsive, eyes were slightly glazed over. I repeatedly asked him his name and how he was doing. He began to respond after prompting, saying he felt very hot and sweaty. He stated he was thirsty and he hadn&#39;t eaten anything before his dose. Technician obtained a glass of water and a granola bar for the patient. Patient began to improve just minutes after food and water. He stated he thought he had stood for too long while waiting for his shot and hadn&#39;t eaten that morning so he began to feel sick. Patient recovered enough to call his daughter to pick him up from the store. His daughter arrived to pick him up and patient was able to walk out of the store without issue.

                                                Hi, my name is, I&#39;m a RN and am submitting this report about my grandpa.  I took him into the VA to get his second covid vaccine on 2/17/21.   At that time my grandp lived semi-independently in a house between my parents and my uncle .  He didn&#39;t get out very much but with some help of grocery shopping and organizing his medication he was still able to live alone and function well independently.  My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I&#39;d have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.  It became obvious to me that this was the end of his life and so I requested a hospice referral from Dr. My grandpa died on 3/24/21.

                                                2/14 Emergency room HPI Patient is a 94 y.o. male who presents with complaint of cough that started about a week ago, and was seen by primary care provider on the 9th February 2021.  Patient was started on Augmentin and has taken it for about 5 days but said the cough is worse and productive of clear sputum.  Patient in ER to get checked for pneumonia.  Patient denies a fever or chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea vomiting and no headache or dizziness. Transferred to another facility h&amp;pHistory of Present Illness:  94-year-old former smoker with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not currently on anticoagulation, coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, CKD 4, prostate cancer on surveillance, TAVR 2/17, with a son who is a doctor and a caregiver who is a Radiology NP by his report, who presents in transfer from previous Hospital due to a large right pleural effusion.  He has had a cough for some time now, but thinks it may have worsened, at least per his caregiver, over the last 4-5 days.  He was seen by his PCP on February 9th and placed on Augmentin, but nothing changed.  He himself denies being short of breath, having any chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, change in appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea.  Of note, on a chest x-ray in June he had bilateral pleural effusions, and on an MRI in July to investigate a renal mass, he was noted to have a small right-sided pleural effusion.        On arrival to facility this morning, he was afebrile, normotensive, had a normal heart rate, sometimes mildly bradycardic, normal respiratory rate and saturations of 97% on room air.  Labs demonstrated chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, stable stage 4 kidney disease creatinine of 2.6, BUN 64, glucose 187.  Chest x-ray demonstrated a moderate right pleural effusion, noting that underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  He was also felt to have bibasilar atelectasis.  CT of the chest without contrast showed a large right pleural effusion with most of the right lower lobe being collapsed.  Superimposed infection could not be excluded.  He had a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and a small pericardial effusion as well.  EKG and procalcitonin were not performed.  He was sent to our facility for thoracentesis.         On arrival here, vitals remained stable.  His bedside RN informed me that upon returning from the bathroom, he appeared to be a bit dyspneic, but the patient himself denies any shortness of breath or ?huffing and puffing?. 2/25 admEd to hospital admission
