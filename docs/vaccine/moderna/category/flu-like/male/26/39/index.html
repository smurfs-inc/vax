                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

                                                I woke up around 3 am because of body aches. The body aches worsened and i checked and had a fever of 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit. My head started to pound and my pulse was accelerated to probably 80 bpm (normally rest at 60 bpm). I felt a little lightheaded and  a bit nauseas. I took 2 200 mg tablets of EC ibuprofen and did not take Tylenol because i knew my immune response needed to take its course. it is about 3:33 in the afternoon and my body is still aching but my fever has dissipated and I still have a headache that throbs when I walk.

I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

It lasted the whole next day. But later in the evening of the next day I think to me the most concerning side effect was I started getting some chest pain as if I pulled a muscle around my chest or what not. And it has continued into the next day as well which is now 2 days after second dose of vaccine.

I had a light headache, which I&#39;d put at about a 3 on a 1-10 scale, but after being at work for a few hours it increased to about a 5. I left early, around 1pm, and slept again from about 3pm to 8pm. The headache eased up after this nap, but was still there in the background. The next morning (this morning, 1/29), the headache was nearly entirely gone.

                                                Received the first dose 12:30pm Thursday(2/11). Around 6pm that same night I notice the first symptom. I had a super strong headache that lasted the next 24 hours or so. Still lingering now but not as bad. Around 3am Friday (2/12) I woke up with chills and the inject spot was extremely tender. All day Friday I had signs of a fever. Chills and felt cold but body was hot to the touch. This lasted all day and it kept Me in bed the whole day.  Around 6pm Friday night, my injection spot was extremely sore , and there was a red circle, about the size of a gold ball around the spot. That?s also when I  noticed I had shortness of breath and was having a little difficulty breathing. Around 8pm I noticed I had really high anxiety that was abnormal. It went away in about 30 mins or so. I thought it was strange as I normally don?t have anxiety that bad. I went to sleep around 10pm and woke up at 5am itchy with a red rash/hives on the upper half of my body, mostly the neck and chest area. Also the red circle around the injection site grew to the size of a baseball. The headache is still there but not as bad . Maybe 2/10 Severeness. I feel better in terms of the fever and breathing today (2/13).  However the rash/hives has gotten worse and seems to be spreading slowly. I plan on taking Benadryl when I grab it from the store in 30 mins or so

                                                After receiving the Moderna vaccine on 2/10/2021, traditionally expected symptoms developed on 2/11/2021 and 2/12/2021 including fatigue, fever, headache, and general achiness. On 2/12/2021 and into the morning of 2/13/2021 I developed a persistent aching chest pain - Saturday morning (2/13/2021) I went to convenient urgent care in for a quick once-over including vitals and an EKG. The EKG showed ST elevations, and I was taken via ambulance to the hospital emergency room. With blood lab value analysis and an echocardiogram performed, the hospitalist and cardiologist determined the diagnosis to be peri myocarditis. I was admitted to the hospital for 24 hours of observation and was released on 2/14/2021.

We broke the fever down with ibuprofen, and I was still sore but relatively better feeling most of the day until around 6:45 pm when I came down with a really bad wave of chills and rising fever.

The patient&#39;s medical history included aphasia. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included diazepam, duwalpro and another, unspecified over-the-counter product.  On 15-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   That same day, according to report, the patient seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down were not working.  On 16-FEB-2021, the patient was unable to walk and could only crawl; he was just dragging his feet. He was also getting tired very quickly.     Treatment for the event included paracetamol and ibuprofen.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.    The outcome of the events, seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down, he could no longer walk and could only crawl,  just drags his feet and was also getting tired very quickly, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association, a causal association between the reported events and the administration of the mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                I woke up at 3 A.M. the following morning with a bad migraine and dry mouth. I was also very nauseous so I went to my kitchen to have a glass of water. On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

Overnight about 3 days after first injection and 4 days after second injection.  Initial injection: pt went to bed on the 3rd night after vaccine having taken no medications and noted mild eye irritation. He woke up a few hours later (~midnight) to severe eye watering and blurriness which required him to keep his eyes closed with mild sinus congestion. No difficulty breathing noted. Pt had trouble getting it to stop despite taking loratadine 10mg and rinsing eyes with water. Pt seriously considered going to ER due to risk of blindness. Pt eventually fell asleep a few hours later and woke up with very sensitive eyes (irritated, very red) that took about 36h to fully recover.   Second injection: pt was on scheduled loratadine 10mg daily. Noted a similar eye irritation (this time four days after injection not three) when going to bed and took 50mg diphenhydramine (about 14h after loratadine dose). Woke up a few hours later to more minor but still debilitating eye watering with proportionally more sinus involvement. No difficulty breathing noted. Pt took an extended release pseudoephedrine, rinsed eyes with water  and waited for it to resolve about an hour or two later. Pt awoke the next morning to much less sensitive eyes than first time.   Note: due to first experience. From time of administration of second dose, pt was on scheduled naproxen (440mg loading dose followed by 220mg q12h), loratadine 10mg q24h,  and pseudoephedrine (120mg ER q24h). Pt took these scheduled days 1-3 and at time of second eye episode was only on scheduled loratadine still. Pt also had 50mg diphenhydramine on hand in case of episode.

                                                Written by Doctor: April 7, 2021 2:09 p.m. DOB 2/07/1995, male, received his second dose of Moderna Vaccine (Lot 019B21A) at 1:13 p.m.  He stood up and walked to the usher?s table to have his vaccine card completed.  Approximately one minute after receiving his vaccine, he had a syncopal episode falling directly backwards striking his head on the floor.  I, MD did not directly witness the fall, but everyone who witnessed the fall said that he fell completely unimpeded to the floor.  I was notified and immediately assisted the patient who was with his girlfriend.  Patient initially appeared ?out?, but almost immediately opened his eyes and asked what happened.  His skin was cool and clammy.  A pulse oximeter was placed on his finger registering 98% o2 and a pulse of 53.  I kept him lying on the floor until he was completely awake and aware of his surroundings.  At the time he said his neck was not sore, but his head was sore.  Approximately 2-3 minutes later, we were able to assist him in standing to immediately sit down in a wheelchair.  He was taken to the cot in the hallway just outside the Medical Observation where I was able to help him to stand and then lie down.  An icepack was provided to put on the back of his head, he was provided water, Gatorade, and two cookies.  Patient said that he hadn?t eaten all day and had been feeling slightly hungry prior to his vaccination.  I had patient move all extremities and asked his questions to verify that he was full awake and oriented to person, place, and time.  Patient girlfriend  stayed with patient while he ate his cookies.  I addressed my concerns about patient striking his head on the floor and the possibility of a closed head injury.  Girlfriend felt that patient was now completely back to his normal state of mind.  I had patient remain lying down for 20 minutes.  When I returned to check on him, he was sitting up and wanted to leave.  I told him that he needed to be able to walk up and down the hallway before I would feel comfortable letting him leave.  He stood up and walked halfway down the hallway before saying he was lightheaded.  I immediately went to him to lead him back to the cot, but he insisted that he needed to use the bathroom to urinate.  Both girlfriend and I stood in the doorway to assist patient if he needed, but he was able to finish urinating, then returned and sat in the wheelchair.  I spoke to both Doctors via a phone call and had spoken to someone earlier.  After letting them know that patient did not want an ambulance called, but I was going to strongly recommend he go to the nearest ER before returning home, I returned to the patient.  Vital signs at 1:53 were Pulse Ox of 98%, pulse 78, and blood pressure sitting of 140/75.  Again, I strongly recommended that girlfriend drive him to an ED for an evaluation and possible cat scan.  Patient also now had some paracervical neck pain which I also said should be evaluated.  Patient and girlfriend both insisted they didn?t want an ambulance called and girlfriend felt comfortable taking patient out of the clinic.  Patient said he was hungry, and they were going to get food first.  Girlfriend gave me her phone number (xxx)xxx-xxxx and I gave her my phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx).  I told her I was going to call her every hour to check on patient and told her to call me at any time.  I recommended acetaminophen for the headache and other vaccine symptoms but no ibuprofen because of the possible head injury.  I recommended to immediately call an ambulance or go to an ED for nausea, worsening headache, confusion, or drowsiness.  Girlfriend is not to let patient sleep longer than 30 minutes at a time.  Patient was able to walk out of the clinic easily under his own power without any assistance.  He stated he was feeling much better.

                                                I received my first Moderna shot on March 24th. Just had a sore arm the next day.   April 2nd: Around 1pm at work I was starting to feel a headache coming on. By about 2-3pm it was worse and felt tired/drowsy. I ate supper then went to take a nap at 7:30pm. I woke up at about 10:30pm, checked the time and just felt out of it so I went right back to sleep.  April 3rd: I slept until my dog woke me at about 5:50am and felt pretty good, still minor headache and some chills. During the night I did feel some soreness in my arm that got the covid shot. After I showered I checked my arm and it was swelled up with a rash like redness maybe an inch in diameter. I was fine for most of the day enjoying the nice weather outside. Then about 6pm I started to feel the headache again and some chills. Went to bed at about 10:30pm, headache was bad, had the chills, started coughing some, and just didn?t feel normal, took some Tylenol to help through the night.  April 4th: Slept through the night fine, woke up with a mild headache and a sore throat. Had some dry coughs occasionally throughout the day, but was fine most of the day.  I did check my temperature throughout these past few days and all check were normal.  April 5th: Almost back to normal, still have a sore throat and cough. My arm rash near the shot area has gone away, just a little swollen.  April 6th: Back to normal health.

                                                Patient received dose 1 of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately 5-10 minutes after administration, the patient&#39;s mother alerted me that the patient was feeling faint and sweaty. I came to check on the patient. He appeared pale and diaphoretic. Patient said his vision was narrowing and he subsequently lost consciousness for approximately 10-20 seconds. I checked the patient&#39;s blood pressure and initial result was 88/64. Upon regaining consciousness, patient reported immediately feeling better. His blood pressure was still low at 94/70. He remained seated and drank some cold water and a cool compress was applied to his forehead. I questioned the patient to determine if he was experiencing any other symptoms that may indicate anaphylaxis (skin itchiness, tight throat, stomach upset) and he denied any other symptoms. I continued to monitor the patient for approximately 30 minutes. During monitoring, the patient told me he is nervous of needles, and has fainted trying to give blood in the past. After 30 minutes of monitoring, diaphoresis had resolved, color returned to patient&#39;s face, blood pressure recheck was 116/84, and patient self-reported feeling fine. He was escorted home by his mother.

Witnesses say patient fell out of the chair on his right hand side. I came out of the pharmacy to find him unconscious face down.  I could see he was breathing. I went to get the BP monitor and by the time I go back he was awake. I had him lay on his back with feet elevated. I took his blood pressure (144/78). I brought him a water. He had a red mark on his upper right temple from hitting the floor. He said he had a dull headache but was otherwise fine. I offered him tylenol and he refused.

                                                Starting the night after vaccination, had a rapid heartbeat, sweating, and anxiety that I have never experienced before. I did not sleep at all for about 7 days. After day 3 of no sleep, I sought treatment for the issue. I was prescribed Ambien to try to help me sleep. It did not help at all. Day 4 of no sleep I went to the ER where they ran blood tests and performed an EKG. All tests were normal. Day 7 of no sleep I was admitted to a behavioral health inpatient facility to help me sleep. I finally was able to sleep with the help of an antipsychotic drug. I was there for 4 days and then discharged. I left with a script for Remeron to help me sleep. Some days I have slept well and others not so much.

Also noticed a muscular pain as well in the same area, hurts to move down the middle of his chest. Also having pain on the right side. Symptoms are persistent, will wax and wane slightly but doesn&#39;t go away completely. Feels better when he is standing if feels better, has not noticed food triggers, no difficulty eating or swallowing. A few weeks ago also started a higher fat intake diet. No fevers or chills, no diarrhea, no rash, no sore throat, no runny nose. No known muscular injury that he can think of.&#34; May 20, 2021-- &#34;Today is feeling some decrease in symptoms, but still feels like he needs to take deep breaths. Feels like &#34;something is erratic&#34; once in a while. Not feeling increased improvement. Laying down does seem to make it worse. One time he was leaning forward and then sitting up made it worse.&#34; May 26, 2021 -- &#34;he reports that he is still feeling some chest pain, but overall is feeling better, symptoms are up and down. Feels like a &#34;tiredness&#34; in the chest wall area. The most pain is from twisting. Not worsening with acidic or greasy foods. Feels like pain is mostly in the muscle now. No SOB at all with increased exertion.&#34;

                                                Pt was given vaccine after all DURs were verified. After vaccine patient stood and walked to waiting area with out issue. After 5-7 minutes patient lifted his arm getting our attention. Came out to patient were he said his vision was getting very blurry. Said he could not read the sign 6 feet in front of him. I touched his shoulder as a precaution and asked if he could see me. He stated yes and proceeded to put his head back and take down his mask and close his eyes. I asked pharmacy staff to call a code. His forehead and back of his neck were visibly wet from sweating. He moved his head forward and hung it down for 3 seconds before lifting it saying his vision was back. I asked if he had any blurriness or faintness still and he verbally said no. I asked if I could get some water for him and he said yes. I also gave him a granola bar and he said that it helped a lot. We also brought paper towel for his forehead and neck. He then stated that he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. He felt embarrassed that we had to call a code and get more people involved. His color came back 3-5 minutes after he initially lifted his head and said his vision was back. Pharmacy made pt sit another 15 minutes after his color came back. Watched patient stand up after the 15 minutes and pt said he felt good. Told patient we would be sending reports about what happened and if it was okay with him to provide his information to be contacted if needed, he agreed.

                                                At 10 pm last night I blacked out while in the bathroom at my home. I had finished urinating, flushed my toilet and blacked out. The last thing I remember was the feeling of falling forward. I woke up sometime between 10 seconds to 2 minutes later feeling exceptionally dizzy and tired. I?ve never had any event happen like this before and was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Today I am still feeling slightly dizzy and not quite right.

This is not normal for me, and the sweating is so bad that I have had to physically wipe it off of my whole body with a towel. Taking ibuprofen before laying down has no affect on this.

Shortly after upon falling asleep, I started getting the chills and felt as though I had a fever. Waking up in the morning, I had a painful throbbing headache. My muscles ached and I felt very fatigued. I was unable to get out of bed due to said fatigue. I felt as though I had a temperature, but did not take it at that juncture. I had no appetite. When I did manage to stand, the headache would throb and I felt nauseated. Later that evening, I had a slight fever of 100.8 degrees fahrenheit. The following morning, I felt nearly recovered, but my head would still throb when changing positions, but not with the same severity as the previous day. Headache slightly persists to this day.

                                                Had no symptoms prior to injection. After injection, quickly developed moderate pain at injection site that eventually became severe. Over the rest of the day, developed a severe headache, severe muscle aches (not just at injection site), severe fatigue, fever of 100.6F, moderate joint aches (not just in arm, but all over body - neck is worst), and general weakness (I almost fell walking to the bathroom and I&#39;m in decently good shape). Toward the evening, I started struggling with thermal homeostasis - I was simultaneously sweating and shivering. The combination of these was severe enough that I had extreme difficulty sleeping last night and woke up at least once an hour, getting &lt;6 hours of sleep after lying in bed for almost 12 hours. Right now (23h post vaccination), the pain at the injection site has gotten significantly less bad, but I still have a splitting headache, fever of 100.3F,  moderate fatigue/weakness, and mild muscle/joint pains across my whole body. I&#39;m unsure how much the headache this morning is from sleep deprivation.   At no point did I lose sense of smell or taste, have a sore throat, cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, or shortness of breath.

                                                I had complete loss of smell and taste November 26th and tested positive for Covid-19 on the 28th. At the time, it started as my smell and taste fading out. Day one of noticeable symptoms also included a slight fever at approximately 99.7 degrees, full body aches as if I&#39;d been in a car accident, chills, a headache, shortness of breath and fatigue. The fever and chills and body aches had gone away after only two days but the shortness of breath and fatigue persisted at least 3 weeks or late December.  By January, I was slowly having my smell and taste back to normal. Early in February, around Feb. 4th, after my first vaccine and approximately 5 days before my second one, my smell and taste became horribly distorted. It started with mint and toothpaste. It started tasting/smelling like mold with pottery clay. After about 2 or three days, almost all foods began tasting and smelling like it was musty, moldy and rotten. Like dead fish or expired meat.  I first noticed with food but now it&#39;s other things as well. Cleaning agents like disinfectant wipes smell the exact same as a jar of peanut butter which is a strong, musty, moldy smell.  A pot roast bought the day of at Kroger was cooked by my fiance and it smelled so rancid to me I almost vomitted. Almost everything smells and tastes horrible and it&#39;s been about two weeks. The only things that seem normal are bubblegum, fruity pebbles and most beverages although not all. Coffee has the same pungent smell.  I have has to switch my diet almost completely to yogurt, fruity pebbles and meal replacement shakes. Along with a multivitamin so I don&#39;t miss anything.

After approximately 10 minutes, while the patient was sitting in the post vaccination area, he appeared to be pale looking to the imx RPh.  The pharmacist asked him how he was doing, he replied &#34;I am doing so-so&#34;.  The RPh got up to check on him further when the patient fell to the floor.  The RPh rolled him on his back, got him in a comfortable position,  and elevated his legs.  RPh applied gauze to a cut in his lip, and with the immediate assistance of the health screener, applied cold compress to his neck and forehead.  Patient experienced faintness and sweaty skin only.  Patient did not show any other symptoms.  After about15 minutes, patient said he felt like himself again, and wanted to sit up in a chair.  The RPh assisted him into a chair, where he sat for 5 minutes.  At the request of the patient, he wanted to go home.  RPh escorted patient to his car and watched him get inside safely.  1 hour later, RPh followed up with a phone call to the patient and he was on his way to an urgent care clinic to get a possible stitch for his lip.

The condition has not improved, and it is now 39 hours after injection. Regular, everyday tasks are very difficult. Pain is about a 7.5/10.  Also, 24 hrs after injection I experienced a fever. The fever lasted for 12 hours without coming below 103 degrees, and went up to 105.2 degrees at its highest. This was accompanied by extreme chills. I have also have body aches, which are likely a result of the fever, and the fact that I haven&#39;t slept in 2 nights because of these side effects.

Once the Benadryl runs out then I start to feel an itch and the itch leaded to that whole area red and bumpy. The only thing I have gotten so far is a steroid and Benadryl. only thing that works is the Benadryl.   When I first went into the ER I went because I got hive and ive never had hives before in my life.   I went 3 days later because I had a migraine, felt sick and had trouble swallowing.

At approximately 2:30 AM on 4/11/2021 I awoke to extreme chills and uncontrollable tremors. The tremors were so bad that I had issues walking to the kitchen to take additional medication, and could not hold a glass in my right hand steady - as it slipped out of my hand while my hand was uncontrollably shaking. Additional Tylenol, Gabapentin, and Zanaflex calmed my nerves enough to where I was able to return to manageable chills for the next 12 hours.

                                                Patient had vaso-vagal reaction from the vaccine. Within 2 minutes of getting the vaccine the patient became flushed and very pale. He as sweating profusely and had vision loss. He was sitting while this all happened which I think prevented him from fainting. I got him water, an ice pack and called ems. By the time EMS arrived the patient was starting to feel better. EMS did their evaluation on site and the patient was able to go home 20 minutes later.

                                                During my first vaccine I experienced a bruise on my arm that lasted ~3 weeks. My arm swelled (including my fingers which looked like sausages) for a few hours that night.  I also felt like I experienced slight chest congestion for a week or two after. The second vaccine (lot number listed on this form) I have a bruise that in my opinion is worse than the one from the first shot.  The bruise is still present after 1 week. I also feel slight tenderness around the joint area. I have not heard of these symptoms being advertise Will this cause joint damage? Additionally form both vaccines I experienced fever, body aches and obviously a sore arm.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine  About 8 hours after receiving the second dose of Moderna, almost all of the side effects came in full force including headache, dizziness, fatigue, full body aches, injection site pain, chills, and elevated temperature. The peak severity lasted about 4-5 hours. It wasn&#39;t possible to sleep at all the night after the shot. After that 5 hour period, lingering side effects included headache, fatigue, and aches. About 22 hours after the shot, I decided to take some Tylenol to help get rid of the residual side effects. At 24 hours after the shot, it appears most effects have subsided but there is residual dizziness and some fatigue and weakness.

He was rolled from prone, assessed and had a pulse but initially was not breathing. 911 called Within 10 second, had spontaneous return of respirations, consciousness and was oriented to person, place, time. Sustained an abrasion to his head, complaints of mild HA, no neck pain or signs of cervical injury or other trauma. Vitals monitored. Given fluids, juice. Assessed by paramedics and refused transport to ED for further evaluation. Given ice and called a friend for a ride home. Observed for nearly 1 hour after LOC and had returned to baseline mentation. Advised to call 911 or go to ED if worsening of HA, vision changes, confusion, falls, nausea, vomiting due to concerns for head trauma. Assessment is that this was likely a vasovagal episode and patient reported similar experience with immunization in past, in retrospect. Discussed that this is not a contraindication for 2nd dose but that he should be sure he is well hydrated and advise healthcare providers of history of vasovagal with first dose. The county will work with him to schedule 2nd dose at a health clinic attended by EMS (on site).

                                                Patient has history of passing out when getting blood drawn. As patient was standing to get vaccination card filled out, he told associate to call RPH that he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ran out to give my attention and patient was sweating and looked dizzy. His eyes started to shut while he was standing and as I was holding his arm and back to support him he started to fall to the ground. Patient gently went to the ground, I pushed him over to one side and he was out for about 3 seconds and woke back up. Patient was very hot and sweaty. He wanted to move to a more private area so I made an area with a privacy panel available to him. Patient stated to me that he has no history of seizure, but suffers from mild anxiety. Myself or one of the associates was with him for approximately 45 minutes just to make sure he was ok. His blood pressure was taken (twice) and water was given. His BP readings were normal. Patient was on his way. Moderna series completed.

The first shot gave me a mild chills and pretty bad body pain, however, the second shot gave me a sore throat, nasal congestion, chest congestion,  wet cough, body pain, and shortness of breath. In order to tally out a second exposure to Coronavirus, I got tested twice and was negative. These adverse symptoms started 4 hours after the 2nd vaccine and are still the same intensity. I?m taking mucinex and anti histamines but nothing has been helping much. I?m on my 6th day now.

                                                Starting at about 5pm on the day of vaccination, I experienced intense but expected side effects including full body muscle ache, fever, drowsiness, cold sweats, joint pain. These symptoms lasted for about 24hrs before subsiding completely by that Tuesday evening. On Thursday, 5/13, I woke up with moderate tightness in my chest that progressed over the course of 45 minutes to be severe chest pain. At that point, my wife drove me to the ER in  where I was checked in at about 8:30am. By the time I was checked in the chest pain had subsided to be just a slight discomfort, overall the chest pain had lasted for approximately 2 hours. At the ER my bloodwork was done and the initial blood samples returned an elevated Troponin I level of 5.04 ng/ml. While at the ER at the  I experienced one more incident of chest pain which lasted roughly 30 minutes and was moderately low on the pain scale. I was given multiple EKGs, X-rays, and Echocardiograms, all of which showed no abnormalities. Repeated troponin tests however showed an increase in my levels over the course of the day from 5 up to 12.6 and 13. I was placed on a heparin drip in the afternoon. By doctor recommendation I was air-lifted to later that night at 10:30pm so that further scans and a possible cardiac catheterization and CT scans. The following day, Friday, at 1am at my bloodwork was taken and troponin levels had increased to 14. I was scheduled for a CT scan, cardiac MRI, and echocardiogram to confirm the diagnosis of Myocarditis. By Saturday afternoon I was taken off of the heparin drip and told that they would not be able to perform any of the scheduled tests until Monday at the earliest. My most recent troponin level came back as a 9. At this point I decided to check myself out of  against medical advice since they were not able to run the necessary scans and my wife and I do not live in . I returned home to and followed up on 5/19 with a doctor at the ER at  since I was unable to find any available appointments with any cardiologists in the area for the next few weeks. My troponin levels and EKG taken at came back as normal, so I continue to follow doctor advice of bedrest and no alcohol for the next 4-6 weeks. My pulse is still elevated (roughly 85 bpm resting when it used to be at &lt;65 bpm resting) and seems to easily increase with even moderate activity such as walking in the house up to over 100 bpm.

                                                The same day as the injection I experienced severe pain a few hours after in my bicep rather than my shoulder where I experienced pain during the 1st vaccine dose. I also experienced the common fatigue. However, at 12:13a.m on May 25th, I was woken from sleeping to what can only be described as either the most severe case of the shakes that have ever been experienced, or convulsions. I was unable to move, speak, and could hardly breathe. The effects of this lasted well over an hour and a half. It was only after what I was experiencing stopped, that I suddenly became burning hot, but did not have a fever. 98.7° was what was read at the time I started to feel hot. Since then I have experienced severe joint and knuckle pain on my left hand, still bicep soreness, pain in my left forearm, again joint and knuckle pain in my left hand, and headaches.

It felt like I could only breath in for about a second and a half without a lot of strain or coughing. It is now 10:41 AM and I still have a heavy chest and shortness of breath but it is much more manageable than before. I still can&#39;t take a full breath, but I can breath in for about 5 seconds before it feels like something is blocking me from going further. No current pain.

                                                Friday (Day of shot): Fairly typical symptoms (soreness in arm, cough and sore throat, headache, and fatigue) Saturday (24hrs): Same symptoms as above, but slightly worse than day before. In addition, both feet (on top) began itching later into day. Sunday (48 hrs):  Typical symptoms began disappearing, itch on feet became more intense, bottoms of feet and ankles started to itch as well. Monday (72 hours): Typical symptoms virtually disappeared. Itching became progressively worse throughout the day on feet/ankles, and various small areas of body (abdomin, back of knees, inside of elbows/forearms) became itchy. Hives and rashes noticed over entire body later in afternoon. Hives/rashes were either single (unraised) isolated red dots, clustered and raised red patches, or clusters of small &#34;braille-like&#34; bumps (clusters and bumps area-size ranged anywhere from quarter-sized to palm-sized). Most noticeable areas were upper left back/shoulder, both sides of abdomin, groin, front/inner thighs, behind both knees, inner forearms, and both ankles and feet (top and bottom). Sore throat also came back on Monday afternoon, and over ~2 hr became itchy, then constricted with trouble swallowing, then restricted/strained breathing. Went to ER after noticed trouble swallowing, given epinehrine shot in  left leg. Throat slowly went back to normal over the next 1-2 hours. From 05/18 through today (3 weeks, and still ongoing),  rashes and hives have been diminished in size and amount, but are present both in pre-existing and new areas of body. Rashes/hives may last 1-2 days after developing or be on-going (feet and ankles). No prior history of allergies. No change in diet, lifestyle, soaps/detergents, environment at time of reaction.

                                                Skin reaction developed approximately 12-24 hours following 2nd dose of Moderna COVID19 vaccination. Significant fatigue also occurred. No side effects were noted following 1st dose (one month prior to 2nd dose).  Severe skin reaction primarily concentrated at both palms (redness, irritation, minor painfulness) and both feet (irritation, visible rash). Skin reactions also occurred on upper chest and full back (redness, itchiness). Reactions are still present but have begun to subside about 120 hours after injection.

                                                11:05- lightheaded, nausea, chills. Laid on the ground for probably an hour recovering. Once home, I noticed my chest feel a deep sore, achey. I chalked it up to the side effects, until i went mountain biking and had to turn around after there was so much resistance and pressure in my chest. I&#39;m glad I turned around when I did. It continued to be a deep constant pressure for over a week after the shot. Eventually the pressure subsided but I also didn&#39;t do any physical activities after the mountain biking experience.  As i tld the Dr.s this same story they told me I should have gone to the emergency room... Of course I didn&#39;t know, so I went about my life just reducing physical activity. I went in for my second shot today and was informed of the new possible linkage between myocarditis and vaccines. What the Dr.&#39;s described (I had two in the room this time because of the way I reacted to the first shot) was exactly what I felt after the first shot. If I was having the same symptoms, as recently discovered, but only after the first one, I wasn&#39;t going to try and find out if I would die from this second one or how much worse the inflammation would be.  I will disclose, pertinent or not, that I am a small individual at 5&#39;7, 120.

                                                From May 14, 2021, I have started experience dizziness and weakness in my body. There has been slight fever during the initial days but the weakness and mild headache is still there till today i.e. June 9 2021. I do experience a little shortness of breath and chest pain (on both sides) sometimes but that is not continuous and remains normal most of the time. I have got stomach infection and constipation too during these times and I have taken a pill of Prilosec upon prescription of doctor. Stomach looks good and bowel movement is fine as of now. I have been monitoring my blood pressure and body temp during these days and they all were normal.    Apart from that I experience chills more than anyone around me and don&#39;t know if that is related to vaccine effect.  Currently, my main concerns are - mild headache, weakness in body and dizziness which is happening for almost a month now.

Loss of vision lasted for 1 minute.  Loss of vision occurred while standing.  Referral to primary care and ophthalmology specialist found normal eye exam and MRI of orbits but  presence of tachycardia especially while standing (fluctuations between 60 beats at rest/laying down to 130 beats per minute standing).   Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  is suspected.  Currently pursuing cardiac workup with cardiologist and Covid POTS specialist.  POTS specialist believes autoantibody development after vaccination could be suspected as recovering covid patients similarly present to clinic with POTS like symptoms.

Symptoms completely resolved on Thursday 1/7/21. I also experienced symptoms of vertigo (dizziness and nausea) beginning Friday 1/8/21 that lasted till 1/10/21 and am not sure if related or not. I do have a history of vertigo and am prescribed meclizine. Meclizine was taken with minor relief.

Treatment: Took the day after the shot off of work and slept a LOT (approx 18 hours on and off), stayed hydrated and fed. Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

I took medication for the pain but the symptoms were lessened not for much, I remained in bed until 2:30 PM on Sunday 7th. I am still weakened, fatigued and with a slight shortness of breath, I am assuming by tomorrow I will be feeling better. No regrets whatsoever.

                                                I received the 2nd vaccine at 1:30pm, by 8:30pm I was extremely fatigued and went to bed early. I woke up in the middle of the night (around 12:00AM) with terrible night sweats, chills, a fever of 101, a terrible headache (completely different from my migraines) and my arm was extremely sore and painful. I tried to avoid taking any medication as I heard that it could decrease the efficacy of the vaccine, but it became unbearable so I took ibuprofen around 3:00am. My symptoms lasted throughout the next day, the fever subsided after the first dose of ibuprofen however I still had chills and the headache. The chills finally subsided around 3:00pm and the headache did not subside until I woke up Friday (2/5/21) morning around 6:00am which was roughly 42 hours after my second dose was administered.

                                                One day after my first COVID19 vaccine, I experienced chills, headache, and myalgia when I woke up that day. I took two 500mg tablets of extra strength Acetaminophen to reduce the severity of my symptoms. And two more tablets six hours later to prevent further symptom severity. When I received my second dose one month later, began experiencing the same symptoms as before. But at 10:00pm of that day. And I experienced pain and discomfort at the injection sight. These symptoms were again reduced by appropriate doses and intervals of Acetaminophen. These general symptoms and injection site symptoms continued for one more day.

His pupils got large and he then passed out. Code white was called, 911 was called, we got an ice pack and placed on his chest and a cold rag on his head. After about 10 seconds, he regained alertness. EMT arrived and accessed the patient. His blood pressure was normal and pulse was normal. He was given a cold drink and sat in the chair until he felt better.

                                                The first night after the shot I was irritable and achy, woke up fatigued. By 5 pm the day after I had stomach/abdominal pain aches, nausea and fatigue. The fever started at 100. That night I woke up at least once an hour from the pain. I had to throw up. The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup. Then Tuesday woke up fatigued and mild to low abdominal and now muscle pain.

These began around 1AM approximately 9 hours after vaccination.  Side effects most strongly felt within 36 hours of receiving vaccination.  Continued fatigue, chills, night sweats and muscle pain for two additional days (Thursday 3/11, Friday 3/12) that gradually subsided over those days. Appeared to be a slight rash around the injection site for several days after. I previously had the COVID-19 virus in late March 2020.

Starting on March 19th, I experienced mild shortness of breath for 3 days.  I checked my O2 sat throughout those 3 days and never dropped below 98%.  My wife experienced the same shortness of breath for the same period of time with a low of 97% on her O2 sat.  She received a Covid test on the last day of her symptoms and received a negative result.  Now, on March 25th I have developed a red, circular rash at the injection site (upper portion of left arm).  It is itchy, warm, and has a firm feel, roughly 2.5 inches in diameter with a slight, inward, crescent-shaped curve of the red patch on one side.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

My girlfriend was treating me during the event helping me taking my shirt off because i got desperate from the heat and cold at the same time i drenched my side of the bed and speaking incoherently at times, i asked my girlfriend to bring me my phone in case &#34;i needed to call 911&#34; but in the process i fell asleep while my girlfriend was watching me until 6:00am i finally slept, since that day i have been feeling better but not 100% i still have some sort of muscle spasms in ramdom areas of my body but more on my left upper arm

                                                I received the first dose of the Moderna vaccine  at 2:55pm on 4/7.  An hour or two later, I started to get a sore throat.  The sore throat was very painful by the early morning of 4/8.  On 4/8 I went into a doctor to see if I had strep throat because of the level of pain and since I didn&#39;t think I could get a sore throat from the vaccine, but he said it was not strep and that it was likely just a side effect of the vaccine.  On 4/8 I also had a fever topping 101.4, fatigue (I slept a lot that day), mental fog, pain at injection site, and all-around body pain.  The sore throat lessened greatly by 4/9, so it clearly wasn&#39;t a strep infection and seems it was indeed a side effect of the vaccine.  From 4/9 through 4/11 I had general &#34;cold&#34; symptoms: runny nose, phlegmy, watery eyes, redness and pain at injection site, muscle aches, elevated temperature (not fever), and general fatigue. By 4/12, these symptoms are nearly completely gone.  Some of these symptoms seemed quite strange as side effects from the vaccine, but they started and perfectly paralleled the expected vaccine side-effects, which makes me think they were caused by the vaccine.  I have no reason to think I had another illness at the same time as when I was experiencing these side-effects.  I had had Covid-19 previously (in December 2020; I tested positive and had mild symptoms).  Perhaps having had Covid-19 already provoked these strange side-effects.

He did drink some water and felt better. He thought he may have been dehydrated , anxious about the shot, and concerned when reading the shot info.  He has had flu shots in the past but  has not been  to a doctor in recent memory. The paramedics checked him and offered him a ride to the hospital . His vitals were fine so they released him to his girlfriend who was able to drive.

Vomiting and diarrhea began at the onset of symptoms as well. Vomiting stopped after 24 hours. Diarrhea continues to be an issue. Nausea continues through the entire period; however, the current nausea could be contributed to the lack of food over the last 2 days as well as dehydration. Aching joints also continue to be a problem mostly in the lower back area.   Treatment was bed rest for 48 hours as well as 1000mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Gatorade/Powerade was drank as could be tolerated.

Patient&#39;s head went back as if he was falling asleep, but  he began making gurgling noises and his eyes rolled to the back of his head.  Helped him slide him down out of the chair, so he would not hit his head or fall.  Once on the floor the patient began seizing. After a sternum rub, the patient raised up and was helped back into the chair.  He was sweating  and flushed.  He was able to answer questions as we awaited the EMT to arrive.

According to wife he did shake for less than 15 seconds in his arm and a bit in his head.  They were in the car, so she tilted the seat back for him and came in to get us.  Within the 30 seconds that she was gone he was awake and sweating profusely.  We gave him an ice pack, 25mg of liquid benadryl, and kept him laying back in the seat.  At 5 and 15 minutes mark the patient was checked on and he was completely fine.  After 20 minutes the patient had stopped sweating and reported to be feeling 98% better.

                                                Patient got Moderna vaccine about 2:30 pm . He indicated he was nervous and asked to have his girlfriend hold his hand while he was vaccinated.  He then sat in the waiting area afterwards. Approximately 10 minutes later approached the counter and said he was not feeling well.  He started to wobble and our staff sat him in a chair nearby. He said maybe he &#34;blacked out&#34; for a moment. He indicated he had not had much to eat that day. We gave him a water and a cookie. Seemed to be okay, talking with staff,  but then started to shiver . EMTs  were called and he was checked by them . Heart rate just over 100 , O2 saturation at 99% , no hives per EMT .Possible vasovagal event per EMT  .  Patient declined to go to hospital and left shortly after with his girlfriend driving him home.

I called a pharmacy technician into the room with me, and got him a water. He slumped in the chair, fainted, as his head fell back  he made a groaning noise, eyes rolled. I went into get the radio to call code white and when I returned he had come to, and was asking to lay on the floor. He was sweating and clammy. The optical manager, helped me and pharmacy technician get him to the floor. He did not want an ambulance because he was starting to feel better. After 15 minutes of water and cold pack on his neck, he was recovered. He was talking and up walking. He left with his brother and brother&#39;s girlfriend.

Itching was low in intensity.  The injection site swelled noticeably.  I went to sleep but I woke around 4 AM with an intense headache, nausea, slightly blurred vision, and a fever. Throughout the remaining day my fever got up to 101F.  Other symptoms included muscle ache and fatigue.  The injection site began intermittently pulsating/twitching the evening of 5/20/21.  On Friday morning 5/21 the intermittent twitching spread to my left fingers.   The blurry vision, headache, and nausea gradually went away.  All symptoms were gone by morning of 5/22.  I did not take any medication throughout.

                                                The day after, I had the normal fever, flu-like symptoms, and my left ankle/right knee ached pretty badly. Starting Monday 05/17, my right knee was unbearably painful. If I moved it at all away from a ~30 degree angle, my entire leg lit up with the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt. Not as bad as if I put pressure on it though, that was even worse. I couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t drive, could barely get out of bed for days. I got through that with over the counter pain killers and Biofreezing the knee like crazy.  Starting Friday 05/21 I believe, my knee pain suddenly went away only to be replaced with pain in my left foot. It&#39;s not nearly as bad as the knee was, but the entire left side is in constant pain made worse with pressure. I can drive now that my right leg works fine, but still can&#39;t walk without some form of assistance. I was reporting all of this in the V-safe health checker, but it apparently doesn&#39;t care outside of 7 days. Tempted to put &#34;permanent damage&#34; for Item 21 as the result, but I&#39;m hoping this goes away soon.

By that evening, I felt the usual symptoms of fever, body ache and chills, which continued for the next 48 hours. By Sunday, 05/23, I was feeling back to normal and in good health. The next morning, Monday, 05/24, I woke up with chest pain, a crushing pain by my heart and I went to the ER. An EKG was taken, and the cardiologist mentioned that it was abnormal and that a catheter angiogram needed to be done to check the arteries. That was followed by and ECG and a MRI and a stay at the hospital overnight. Next morning, the cardiologist told me that I have myocarditis caused by the vaccine and the inflammation is at the tip of the heart. I am currently on medication over the course of the next month, till my follow up visit with the cardiologist.

We are on-site pharmacy located inside the Health Center. At the time, a nurse is monitoring patients at the observation area.

This reaction was due to I believe the fact I had positive antibodies from a positive infection 8 months prior.  I had laboratory evidence of a positive serum antibody titer following the infection.  Was this vaccine studied in regards to patients who received the vaccine? because I believe it needs further study before it is given to patients who have already developed immunity from acquiring the actual COVID disease.

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

I started Experiencing the listed side effects from the morning of January 8th, 2021 to the morning of January 9th, 2021. It started with light muscle and joint pain at 8am and progressed to sever muscle and joint pain, chills, nausea, fatigue, headaches and eventually a fever averaging at 100 degrees Fahrenheit by 1-2PM the same day. These side effects were enough to leave me bedridden for most of the 8th. most side effects were gone by the morning of the 9th, the fever eventually broke by 930Am on the 9th.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

I started having body chills. the next morning when I woke up, I still had body chills, the highest temp recorded was 101.4 using a non-contact thermometer pointing at the forehead. My right arm, where the shot was, was painful all day. I felt really weak all day. I pretty much slept all day and all night (2/4) on 2/5, I was feeling a lot better, no fever, but still felt weak. pretty much relaxed all day and slept. the next 2 days I just took it easy and relaxed. Didn&#39;t take any medications during this.

                                                On Tuesday February 2, 2021, my son slept at my house (not at his group home apartment) and complained of severe headache and neck pain. His whole body was in pain as well. His blood pressure was 150/90. On Wednesday, February 22 he slept at his group home apartment and complained on chills, body pain and headache. He cancelled that day his counseling session and work. He called me on Thursday still complaining of body aches and weakness. He stayed in bed till Friday February 5, 2021.  He has been taking pain killers all this time.

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

Patient was given a cold cloth around the back of his neck and his blood pressure was taken and it was 82/58.  Patients O2 sat was 98 and pulse was 78. Patient stated that he was allergic to nuts. We asked if he had eaten breakfast this morning and he stated that he had a bowl of cereal. I instructed for someone to have him sit on the ground and to get him some candy  and a sugary drink.  A package of skittles was presented along with a Mountain Dew.  After finishing both the candy and Mountain Dew  (aprox 4 mins) the patient started to get a little color back and he stated he was feeling much better.  A second set of vitals was then taken which were  BP: 106/78 the O2 sat 98 and Heart rate was again at 78.  We instructed the patient to please hang around for 30 more minutes and after that time left with the person he was with.

When I came to about 10 seconds later, there was a public health official there rubbing my chest asking me if I knew where I was.  It took me a second to fully come to my senses but then I realized where I was and what had happened.  I was very pale, felt chills, was sweating, and it took effort to open my hands.  The EMTs ran a bunch of tests, my Blood pressure was low (I think the number I remember was 104/33), but the rest of the measurements like blood sugar or the number of ekg like tests they did all came back normal.  The EMTs in the field said they think it was a response to the vaccine.  After about 20 minutes of the EMTs monitoring me, my numbers came back up and I was feeling relatively normal.  I waited another 30 minutes before leaving just to make sure.  It has been almost a week and I haven&#39;t felt any symptoms close to that since then.

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

                                                After getting the shot I experienced all the typical symptoms of a flu. Light headedness, soreness of my muscles, The shot location itself hurts very badly.  I do not believe it to be threatening to my long-term health in any manner but it does make me worry about taking the next dose that purportedly should be much worse.  I suffered chills the prior night and decided to file this report to help add to the information available.

                                                syncopal episode- 1:33 pm individual fell head-first off from chair in observation area and hit her head. I was called over by the observation person that someone needed attention right away. I ran over the individual was lying on the floor and her husband was sitting on a chair right next to her. He said she fainted and fell forward. The individual appeared to be unconscious when I arrived and was very diaphoretic. I loudly asked if she was okay and then tapped her chest. She looked up at me and said ?oh snap.? She was oriented to person and place and her pupils were equal, round, and reactive. She denied that she had any tingling in her arms or legs. She said she heard everyone talking to her, but thought she was dreaming. She said that she has a history of passing out with finger-pricks (she cannot donate blood anymore because of this), shots, and she passed out when she got a piercing in the past. She said she felt her HR slowly starting to climb, but she felt she would be okay. She said she then started feeling lightheaded and passed out. I took HR BP at  1:35 128/74, 62 and again 5 minutes later 128/80, 62. Individual was given an ice pack for her head. She had a bump on the upper right side of forehead. She said she had not eaten or drank much before her shot. She said her stomach was a little upset. She was given water and granola bars and sat up for a while before standing up. She asked if I thought she should get her head checked out. I said it is never a bad idea to get checked and since she did hit her head hard enough for a bump to happen right away. Individual was feeling better before she left, stating just her head hurt. We told her to ice and ibuprofen or Tylenol to treat discomfort.

                                                I had a fever of 102 degrees almost the entire day after receiving the second shot (the fever went away after a day) with a very painful headache that continued in a milder manner for a few days after the fever was gone. I was also dizzy when my fever was worst and had trouble Standing/walking straight.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient  is a 29 y.o.  with a history that includes # Asthma # Diabetes, recently diagnosed # Obstructive sleep apnea # Remote pulmonary embolism, no longer on anticoagulation who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of known COVID-19, since admitted to Hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -&gt; 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.

                                                Mild dry cough beginning Wednesday (about 24 hours after vaccination) and becoming a moderate cough on Thursday into Friday, calming back into a mild cough later on Friday and nearly gone as of now (Saturday afternoon). Throat felt dry during the same period, leading to unusually high water intake and frequent urination, and briefly some discomfort and slight pain around the front-right part of waist that I assume was due to too much water and urination. Also Thursday night, I had some potential chills ? but no fever when I checked Friday morning. Also during this three-day period I felt fatigue, and lay in bed most of the day Friday. Also during this three-day period  I was congested and had a runny nose, but I have had those for weeks presumably due to allergies  Today I feel mostly but not quite healthy.

                                                Noticed hives about an hour after getting the shot forming all around my body.  Thought it was normal as the covid rash.  Quickly started feeling ill. Had a small amount of trouble breathing and a fever with swelling  and the hives became larger as my skin was flushed. Googled it and it said that this was a normal reaction and common side effects.  So I did not do anything and fell asleep because I felt badly. The next day I woke up to see the bumps all over my body including my digits and pelvic region. Called and talked to my wife she told me to go to the hospital. I started feeling a bit better though and decided against it and took rest that day. The following day the rash had become raised and tender across my body.

I checked my heart rate with my pulse oximeter and it was at 130 as I laid down and it suddenly started beating faster and faster until my heart rate went as high as 200bpm. I immediately called 911 and they checked my vitals upon arrival. My heart rate was consistently at 150 during their arrival and blood pressure was at 180/*** (unsure of second #). I refused that they take me to ER, and got a ride to urgent care where they took X-rays of me and gave me IVs and Tylenol. X-rays were normal and their diagnosis was adverse effect to COVID19 vaccine. My heart rate started to normalize the day after I went to urgent care, but took me 3-4 days to feel back to normal.

Third day was completely fine (4/20), Morning of fourth day (4/21) wave of dizziness and fatigue began accompanied with feeling of pressure in ears with occasional ringing. Also headache at the back of the head and where the cervical spine meets the skull. Occasional congestion. Hard to concentrate and occasional lightheaded feeling. Going on one week since injection and 3rd day of dizzy spells. (4/24)  Treatment: Drinking mostly water. Diet consisting mostly of vegetables and grains (no changes have been made to my diet) Ibuprofen 200mg seems to alleviate earache which in turn relieves some dizziness but feeling of being off balance remains.  No previous history of any sort of vertigo or ear infections.

No treatment administered regularly, ibuprofen taken one time.  Headaches have been reported through last week and seem to have subsided as of a few days ago.  Onset of chronic tinnitus and individual &#34;tinnitus events&#34; roughly ~2 weeks after vaccination.    7 &#34;tinnitus events&#34; have been experienced where the patient reports rapid onset auditory muting in one or both ears with the onset of an audible frequency and will persist for roughly 5 seconds before quickly fading.  The frequency has been both low frequency as well has high frequency during different events, and this has happened in each ear individually as well as both ears, random between events.  The most recent tinnitus event happened yesterday, so the condition is ongoing.  Chronic tinnitus has been reported as well, with a mild case of constant high-pitched tinnitus (roughly 8khz tone) that has continued from 2 weeks post vaccination to today.

He was vaccinated with the Moderna COVID vaccine on May 5th which caused fevers and sore throat that resolved. His pleuritic left sided chest pain began 11 days from vaccination. Given the symptoms, the PCP ordered a CXR and d-dimer. Because of the elevated d-dimer and tachycardia while in the office, she ordered a CT chest for PE protocol. This showed bilateral pulmonary emboli so the patient was directed to the ER. He was admitted and started on anticoagulation therapy. Given the CT chest findings of adenopathy, Hemotalogy-Oncology service was consulted and ordered labs.

                                                The first day after I received the vaccine I experienced symptoms in guidance with all available resources. I was fatigued, my arm was sore at the sight of injection. I remember sleeping at least 12 hours.  A few days later I began to experience severe intermittent chest pain. The area under my arm was extremely tender, as were the area behind my left knee. The adverse event as stated in the report was a sudden jolt of searing pain on my left side. It lasted only a few moments and felt like it traveled from my left shoulder down to my left thigh and behind my knee. It nearly knocked me off my feet. I remained with a lingering pain in my leg and upper left back until today.  I reached out the pharmacist  who administered the vaccine about the side effects and she advised me to immediately contact my doctor&#39;s office. I visited my doctor&#39;s office yesterday (6/3/21) and he assured me I didn&#39;t have any blood clots. He advised me to use a heating pad for the pain in my leg. He also said that sometimes the lingering side effects from the vaccine may last weeks in rare cases. Those discomforts are finally starting to subside. I had no treatment outside of elevated levels of hydration, taking Tylenol and resting.

                                                Starting the day after the vaccine, 06/04/2021, I had severe body aches, severe headache, pain on my arm where the shot was given, and severely swollen eyes but no vision problems. The body aches, headache, and arm pain lasted until 06/06/2021. The swollen eyes are still swollen today, 06/10/21, 7 days after the vaccine. On 06/09/2021 my lymph nodes in my right arm pit and on my left pectoral muscle swelled up, became red, and had an aching pain without touch and a moderate pain when touched. As of today, 06/10/2021, my lymph nodes are still swollen but with very minor pain with touch.

He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

                                                Chills starting around 10:30 PM, joined shortly after by an increasingly painful headache. Alternating between chills and being overheated on and off all night, while headache became worse. Had to take ibuprofen at 7:30 AM after not being able to sleep, and was able to sleep. Woke up at 1 PM and had to take another ibuprofen for the headache. Chills were gone, but was overheated and sweating for an hour or two. Had to take another ibuprofen at night, but headache wasn&#39;t too much worse. Headaches were gone upon waking up at 9 AM on Sunday.  Experienced lymph node swelling in armpit of arm that got the vaccination. Tried to do pushups, but became too painful. I had also experienced the lymph node swelling after my first vaccination 28 days before my second one. About a week after, and they always felt minorly swollen up until the time of my second vaccination. I didn&#39;t know they were caused by the vaccine until after the second vaccination.  Currently 1:20 AM on Monday, and I have been experiencing redness and itching in a large patch around the vaccination site all day.

I woke up around 2:00 am and I had a high fever and I was having trouble breathing. My fingertips had turned blue. My oxygen level was about 92%. I took ibuprofen and that brought the fever back down. I had body aches the next day. My cough had gotten worse (that I had at time of vaccination).  I went to Urgent Care on January 6, 2021.  They did the COVID test that day. I had a sinus infection - antibiotics were prescribed.  It took about two weeks for symptoms to resolve.

Next day I was in bed all day the next day because of the severe body aches. Cough got worse for the next few days or so after that.  I had some shortness of breath because of the coughing. Migraines started - strong headaches. The first one was the morning after the vaccine. During the next day (third day after vaccine) I had another migraine.  Symptoms were acute for three days.

                                                30 yo man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED for chest pressure and SOB that started this morning when he woke up. It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

Felt body aches and slight chills (temperature always below 98.6 though).   Began 50mg oral prednisone on 3/6. On 3/7, rash worsened and an urgent care facility gave me a 10mg shot of dexamethesone which helped immediately.   Dermatologist recommended antihistamine course beginning 3/9.

                                                During the 15 minute observation period after injection, patient returned to the check-in desk complaining of dizziness. He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

                                                Immune reaction diary: Vaccinated at 2:58 PM, 3/19/21 Started feeling sleepy after I got home around 5 PM, T&#43;2 hours, as I expect with a flu shot. I took a melatonin to boost this effect, and was cozily asleep by 6 PM, T&#43;3. 5:00 AM, T&#43;14: woke up chilly and overall mildly sore. Normal temperature. Very mild headache behind the eyes. No Tylenol yet for anything. Chills compounded by the fact I was  wearing the same T-shirt from the day. I changed into a long-sleeve pajama turtleneck, pull-over sweater, and put on socks, and went back to sleep.  7 AM, T&#43;16: Soreness and chills fading. Arm still a bit sore but less than shot #1. 8 AM, T&#43;17: Headache and soreness comparable to a rough hangover. Moving slow today. No Tylenol needed yet. 11:30 AM: Mild fever of 100.7. Headache and soreness have remained mild. 2:30 PM (T&#43;23.5): Fever of 101.0 (peak) 6:30 PM (T&#43;27.5): Fever reduced to 99.5. 8:00 PM (T&#43;29): Finally took some Tylenol with dinner for bedtime. 8:30 PM: temperature back to my normal baseline. 11:00 PM (T&#43;32): Feeling back to normal, though worn out from the day.

                                                Because of my celiac condition, I avoid eating products with wheat and gluten in them. However, occasionally it is unavoidable, such as with traveling. Typical reactions include fatigue, headache, mild brain fog, irritability, and watery bowel movements for up to 3 days following ingestion. However, since receiving the Moderna vaccine I have encountered wheat products 3 times; in all three cases the reaction was much more severe and included whole-body ache for 5-7 days, insomnia for 2-3 days, dry heaving for 24 hours, extreme sensitivity to motion/motion sickness for up to 3 days, intense gastrointestinal discomfort for up to 7 days, constipation and diarrhea, severe congestion, shortness of breath, elevated heart rate, confusion or disorientation, and an overall elevated level of symptoms lasting from 4-7 days depending on the amount ingested.

Patient started to sweat (sweat was vissible on his forehead &amp; his shirt). I escorted patient to immunization booth and assited him to lie down on his back (supine) as recommended per immunization adverse event response protocol. I applied cold compresses to his forhead and arms, monitored his breathing, LOC and BP until emergency response team arrived. By the time emergency response arrived, the patient stated he felt better. He declined ambulance and decided to drive himself home. Both the emergency response team and the patient left the pharmacy.

                                                One week after vaccine, I became incredibly dehydrated, began vomitting and within 2hrs spiked a 104.4 degree F fever. I had uncontrollable shakes, chills &amp; hot flashes. Tylenol wouldn&#39;t reduce my fever. I was taken to the ER where I was given fluids, potassium and magnesium which eventually calmed my fever. My blood pressure was very low as well. I tested negative for COVID-19 and Mono. No clear indication of cause resulted from chest xray and CT scan. Later small nodules were detected in my lung. Doctor&#39;s referred this as a viral reaction but couldn&#39;t determine a cause. I was discharged from the hospital after being there about 6hrs. The next day I was lethargic but felt almost back to normal. Within 36 hours I felt 100% and like nothing ever happened.

He walked over to the blood pressure machine and took his blood pressure. He then said He was starting to feel funny. Pharmacist took his blood pressure. Initially it was156/94 pulse 114. She gave him a water. She checked on him again a few minutes later and it was 166/76 pulse 103. I check on him. He said he felt tingly and his throat was still scratchy. But he was not having any problem breathing. He said he thought he was having a panic attack. I recommended Benadryl. I gave him 50mg Benadryl orally at 10:15. He was still feeling funny after and we called a manager to get paramedics ( he wanted paramedics called). He was a little shaky and still felt bad. Paramedics arrived a little after 10:30. They ran some tests and also said they thought it was a panic attack. They did not administer any meds to him that I saw, but did take his BG, BP, and check his heart. They went ahead and wheeled him to the ER. Patient apologized, I think he felt embarrassed.

                                                Patient received his first Moderna COVID vaccine. While he was waiting the 15 minutes he started to feel pressure behind his eyes, started sweating profusely, felt dizzy, and nauseous.  I had the patient go into the IMZ room where I had him sit down.  I took his blood pressure. His heart rate was 55 bpm and his blood pressure was around 110/70.  He was not having any trouble breathing or had any signs of anaphylaxis (swelling of throat, tongue, lipps, etc). I had him remain seated and talked to him for 5 minutes. He felt like he was starting to come out of it and we took his blood pressure again.  His heart rate and gone back up to 65 and his blood pressure was around 135/75.  I had the patient remain seated for another 5-10 minutes.  Took his bp again and the numbers were similar to the second one that was previously mentioned.  He wanted to stand up and see how he was feeling.  He stood up right outside the pharmacy for another 15 minutes and said that he felt back to normal.  I explained that in the previous case where this happened to a woman they recommended she have someone drive her home and I recommended he do the same.  He seemed to think he was fine and I believe he was planning to drive himself home.

Weird vivid dreams (after trying to go back to sleep) along with shooting pain through my legs. When I got up at 8 am, I felt it was like a cold without any of the nasal issues. Symptoms persisted until I took ibuprofen at 10 am. The symptoms continued throughout the day but were faintly noticeable even up until I went to sleep. The second day I woke up at 10 am with symptoms of few leg cramps and a small headache. Not nearly as bad as the first day.

                                                I for my 2nd shot on may 5th 2021 at 5pm. By 1130pm I developed a headache and pushing on my left side neck on the back side (same side I got my shot also) by 1130pm. It turned into a migraine. I took Imitrex 100mg and fell asleep and it went away. At the exact same time last night on 5/6 around 110pm a headache started caused by the same muscle ache on my left back neck. I can push on one spot and the headache gets much worse. I took 50mg Imitrex an hour ago. It&#39;s bow 457am 5/7 and the headache went right away. I&#39;m now having hot flashes and had to take my shirt off. Not sure if it&#39;s the medication or both. This is unusual for me to feel hot when it&#39;s 58F outside and 71F inside. That means something unusual is giving me headache/migraine/muscle pain in neck/hot flashes. My Imitrex never causes hot flashes. Thank you. P. S the first shot had no reaction other then soar arm. Which I have now also.

Sunday morning (6:00 am) presented with chest pain for about ten minutes that subsided. Sunday night/ Monday morning at approximately midnight (12:00 am) presented again with chest pain that continued as we sought medical attention from local fire department, to which an ambulance was called, meds were given and diagnosis was heart attack from labs drawn at hospital. Took him back for a heart cath and there was no blockage. From everything I was told they couldn&#39;t figure out what caused the chest pain.  He spent 2 days in CCU. He discharged Wednesday the 12th of May. He is now on Plavix, Coreg, a low dose aspirin, and Atorvastatin.

                                                Patient with no past medical history, presented to the emergency department with complaints of acute onset left-sided chest pain while getting ready for work. Pain was described as burning sensation that is somewhat improved with leaning forward. Notably patient had received his second dose of the COVID 19 vaccine series (moderna) 3 days prior to presentation. He also noted generalized weakness with hot and cold chills after the vaccination that resolved within 24 hours. ECG in the emergency department with concerning for ST-segment elevations in anterolateral leads and cardiac enzymes were positive. Patient then underwent cardiac MRI which found evidence of perimyocarditis believed to be due to acute inflammatory response to second dose of COVID-19 vaccine series as all other tests were negative and patient had no previous viral illness prodrome. The patient was treated with colchicine and later discharged home after a 3 day hospitalization.

                                                Reporting primary symptoms: headache, fever, lightheadedness, elevated heart rate, arm soreness, muscle soreness, back pain, nausea, suppressed appetite, anxiety, and panic attacks. (see below for more information) Initially, felt faint and lightheaded. Stood up and the feeling worsened. Within five minutes, felt nauseated and clammy. Also, appeared pale in the face. Was given instructions to sit, close eyes, and take deep breaths. Applied a cool, wet rag to the face and neck as needed. Was anxious and may have had a panic attack triggered by the experience. Heart rate had elevated, but not to a concerning level. Within 30 minutes of initial vaccine administration, face was no longer pale and heart rate was lowering. Other symptoms mostly subsided within 90 minutes of the vaccine administration. The next morning (5/19/21), woke with a mild headache, low grade fever, some fatigue, slight nasal congestion, and very sore arm. Took Tylenol for fever and it was mostly gone by the next day (5/20/21). Felt well enough Saturday (5/22/21) morning for lots of physical activity (push-mowed lawn in humid conditions) and only had a mild headache and mild fatigue afterward. No notable symptoms on Sunday (5/23/21) morning, but had indigestion, gas pain, and some soreness (back muscle) late that night. Stayed up a little later than normal. Woke a few hours early (around 4:30 am) on Monday (5/24/21) with throbbing low-to-mid, left-side back pain and worsened indigestion and gas pain. Had anxiety that led to a panic attack. Did not feel well and tried stretching, taking Tums, deep breathing, used the bathroom, and walked around. This was helpful enough to return to sleep. Woke up again at 8:45 am and had a mild headache, some soreness in neck/shoulders, and anxiety about the situation. Took a shower, did some deep breathing, and tried to relax. Drank some caffeine at noon, but the headache was not relieved. Appetite was somewhat suppressed and was mildly lightheaded. Stomach became more unsettle by night. Stopped all caffeine intake and NSAID usage (and still no intake/usage at the time of this report). At night, anxiety over the situation worsened, so tried deep breathing, talking to others about the situation, and stretching. Panic attack occurred, but was able to manage with the aforementioned techniques. Woke the next day (5/25/21) with mild headache, muscle soreness in mid-to-upper back, shoulders, and neck, suppressed appetite, and anxiety. Was able to manage most symptoms with breathing, stretching, relaxing,  and talking through the situation. No panic attack on 5/25/21. Went to bed earlier than normal (around 9:30 pm) and woke on 5/26/21 around 9:30 am. Had similar symptoms, but appetite was more decreased and worsened anxiety. Decided to see doctor that afternoon (see item 19 for more information on testing from that visit) and was told to give more time to recover from vaccine side effects. Did not give doctor information about anxiety or panic attacks at that time.  Had a panic attack (less severe than previous) Wednesday night and managed with the aforementioned techniques. Thursday (5/27/21) morning woke with no headache and no fever, but still some soreness in neck/shoulder area, suppressed appetite, mild fatigue, and mild anxiety about the situation. No panic attack on 5/27/21. Friday (5/28/21) woke with similar symptoms and decided to visit doctor again about anxiety. Was prescribed Buspar and Zoloft. After taking Buspar (first time ever) at 2:30 pm, experienced an increased heart rate up to 160bpm and a low fever up to 100.2F. Experienced another panic attack during this time. Sought medical assistance from local ER around 3:30 pm. Was seen and monitored until discharge at about 11:45 pm. During stay, tests and levels were mostly normal except during a panic attack that was triggered after blood was drawn. Treated with Vistaril around 11:20 pm and monitored for about 20 minutes before being discharged. Anxiety was relieved after deep breathing and relaxing. Did not take Zoloft. Slept and woke on 5/29/21 with mild headache, unsettled stomach, and mild anxiety. Anxiety is more manageable so far and other symptoms were somewhat improved after eating breakfast. Currently, no plans to continue taking Buspar, but will consult doctor.

Patient was then helped getting back to his chair staying that he was feeling fine. I sat with patient for about 2 minutes and noticed that he was a little pale and sweating. I asked patient if he wanted to lie down and he refused. I told patient to remain still while I was getting help and called 911. I again fainted and I put patient down on the floor and monitored his breathing, heart rate. I gained consciousness back after 10 to 15 seconds. Store manager arrived. Patient drank some water. Patient seems to be aware of surroundings. EMTs arrived soon after. During the time that EMTs were monitoring patient. Patient fainted again and was taken to hospital.

Racing heart, felt like I was passing out, mental fogging, trouble swallowing lasted about 1.5 - 2 hours. After 2nd dose I had the normal side effects, headache, chills, body aches fatigue.. After about 2 days of common side effects I noticed I was having trouble swallowing and it felt like I was being choked pulse food regurgitation and diarrhea.  It kept getting worse and worse after a week or so of hell I get an emergency endoscopy showing I have  eosinophilic esophagitis.  I?ve been put on all sorts of meds that are supposed to be treating this but nothing is working.  It?s been near a month now and 2 weeks have been on a hard core elimination diet  symptoms are persistent and discomfort it spreading to what feels like intestines, kidneys and possibly other locations I now have to go in for a colonoscopy soon as the meds should be working and discomfort is spreading.  Loads of headaches can?t sleep with all the discomfort.  Never hungry.  Possible permanent esophagus damage maybe more everything is still being diagnosed and no one is really finding any answers why.  For the last 6 years I?ve been on a health kick working out almost daily and eating very healthy.  No symptoms no warning  signs these one or more diseases it has all just started out of the blue post vaccine nothing else in my life has changed.

                                                Chills; Fever; Loss of consciousness x 2; GI upset; Diarrhea; Difficulty sleeping; Pallor; Stomach flu; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning a 31-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

He notes he was not until approximately 1.75 hours after vaccination that he began to develop a runny nose and aching primarily in his arm.  He felt this might be normal but then soon after developed a hot itchy tight feeling in his throat with ongoing rhinorrhea, mild tightness in breathing and soreness in his left arm. He has had similar reactions with Remicade in the past and they became severe and that is why he is no longer using Remicade.

                                                Two days after receiving vaccine in left deltoid, my left ear became bright red and registered 100*F on multiple thermometers. The area around my ear remained 98.7*F. As it progressed I developed minor amounts of blotchy red areas along the hairline on the left side of my face only. Nothing occured on the right side of my body. Diarrhea developed with multiple episodes. All of this lasted approx. 3 hours before subsiding without treatment. I have had significant amount of vaccines and immunizations from the civilian and military sectors and never suffered this before.

I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

I have not had covid and have not been sick since pandemic started. The following morning I woke up with a fever of 101 and extreme arm pain. As the morning progressed, I continued to have increasing fever even after taking Tylenol 500mg every 4-6 hours. My fever peaked at 104.7 by 3pm on 1/20, then started to come down after taking 400mg of ibuprofen. By 9pm on 1/20, my fever started to spike again and then I took more inbuprofen. As of 1/21, I am still having symptoms of being unwell and nausea, as well as low grade fever of 101. I do not have any covid symptoms (no cough, no loss of taste).

Saturdays diarrhea slowed down - and I went to ER - muscles were pushing - I felt my electrolytes were out of whack. I02 degree fever so they gave me Tylenol. They gave me two bags of fluids. My heartrate was in mid 120s when I went in and after fluids it went down to the 70&#39;s. I was discharged after that. I was swabbed for COVID - negative. Sunday I was still lethargic and fatigue; diarrhea slowed down quite a bit and I was able to eat some food. Monday I came back to work - not 100% in health but felt better.

                                                I received it at 10am and around 2am that night I started to have a bad headache and body aches. I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

I started feeling Fever with Chills on 1/15/21 evening and then I had headache, and next day I lost smell and taste. I thought these are all COVID symptoms and went for lab testing for SARS RT PCR testing on 1/18/ 21. The result was Detected. I am now feeling well. I went for another testing again for the same test and waiting for the result. Now my question is I have second dose scheduled at 2/7/2021. What if my second lab result comes Negative and What if my second lab result comes Positive? I want to know if i need to take a shot or not? I was isolated in my room at home for all these days and still isolated until I get my result.

He reported sudden sense of nausea, tunnel vision, headache and light sensitivity. He returned to the clinic shortly after leaving due to his condition. We had him rest in one of the outpatient rooms while monitoring his vitals, was also given an instant ice pack for his head. The pt. was prescribed Banophen (anti-histamine), Ondansetron for nausea and Ibuprofen 800mg for pain relief. He was given 6 TAB of both the Ondansetron and Ibuprofen but took 1 tablet of each of the 3 medications after coming into the exam room. Our patient relaxed in the room and was closely monitored for 45mins.-1hr. following coming back. Pt. began feeling better about 30mins. into his stay where he waited another 20-30mins. to ensure symptoms resided and he felt better. He was free to leave once better. Instructions were to contact our clinic or return if the headache or nausea returned or if his symptoms worsened.

I woke up around the10 am  the 25th.the next day. I had a migraine that wouldn&#39;t go away. I was feeling nauseous and still had a light sensitive headache. I took Migraine medication, and eventually mid afternoon the symptoms went away. Less than 24 hours later I was back to normal. March 4th I was using Gold Bond Ultimate Mens lotion and had an adverse reaction. My hand swelled up, and got red.  I took Benadryl and it went away. March 5th I used Curel lotion and the same thing happened. Did not take Benadryl.

Then I had severe migraines and throwing up even though I?ve never had migraines before. This lasted about a week. Then I began to develop painful lymph nodes and got shingles, also something that has never happened before. Shingles healing right as I got second shot on March 5th and had same high fever sick reaction as first week of second shot but with diarrhea this time which I did not have the first time.

He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

A single small ulcerative lesion appeared in the upper soft palate of my mouth so I went to a walk in clinic and had a strep done which was negative. D/t the ulcers appearing in my mouth I had and HIV test done which also came back negative. I had a small low grade fever and muscle aches also associated but the lesion in my mouth is what caused the major concern which slowly resolved over the next few weeks.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

I pretty much had the same symptoms as the first dose: chills, body aches. headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue. It lasted for about 3-4 days. Now, I stared with bloody stools with my first dose and it never really resolved before I got the second dose. I noticed it increased the frequency, made it a little worse after the second dose. They were not so frequent anymore. I still have blood in my stool at least 2 times a week.

I also noticed the texture was a little harder and every time I went to the bathroom and had a bowel movement I had blood in my stool. I went to the walk in clinic and they did some blood work). I did not find any help and consulted with a GI doctor, (more than once) and I still to this date have blood in my stool (not as often as before but still happens).

He reported no swelling, so I gave him a 25mg of benadryl and took his BP, which was 142/92. He did not eat breakfast so I got him some crackers and water and watched him. I recommended he call his doctor, he did and they told him to go to ER so I offered to call a squad and he declined. He did not want to go to ER, but wanted to get seen at urgent care. I walked him down to urgent care since the numbness had not improved. He came back to the pharmacy a few hours later and reported that when the benadryl kicked in the numbness subsided and he feels just fine now. He is going to follow up with his primary care doctor tomorrow.

                                                At approximately 9:00 PM (roughly 11.5 hours after vaccination)  I became extremely light headed with slurred speech. I experienced tunnel vision and dizziness. My face turned white, and my lips were a blue color. I sat down immediately, which improved my condition temporarily.   But, within 2 minutes I began experiencing tunnel vision and dizziness again while sitting upright. I laid down on my back and elevated my legs.  My vision returned and but I remained dizzy and pale. I experienced some numbness and tingling in my extremities.  My wife attached a fingertip pulse oximeter to my finger at this time (we did not have a tool to check blood pressure on hand). My blood %SpO2 read between  95 and 98% and pulse ranged from 95 to 101 bpm.  I did NOT experience: difficulty breathing, swelling of the airway, nor itching.   Since I was not having difficulty breathing, and my symptoms seemed to indicate low blood pressure or potentially low blood sugar I decided to wait it out and see if my symptoms worsened.    While laying on the floor, I consumed a glass of milk and a few oreo cookies, hoping to counter hypoglycemia (if that&#39;s what was going on).  After approximately 15 minutes my condition began to improve - I could sit up slightly with only mild dizziness and color began returning to my face. After approximately 30 minutes, I was able to stand and walk to my couch and lay down. After around an hour, I was feeling almost back to normal with only a slight dizziness and tiredness remaining.  12 hours after the adverse event (24 hours post vaccination) I feel okay, slightly lightheaded but generally fine. I intend to call a doctor and discuss if any further tests are necessary.

                                                &#34;Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine   About 45 minutes after my shot, my left arm started hurting, basically going down from the injection site to my elbow. AT 1:30 am - 4/9/2021 (14 hours after shot), I awoke out of my sleep and was freezing. I got up and layer up on clothing and drank some water. From 1:30 am - 5:45 am- 4/9/2021, I was wide awake, but tired , yawning, freezing, and had a temp of 99.9. My mouth got very dry and I was drink just a little water, but found myself having to run to the restroom once an hours. My temp slowly got down to 99.2 by 5:30am. During this time, I was also nauseous from shaking so much from being cold. I slept for another 15 minutes and then was wide awake from 6:10 am- 7:30  and then fell asleep till 9:30am. As of 12:00pm, - 4-9-2021 I have slept maybe 4 hrs, I have a headache, my arm is throbbing and I am tired. I also feel like I have a bunch of mucus in my throat (but that could be from allergies).

I took Tylenol 1g at noon but did not make difference. I took a 600 mg ibuprofen after going to an urgent care facility after the headache became intolerable. The ibuprofen led to the relief of the headache and fever.  Two days after the vaccine: Mild fatigue and headache.

                                                I had COVID in early December. During this time I lost my taste and smell and it came back two weeks later.   After receiving my first vaccine, I had the normal symptoms of someone receiving their second shot. I&#39;ve read this is common among younger people who have previously had COVID. I had two days of fever and chills, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m report this.  My taste and smell has been altered since the day after my vaccine. For weaker smells, I don&#39;t pick them up at all. Stronger smells either smell excessively sweet or burnt. I can pick up about 20% of the smell of something and the other 80% is this weird sweet or burnt flavor, but never both. Garbage, gasoline, hand sanitizer all have the same sweet smell. Most food smells burnt.  My taste is similar. Some food has a burnt flavor. Beef, previously a favorite food of mine, has a nauseating taste to it that prevents me from eating too much of it.   I have read that some people are experiencing post-COVID parosmia, but given that mine came on immediately after my vaccine I can&#39;t help but wonder if there is a correlation. It&#39;s been nearly a month without much improvement.

                                                Administered Moderna vaccination at 12:40 pm Sunday April  11,2021. Instructed patient to sit and wait in the vaccination waiting area for 15 minutes. Patient approached me  10 minutes into waiting time and told me he did not feel well. Patient was drenched in sweat. I instructed my tech to paged code white while I stayed with him. I advised him to remove his sweater and face mask. He said he had labored breathing and did not have much energy to talk. I provided him with ice pack, and had him sit down in the clinical service room. His sweat was dissipating. His finance stated he may need electrolytes and he gets anxious with needles. Front lead staff provided him with Gatorade, he took few sips.  He requested Emergency medical services to be called. He called his finance on the phone and informed her of his current condition. He stated he drove 1 hour and 45 minutes to get here and did not feel well enough to drive. EMS came on site and evaluated him. The patient requested to be taken to hospital, after further evaluation they transported him to the hospital. Patient was alert, but seemed slow to respond to questions. He kept stating he did not feel well. We advised him we call EMS and they are on the way.

No loss of consciousness, however, was unable to control body.  Was taken to ER and was stabilized. With some pain medications and an IV, I was released. Had fever for 24 hours, reaching 104 F. By the third day my fever broke, but energy levels have remained low since the episode occurred.

                                                So I got the vaccine on January 23rd and the Sunday following I started noticing I was getting very dizzy I went to the ear doctor they said it was not my inner ear so I went to a heart doctor and they did a tilt table test and the tilt table suggested orthostatic hypotension. The heart doctor did alot of heart tests and the heart is good. My vision was blurry with constant headaches went to an eye doctor and I have onset strabismus in my right eye and then I went to a neurologist because the tips of my toes were numb . The heart doctor has me on fludrocortisone and metropolol because my heart rate was very high all the time ever since the vaccine it was stuck at 130 to 150 beats per minute no matter if I was resting or sitting. My pupils oscillate and ever since the adverse reaction started I have had pupillary athetosis or hippus. Horrible brain fog can&#39;t think clearly or sleep well insomnia came with all of this as well. I go to the mayoclinic, because dysautonomia is expected.

                                                Today 4/15/21, patient was administered the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, his wife mentioned to us that he has a severe phobia of needles and has passed out previously to other shots. He had no other issues on his PQCF preventing him from receiving the vaccine.  The PQCF was reviewed with the patient by pharmacist. Tech administered the vaccine under supervision of both pharmacist and other technician due to his phobia. Patient received the vaccine with no issues except obvious nerves and a few minutes later while still in the booth, he reported not feeling well. We got him a bottle of water and he went to the post-vaccination waiting area with his wife. We were monitoring him closely and noted that his head was slumping into his wife&#39;s stomach when he was sitting down, and he appeared ill. Immediately, we got patient in supine position on the floor with his feet on a chair elevated. Cold ice packs were put on his head, beck, and wrists. Within 5-10 minutes, he was feeling much better. He sat back up in the chair, still with ice packs, and drank water.  Patient was asked to stay for 30 minutes so we could continue to monitor him. After 30 minutes, he left with no issues.

Had body aches the next day and felt light headed. Went bed that evening and slept a good 10 hours. So by Friday felt 90% still some stiffness, but felt good to go. Later in the afternoon and early evening I noticed a rash from the face down to the pelvic emerge. It is gone in the morning.  Hearing from a relative that got the Johnson and Johnson they also got the rash, but no other side effect.

THen I was fine. A day before I hit my 2-week mark, I got really dizzy and started experiencing some mild confusion/forgetfulness, and had an inability to focus on anything.  It was so bad that I went to the doctor and he couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.  Then I found a forum online of people complaining about dizziness 2 weeks after their moderna shot and thought it best that I report it.

By 7 PM, chills were extreme (shivering in bed under blankets sweating), several dry heaves thinking I might puke, but nothing in my stomach.  Went to sleep by 8 pm.  Woke up several times over the next few hours with chills and feeling queasy.  Finally down at midnight.  Felt mostly normal by Friday, with some slight stomach discomfort.  Went away by noon.

He said he was hearing me as if I was very far away.  I offered him the bottle of water and I asked him to take it and wait another 15 minutes. He stayed and 15 minute later he was feeling fine. He said his symptoms were gone by the time he decided to leave (35 minutes after the vaccine was administered).

Over the next 24-48 hours he began experiencing myalgias malaise and fatigue, he self treated with ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed.  He felt a little bit better on Sunday and went to assist in picking up a brush more.  During the process he became  short of breath as well as midsternal chest discomfort. He presented to the ED.    Evaluation found a CRP of 112, elevated troponins and a  leukocytosis of approximately 20,000 along with elevated neutrophils.  His influenza a and influenza B testing have been negative and his SARS COVID the PCR was negative.  Given his elevated troponins, he was started on IV heparin and admitted for further evaluation.   On admission to the floor, he was chest pain free. We were concerned for potential myo/pericarditis given his history and laboratory study findings. Cardiac MRI was performed which suggested active myocarditis with biventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF 34%, RVEF 37%). Given his new LV dysfunction he was started on low dose lisinopril and metoprolol succinate.  It is unclear whether this is atypical viral myocarditis or whether it potentially could be vaccine related, the MRI is consistent with that of myocarditis. We did not proceed with cardiac biopsy unless since there was no evidence for clinical decompensation, unstable heart rhythm or other worrisome features. He will plan to follow up with Dr. 1 week post hospitalization with repeat echocardiography and blood work.  If at that time there are any signs of instability we would proceed with more aggressive workup at that time.    Infectious disease was consulted who recommended infectious work up including serology testing for: parvovirus IgG and IgM was positive, Herpes Virus type 6, EBV, CMV (undetected) adenovirus, enterovirus (negative) and HIV (negative) .    He does not have any family history of cardiomyopathy.  There is no family history of sudden cardiac death, he states that his family has been quite healthy from a cardiac standpoint he was previously healthy before this episode.

I woke up on 05/26/21 at approximately 0120h feeling the need to urinate and was very sweaty, hot and thirsty. I sat down to urinate, and I felt dizzy standing back up. I was feeling very thirsty so proceeded to walk to get some water. I fainted after walking about 10 feet. I regained consciousness, and I drank water and ingested an Advil with the help of my wife. I felt a lot better after drinking the water, but still had a mild throbbing headache. I went back to sleep, and the fever symptoms came and went which affected my sleep quality. I drank more water any time I woke up. I took 2 more Advil as well at one time waking up. I woke up around 1300h on 05/26/21 feeling a lot better and a little more well rested. My fever symptoms are gone, but I am still a little sensitive to cold and feeling a little weak.

I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna on January 19, 2021. 48 hours later upon waking from sleep patient had myalgias, arthralgia in all distributions, and  a frontal headache. Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

                                                Severe hives and swelling in face/lips appx 3.5 days after getting 1st dose of Covid-19 Moderna Vaccine. Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

                                                Received 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/20. Besides general left arm soreness for 2-3 days following vaccine, I had no other symptoms until Sunday January 3rd, at which time I began to notice increased fatigue, chills, and mild cough. Symptoms did not subside by Monday morning, January 4th, and I called in sick to work and requested that I receive a Covid 19 test from an urgent care. I tested positive for Covid 19 that day, and remained off work until 1/14/21. I experienced moderate chills, moderate increased skin sensitivity, and significant fatigue from 1/3/21 to 1/8/21, sleeping ~16-20 hours per day every day during that time. I began feeling better 1/9/21 and symptoms gradually improved until I was symptom-free on 1/12/21. I returned to work on 1/14/21, &gt;10 days following initial symptoms.

Towards the end of the day I felt tired, however not sure if that was from the vaccine or because I did not sleep well. Tylenol reduced symptoms and they did not greatly interfere with my day.  The following morning all side effects were gone and I was back to completely normal.

I proceeded to leave work, where my HR continued to remain elevated for the next ~30 hours. That night I vomited several times. Otherwise, only other noticeable s/s were or body soreness and a lingering headache.

I had a sharp and persistent headache that lasted most of the night. I felt a little pain in my chest, and even when I took deep breaths it never felt like I had enough air. I&#39;m wondering in the breathing difficulties might have been due to heartburn/indigestion. I had to stop taking my heartburn medicine because it&#39;s not good for my kidneys (I also have kidney disease). On rare occasions I have had symptoms from heartburn that feel almost like asthma. The fever-symptoms and chills subsided a few hours later after I took a Tylenol, but I continue to feel fatigued and I have a bad headache.

The next day I was about 25% worse. Overall, I felt badly for about 2 1/2 hours. After about a week I felt fine, but the symptoms came back. I was tested again for COVID and the flu. Both were negative and I was instructed to just rest for 10 days and work from home. Experienced the same with 2nd dose, but twice as bad. Did not see a doctor in person.

                                                My vision became burry and I was unable to see what I was looking directly at- similar to if I had been looking directly at a bright light source for several seconds- This lasted for approximately 5 minutes. After 5 minutes this went away, but my left-most vision (extreme left of my field of view) began getting blurry and having the kaleidoscope effect- This lasted for approximately 15 minutes, and then subsided. Since these two vision anomalies, I have intermittently had a dull ache in my right hemisphere of my head. This ache will just come in a flash for a second or two, and then won&#39;t happen again for hours.

                                                On 3/28, I began experience light-headedness, chills, aches, headache, brain fog, and fatigue.  The symptoms felt just like past instances of the flu I&#39;ve had.  Given this, I didn&#39;t go to work on 3/29, and instead went to get a covid test.  On 3/29, I also started to get consistent pain in emanating from the lymph node in my right arm, the same arm I received the vaccine in on 3/22.  The actual vaccine site no longer has any tenderness, and it was never painful after the shot.  I had no symptoms at all between 3/22 and 3/28.  The lymph node under my right arm is visibly swollen as well.  On 3/30, I was given the results of my covid test from 3/29, which was &#34;covid-19 not present.&#34;

Also lost my appetite and had a &#34;sour&#34; stomach. Not nauseus, but in the bathroom consistently throughout the day. These symptoms continued until 2 PM when the fever broke. Body aches lessened by 3 PM. Headache discomfort peaked around this time though. Worst headache I&#39;ve had in as long as I can remember. Sour stomach was resolved by 8 PM and I ate a small meal. By 1030 PM, the only symptoms I&#39;m dealing with now are a moderate headache and fatigue.

I used to be on 10mg of Ramipril years ago and moved to 5 due to light headedness when standing up. Yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly. Getting up too fast with heart pressure meds prescribed for albumin /T1D and not for heart pressure. The secondary use of Ramipril is normal for type 1 diabetes after 20&#43; years. So I went to 5mg and haven?t had that issue since. I should also mention that when this used to happen to me I would lay down and recover with no problem.  Back to the incident it felt exactly like that but on steroids. I was in the bathroom looking for Tylenol and I got light headed, yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly, ringing in the ears, dizzy, and confused. I remember thinking I should probably get down on the tile floor and lay down like I?m used to from the episodes years ago with 10mg Ramipril causing the same symptoms but never anything so extreme. Next thing I know I?m on the ground waking up where I fainted and hit my head pretty hard on the way down. I probably have a minor concussion. Iced my head in the back where I hit it last night and this morning. Surprisingly 0 bumps, etc other than a little bit sore.  Trying to remember going down is impossible. There is a strange, I guess it?s not strange as I fainted, but to me being 1 moment thinking what I should do then the next moment still thinking that same exact thing but coming to on the bathroom floor with parents yelling over top of me as I was at their house is strange. I recall what almost felt like a dream while I was out but I was wondering why everyone was asking if I was ok, of course I?m ok I thought. Then I realized what happened and crawled around on the floor the rest of the night if I needed anything and was checked every hour through the night which was horrible but necessary.  Also my blood glucose was a 220 at the time of the incident according to my CGM so it didn?t have to do with low blood sugar.  In any case I feel better today but in a fog with a slight headache.

                                                I was released from quarantine from my Covid-19 infection 5 days prior to getting the first Moderna vaccine in the morning. By the evening, I felt sicker than I ever have in my entire life. I was shaking uncontrollably, had a fever, extreme chills, and a pounding headache and muscle aches. I didn&#39;t sleep that night and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until noon the next day. I am still lethargic today and seemed to have lost my sense of smell.   My Covid-19 symptoms from the 2 weeks prior were extremely mild and the vaccine experience was 1,000x worse. Something isn&#39;t right and I am questioning whether I should get the second shot.

The diarrhea started the day of the fever and lasted part of the day after. Additionally headaches have been constant since the day of the vaccination. Additionally the first few days from receiving the vaccine were weakness and body ache that had gone away before the fever occurred.

I can typically wrap my hand around my feet easily (i.e., touch my toes).  However, I had leg tightness so strong I could barely make it to my shins.   I went to work. Had chills, malaise,  pain at the injection site, and continued intense leg pain until I took an acetaminophen (500mg) at 2:00 p.m. on April 9.   Hip and butt tightness continued for the rest of April 9 and through part of April 10.   Redness and pain at the injection site continued until April 12.

                                                Pt. was very sick the day after the shot, then Friday morning his heart was going into atrial fibrillation and jumping between 110 heart rate and 160&#43;. He was out golfing when he noticed this. He rested later that day but was extremely tired and felt sick. Saturday morning (2.5 days after vaccine) he needed to go to the emergency room because his heart rate was back over 160. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia and gave him a message for it but it made it worse and the rate was over 200. They had to stop and start his heart then put on beta blocker which brought it to 180, then another beta blocker brought to 150. Following EKGs showed atrial fibrillation, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and super ventricular tachycardia. Pt. had this about a year ago but was fine after a few days. This was the first time he was hospitalized for it and is now on daily medications. He fears the Moderna vaccine triggered it and is very worried about the second dose.

                                                Within a couple hours of the shot, I developed arm pain at the site of injection. Headache onset was around 7-9pm and initially mild. Pain grew through the night. Headache became a migraine sometime between 4-6am. By 10am the pain was among the worst I?ve felt. Developed low grade fever around this time (about 100.8 F). I took 2 regular strength OTC tablets of Tylenol sometime between 10am and 12pm.  The head pain only lessened a little in severity. Sometime around 3pm the migraine dissipated rapidly. For the following 24 hours, I had no pain but felt lethargic.

                                                We had a customer pass out after a shot and came too quickly.  He began to fall forward several minutes after the shot and another customer pointed out that he needed assistance.  As I hung up quickly and went to the patient he was coming to and recovered.  I wasn&#39;t sure if he bumped his head but did not see any lacerations or signs of obvious severe injury. Store manager was contacted to help assess reporting through Incident reporting process.  His BP was 118/82 after spending a few minutes with him and giving him water.  He had a sweaty forehead and sat with us for a bit. I did offer to call an ambulance and administer Benadryl.  Patient declined.  He mentioned fainting with blood donations in the past, never with vaccines.  We discussed for second shot we will stand nearby ready for fainting again, or receiving the shot at an MD office in prone (lying down) position.  There was no answer to a follow-up phone call the next morning.

Shaking was so severe that my wife woke up in bed (heavy sleeping) and was so concerned that she was going to call 911, instead she called ER first and they said they couldn&#39;t provide any advice. I said I felt cold, even though I had a fever that was extremely high (no thermometer to measure) my wife then put the 30lb weighted blanket on me and after about 15-minutes the shaking started to decrease before finally subsiding completely. I then had a drink of water at room temperature which lowered my internal core body temperature and slight shaking started again until I warmed back up and stopped. Our house was 73 degrees F which normally I would sleep in my underwear, instead I was fully dressed, under all our blankets plus the 30lb weighted blanket and I still felt cold.  That night I had sweated more than ever, my pillow was literally a swamp and stayed damp until the next night although pillow cases were removed. Half of the king size bed was soaking wet and yet I still felt cold.  I sweated through the sheets again for 2 more nights before my body finally started regulating its temperature again and have since been okay. Felt very lethargic for 5-days.

On April 17th, two days after the shot I discovered a large bump (around 4-6 mm) under my skin on my lower neck, on the left side, close to the shoulder. I called a doctor and was advised to observe the bump for a week and schedule an in-person appointment with my doctor if the bump doesn&#39;t go away. The doctor said that it&#39;s most likely a lymph node.

                                                I began to feel nauseous and lightheaded while brushing my teeth around 10:30 pm several hours after I received the first injection of the Moderna COVID vaccination. I sat down and started feeling very hot. I passed out a few moments later. I woke a few minutes or seconds after passing out and was evaluated by EMTs. They said my vitals looked good, but strongly recommended I go to the emergency room for further evaluation. The ER performed and EKG and bloodwork, both of which were normal. I was told this was most likely vasovagal syncope and sent home. I have had a previous history of fainting from injury or injections. This was different because the fainting has previously occurred minutes or seconds after the triggering event versus hours. Since that night, I&#39;ve  been tired and experienced occasional lightheadedness. I saw my primary care doctor today (4/21) and he advised me to fill out this report.

                                                Received my shot, talked with the nurse for about a minute or two afterwards in the back and she informed me that i needed to wait 10-15 minutes before i left. i go to the waiting room and set my alarm for 10 minutes. i texted my mother i was done and leaving  to go back home soon and that my second appt was on May 11. she texted back, i responded once again that i will call her when i get home in just over an hour.  Since i had no idea what to expect if something &#34;did go wrong&#34;, i picked up my packet of information i received prior to my shot and started browsing through. i saw the possible serious side effects column and started to go through the list. At the time, about 5-6 mins now afterwards of my shot, i had no difficulty breathing, i did have a little tingling in my tongue, i read &#34;a fast heartbeat&#34;, and put my hand on my chest and asked myself, IS MY HEART GOING FASTER? i looked at the paper again and put my hand back on my chest, and that was the last thing i remember until i was brought back to conscious by the nurses and doctors. i was told the guy in the waiting room ran after i passed out. when i came back to they walked me into the back, i was dizzy and profusively sweating and was drenched from head to toe , shirt and pants were SOAKED in sweat, they took my vitals for the next 40 minutes (3 or 4 times) i dont remember it too clearly until i started coming back to. Blood pressure was up and down and i was white as a ghost, they gave me fluids and i hung out until i felt superbly better about 40 minutes later. Then on my drive home, i had to pull over again, because i was getting light headed and felt like i was going to vomit. made it home, 90 minutes later, took a baby aspirin and slept the rest of the afternoon for about 5/6 hours before waking back up to eat some dinner.

Fatigue started within 1 hour of injection but was only on 03/27/2021 and did not return in subsequent days.  Pain/soreness at injection site started within 1 hour of injection but was steadily decreasing until gone on 03/30/2021.  Second shot (on 04/24/2021 at 12:00 PM) resulted in fatigue, pain/soreness at injection site, and moderate flu-like symptoms.  Fatigue started within 1 hour of injection and was gone by 5:00 PM 04/25/2021.  Pain/soreness at injection site started within 1 hour of injection and lasted until 04/28/2021 (steadily decreasing each day since injection).  Flu-like symptoms started in the evening of 04/24/2021 and peaked at 9 AM (wake-up time) on 04/25/2021 until 5 PM 04/25/2021.  Flu-like symptoms included muscle pain, chills, elevated temperature (did not break 100 degrees), headache, fatigue, and general malaise.  These symptoms peaked in intensity around 1PM on 04/25/2021.  1000mg Tylenol taken at 9PM and 3PM seemed to help with symptoms.  Fell asleep at 3:30 PM and woke at 5PM with virtually no feeling of symptoms (other than pain/soreness at injection site).

                                                I arrived at the ER complaining of tightness in the chest and nausea, having vomited an hour earlier. At triage, the EKG showed a weak heart rate. This was two and a half days after receiving the shot, and having had other symptoms including fever, chills, general soreness, all of which may have obscured an earlier onset of tightness in the chest. Eventually I was diagnosed with acute Pericarditis and prescribed Colchicine by mouth 2 times a day. I&#39;ll need to have follow-ups with a cardiologist, continue taking the Colchicine, and go easy on the heart for 6 weeks to 3 months. Long-term, it&#39;s expected I&#39;ll make a full recovery.

A nurse and a medical technician addressed his concerns and the patient was diaphoretic, lightheaded, pale, and vomiting. We immediately provided 1 adult dose of epinephrine, laid him down with his feet elevated, and contacted EMS. Once he was stable to walk we moved him into a private room to be further assessed by EMS. Vitals were taken every 5 mins until the patient was transported to a local hospital.

                                                Three days after receiving my second dose of Moderna vaccine, I had a possible HSV-2 outbreak. It is rare for me to have outbreaks.   During the first 24 hours of receiving the vaccine I felt fatigue, aches and sickness, but it went away after 24-28 hours. However on the third day, that is when I had a possible hsv outbreak.   I looked online to discover that other people have also had outbreaks within a week of getting the Moderna second dose vaccine.

                                                pupils underwent myosis for several hours after the injection before returning to normal dialation rates. (not sure if this was a side effect or just a shock response to foreign matterials entering the body)  localized soreness in arm for a few days. worse second day than first.  chemical taste in mouth resembling isopropyl alcohol for about an hour or so, starting about 30 minutes after recieving vaccine, i assume this was just some of the sterilizing agent entering the body and getting circulated.  mild head fog in the days following the shot, this seems to have mostly gone away and i cant say with certainty if it is a side effect or was caused by some other factor such as stress.  mood disturbance / depression starting the day of the shot, this one might be completely unrelated, I attended a funeral of a family friend on that day which seems a reasonably likely cause for such, im just listing it because I want to be concise with my reporting of what Ive been experiencing.  mild headache behind the temple on the right side of my head, and behind both eyes.  heightened reaction to concrete allergy, not sure what exactly in concrete/cement i am allegric too possible nickel or chromates as pomphlox seems to fit the description, this has been recurrent for years but after recieving the vaccine a ring of hives formed on my left hand and my feet were the most broken out theyve ever been, i worked with cement 1 day after recieving the shot.  a relatively consistent feeling of coldness, since getting the shot ive felt abnormally cold, sometimes feeling the need for wearing a coat in 80&#43; degree weather. this is completely abnormal, typically i could wear a tshirt in 50°F weather and a hooded sweatshirt would suffice down into the 20s.  persistent joint pain in almost every joint of my body and the surrounding muscles, feels like it may be in the cartilidge or connective tissue, occasional pains had been experienced before and considered a normal part of life, but this has been relatively constant like an inflammatory response.  sleep cycle disturbance, normally i had abnormal sleeping habbits where being awake for 24&#43; hours at a time wasnt particularly uncommon (oddly this one seemingly gets worse when i stop drinking caffinated drinks), and it was impossible for me to get to sleep prior to like 2-3 am most nights followed by  sleeping for around 4-10 hours a night on average. however since recieving the shot ive been sleeping a lot more than this and at strange times (for me) like the middle of the afternoon.  fever/constant headache on the side the injection was recieved on has set in after about 2weeks and has been terrible, ive had to take ibuprophen for two days just to function, mild visual hallucinations have also occured in the past couple days mostly spatial distortions where the depth perception isnt working properly, and framerate issues where objects in motion leave a trail momentarily.

I had dark spots in my vision and intense pressure in my head. As I had been told to expect random side effects I went home and went to sleep early. The next day I had a lack of motor function with continued intracranial pressure and confusion. I called my doctor and went to the Emergency Room where my Blood Pressure was recorded to be Hypertensive and then retaken. I was given a CT scan and sent home. I was unable to work  the rest of the week and was out of work after being sent home sick the following week. I continued to experience intense intracranial pressure and an inability to form short term memories for three weeks after vaccination. I still continue to experience intracranial pressure and episodes of hypertension but have more ease in forming short term memories. Intracranial pressure has nonetheless decreased significantly compared to the immediate onset following inoculation. My medical testing is ongoing.

On the second dose (on 4/28/21) I had that and shivering, sweating, fatigue, body aches that lasted about 1 day after they started and were gone by the third morning after getting the second shot.  Since the second vaccine and ongoing I have developed a heavy mucus buildup and need to clear my throat often, periodically (perhaps once a week for a couple hours) I cough up grey/green sputum. No other symptoms are present as far as I can tell and I am not running any fever. I have scheduled a virtual appointment with my primary care provider later today.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

                                                Arm super sore; that night I a was miserable - fever, chills - sweats back and forth; nausea; diarrhea; intense headache - felt like head was going to explode; a little vomiting; neck and joint pain. Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

The next morning, 1/31, I noticed the area around the injection site was red, warm to the touch, and hurt when pressure was applied. The next morning, 2/1, the size of the red area increased slightly and it was still warm and hurt when pressure was applied. This afternoon, 2/1, I&#39;m noticing feeling warmer and sweating more than usual. I&#39;m not sure if that is related but I don&#39;t have another explanation for it.

                                                Within twenty-four hours I had a 102.7 degree temperature which lasted a day then gradually went away, I took Tylenol for the fever. For then next couple days just felt rundown. Then three days post vaccine I began having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath. That night around one thirteen the morning I went to Emergency Department. they took a ECG and drew labs. the ECG showed normal rhythm just a little elevated and my Blood pressure was elevated. Upon the attending physician getting my lab work back i was admitted for my triponin levels being elevated. I was taken for chest X-rays and a Cat Scan per their pulmonary embolism protocols. Both of which showed nothing.  The next day i had a Echocardiogram, and Cardiac Catheterization, and a Cardiac MRI.

                                                On 2/6/2021, beginning at around 6 p.m., I started experiencing a very severe headache. The headache became progressively worse between 6 p.m. and around 2 a.m. that night. It was one of the worst headaches I have ever experienced. The headache felt like &#34;pressure&#34; around my head - it was not concentrated in a single spot. It seemed to be slightly worse when lying down. I was alarmed at the strength of the headache, and how long the headache lasted. I considered going to the hospital but decided not to. I took two Advil, which did not resolve the headache, but did make it slightly less terrible. I was able to get some sleep, and when I woke up the next morning, I still had a headache (albeit not quite as bad). As of today, 2/10/2021, I still have a slight headache--I have had a headache every single day since 2/6/2021. My current headache is not nearly as bad as the headache on 2/6/2021, but it&#39;s still a headache. I experienced the other vaccine symptoms that others have reported (fever, chills, sweating, significant pain at the injection site, etc.), but I was surprised to experience one of the worst and longest-lasting headaches of my life. I am concerned about taking the next dose in a few weeks.

After second shot, I developed the usual thing of arm soreness, fever, chills, joint pain and generalized body aches as well as GI symptoms. All symptoms went away in two days except that I have had persistent symptoms of cramping abdominal pain, on/off nausea, bloating. I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with a fever, took 400mg of ibuprofen to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I felt mostly normal, so I took my Bupropion dose (150mg) and drank a cup of coffee. I exercised and went to the gym. When I got back I noticed my heart rate while resting was 130. This persisted into the night. I felt tired, weak, unfocused, and cold at night again. It is possible I had a slight fever again. 48 hrs after my second vaccine, I still have a high resting heart rate (90) which goes up to 120 whenever I move. It is as though I am exercising. I feel like I could jump up and run at any moment. I do not feel fatigued today thankfully. The high heart rate with fatigue is what worried me most.

                                                Developed iritis form of uveitis shortly after getting vaccine. Felt feverish and very fatigued and sore the day after the vaccine (3/19/21), which was unexpected as I am generally healthy and do not recall having an adverse reaction to a vaccine before. Noticed prominent symptoms of iritis by around 2/22/21, but they may have been occurring earlier as I did not know what was happening to me. Symptoms started off as occasional aching of my right eye, but it eventually got inflamed and extra sensitive to light, and I experienced worse redness and aching/pain and photosensitivity by 2/26/21 when I scheduled an appointment with an optometrist. Pain/sensitivity was intermittent from 2/26/21 to  3/1/21, but redness remained. On 3/1/21, my optometrist tentatively diagnosed me with mild iritis and referred me to an opthalmologist. On 3/1/21, an opthalmologist diagnosed me with iritis/anterior uveitis, and I began a treatment of prednisolone acetate 1% drops. thought my development of iritis may have been related to me getting my first dose of the Covid-19 Moderna vaccine shortly before getting symptoms. Hoping to recover within  a few weeks. Have a follow-up appointment scheduled for 3/10/21.

These were not the typical &#34;shivering&#34; symptoms typically experienced by patients with high fever.  All other symptoms experienced following severe symptoms more closely resembling flu-like symptoms that are to be expected following second vaccine.

                                                I had a sore arm almost immediately following the shot that slowly got worse throughout the evening. In the morning my arm was very sore. I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

                                                Approximately two to three minutes after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, my face began feeling flush. I also felt a tingling sensation in my face and neck, and I began sweating profusely. I walked up to one of the rescue/paramedic staffers and told them that I had a &#34;flush&#34; feeling in my face. The paramedic asked me a few questions about how I was feeling, then a second paramedic brought a wheelchair. I sat in the wheelchair and was brought to a separate room. The second paramedic noted that I was covered in sweat. The second paramedic and I decided to remove the top layer of my clothing (a polo shirt) because it was drenched in sweat. After about 10 or 15 minutes of sitting in the wheelchair and focusing on my breathing, the tingling/sweating sensation subsided and I was able to walk back into the observation area. I felt a second &#34;wave&#34; of sweating/tingling come over me a few minutes later, but it was minor compared to the first &#34;wave,&#34; and did not require additional attention from the paramedics. I did not require any medication during this event.

                                                It started the following day around 12pm on Wednesday. I started to feel nauseous and unwell. I wasn?t able to eat much because the nausea was so bad. Around 9pm, I started to violently vomit as the nausea got worse . I continued to vomit and have several diarrhea through the night until about 5am.   I had a fever of 101 , body aches, chills, vomiting and diarrhea . I have been sick many times in my life, but nausea like this has never been so unbearable , along with the violent vomiting .   Thursday I was still not well, as my body was completely depleted of all fluids and I was severely dehydrated .

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

My first dose was injected on my left arm, and I experienced moderate to severe arm pain (it felt like I tore my shoulder). The  night after my second dose, I had cold/night sweats and completely drenched the bed. This occurred three nights in a row. The morning after the shot I also woke up with a 102.5 degree fever, but the fever went away shortly after I woke up. Additionally, I also experienced severe headaches and exhaustion for about two to three days after the injection. On the fourth day, all the adverse side effects dissipated and eventually went away completely.

The warmness lasted 2-3 minutes, and then he felt cool. The lightheadedness subsided about 10:15 AM. This is when his mother called me over and told me what was going on. His BP (using automatic cuff) was 110/58 with a pulse of 55. He denied any other sx, and said he ate Special K Protein and soy milk for breakfast. We gave him a bottle of water to sip, and he continued to sit with his head near his knees. At 10:30 AM, his BP was 101/56 with pulse of 51. He said the lightheadedness returned slightly, but the sweatiness subsided. By 10:43 AM, he said he felt all better. At 10:36 AM, he took his pulse manually, and it was 66. By 10:43 AM, he felt &#34;all better&#34; and his BP was 135/75 at 10:54 AM, with a pulse of 57 (per automatic cuff).

                                                I received the shot in my left arm. Two things happened upon injection (1) I immediately began to bleed from the injection site. I have been told the provider may have hit a capillary; it bled for about 45 seconds. (2) within 20 seconds of injection I felt faint and began to sweat; this was rather short and subsided within 2-3 minutes. I was concerned that because I began to bleed immediately after injection that the vaccine may have also been expelled, too. But given the following reaction just described and the soreness I continue to feel in my arm, I assume the vaccine was successfully injected. The shot provider was surprised at the bleeding, as was I, but unsure of the exact reasoning behind it.

I continued to speak to him and he was unable to hear initially.  He did cry out and gasp and tighten then started to have a few slow jerky movements bringing both arms and body up from the chair. It appeared as if he may vomit and I repositioned to ensure he would not slide off of the chair.  The movements lasted about a minute and then he started to come to.  He described feeling dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and sweaty.  During the event his pupils were non responsive. At 11:17 he went pale and started feeling as if he was spinning and experiencing tingling.  He was still reclined in the chair and sitting up aided with the tingling.  He was given a cold pack to help regulate and given ice water at 11:18.  He stated he had not eaten yet today as he usually doesn&#39;t eat until 11. His temperature had dropped to 96.1 vs 97.5 prior to the vaccination.  BP was checked at 11:25 and was 120/72 which is lower than usual for him and to be expected with the LOC.  After drinking his water, I had him attempt to stand while grasping the wall/table for 2 minutes to assess his steadiness, then standing unassisted for 2 minutes.  After he felt steady enough we had him walk 10-15 feet and stand for another 2 minutes.  Patient was feeling tired and instructed not to drive home.  The situation was conveyed to his wife and they were instructed to seek ER/Urgent care if any of his symptoms reappeared. They stayed in the area to eat lunch and I checked in again at 12:12pm with the patient and he is feeling better after eating but still tired.  I also recommended following up with his primary as I will be sending her a copy of this report.

                                                I had the vaccine that month 3 weeks earlier, and had a 24 hour fever and 48 hour cough. Heart palpitations followed after the vaccine.   The main issue of me reporting this is that I had leg pain when I had the 2nd vaccine shot including the above fever, cough, and heart palpitations. I didn&#39;t report this to a doctor because I took aspirin for a week and it went away. Plus i&#39;m a man so I am stubborn as hell. But seeing the need to report if symptoms arise from what I saw in a article, I thought I should do so.

                                                My husband got a headache and a rash on his temple, starting the Wednesday after his second shot. His headache and the rash got worse, along with swollen lymph nosed on his neck and head. He went to an urgent care clinic on Saturday, a week after his second Moderna shot, and was diagnosed with shingles. He was given gabapentin, a generic of Valtrex and prednisone.

                                                03/28: At 9 PM (9 hours after shot), I rapidly experienced fatigue, fever (101 degrees), chills, aches, and slight nausea. I took my vitals during this time: SPo2 of 98-99%, BP was 123/80, and heart rate was in the mid-to-high 80s. By midnight, I felt much better and assumed everything was over.   03/29: Woke up feeling fairly tired. As I was trying to do my normal morning routine of cleaning up, taking out trash, etc. I noticed a shortness of breath. No fever or other symptoms from the night before. I checked my SPo2 levels with 3 different oximeters, and all gave readings in the 93%-94% range. My heart rate, which is usually in the 80s and 90s when moving about, was in the low 70s, bottoming at 72. This was nerve racking. This along with intermittent dizziness persisted for 24 hours. I got COVID tested and it came back negative. Flu came back negative, too. A consult with a doctor inferred that &#34;everyone has different vaccine side effects.&#34; Not helpful.   This shortness of breath/fatigue/low blood oxygen saturation continued persistently for the next 48 hours. I was essentially advised to stay home and rest. I noticed some lymph node swelling, too.   By day 4, I was feeling much better. My heart rate had gone back up into the 80s, and my blood oxygen sat. had increased to 96-97%. I was still somewhat tired and got winded very, very easily.   It&#39;s been over two weeks since my second shot upon writing this. I didn&#39;t want to report, but I can&#39;t make heads or tails as to why this happened. The only change in my health was taking the vaccine. I don&#39;t have any blood clots, asthma, or underlying issues. However, these side effects, if they are as such, need to be discussed. I know others who got the Moderna vaccine with similar anecdotes. The difference is, living with a clinician, I monitor my vitals all the time and knew enough to take measurements.

                                                Within 5 minutes of getting the shot, I got really lightheaded, and was given a bottle of water and more time to be monitored beyond the standard 15 minutes. Approximately 4 hours later, I developed flu-like symptoms for 36 hours, including an excruciating headache. I want to Urgent Care on the 3rd day (April 3rd) due to my headache and run blood work. That same day, I noticed that I was easily getting lightheaded. Even today (April 23rd) I continue to have lightheadedness every day, with certain things triggering it (e.g., tie my shoes, holding breath during deep breathing exercises to alleviate chest pain, lifting weights). Anything that requires my head to be below my chest makes me lightheaded after 2 seconds. I thought I was going to have a stroke or brain aneurism on the night of Easter Sunday due to my headaches, so I stayed up all night thinking that I could stay alive.

                                                I woke up the morning after my second dose experiencing  the common symptoms related to the vaccine -- persistent headache, body ache, fever, cold shivers, and fatigue. These symptoms lasted for approximately 24 hours, and I continued to have a headache for a total of approximately 48 hours.   However, I then developed pain in my left calf approximately 10 days after the second dose and on three consecutive evenings at approximately 9pm I developed an all-body itchy rash (big red raised welts) that would disappear by the time I woke up the next morning. The rash only occurred on these three evenings, but the pain in my calf persisted. I went to see my primary care doctor the following Monday (05/17/21) who gave me a referral for an ultrasound to rule out a DVT, although he said that it was not urgent that I go as I didn&#39;t have the other regular symptoms of a DVT (swelling, redness, warm to the touch) and I was too young and healthy to be at risk for one. My doctor said that if the pain didn&#39;t subside by the end of the week I should go for the ultrasound. The pain got worse and so I went for an ultrasound on Saturday (05/22/2021). I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH A BLOOD CLOT (DVT), and sent to the emergency department.

Early in 2020, I was diagnosed with Covid-19 infection. The severity of the symptoms from the vaccine were just as intense as the infection; however, the duration was significantly shorter.

                                                After the individual received his vaccine he went to the medical monitoring area with two additional members of his party.  At approximately 1412 the individuals friends alerted me that he needs help. I walked approximately 40 feet to find a 33 year old male patient that was unconscious and seizing.  The seizure lasted about 20-30 seconds with the patient waking up confused. I instructed someone from my team to call 911 and request an  ambulance.  Another team member and myself assisted the patient to a wheelchair and moved him to our treatment area approximately 50 feet away.  The patient was somewhat confused, hot &amp; sweaty and fatigued.  I took a basic set of vital signs and got: BP 90/70 Pulse 56 Respirations 22 LOC x 4 No CBG  The ambulance arrived within 10 minuets and another round of vitals were taken.  The patients blood pressure and pulse were still low.  A CBG of 120 was achieved.  The patient was still hot / sweaty and fatigued.  The patient lied down on a cot and soon started feeling better.  He stopped sweating and his BP / Pulse started rising to within normal limits.  The two paramedics on site conducted a 12 lead ECG and didn&#39;t notice any amoralities.  Due to this incident being the first of its kind for the patient and without being a able to find a definitive known cause it was recommended that the patient be transported to the local hospital for further evaluation.  The patient declined and stated that he would have his friends take him if he starting feeling really bad.   It was strongly advised that he be transported via medics to the hospital but in the end the patient refused.

                                                On the day of vaccination my arm was sore but at night i had a fever, chills, muscle aches and headache associated with insomnia. Symptoms started to get worse the next day of vaccination as I was hardly moving my left arm and i had to get off work early because i couldn&#39;t stand on my feet for a long time. finally on the third day symptoms started to improve.

Concerned I should have taken longer time between having COVID and getting the vaccine. It was a approximately 3 days from time of being clear of isolation and any symptoms. There was no concern on the consent form of recently having COVID just a concern if you were presently positive.

Following his initial vaccination at approx. 530pm, the patient (EMT) walked back to the ambulance in which he was working and bypassed the observation area.  He reports approx. 20min later he began experiencing the sensation that his throat was swelling and immediately began dry heaving.  He returned inside and was tachycardic on monitoring and shivering.  The patient never lost his ability to breath during his time at the vaccination clinic but ultimately received a single dose of IM Epinephrine, Zytec 10mg, and Benadryl (unknown dose) and transported by ambulance to the local ER.  no rashes were observed at the time of intial onset through the time of transport (approx. 20min)

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

Standing for more than a couple of minutes caused lightheaded feeling.   A high fever started around 5 pm that night and lasted until midnight when it seemed to break while I was sleeping after taking Tylenol.  The next day mild headache remained but was much better overall other symptoms did not remain.

                                                I recieved my second covid 19 vaccine by moderna.  I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

                                                The day after my vaccination, on 2/4/21, I started having headache followed by fever and chills in the afternoon and throughout the night till the early morning on 2/5/21 when the fever, chills and the headache are all gone.  However, the site of the injection on my left arm has turned red. I would say it is a red circle with a radius of 1.5-inch around the injection location. It is painful when pressed on. Also my left armpit (lymph nod) is swollen and is painful. Hopefully I won&#39;t die :/

                                                Patient complained about feeling dizzy about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Before that time, he and I had been talking, and he said he had felt fine. He was put in a reclining chair and continued to feel dizzy, experienced a mild headache, slightly scratchy throat and skin and nausea. For a minute or so, he stopped answering my questions. At that point, I was becoming concerned this could be an allergic reaction, versus vasovagal episode. His vital signs were done, essentially normal with exception of elevated BP.  he was given diphenhydramine 50 mg IM and stated about 5 minutes after that, that his symptoms were slightly better. 911 was called when he seemed to be getting worse, not lucid. . EMTs assessment was same as mine, allergic reaction versus vasovagal.  His EKG NSR, vitals remained  the same. BP still high, not dropping. EMS staff suggested he go to ED, which patient declined. He was feeling better about 1 hour later.

Chills, dizziness, and body aches continued mildly through Sunday.   I also passed out/blacked out the night of getting the vaccine while using the bathroom. Unclear if this was simply due to standing too quickly while experiencing the above mentioned symptoms and blood rushing to my head or a true side effect of the vaccine.

The headache, muscle aches and extreme fatigue continued for 2 days after vaccine administration. The patient took tylenol and ibuprofen for his fever and headache symptoms. To date, he is still experiencing headaches. He will be visiting his PCP for his annual 2/26/21 and will bring up the reaction to him for further direction.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the shot I developed symptoms including, brain fog, chills, aches, and pain at the sight of the injection. Over the course of the night, I fell more ill and finally took my temperature in the morning around 7 AM and had a fever of around 100.4 F. I took Tylenol about every 6 hours for the next 24 hours with my temperature fluctuating between normal and 100.4 F. During this time, I was too ill to do anything more than sleep or lay in bed. The following day, my temperature broke, but I was still experiencing aches, chills, and brain fog, along with the pain at the injection site. After about 84 hours from the time of the vaccination, I felt normal enough to resume my daily activities.

Finished a conversation at left the facility after approximately 9:55am. While driving back to office (appx 5 minute drive total), experienced clammy skin, sweating at 3 minutes into drive.  I considered pulling over, though I knew I should be around people where I could be monitored, so continued on. Experienced elevated temperature, blurriness of vision and my vision began to turn bright and white.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I thought I may be passing out.  I got out of the vehicle, sat down on the nearest bench and asked two individuals who where outside to stay with me, and I explained my symptoms to them.  I remained seated for approximately 10 minutes, and when I felt the symptoms subside, went into my office and am now filing this report.

I asked my pharmacy staff to call 911 and attend the patient.  I was attending a patient who was feeling faint after her vaccination.  Staff was in contact with 911 and were attending patient.   His initial blood pressure reading was 138/92. He was sweating profusely.  He was no longer talking.  his next blood pressure reading was higher in the 160&#39;s according to our other pharmacist who was attending him.  The paramedics were here very quickly and took the patient to a local hospital.  I believe the attending pharmacist will also be reporting this.

                                                I am experiencing vertigo which I?ve never experienced prior to this shot.  It seems like others are experiencing the same issue around 8 days after the shot.   I?m not sure if these individuals have reported this but I have provided a forum where people are reporting this same issue.    The vertigo was so intense on Monday 3/8/2021 at around 4:30am that I ended up getting sick and throwing up.  Symptoms are still around today 3/10/2021 but not as severe.

Thursday I went to the ER and was diagnosed with pneumonia and given a gastro cocktail and recommended follow up with gastrointestinal physician. On Friday I felt worse and had a fever of 101 I took Tylenol and Motrin and continually felt worse. Went to ER with 103.4 fever and racing heart rate. BP was normal. Was discharged and told to continue medication. The next day (Saturday) I woke with a swollen penis and went back to the ER where I was given a steroid shot and told to ice and watch for any additional swelling. Fever has stayed down but have had aches and pains throughout the day

Pain radiating to testicles.  Entire body aching.  Couldn&#39;t find comfortable position to sit/stand/walk.   Worse than any illness I&#39;ve had, but without the brain fog Within next 48 hours: Armpit swollen on right arm (same as vaccine arm).  Pain in head persisting.  Pain behind ears.  Dizzy/lightheaded feeling. Third Day after vaccine: Armpit is still swollen.  Headache persists.  Ache in muscles and joints seem to be re-emerging.  But, overall, I&#39;m fine and can work today. Note: Pollen count high - and I typically do get headaches from pollen - so, headaches could be attributable to pollen, but timing is suspicious.

On 29-Mar-2021, the patient experienced PRESYNCOPE (felt like he was about to pass out) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy), PALPITATIONS (felt like his heart was racing), NASOPHARYNGITIS (felt like he had a cold), SOMNOLENCE (felt like he wanted to sleep) and NAUSEA (felt nauseous). On 29-Mar-2021, PRESYNCOPE (felt like he was about to pass out), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy), PALPITATIONS (felt like his heart was racing), NASOPHARYNGITIS (felt like he had a cold), SOMNOLENCE (felt like he wanted to sleep) and NAUSEA (felt nauseous) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant drugs were reported.  On 29 Mar 2021, the patient went to emergency room and was monitored for a couple hours, not medical treatment was provided for side effect relief.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 34-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of presyncope, palpitations, and nonserious unexpected dizziness, somnolence, palpitations, nasopharyngitis and expected nausea. Event onset Day1 after first dose. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                At around 3pm the day of receiving the 2nd dose, I started experiencing chills.  Within a couple more hours the chills subsided and replaced by elevated temperature by about 7pm (around 102 degrees).  Along with the elevated temperature my heart rate increased significantly to about 160 bpm.  With the current state of my hyperthyroidism I experience somewhere between 100-120 bpm normally.  At around 9pm my temperature reached 102.8 degrees, the heart rate was not decreasing, and a headache started coming in.  I took NyQuil to subside the pain and eventually was able to fall asleep despite the elevated heart rate. The following morning the temperature went down to 101 degrees; my whole body was experiencing soreness.  My heart rate decreased to around 140 bpm.  As the day went on the adverse effects starting wearing off; by the evening everything was back to normal levels.

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

                                                Patient was given a timer and asked to stay in the area.  He felt fine, so he walked to the bakery area and spoke with another pt, at the muffins display. He said his arm felt &#34;weird&#34; and said that happened to her, too.  He said he started feeling lightheaded and was leaning against the case.  He said, &#34; I blinked, fell to the ground and next he saw people standing around him.&#34;  He said, no nausea, just lightheaded and he hit the side of his head lightly. Staff helped him into a wheelchair and took him to the office.  I spoke with him in the office and asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital.  I received this information from the patient when I asked him if he could tell me what happened.  He was sweating and pale, but no nausea, no disturbance in his vision and his blood pressure wasn&#39;t elevated.   He told me again that he took no regular medication,  but a couple of years ago he had been dizzy after a tetanus shot.  I asked again if he had any discomfort or pain anywhere and he said only his arm felt sore near the shot.   I asked again if he felt like he would like to go to the hospital and he said no.  His family came and picked him up.

                                                I began to have a fever with chills and very severe body aches that lasted 3 days after the shot and developed the day after the shot was administered. In addition, I developed a rash on my arm and was bedridden. I took a small walk that day and proceeded to swell up on the left side of my body but it subsided within a few hours. The next day, I suffered a stroke due to blot clotting and the clot flowing to my brain. I had to go to the hospital and was there for a few days.

I woke up around 7:15 am and had a headache, was fatigued and a little nauseous. The symptoms continued throughout the day getting better as the day went on. By 8 pm my headache was mostly gone. Waking up the next day at 5:45 I still had a slight headache and was a little tired but mostly OK.

Most of these effects passed after about 30 hours. I woke up this morning with a headache and my left eye really hurts. I have a subconjunctival hemorrhage in my left eye that fills about 1/3rd of the eye white with blood..... Headache, stiff muscles and overall tiredness are the only other remaining side effects besides a blood-filled eyeball at this point.

                                                20mins after the shot. I rapidly developed a fever and had trouble seeing. Felt like fainting. Really nauseous stomach and diarrhea. Chills but with a high fever. Threw up 25mins after shot. Immediately after that felt really nauseous and couldn?t see straight. Vision was black and I was seeing stars. Felt like hallucinating really bad. Couldn?t focus my vision. Got home and showered with a really hot shower and immediately started feeling better. 45mins to 1 hour after shot started feeling way better! Just sluggish the rest of the night.  For some reason was fighting going to sleep and fell asleep sitting up. Next day much better!

Coughing also took place.  No rash was present and nothing present at the injection site.  Allergy symptoms subsided over the next few hours as a result of Zyrtec being taken. Swelling of eyes remained until the next day after the event.

                                                It was discovered after administration of the shot that several syringes had only 0.1ml instead of 0.5ml.  This left us uncertain what volume he had received.  We were able to bring the patient back in round 2 hours later and administered another 0.4ml in the other arm.  Over the next few days, he had routine post-shot side effects (sore arms x 2, fatigue) but was otherwise well.

                                                Pt was seen in the Covid vaccine clinic for his second dose of moderna vaccine. Pt stated to this nurse that he typically passes out after receiving a vaccine or blood draw. This RN advised pt to sit in the same chair for his 15 min observation period. At approximately 1642 Pt started slumping over in his chair and was unresponsive to voice. His eyes were open, his skin become very pale and was diaphoretic. This Rn along with several RNs that were near by came to his aid. VS were obtained. At 1644 pt lost consciousness for approximately 15 to 30 seconds, EMS was called at this time (1644). Right before pt woke up he had witnessed convulsions. Upon waking, pt was lip smacking, no emesis at this time. His eyes were open and he was supporting his own weight but was not responding to voice commands. At approximately 1646 pt was alert and responding appropriately, stated that he knew where he was now and he was no longer confused. Pt was given an apple juice which he was able to drink without complications. At 1708 pt was A&amp;O x4, had a steady gait, stated that he felt back to baseline and safe to drive home. Pt declined EMS evaluation and left the clinic.

                                                At approximately 3am (~13 hours post-injection) I experienced chills. I was asleep in bed and was awakened by my own shivering. My bedroom was its typical temperature, I had my usual bedding on the bed, and my wife (next to me) did not feel that the temperature was unusually low. I added additional blankets and suffered through these chills for approximately one hour until they passed.  At approximately 9am (~19 hours post-injection) I began to experience severe body aches and fatigue. I got up, had breakfast, and then slept approximately 3 more hours. I awoke for lunch, played with my children, and then fell asleep for approximately 2 more hours. Body aches continued through the day. Over-the-counter Tylenol was sufficient to ease the discomfort. I would describe the level of body ache as similar to having completed an extremely strenuous physical activity the previous day; the last time I can remember feeling this sore was following a multi-day 100-mile backpack trip at high elevation. At present (10pm, approximately 32 hours post-injection) the body aches are subsiding but still present. My fatigue is also subsiding.

I was told I was having a heart attack based off the high levels of an enzyme that&#39;s present when the heart is under stress. I was given a catheter through the artery in my wrist and my heart was clear. I was then diagnosed with Pericarditis. I am currently on medication and still having severe chest pains.

About a minute after administering the COVID-19 vaccine the patient reported feeling dizzy. He then passed out in the chair. We safely moved the patient to the floor. Then within approximately 15 seconds the patient sat up and then stood up on his own. We asked the patient to then be seated in the chair while he recovered. We called 911 as soon as he passed out. Patient was somewhat confused initially but quickly regained his bearings. He began sweating and said he was very hot. We checked his blood pressure and it was 100/80. Patient continued to recover and said he was feeling better. We had him wait until EMTs arrived. He told them he did not need any care. We took his blood pressure again and it was now 110/75. He said he felt well to go to the EMTs and pharmacist.

                                                SECOND DOSE. (First does was fine. Minor ache on injection site with none of the symptoms below) Rash at injection site: Significant slightly elevated  red rash on triceps and deltoid near injection site that lasted from onset at 2:30 ( 14 hours after injection)  until reporting time  4 day. Minor soreness. Condition improving. Fever/Chills/Loss of Appetite: At 2:30 am (14 hours after injection) heart rate went to above 100 BPM (sometime 110-130&#43;)and started to slowly improve to 80 BPM in the morning 8am -- measured using Amazon halo heart rate sensor. While I did not measure temp until 7PM Friday the next day (101.8) during the 1st night I felt very hot and had chills.  Estimate temperature was 103-104. Difficult to sleep (0-2 hours of sleep first night). At 2pm Friday I thought I had recovered but a few hours later I entered another more mild cycle (80-95 bpm). Was able to sleep. I drank two electrolyte (generic Pedialyte from pharmacy) one after injection and the second the next day and was hydrated the full day. I took 1 generic ibuprofen the night of first symptoms at 2:30 am and a second the following night at 11pm.  Aches: Aches were onset on Saturday morning (day 2) in the back neck muscles.

                                                I am a healthy individual with no pre-existing conditions. I had Covid-19 in August of 2020. I was in bed for 5 weeks with most of the symptoms and regularly had fever exceeding 104. When I was allowed to return to work, the Dr. gave me light duty orders to not exceed 5 hours worked per day for 2 months.  After receiving the first vaccination dose, my arm became incredibly sore. These symptoms lasted for almost 2 weeks.   The morning following vaccination, my body began to ache and hurt on touch to the point where the cover woke me up in pain. These symptoms lasted nearly three days during both day and night.   I became nauseous about 24 hours following the vaccination. These symptoms lasted almost 4, 24 hour days.   I became dizzy, periodically, about 24 hours after receiving the vaccination.  These symptoms lasted for almost 7 days.   I had low grade fever on three occasions that I knew about, I treated with Tylenol.  These symptoms lasted 3 days after vaccination.   I had a horrible headache (I never have had headaches before) I could not open my eyes or expose them to light. Most of the pain was concentrated on the left side of my head. These headaches started 3 days after receiving the vaccination and lasted 5 days later until day 8. I used Tylenol, which seemed to have little effect and slept all day.

He stated he does not have a fever but he has body aches and his eyes burn. The burning of the eyes doesn&#39;t last long but it happens a few times throughout the day. I suggested that when the time came to get his second dose that he should see how he is feeling and let us know to discuss it before administering and that if he doesn&#39;t feel better in a few days to make an appointment with his doctor.

By 130am 1/1/2021 I awoke from my sleep terribly dizzy, shaking violently and experiencing a fever of 101.3 F. I took advil and tylenol and fell asleep about an hour later. I woke up with similar symptoms at approximately 830am on 1/1/2021 took an additional dose of advil and tylenol and slept till 12p. I woke up with a bad headache and coughing fits similar to when I had covid back in March. I went to an urgent care who assessed me and ordered me to the ER. medical center administered IV fluids, an inhaler, steroids, epinephrine and benadryl and a few hours later my symptoms had subsided for the most part and a dose of IV antibiotics was administered. I am currently admitted for observation with likely discharge on 1/2/2021.

I ate some oatmeal for breakfast and took 1000mg of Acetaminophen and it has not helped. Its been almost 2 hours since I took the tylenol with no result.

                                                I felt nothing for the 15 minute waiting period after the shot.  About 35 minutes after the shot (while driving home) I noticed tingling on the tip of my tongue with mild lightheadedness, sweating, and shortness of breath.  I pulled over, drank some water, and all these symptoms went away in less than a minute.  I felt a little malaise on the drive home.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

My right side of my face around the cheek, eye, and ear area began to tingle and feel numb around 20 to 30 min. After the shot was administered. It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

                                                An employee received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on 01/28/2021. This store had entered and scanned the patient&#39;s VAR into the system. On 02/11/2021, the patient was called into our store location to receive his second dose, even though it was 14 days too early. The patient&#39;s VAR and vaccine was not immediately entered into the system, so the fact that the patient had received the first dose only 14 days ago was not immediately discovered. On 2-12-2021, our team was entering the patient&#39;s vaccine into the system and this was when the error was caught. Patient was contacted and instructed to call the nurse triage line. So far, the patient has only reported normal vaccine-related side effects such as sore arm, malaise, fatigue, and sweating.

My shirt was soaked through when i left the clinic. Felt fine and took some benadryl (to sleep) and (tylenol) to stop arm pain and then went to sleep. Woke up at 1am with chills, shaking, chattering teeth and body aches.  Took a hot shower and attempted to go back to sleep, but had intense body aches. Slept a few more hours. Woke up again feeling worse at 7am. fever of 101 degrees. Took more tylenol and more benadryl. Slept until 2pm. Woke up still had fever and body aches. By 530pm body aches stopped and fever went away. By 7pm i felt normal. Injection site soreness lasted for less time on 2nd shot than on first shot.

He received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine (lot number 003B21A, expiration date 9/9/2021) around noon at the vaccine facility.  About 2 1/2 hours later, the patient developed burning and itching of the eyes and rhinorrhea.  The patient&#39;s co-workers and a medic looked at him and said that his eyes were red and puffy, and told him that he should report to the ER.  He also experienced some throat itching, and said that his thinking was &#34;cloudy&#34;.  The patient said that he had eaten nothing in the previous several hours.  He had not taken any medications that day.  He is not aware of any known drug or food allergies, and he has not been sick in the past few weeks.  He denies having had any vaccinations in the previous 2 weeks.

                                                Saturday afternoon (2 days after dose) I broke out in extremely bad hives all over my back, face and head. I called ER to see what I should do because this has never happened before. I&#39;ve never had any allergic reaction to anything and I was concerned since I just received my 2nd dose. ER recommended I come in, since nothing in my normal life changed to cause this also because my lips were getting swollen and throat was scratchy. Once I was checked out in ER they gave me an IV with another antihistamine to get in my system faster. I was releases later that night with a script for prednisone (2 pills for 3 days). Everything was fine Sunday however, i woke up Monday with the rash and hives coming back. I then made another appointment with a Dr, who prescribed more prednisone. Hives have since been gone and not returned.

I also had a fever of 103.7. This lasted about 36 hours until I started feeling moderate again.   2. Secondly I wanted to mention that I have had a sore throat upon waking every morning since I have gotten the vaccine. Potentially this is not from the vaccine, I realize, but I wanted to address it.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after the injection, I awoke with a fever of 101, body aches, and severe headaches.  The symptoms progressed and my fever was over 102 most of the day and hit a max of 103.5 around 2:30pm.  Nausea started around 4pm, which I alleviated by taking Zofran.  I eventually went to bed and awoke on the second day around 4:30am with a fever at 101 still.  Then around 7:30am, the fever broke with the most intense full body sweats.    Later on that Friday, in the afternoon, I noticed a large red rash on my right arm at the injection side, it was slightly swollen and very hot.  It got bigger over the next 12 hours or so and by Sunday afternoon the swelling had subsided and now appears and feels like a sunburn where the redness turns white if you press with a finger and then returns to red and it also itches now.  I treated the itchiness with some hydrocoritizone cream.

Patient promptly regained consciousness and said that he does not remember falling out of chair and that he feels okay aside from some sweating, anxiety, and lightheadedness, which he attributed to being dehydrated. Patient was not given epinephrine because he promptly regained consciousness and was able to have a conversation with us. 991 was called and paramedics came.

                                                Upon waking up the morning after vaccination (about 15 hours after), I felt tired and the arm I recieved the injection in ached. The tired feeling and ache in my arm continued throughout the entire day. The following day (03/11/2021) I woke up (around 5:00am) with body aches and a headache that intensified until about 2:00pm, when body aches and headache subsided quickly. I felt tired the rest of the day.   03/12/2021 while not diagnosed by a doctor, I also recieved a penile yeast infection after having intercourse with my girlfriend. It cleared up within a week using a 2% miconazole nitrate cream. Not sure if this is related to the vaccine, but a similar thing happened after my second dose (will be reported in an additional report).

This occurred a few min after a warm shower and upon entering bed for sleep. Preceding episode my skin felt sensitive to the touch, to the point it was uncomfortable to use a wash poof during shower. The episode lasted at its highest intensity for 2-3 min, after peak it lasted for 20 min total. I was unable to get up during the peak to grab warm clothing or a blanket. I had no control over my body mobility.

                                                In the 3 weeks leading up to February 10th, I became progressively more bloated with fluid in my stomach area, with an increasing feeling of fullness.  By the 10th, I felt so full that I had only eaten one meal in two days.  I had also been sleeping upright for days to attempt to clear what I perceived to be a stomach blockage and therefore was quite tired.  I walked in to the ER and the x-ray revealed the blood clot in my portal vein.  The physician immediately had enoxaparin administered to me and I was admitted.  I received another enoxaparin dose the next morning.  I was discharged on Xarelto 15mg twice a day in the afternoon of Feb 11th.  I am continuing on Xarelto as my hematologist runs various tests and I have an EGD on 4/16 due to a possible stomach ulcer.  I was diagnosed with: Mesenteric venous thrombosis Elevated transaminase measurement Fatty liver

Shingles were accompanied by eye irritation, headaches (localized on left side), and light headness.  Treated with Prednisone and Valtrex.

He felt slightly better and upon arriving home the patient had troubles breathing and explained it as a panic attack without actually having any anxiety. The patient consulted with a physician at a local clinic and was instructed to go to the emergency room. I have not had contact with the patient since arriving at the emergency room.

                                                Horrible ear infection started a few days after receiving vaccination. I was lethargic 2 days after vaccination, then woke up with the worst ear pain I?ve ever had. I could not sleep and NyQuil would only help for 1 hour. I went to the Urgent Care at 8am and was diagnosed with a bad ear infection. I was prescribed Amoxicillin and was given a shot of Tramadol which quickly helped the pain. I haven?t had an ear infection in 20 years and it is uncommon for adults to get them. I thought it would be important for you to track whether this is happening to other people and if anything could be done to prevent it.

                                                I had received my first Moderna vaccination into my left arm on April 15, 2021.  On April 27, 2021, from 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm, I engaged in light athletic exercises at a local park. In the evening, at around 9:30 pm, I started experiencing symptoms that I thought were similar to allergies (some occasional sneezing), and also felt a tightness or heaviness in my chest. I did not have a fever, but was seating. My overall impression was sympathetic nervous system activation. I thought I could sleep it off, but woke up at 4:30 am with a racing heart and elevated heart pressure and heart rate so I went to a local emergency room. My heart pressure and heart rate went down within the hour, and a chest X-ray was negative (e.g., my heart was OK, my lungs were OK). Additionally, EKG signals at the time of my admission into the ER were also OK. Blood work conducted at the hospital was also okay, potassium levels were at 3.4, when the average should be around 3.5, so I received two potassium pills. Oxygen saturation levels were at 99%.  At the time that I am writing this report, 10:52 pm ET on April 28th, I do still feel a slight heaviness of chest and some minor nasal congestion but I am doing significantly matter.

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

I checked the patient&#39;s temperature and it was 98.7F. I asked the patient what his symptoms were. Patient reported mucus draining causing irritation to the back of his throat. I recommended OTC nasal spray for the post-nasal drip. I asked if patient had any history of allergic reaction to any vaccine, fainting, or history of seizures and patient denied. I stated patient was in the clear to take the shot if he was comfortable. Patient said okay. Pharmacist administered the shot and patient and his wife were seating in our waiting area to wait 20 min. After 10 min, patient&#39;s wife screams that her husband is not feeling well. Pharmacist rushes to the patient and sees his body shaking in the seat and asks a customer to lay him on the ground. Customer calls 911. Seizing lasted less than a minute. I approach the scene and immediately lay the patient to his side. Patient is conscious and breathing. Patient denied chest paint, headache, or tingling sensation in hands and feet. Patient vitals were checked. Paramedics arrive and did a full check up and everything was within normal limits. Patient openly reported he had not eaten all day and has history of fainting after shot due to anxiety of needles. Paramedics encouraged patient to seek medical attention, but patient denied. Patient was given water and a banana and went home.

Prior to vaccination I was having mild ringing in my right ear due to moderate hearing loss caused by ear drum perforation.  2 days after vaccination I started having tinnitus on left side of my brain on and off and now it&#39;s continuous , also ringing in my right ear has increased , it is causing to me to have sleepless nights and groggy days. It has not improved even after a month. It could be  a permanent damage but I am not sure.

                                                at around noon the day following my shot, I started feeling soreness all over my body. I took aleve. I felt some chills and a slight headache. These lasted until Sunday. Monday I started feeling very tired, very week, and still sore in my arms and a little in my legs. I took aleeve. Tuesday I still felt lingering soreness but no headache. I started feeling anxiety towards the end of my workday. At around 4pm I started to feel my legs quivering as if I had just run several miles and my muscles were week. This gave me anxiety as I was still working and assisting clients. at around 4:15 I started feeling like I was going to break out in hives around my neck area, which does sometimes happen to me. I got home and around 7pm I took a Zyrtec, but by that point hives started forming on my neck and head. I felt my lip start to swell. I woke up at about 3am on Wednesday to find both of my lips swollen and I took a Benadryl and went back to bed. I woke up at about 7am and my eyes were both swollen almost completely shut and my lips were swollen. I could feel itchiness from incoming hives around my neck and shoulders. I took two Benadryl and rested all day. The swelling mostly went down by the end of the day and I continued to nurse the Benadryl. I saw my doctor on the 15th. He advised how to proceed and prepare  with the second dose and referred me to an allergist.

Patient was then helped to the floor to lay down. We placed something under his head to make him more comfortable and then proceeded to elevate his feet. He remained laying down for about 5 minutes. Then the sweating stopped and he was no longer dizzy or pale.  We returned him to the sitting position for another 10 mins and then helped him test standing at which point he said he felt better and would like to go shopping. I walked around with him for about 5 minutes to make sure he continued to feel ok.

I took a 1000mg dose of acetaminophen and a 400mg dose of ibuprofen about an hour after I got up and rested for several hours.  The symptoms started to dissipate at around 1pm but the soreness slightly persisted throughout the day.  Symptoms were gone the next day.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bronchoscopy (left lung filled with blood). Concomitant products included COLECALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) for an unknown indication.   On 31-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 28-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 03-May-2021, the patient experienced HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). an unknown date, the patient experienced HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days). The patient was hospitalized on 03-May-2021 due to PULMONARY THROMBOSIS. The patient was treated with HEPARIN (intravenous) on 04-May-2021 for Clot blood, at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) and PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) had not resolved, CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats) outcome was unknown and HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days) had resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   They did some tests and found there was blood clot in his left lung and put him on blood thinner but he reported that the blood thinner made his bleeding more worse. The patient still in hospital and currently in ICU and the Doctors are unable to determine where the blood is coming from and unable to remove the clot. And he is still suffering with blood cough.

Patient went to ENT (Feb 25) who diagnosed Menier&#39;s disease and prescribed 5 day course of Prednisone and that afternoon experienced pronounced paresthesia (from the right lip to the temple). On 27 Feb 21, the patient experienced heart palpatations likely from prednisone and/or anxiety, went to ER had Chest X-ray, EKG, bloodwork and was discharged a few hours. Headaches and facial pressure came off while on prednisone.  March 2-3 come off prednisone, headaches and pressure return, along with paresthesia continuing and again went to ER. All labs, MRI and CT scan came back normal.  March 3 went to see neurologists and had blood work and MRI which was unremarkable.  March 5 MRI with and without contrast showed is a vein near auditory canal on left side, followed up EEG but unremarkable.

                                                Starting the day of the vaccine in the evening, I had fever, felt tired and chills. Temperature 101-102 . I  took ibuprofen and went to sleep. I had chills the whole night. I woke up the next day and had headache, dizzy, nauseated. I continued to take ibuprofen every 4 hours.  Mild fever during the day and no fever at night. Nausea was improving.  Headache was not improving. The following day, I felt a little better, a little nauseated, headache, dizziness and diarrhea and left work early to go home. Took Zofran for dizziness and it helped a little. I did a telehealth visit over the phone and I was sent to get Covid test (negative).  Symptoms did not improve so I went to ER the follow day.  I was sent home with a prescription for higher dose Zofran and was told to stop ibuprofen and start Tylenol.   I went home and tried to rest.  Symptoms are slowly improving.  I was unable to drive for a whole week.  I had these symptoms for about 7 days. Headache, diarrhea and nausea went away, but I still felt fatigued.   The fatigue lasted for about another week (total of 2 weeks).

                                                About 12 hours after the shot I began feeling ill with flu-like symptoms, which is what happened with the first Moderna shot a month earlier. A few hours later, my entire body was throbbing with pain, I was in a cold sweat, my head was aching(it felt like an intense withdrawal) and I was incredibly weak. I stayed totally bedridden for 20 hours, forcing myself to sip water whenever I could muster the strength to sit up. My entire body was red, as though I had a light sunburn. The pain in my body and head was so overwhelming for a short period I considered calling an ambulance, but ultimately rode it out. Most of the pain, redness, and weakness have subsided over a day later, and I am about ninety-five percent back to normal with a very mild head ache.

Body aches the entire next day in addition to being extra tired and constant diarrhea.  Had to stay home from work. I haven&#39;t felt 100% since, even though it has been over 2 weeks. After my wife got her second shot, our entire household got a suspicious flu like cold, then it happened again right after my second dose. That lasted almost a week each time and just seems unlikely to be a complete coincidence.

First noticed apart from expected muscle soreness when lifting a water bottle with opposite are that received shot was difficult and painful in the brachioradialis and surrounding area, top of forearms middle to near elbow. All other associated soreness after shot subsided within 24 to 30 hours. Muscle soreness in these muscle groups have persisted through today and continue to do so. Lifting or moving objects that use these muscles is difficult or painful, and causes fatigue rapidly. Soreness not present prior to second injection, and would have been noticeable.

Sought medical attention from my primary physician, then went to a dermatologist for a second opinion. They both agreed the rash was pityriasis rosea and couldn&#39;t confirm whether it was from the vaccine or just a coincidence.

                                                Around an hour or so after the shot, I had mild face numbness. I noticed this with the first dose as well, but in both cases, it went away. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the onset of a migraine as I get migraines from time to time and I did have headaches/migraines with both doses. Around 12 hours or so after getting the second shot, I had flu-like symptoms (headache, nausea, aches, mild fever). I couldn&#39;t focus and vomited water/stomach bile a couple of times. After around 12 hours of feeling flu-like, I started to feel better and could eat simple food again (Corn Chex, chicken broth). I also had soreness in the arm near the injection site. I can&#39;t remember if I had neck pain or not. After the 12 hours or so of the flu-like symptoms, I quickly recovered. I would have reported this via VAMS, but felt so bad during the first 24 hours after getting the second dose, that I was late to registering my second dose in the VAMS system and the system would not let me retroactively report my symptoms. This is why I am submitting this VAERS report in case that it is helpful.

Also had nausea (as well as had difficulty wanting to eat because I was nauseous), slight fever of 100, headache (no longer a migraine) and major body aches. Stayed home from work and relaxed on my couch (mostly). Today/currently, on 1/6 at 12:50pm, only symptoms I still have is soreness at injection site (not as sever-more of a discomfort) and slight body ache (not as sever). Last does of Tylenol was taken at 01:30am on 1/6.

                                                The evening of the vaccine it started with severe fatigue and a sore throat. The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

Followed by back and neck muscle spasms causing pain at any slight movement. Telemedicine visit to doctor suggested the sore throat was something viral (not Covid), and that it should go away. Two PCR tests were negative for Covid. Muscle pain has not been addressed yet, as I cannot make an appointment until I have been symptom-free for 72 hours.

                                                Just after getting the vaccine had a sore shoulder for 2 days, then after that nothing until 8 days after getting the vaccine.  On the 26th, started feeling slight soreness in joints in muscles kind of like they were locked up, didnt think much of it, thought it was maybe from overdoing a gym workout.  The next day on the 27th, woke up and was feeling chills, along with mostly full body soreness and feeling very lethargic.  I also had a baseball sized red area on the injection site on my shoulder, it was itchy, swollen and felt very firm to the touch especially compared to other shoulder.  I also had hive like red circular welts on my back, butt, and upper legs.  Two of my fingers had spots on them that felt like blisters.  Felt very sore and tired all day.  In the evening I took 50mg benadryl to try and combat the symptoms.  When I woke up the next morning (28th) still had all the same symptoms just felt slightly better overall.  Took 50mg more benadryl and felt pretty tired and lethargic throughout the day.  In the late afternoon I have started feeling more sore again, and have a slight headache.  The hives and red area on my shoulder are still present but not as red.  So far during this time I have not had any issues with my throat and breathing, but my sternum has been super sore, more sore than any other part of my body during this time.  If i take as much air in as I can, it feels sore and hurts as I get to the last 10% of my lung capacity inhaling.

                                                I woke up the day after I received the Moderna COVID vaccine feeling achy and tired, as expected.  I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen at 0730.  As the day progressed my symptoms became worse and I developed a fever and chills/shivers.  At 1600 I took 1000 MG of Tylenol.  By 1730 my fever had increased to 103.4 and my shivering was intense.  I took a cold shower and another 600 MG of Ibuprofen.  By 1845 my fever had increased to 104.7, so I proceeded to the Hospital.  Before triage I began to sweat. During triage my fever read 103.8 and my heartrate was 120. I was given 1,000 mL of fluids via an IV.  My fever continued to diminish as the IV was administered and was 100.8 at the time of discharge.

Patient was seated  approximately 6 feet in front of pharmacy counter and I went out to check on him.  Patient was sweating profusely and again complained of feeling disoriented.  I asked if he was feeling nauseous and he said no.  I placed a cold compress on the back of his neck and had him try to relax and breath evenly.   I then  got a ice pack for him and wrapped it in towels to protect the patient from the cold.  Offered patient some water which he denied.  Offered to call an ambulance and patient denied.  I took the patients blood pressure and it was 140/84. Patient states this is slightly higher than normal for him.  After 5 more minutes patient began to recover quickly.  Sweating stopped and his color returned to normal.  Patient stated he felt much better.  I took patients blood pressure again and it was 133/94.  Patient stayed under observation for another 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left the pharmacy.

                                                Chills/fever,  mild headache, fatigue. Vaccine was given on a Friday afternoon, symptoms presented around 2200-2300 that night and were at their peak all day Saturday. By Sunday all symptoms were still present but the fever had mostly resolved. Some fatigue persisted the rest of the week (Monday through Friday).   The following week after receiving the vaccine I experienced fever (up to 104F taken in clinic) fatigue, lack of appetite, abdominal discomfort. I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in the ER so the fever was attributed to that. Just wanted to note that I have had flare ups over the past few years but was never febrile. Also of note is that I had been taking INH and Rifampin which may have caused and/or contributed to some of the adverse effects.

                                                Felt fine until about nine hours after the shot. Had been sitting at computer for at least six hours straight (and probably smoking more pot than I should have), felt dizzy and short of breath, got up, ended up losing consciousness on the living room floor. Woke up a few minutes later and put myself to bed; felt fatigue, aches, chills, and like I might have been running a mild fever. Slept unusually well; woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine. Not particularly concerned but felt like I should report it.

                                                Sinus pressure started the same night as the vaccine. The symptoms gradually worsened throughout the night. He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

I came to check on him and gave him water and orange juice to drink.  I checked his blood pressure twice, approximately 2 minutes apart.  The first blood pressure reading was 73/46mmHg and a heart rate or 46bpm.  The second reading was 110/74mmHg and HR 66bpm.  After the second BP reading, patient stated that he was feeling better.  This was just likely vasovagal syncope.   Patient remained on the floor because it was a cooler location for approximately 15 minutes and was feeling better and went home with his father-in-law and mother-in-law.

Entire body was weak and fatigued.  48 hours everything seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.  Roughly 80 hours later from the vaccination, suddenly body cramped up and had trouble speaking and pronouncing words. Fell to the ground and had hand spasms similar to bells palsy or cerebral palsy. Could not speak fluently or get up on my own. After 45 minutes to 1 hour, when paramedics were called and came they sat me up. Within a few minutes, like a switch, I could speak normally again and could walk on my own. Walked out to the ambulance and waited for 15 minutes or so, and everything seemed fine and back to &#39;normal&#39;. Declined to go to hospital, and since that episode things are still &#39;normal&#39;.

                                                Muscle cramping below sternum into the back around 1:00 AM in 3/20/21. The pain made me restless and never stopped, like a permanent cramp. Attempting a foam roller to stretch my muscle and release some pin to no luck. I considered going to the ER because of the pain not subsiding.   Around 2:30 AM I started throwing up, which lasted off an on for about a hour.   I returned to bed around 3:30 AM with the muscle tightness still happening. Around 4:00 I began having chills and my muscle started to relax. By 5:00 AM I was sleeping. No ongoing effective expect fatigue, and my throat was sore from throwing up.

                                                Patient had flu-like symptoms while deployed at start of pandemic (approx. Jan/Feb 2020), but testing was unavailable. His symptoms (URI-like) completely resolved. He received Moderna dose 1 on 02 Feb 2021 without incident, and Moderna dose 2 on 02 Mar 2021. Approximately one week later, he developed mild, dull, diffuse chest pain and shortness of breath which has persisted since.   He was seen in clinic for chest pain and dyspnea on 15 Mar 2021. Patient noted his chest hurt ?all over? especially with deep or with normal inspiration. Reclining, laying down, and sleeping on his right side increased his pain (he did not trial sleeping on his left). Leaning forward decreased pain. He endorsed feeling short of breath, and stated he felt light headed twice while going up stairs, without passing out. He denied recent illnesses and other symptoms. He is a very physically fit Active Duty Marine, who has continued running despite his symptoms. During this encounter and later f/u encounter, he expressed he did not believe running made his symptoms significantly worse.  Vital signs were within normal range and he did not appear in distress. Cardiac and lung exam were normal, and no friction rub or murmur was appreciated. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with HR consistent with his known, athletic-type normal variant heart rate. No other abnormalities were detected. Due to limited ancillary services within clinic, he was sent to USNHO ED for evaluation. There, he had basic labs (including Trop I) drawn, which were normal. EKG and portable chest xray were also unremarkable, and he was discharged with Motrin 800mg PO TID.  He was seen in clinic again 29 Mar 2021 for continued, unchanged symptoms, and reported he had been taking his Motrin only in the mornings and afternoons. Vital signs were unchanged (normal limits). Exam, including heart and lung, were normal. EKG again demonstrated sinus bradycardia, consistent with his normal resting heart rate. He was started on empiric therapy for pericarditis. He was released from clinic and will follow up in several weeks.

Pain, Bloating, Feeling of extreme fullness, Nausea, constant gurgling of the stomach.  This lasted for approximately ~ 2 weeks.  These symptoms have not fully resolved but have improved 85-90%. Day 3-current: Twitching and muscle spasms began in the arm that I got the shot in.  Shoulder, bicep, and into the forearm were CONTINUOUSLY twitching all day long.  Sleep became difficult for a period of a few days due to this.   This muscle twitching then began to occur in all other parts of the body.  Eye lids, arms, legs, torso.  Everywhere.  The rate of the twitches at worst was approximately 30 twitches per minute bouncing around from one area of the body to another.  I am currently 3 weeks post vaccination and although I have seen significant improvement in the twitching, I am still currently experience this symptom.

Rash is noticeably warmer than surrounding skin.

Left Arm pain in the place of injection is normal.  Fatigue on the day of vaccination and 2 days after. It is getting better by time. I forced myself to do some light activity and walk around. I felt better.

My arm where the injection site was became incredibly sore to the point where I couldn?t sleep on it at all.  Otherwise I felt decent. I woke up the next day and my arm was about 50% as sore as it was at the peak. I had about 90% energy level so still very slight fatigue. Towards the end of the night the soreness in my arm dropped to about 20% of the peak.

                                                Patient sat in observation area after receiving vaccine for 15mins. After his time was up, he was asked if he was feeling okay, if so he may leave. He stood up and walked to pharmacy counter to inform pharmacy staff he was not feeling well, that he was having chills and felt dizzy. A pharmacist was called to check on the patient, as the pharmacist reached to patient to ask about his symptoms, the patient started to fall. The pharmacist caught the patient from behind and gently sat him down. A second pharmacist was called while another technician dialed EMS. EMS arrived to evaluate patient and determined he was dehydrated. They offered to take patient to ambulance to give him IV fluids, the patient declined. Stated he was fine, gave his statement and was able to walk out on his own power.

Certain things have a very distinct smell and matching taste. Most are liquids. For example Coke and Gatorade smell and taste exactly the same and it?s a terrible taste. Shampoo, tooth paste the same. Foods have recently started to taste the similar, there has been no improvement since it came on.

Nothing happened next day or after.   After my second shot on 4/11/21 by afternoon, felt nothing till night before going to bed. Next day waking up by 6:30 am for work, I felt waves of body pain almost head to toes. These were accompanied by chills, later I felt little feverish. I took two Ibuprofen pills twice throughout the day that might have made me feel better which is why I could work. Till I slept I was quite down. Today on 4/13/21 I feel much better. Still bit fatigued but none of the severe pains or chills I went through on 4/12/21. Hopefully I won?t have to go through them anytime anymore.

These symptoms continued until about 2:00pm 04/08/2021 when they rapidly subsided. I did occasionally take acetaminophen to help reduce the fever.   04/08/2021 not sure of this is related or coincidental, but I had irritation on the skin of my penis after having intercourse with my girlfriend. I did receive a yeast infection after my first dose, and I&#39;ve never had either of these issues before or since.

No topical cream or itch relief treatment is effective. Rashes continue to grow slowly in size but greater in number.

After 10 minutes, I went to check on him and he said the tingling sensation was gone, but not he was experiencing headache/head pressure  and warm sensation. I told him to continue to wait, which he did and after 20 minutes he said he was feeling  a little better and he was going to head home and rest. I counseled him to continue monitor the symptoms and if they progressed or worsen or if he experienced any new symptoms to seek medical care at emergency room or his primary care doctor depending upon the severity of the symptoms.

                                                Approximately 2 minutes after administration of the vaccine, patient stated he was feeling light-headed, tingling sensation in fingers and beginning to sweat. He was instructed to sit back down, stay for a total of 30 minutes and let the pharmacist know if his condition worsens (his mother was with him). I, asked a technician to provide him with a bottle of cold water. After 4 to 5 minutes, his mother notified me his condition had worsened and the patient looked pale and sweat was visible on his forehead. Another pharmacist stepped in to assist because I was with a different patient. This pharmacist, aligned 3 to 4 chairs so the patient could lie down. He stayed with him until he stated he felt better, which was approximately 5 minutes later. For the record, the patient did not mention a headache or symptoms of a migraine. Patient called pharmacy on 4/14/21 and stated he&#39;s been suffering from a headache/migraine since the day of administration. The pharmacist recommended to follow up with PCP.

                                                I believe I experienced multiple symptoms as a result of my vaccine. My experience matches exactly as described in the article.  ON 4/1/21 at approximately 4pm I awoke from a nap experiencing acute vertigo, nausea and headache. I also was experiencing fever and chills. I began treating with excedrine but did not have an effect. The vertigo was very acute, my eyes were skipping and I was unable to walk. Nause was so intense that any attempt to leave my bed resulted in vomiting. I was unable to eat and could barely drink for the first 24 hours. Friday 4/2 at approx 7pm I took a dose of Promethazine which began to help the nausea. Extreme headache/migraine lasted for 3 days. During this time I also experienced extreme neck pain, as well as pain near base of skull, behind my ears, and on my temples. Symptoms were steadily improving each day, so I did not seek medical care during this time. I feel I became fully recovered by 4/18. I just had my second vaccine dose on 4/21 and I am very nervous about experiencing a relapse of symptoms.

                                                On Sat, May 8th around 4:30 PM, while sitting and watching TV, I felt a numbing shock to the left side of my body (particularly left cheek, my entire left arm, and legs) and got up to check myself in the mirror. I got chills and my teeth began chattering, but my arm in particular felt like it was on fire. I thought I was having a stroke so I managed to drive myself to the ER where I was admitted. When the doctors performed the initial tests on me, my skin felt dull on my left side but my arm felt a burning-numbness to it. The doctors performed two MRIs, a CT scan, an Echo Cardiogram, Blood Tests, Blood Pressure readings, and a Covid-19 test and found no problems in my brain or heart, no Covid infection, and a healthy cardiovascular system. I was released May 10th with the diagnosis of a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) of unknown cause. When I woke up today on 5/11, the burning-numbing sensation returned to my arm again (even as I type this) but this time I know it is not a stroke. I have had no medical history, exercise regularly, have a healthy diet (vegetarian/vegan for more than seven years), the only thing I&#39;ve done recently is had my first Moderna shot injected intramuscularly in my left arm, the same arm where this burning-numbness is taking place. I thought it is best proactive to report this event and if there is any correlation to the vaccine

Around noon that day I had a seizure at work and was rushed to the ER. While at the hospital waiting for a room to open up, I had another seizure. This one was much worse than the first. They had to intubate me and I spent 5 nights in the ICU. Another 3 on the Neurology floor for observation. The seizures caused Rhabdomyolysis which caused damage to my kidneys and significant muscle loss/damage. I wasn&#39;t able to walk at all for 3 days.

Body aches build over the night. Wake up with mild/moderate pain in back, knees, arm. Groggy. Went to work on something with a friend at 10:00 AM (T&#43;24Hrs), but had to return home because....  T&#43;24hr: ....headache growing. Went home and found fever at 102°.  Slight chills, bit mainly just heat without sweating. Fever hit 103.2 at peak. Went through 10lbs ice to keep the fever in check. Headache from T24hr-T36HR feels like a spike through the top of frontal lobe to my left eye.  T&#43;32hr: Headache still intense. Only back pain now. Appetite slowly increasing.  T&#43;48hr (Saturday morning). Back pain persists, but mild. Headache gone. Have a relatively normal day.  T&#43;60hrs (Sat. Afternoon): Back pain increasing. Stop all unnecessary lifting/moving.  T&#43;68hrs (early Sunday morning): Go to ER with the back pain. Absolutely excruciating spasms from top of sacrum - roughly LI/12T. Lower back stiff as wood. Given shot or Toradol, dose/prescription to flexiril. I specifically request this plan because usually takes care of the spasms; basically, get me able to move and the pain/spasms will go away.   NOTE: I have a history of back issues in this area, but I have not had an episode in years and certainly never had an episode that works like this with no relief. From about 2017-2019, I r  T&#43;70-78hrs: Feel normal.  T &#43; 78-88hrs: lower back pain comes back with an absolute vengeance.  T&#43;90hrs (early Monday morning): Return to ER. Back pain worse than Sunday morning. Receive toradol shot and prescription Prednisone. Back pain gone by around 10:30 AM. Decide to take prednisone Tuesday morning as its getting a bit late in the day by the time pharmacy fills the prescription.   T&#43;90hrs: Back pain returns in similar fashion as Sunday afternoon. Still. Barely mobile.   T&#43;96 hours: Wake up with lower back pain similar to Sunday/Monday morning. Took prednisone and flexiril this morning.   Please help me.

That went throughout the night and was the same all day Friday. Saturday at 4:00 am woke up vomiting and experiences chest pain. By 9 AM the chest pain was so extreme that I had my wife take me to the ER.  Where they said I was having a heart attack. I have been at Hospital in the ICU  since then.

                                                A few minutes after giving vaccination, patient&#39;s mother and caregiver stated that he was having a reaction.  Patient can only use his eyes to respond &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34; since he is non-verbal and when he would not respond to his mother&#39;s questions with his eyes she became very panicked and alerted the pharmacy staff.  When I got to the patient he was very clammy, sweating, and breathing heavy.  She said his eyes had rolled back in his head and his tongue had turned blue.  I propped his legs up on a chair and took his blood pressure with an automatic blood pressure cuff and it was 164/124 with pulse 95.  I decided to contact EMS for assistance. Retook BP  few minutes later and it was the same.  EMS arrived and stated it was most likely a reaction to being afraid of needles but would take him to get checked out.

                                                The day after the shot, I had the expected fever. The following day, I began to have hand pain and weakness. This continued and seemed likely to be a flare of Sjogren&#39;s, significantly more severe than any symptoms I had previously experienced. After a couple of weeks, my rheumatologist tried me on a pack of methylprednisolone which helped while I was taking them but symptoms rebounded as soon as I finished the pack. This seems like it is not directly related to the vaccine&#39;s action, but the timing makes me think it prompted my immune system to get carried away even after it finished the response to the vaccine. We are continuing to investigate treatment, but in the meantime, I am having to get help for things requiring gripping and I am limited in my ability to type and thus work, so I am also having to look at speech-to-text programs.

All symptoms subsided in 28 hours after injection except headache which persisted for about 4 days.  12 days after second dose patient experienced intense pain and redness at site of injection leading to loss of mobility in left arm, and outbreak of hives across torso, upper arms and legs, which have persisted for 5 days (to date of Adverse Event report). Arm pain subsides with 400 mg ibuprofen taken daily. Pharmacist recommended Benadryl for hives, taking 25 mg Diphenhydramine HCI once daily with little improvement in symptoms. Patient recalls no previous history experiencing acute or chronic urticaria. Hives are moderately itchy, mostly painless, and have gradually increased to 2-3 inches in diameter.

I saw patient on 3/24/21 after 2nd dose (given to right arm on 3/18/21), and at that time he was complaining of right axillary swelling with some redness as well as persisting left axillary swelling.  Patient had also had other symptoms (fevers, aches, chest discomfort/cough) in the few days after the vaccines that had resolved.  I consulted with our ID specialist, who saw the pt on 4/16/21, and at that time only left axillary fullness was noted.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

After patient received vaccine he started yawning, became diaphoretic, pale  we lowered him to ground and elevated feet. He said he heard humming in his ears and blacked out.  His wife was present. She reported his hx of doing this previously. She said he is an avid runner and his resting heart rate is typically in the 40s. His heart rate was 37-40 when palpated radially. His Bp stayed about 90/50 which she said was also his baseline. I called the patient around 11AM 2 hours after the event and he reported he felt much better and had recovered.

I felt strong muscle pain at the injected arm around 12 hours later and woke by the pain multiple times. The next day (1/14/2021),  my left arm is still very painful if I lift it. This strong pain lasted a whole day (1/14/2021) and alleviated quite a lot since 1/15/2021. I&#39;m likely to be one of the reported 90% with musle pain.  2. A mild headache similar to mild cold on the night after the injection. It dimishes next morning. This can be ignored.

The pain elevated as the evening went on to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand for too long or sit.

My wife helped me downstairs and after some water and Tylenol, symptoms reversed themselves in about 15 minutes.  My body temperature was not recognized by the thermometer and then registered 93.4

After 3 days I observed both my lymph nodes in my armpits were swollen and I felt very fatigued.  No real pain on lymph nodes just swollen.   Lasted for approximately 5 days and returned to normal around January 20th.  I am an athletic 37 year old male.  Had no illness prior.  Had telemedicine appointment with my doctor and he said to report the possible side effects.  Also had blood work up done at his requests to confirm everything was ?normal? with me.

At the time of patient&#39;s vaccine (01/19/2021), the patient was unaware of his spouse&#39;s COVID-19 status, as they had little contact with others and thought it was a cold. Patient began having COVID-like symptoms on 01/23/2021: cough, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, muscle/body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patient has had two subsequent negative COVID-19 tests while symptomatic. Because of his symptoms, his spouse&#39;s symptoms and positive COVID status, practitioners have cautioned patient to act as if he has COVID. He is under quarantine orders per Public Health. The concern from the patient, Doctors and Public Health officials has been the patient&#39;s negative status while obviously symptomatic, and if he can pass COVID if he is symptomatic but testing negative. He has another test scheduled for Saturday 1/30/2021.

Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

Neck stiffness and soreness began Thursday evening.  Severe chest pains early Saturday morning (3am).  Taken to urgent care - EKG showed irregularity and high level of troponin. Transported from there to the hospital.  They did angiogram, and diagnosed me with pericarditis. The on call physician believes this was most likely caused by the second dose of the vaccine.

I had to take the tylenol every 4 hours to keep my temp below 100 until that evening. Chills persisted until the following afternoon and the headaches ended the day after that.

I was unable to speak for a few minutes due to the uncontrolled muscle contractions and was just generally too uncomfortable to move. It was not a seizure, but it was temporarily debilitating. Once I got myself wrapped in a warm blanket, it only took about 10 minutes to pass (and never returned). The rest of the day I did feel generally ill, but the day after I felt completely back to normal.

Three days after the shot, I experienced the worst headache of my life.  I received my shot 6 days ago and I still feel very &#34;hot&#34;/low grade fever and experiencing flushing of the face.  The symptoms haven&#39;t felt serious but I&#39;m hearing approximately 60% of individuals I speak with are experiencing the same or worse symptoms.  I worry that individuals won&#39;t want to receive their 2nd shot due to the reported side effects.  I believe more awareness should be communicated to the general public, so they aren&#39;t caught off guard.   I had a covid test conducted on Friday (negative) and will get another one this week to be certain I do not have covid.

For about 36 hours, I felt exactly like that after receiving the shot. I?m fine today. I plan to get shot #2. This was NOT an allergy and I?m not even sure it qualifies as a reaction. They were side effects that I was told I might have. I?m reporting I had them.

We monitored him for over an hour and during that time, he continued to c/o dizziness, frontal headache, photophobia, and worsening when opening his eyes are trying to look straight ahead. We had him isolated in a dim room and had air blowing on him as he complained of being hot. His O2 Sat, pulse , and BP all stayed stable and within normal range. Pt. denied sx of swelling around face/neck or difficulty breathing. RR was stable and unlabored at all times. Pt. refused EMS services and after some time, insisted he needed to get up and leave. Our staff and his co-worker assisted him out of the facility and to a vehicle where we was transported off the premises.  We were informed later through his supervisor that he got worse after leaving and went to the hospital where he &#34;seized.&#34; He is reportedly stable at this time but further information on his condition is unavailable.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

The day after I received the vaccine I was very tired feeling, my left arm very sore, and I noticed my heart rate was staying higher. At one point at work my heart rate went up to 140 bpm. I went to the doctor after work and was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia. I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I do not know what caused my heart rate to increase, but the metoprolol has my rate controlled now. I felt the fatigue lasted about 3-4 days and then I was back to normal.

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

                                                Moderna Covid 19 vaccine - Got first dose 1-8-2021 -   Side effects.  Right arm is very sore.  Weakness in arm.  More painful than the ankle surgery.  Took a couple hours then it started  1-9-21 at about 1130pm got headache. Took two Advil 1-10-21 at 11am got a headache  1-11-21 around 830pm shoulder and arm finally started feeling less pain 1-13-21 headache around 134.  Took Advil 1-14: arm and shoulder still cracking. Got really bad constipation. Forced it out. Hurt like hell. Tore something took 2 senna plus pills  1-15. Morning had thick and super long poop again. Forced it out a lil quicker but tore again or hemorrhoids  or both. Took 2 senna pills. Moved my neck wrong way.  All muscles are super super tight in my neck. Cracked with shoulder.  Now I can?t move my neck to the right   1-16: poop was pretty normal. Came out nice.  Still some in rectum wasn?t ready to expel. Had to use badee three or four times and lots of wiping to get clean.  1-18: right arm hurting again about half as bad. Still very painful when I lift etc.   Neck is a lot better  1-19: arm still hurts.  Can?t lift up without pain. Weak to lift other things pain actually seems to be in my shoulder and cracking a lot.  Not in my arm itself.  By the nighttime the pain became more intense in my shoulder and very difficult to lift it or move it.  Like the first day I got the vaccine.  1-20: shoulder hurts worse than ever.  Worst pain ever even if I keep it still has some pain. Horrible.    Became worse over the day  1-21:  at 330pm had loose bowels.  1-22-21 at 1118am.  Loose bowels again after an initial drop of on bowels.   1-23.  Normal poops.    2-5-21.  Got second dose at 1250am in left arm this time instead of right.  At 215pm still fine. But as I got up slight headache. Arm not hurting yet  247pm started having some pain just at injection site. Later at night around 9 or so I got really tired also felt slightly nauseous  2-6-21 at 1207pm.  Arm is sore but bearable.  Can move it fine.   Doable.  At 1221pm felt nauseous.  Sick to my stomach.  130pm or so was able to eat Mac n cheese.  Had raspberries about a half hour earlier to settle my tummy  2/7 at 122am:  laying in bed.  Got a bad headache since I got up.  Arm pain is minor. So long as I don?t touch it it?s fine.   I am tired.  Worn out. Congested.  Left arm and shoulder starting hurting around 2-15?   Once I started working out. Hurt like hell.  800mg Advil helped some but still hurt.  2-26: shoulder left still hurts and tight.  Did not take Advil.   Tried to stretch it.  Feels a little better at 9pm 2-28-21: slight nausea Again.  Still sore arm on and off.  Dried out.  Tired.  Drinking tons of water 3-3.  Last day I worked out and did cardio.  3-5.  Left arm still hurts a bit at injection site.

I would rate the pain when I pushed on the injection site at 6/10. It was only painful when I touched it or tried to use the muscle to lift my arm in certain ways. I also experienced some level of fatigue and slight dizziness the day after I received my shot.

                                                The side effects I&#39;m experiencing didn&#39;t start until about 2 days later.  It started out as pain at the injection site with extremely bad dizziness that has gotten worse each day. On day 4 after the injection I noticed a full pain in my left thumb area. The same side as the injection. I didn&#39;t think anything of it but as the hour&#39;s and days went by it continued and continues to get worse. The best way I could explain it is it feels like when your hand falls asleep without the pins and needles. Yesterday I ended up having to go to the ER. My issue with my left thumb area started to get much worse. I couldn&#39;t hold things in my left hand and started to radiate up my arm. It was the weirdest feeling I can&#39;t really explain it other than being slightly numb and very week. I wasn&#39;t able to move my hand much at all. They gave me a cat scan but they never called me back to be seen or to give me my results. I was there for 8 hours and was never called back to be seen. I had to leave this morning before I was seen because I didn&#39;t have anyone to watch son. Today is 8 days since I received my first covid shot and I still have major fatigue along with dizziness. I will start sweating profusely out of nowhere and then stops.  I&#39;ve had a numb/metallic taste in my mouth for about 4-5 days as well. I feel like I&#39;m in a complete fog and can&#39;t shake this feeling. I&#39;m having trouble concentrating and remembering things. I&#39;m drinking lots of water and trying to rest when I can but I&#39;m still feeling terrible with no signs of this getting better. My doctor suggested I report this to you and I&#39;m hoping and praying this goes away. Is there anything I can do or a specialist I could see? Thank you so much in advance.

Also had some fatigue that seemed to accompany this, though that could have been a coincidence with many late night interruptions to my sleep schedule because of on-call responsibilities at that time.

                                                This 37 -year-old male patient received the Moderna Covid vaccine on his left deltoid at 17:27 on April 06, 2021. That same evening the patient complained of a slight headache. The patient was treated with acetaminophen 650 mg at 1936.  On April 7, 2021 I spoke the provider to follow-up on this ADR; he confirmed that the reported slight headache had resolved.   On April 7, 2021 the patient continued to report a headache, from a scale from 1-10; 10 being the most he reported: 4 to 6. The patient was treated with acetaminophen 650mg, the patient reported this was partially effective. The patient also reported body aches and chills, his temperatures was checked, and it was 98.6.   During the evening the patient again received acetaminophen 650 mg at 1900 for his headache. On April 9, 2021 I spoke with the provider to follow-up on the patient&#39;s headache, body aches, and fever. The provider stated that on April 08, 2021 the patient continued to complain of a headache, a temperature of 101. He was treated with acetaminophen 650 mg in the morning and evening.  As of this morning the patient is no longer complaining of a headache, body aches nor is he febrile. On April 9, 2021 the patient complained of a headache at 1417 and was treated with acetaminophen 650 mg.   On April 12,2021 I spoke with the provider who stated the patient experienced a headache on the evening of April 11, 2021 requested acetaminophen 650 mg and his headache improved. This morning the patient again experienced a headache today and acetaminophen 650 mg improved his headache.  On April 13, 2021 I spoke with the provider who stated the patient continues to experience headaches and continues to be treated with acetaminophen 650 mg. On April 14, 2021 the patient again requested acetaminophen 650 for a headache at mid-day and at nighttime. On April 15, 2021 I spoke with the provider who stated the patient is no longer requesting acetaminophen for his headache, which was described by the patient as stiff neck muscles. The headache/stiff neck muscles have resolved. All other reported events have resolved.

However, the next day on 4/17/2021 I have pain in my right leg calf. The pain is to the right of the calf and feels like a dull pain. The area is not warm or swollen so I don&#39;t expect it to be a blood clot, but thought it might be worth reporting just in case.

                                                Around 7 PM on Tuesday, I began to feel fatigued. My abdomen became slightly tender. My arm was sore in the injection site, but that was nothing that I did not expect. As the night went on, I began to feel worse. I developed chills? And became feverish. I did take my temperature and it was 99.5° at one point. I took acetaminophen to help with the fever and bodyaches. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen seem to stem the fever symptoms. The highest my fever has ever been since Tuesday was 100.1°.  When I have a fever I do become congested. So I have not thought anything about congestion as I do develop congestion when I chill. I did develop a muted sense of smell and taste. I can still taste what I am eating and drinking.  My biggest concern is that I would love for my fever to go away. It is making me incredibly fatigued.

                                                My left arm was sore about 2-3 hours after the shot. Later that evening, my arm was worse and I could not lift my arm up past my chest. Around about 11:00 p.m., I began to feel chills, aches and pains. I was sluggish, tired and had no energy. The next day when I woke-up around 10:00 a.m., I still had the aches and pains, all the way down to the bottoms of my feet. My body hurt to stand. The aches and pains continued that evening, along with diaherra and chest pains. The pains continued through Saturday and the chest pains got worse. The pain would radiate from my chest to my left arm, to my left shoulder, and into my back between my shoulder blades. Then by 7:00 p.m. or so on Saturday, my chest started to feel better and my aches and pains were not as bad. I was then woken up around 12:00 a.m. or so, on Saturday/Sunday with severe chest pains again with the radiation of pain. This also came along with the aches and pains and diahrrea. This has continued through to today, Monday. I tried to do simple putting my dishes away and loading up my dishwasher, and couldn&#39;t complete the task due to the chest pain and severe aches and pains all over my body. I have tried to treat the symptoms with over-the-counter medications which would include: Advil II, Pepto Bismal, Alka-Seltzer, hot showers, hot baths, luke warm baths, vapor bath soaks and a heating pad.

                                                An hour after injection I tried eating some food and found that if I chewed and swallowed too quickly I began to have q tickle in my throat that led to coughing and vomiting, this symptom has begun to fade. I also started having pain in my right arm after a few hours, which I expected, but at roughly 2am the night of the injection, my right armpit also started feeling painful. It&#39;s now been 2 days and while most symptoms have abated, my right armpit is still incredibly sore.

I thought that I was having a stroke or an aneurism it was unlike anything I?ve ever felt before. Afraid to get my second dose!

Patient exhibited no signs of rash or respiratory reaction. Patient was given a cold pack for his neck and recovered after a few minutes.  During a follow-up call the next day, the patient reported he had fainted at some point when his eyes were closed.  After leaving the pharmacy, the patient went home and took a nap.  The patient reported no further or lasting effects.

Lasted through 4/11/21.  4/12/21-Went home early after eating lunch, felt the same symptoms.  As a physical education teacher, I&#39;m noticing that each time I start to become physical the symptoms come on.  4/13/21-4/15/21, went to bed very early because I felt exhausted.  Still had random headaches.  4/18/21-4/20/21-symptoms persisted, stayed home from work Monday and Tuesday.  Today, 4/22/21, during the first hour of work had a headache along with body fatigue again and decided to fill this out.

                                                Approximately 3- 5 minutes after felt strange mild sensation as if pins and needles was moving throughout my body from the injection site. I also started to breathe differently. Couldn&#39;t tell if my heart rate changed or not.   At about 5 minutes, I started to feel light-headed and nauseous as if I just had blood taken or an IV in my, likely a drop in blood pressure. I was reading a book, put it down on my lap as I couldn&#39;t focus on reading and considering to get help. At that moment, I passed out, hunched over in my chair staring at the floor.   This moment likely lasted for about 1 minute, but felt like 20. I was in a dream like state and at one point had a series of images and/or memories flash by in a sequence. Then, I felt like I was half asleep but couldn&#39;t tell what I was staring at but knew that I had to &#34;wake up&#34;.   Then , I was surrounded by people who helped me up. At this moment I felt very weak and tired and was sweating profusely. My right hand felt very weak.   About 10 minutes later, I started feeling better. I was given water which seemed to help. I would have waves of mild nausea come and go that eventually subsided. I also felt random cramping around my stomach/lower chest area and lower right side rib cage area.   At about 15 -20 minutes felt confident to walk to the bathroom and throughout the store. Eventually, I felt confident to drive safely home.  At the time of writing this (approx 2 hours later), I&#39;m feeling random sensations/feelings of itchyness throughout my body. No sign of hives.

These symptoms worsened over the course of the day, worsened at times and lasted until late in the evening on Saturday. The worse points included fevers of 101.5 at about 3:30 p.m. Saturday (48 hours after injection) and 100.9 at 7 p.m. (51.5 hours after injection). My fever seemed to break in the middle of the night between Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday morning, I woke up feeling nearly 100%.

The symptoms persisted for a couple days and got progressively worst where it was uncomfortable to lie down or sleep without being propped up. It wasn&#39;t painful but it felt like there was a lot of pressure right in the center of my chest below my rib cage as if someone was pressing on it.  The symptoms lasted for about a week with the peak of the symptoms on 5/20.

This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) in a 37-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Eczema. Concurrent medical conditions included Skin infection (Infection on mid to lower back, possible eczema per patient). Concomitant products included TRIAMCINOLONE for Eczema, CEPHALEXIN [CEFALEXIN] for Skin infection.    On 09-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Mar-2021, the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOAESTHESIA (Hypoaesthesia) and PALLOR (Pallor). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Loss of consciousness), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), HYPERHIDROSIS (Hyperhidrosis), HYPOAESTHESIA (Hypoaesthesia) and PALLOR (Pallor) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 09-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 (normal) 99.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The reporter states that the patient received shot and then blacked out a minute or two later. The reporter called 911, and while on the phone the patient regained consciousness and felt much better.  EMS checked him out and all of his vitals were normal and he could walk upright just fine.

The symptoms were reduced after taking Ibuprofen (200 mg) in the morning (May 25).  On May 26, I felt postnasal drip in the morning and I took a Fexofenadine (180 mg) in the morning. It did not help much and I took Zyrtec (10 mg) in the evening. It did not help either and during the same night, I had a soar throat. In the morning of 27th May, I had the feeling of sinuses infection (thick yellowish mucous, pain in the left cheek and teeth, pressure in my head, fatigue). Was seen by a nurse practitioner who was suggesting me taking some OTC medicine, but considering my past history of sinuses and ineffectiveness of OTC against it, I did not take any of those OTC medicine. Then she  prescribed me Amox-Clav (875 mg) twice a day. On May 28, I woke up with mild body pain, nasal congestion, pressure in my head and I took my Multivitamin, Biotin, ibuprofen (400 mg), and second dose of Amox-Clav.

I began to feel ill. Arm hurt, headache, weight on chest. Body hurt. I went to bed early. I woke up on 13 JAN and felt worse. I stayed in bed until around 1300. I got up and went and sat in my office to work. At around 1700, I went to go get my children from a neighbors yard to bring them for supper. I made it to my back yard before feeling to tired to continue. I went inside and laid down. At around 1900 or 1930, I was putting my kids to bed. I then fainted once more. I don&#39;t know how long I was out each time. I don&#39;t think I hit anything with my head. I got up and went to my bed and texted a Doc.

At 3:00 that same afternoon, I began running a fever, which ranged anywhere from  99.8 - 102.6 over the next few days. I experienced body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea and vomiting (one episode), and headaches. I did receive a COVID (Rapid and PCR) and Flu test on the following Monday, all of which came back negative. On the 21 and 22 I woke up without a fever, but within approximately 3 hours of waking up my fever would return. Fever was treated with a rotation of acetaminophen and ibuprofen with success, however, it never dropped the fever below 99.0.

                                                Lower Back Spasms just a few hours after vacine was administered.  I went to bed with what I thought was just flu like syptoms like achy muscles.  But this was more then that.  Even laying in bed my back would spasm and almost take my breath away.  That night did not sleep due to the sporadic unpredictable pain when laying in bed.  Describe pain as electic shock or stabbing pain that takes your breath away it&#39;s so intense, but then goes away very quickly.  The next couple of days I was forced to stay immobile due to the pain that was sporadic in nature.  Even when laying down it spasmed.   I could barely walk for a few days.  I started taking NSAIDS to help with the pain and I became more mobile after a few days.  Work has been very difficult and spasms have not gone away even now Im still having problems and am struggling making it through the work day.  I have to lay down flat on my back as soon as I get home from work and take ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  I was absolutely fine healthy and very active person prior to the vaccine.  Just hours after getting vaccine it&#39;s almost like my joints and back were inflamed for some reason.

At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

                                                Eleven days after the vaccination the patient developed 2 days of heartburn followed by a worsening nonproductive cough, substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, palpitations, and an episode of near syncope. These worsened over about 6 days and then slowly decreased. During this time he was referred to the ED and then admitted to a civilian host nation hospital. Echocardiogram and CT scan were performed and a paericardial cyst was discovered measuring 7.4 cm. He was then referred to another facility for evasluation. The pericardial cyst was confirmed, now 6.5 cm and laboratory tests were performed on 4 FEB, but there was at that time no elevation in inflammatory markers. Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery consultations were obtained, but the consultants and the attending physician (who is an infectious disease physician by training) did not think that the crescendo-decrescendo symptoms could be explained by the pericardial cyst, which was likely an incidental finding. A milder cough may have preceded these events by up to a year, and this may possibly be related to the cyst. The heartburn, chest pain, tachycardia, diaphoresis, palpitations, and near syncope may well be adverse reactions of the vaccine.

I have no history of headaches or migraines and have very rarely had headaches and they were never major.  After lunch on Saturday I got a headache and took 1 Aleve 12 hr and slept it off but it was still minor after waking.  The next morning it returned and I took another Aleve 12 hr and it took over an hour for relief.

Woke up with a fever in morning, fever off and on the following day, fatigue the following two days. By day two I was having difficulty breathing while laying down, shallow breaths. I went to urgent care by the fourth day because the breathing difficulty increased, to the point where it was hard to breathe sitting up. Dr. at the urgent care did chest Xray and EKH, which were both normal. He tested me for COVID-19 and the results were negative. It is now day 7 and I am still having shallow breathing, with what feels like an unclearable chest congestion, and cough.

                                                About 12 hours after the 2nd dose was given, I woke up at 2:30am with a severe headache, uncontrollable chills, muscular discomfort, soreness at the injection site, and fatigue.  I took 2 Tylenol, the chills subsided about 15 minutes after they began, and the headache was better about 30 minutes after taking the Tylenol.  I was in and out of sleep on the couch until around 6am, and I took my temperature at that time.  It was 102 degrees.  I took a couple more Tylenol at 7am and contained to take 2 every 4 hours (last dose around 6pm that night).  My temperature reduced gradually, but it was still over 101 degrees around noon.  By 6-7pm my fever was gone and didn&#39;t return.  I called out of work sick, and I fell back asleep in bed from 8am-11:30am.  I woke up with significant muscle pain in my left theigh (I sleep on my left side, but the pain was much more pronounced than usual).  This lasted 3-4 hours.  Overall, less acute muscle soreness lasted the full length of pronounced reactivity (~2:30am to ~6:30pm on 02/09).  Fatigue was evident until a went to bed around 11:30pm and not noted when I woke up at 6:30am on 02/10 for work.  Soreness at the injection site (left arm) gradually decreased over about 3 days following the injection, but it never impaired my ability to engage in everyday tasks.

States he was monitored by EMT for a short time after this happened, did not need to use his EpiPen, but did take Benadryl. Reports that after 5-10 min his symptoms improved/resolved, and he has felt fine since. States he is feeling great today.  He was advised by PCP NOT to get the second dose of the vaccine, and if he would like a second opinion, will need to be referred to an allergist. Patient declined referral, leaning towards not getting the second dose.

                                                After the second injection on 2/26/21, I woke in the middle of the night with moderate diffuse body pain, fever, chills, and sweating.  I slept until Noon on 2/27/21, then was so profoundly fatigued (like having a severe case of influenza, but worse) that I couldn?t even tolerate being anywhere but bed.  I went back to bed at 1:30 pm on 2/27/21 and slept the entire rest of the day and night, with only brief wakings and then falling back asleep.  I had a fever until late in the day, and mild diffuse badly pain.  I have never experienced fatigue that severe in my life.  On 2/28/21, most of the symptoms had resolved except fatigue, which was still moderately severe, so I marked the box saying I haven?t recovered from the adverse effect as of reporting on 2/28/21 at 11:30 pm.

The lymph nodes swelled to roughly marble to golf ball sized protrusions in the occipital region of my head. This swelling as also accompanied by more swelling on the top right side of my head and also my skin began to break due to the swelling. Extreme headaches and swelling only started to subside on the right side of the back of my head after I received a steroid shot at an urgent care clinic. The steroid did not diminish the swelling and extreme pain on the right side of my head. A few days after this, I went to another urgent care clinic which diagnosed me some kind of infection due to the swelling and then prescribed me topical and oral antibiotics. As I right this, over three weeks from my first dose, I have scabbing and still some pain in the right side of my head.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after my second Moderna vaccine, I experienced the typical body aches, chills, headache, and tiredness expected in someone my age (38).  I was initially happy that my immune system seemed to have a positive response to the second dose.  About 24 hours after my second dose, I developed a severe headache and nerve pain all over the right side of my head.  No over the counter medicine would relieve the pain.  The next day, I developed a rash on my forehead.  The rash quickly spread and consumed the right side of my face and my right eye.  I was seen by medical staff, and received a diagnosis of severe shingles.  I was given Valtrex and, eventually, gabapentin.  My eye continued to get worse and I lost clear vision in my right eye.  I saw an ophthalmologist and was told that the shingles had activated in the eye.  My eye pressure was dangerously high.  I was given steroid drops and drops to relieve eye pressure.     Since February 22, I have battled shingles.  My rash is gone and my eye has cleared.  But, I still suffer from intense nerve pain in my head, forehead, and eye.  All medical professionals opined that the moderna vaccine must have played a role given the timing.  If shingles can be considered a side effect, it is one that has been intense and long-lasting.

Patient was sitting crossed legged on the floor with head down.  Asked patient if he wanted 911 called and patient adamantly declined.  Patient was alert and oriented.  Pharmacy gave patient  a water bottle.  Had patient lie back with feet up.  After a few minutes patient started to feel better.  Had patient stand  up and sat patient in the chair in waiting room.  After going into the exam room for a few minutes to get ready for next patient, I went back into waiting room and patient was sitting on the floor again with legs crossed and head down.  Had patient come back to exam room and lie down on exam table with feet up.  After approx. 10 more minutes, patient was standing up in hallway and stated that he was feeling better and would walk around the store.  Patient left the store without checking back in.  Called patient to follow up at end of shift and patient did not answer.  Left a message letting the patient know we were checking on him.

During this time, he saw ENT for a chronic cough pre-dating his first shot and underwent CT to rule out sinus disease which revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. He then underwent 2nd dose and had exact same constellation of symptoms along with worsening of cervical lymphadenopathy and has persistent lymphadenopathy on exam at the time of consultation with infectious disease 3/16/2021) albeit symptoms and lymph nodes are improving.

                                                I began experiencing a high pitched, singular buzzing in my ears the morning after I received the vaccination. It initially started as an intermittent noise that came and went throughout the day.  Unfortunately, the sound level and length of buzzing both increased as the days passed. By Saturday, March 20th, the buzzing was loud and continuous and was affecting my ability to carry out day to day activities. Now. on March 23rd, I hear the buzz whenever I&#39;m awake. It&#39;s now accompanied by a headache that usually begins in the early afternoon. I haven&#39;t been able to find any respite or cure for the noise, and have been taking Tylenol to help the headache and using a white noise machine to help sleep. I&#39;m very, very hesitant to receive the second dose if the ringing may further worsen.

                                                On March 24, 2021, the day of the shot, I only felt soreness in my left arm. The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

Pulled over and passed out, my wife says I was shaking. Came back to and throw up a few times.  After that I was just not feeling well and had nausea. Started feeling better later that day.

                                                I had a heart attack or major cardiac stress event after receiving the vaccine . This is concerning because when they did all of their imaging and test my heart is in perfect condition and there are no blockages and there was no reason for this to happen. After the vaccine I was fighting massive fatigue and muscle cramps. In the hospital ran my labs and found out that my potassium had bottomed out to critical level and is very likely the cause of this. But why did the vaccine cause my potassium to bottom out?? I eat healthy and take potassium supplements. I?ve been weight training and competing in bodybuilding and powerlifting competitions for about a decade. So having a healthy diet and understanding nutrition is something that I understand a lot more than the average person.

                                                At 0100, approximately 12hrs after receiving round two of the series, I started shivering uncontrollably. I would characterize this more as spasms than chills. I experienced steady dull muscle ache with occasional sharp jolts of pain, especially in my extremities. My joints began to ache severely and I was unable to sleep.  I registered a fever of 100.3 (my normal temperature is ~97.5). Additionally, I experienced nausea and a moderate headache. I shivered most of the evening and finally got out of bed at 0700. I immediately noticed that I was lethargic and fatigued. My doctor recommended I take 1000mg Tylenol to address the symptoms. This was effective, but only for two hours. After that my symptoms returned - most notably the fever and uncontrollable shivering. Symptoms appear to be declining at this point, approximately 31 hours after injection.

Emergency Department CT confirmed an occlusion  of the midline cranial artery. TpA (clot buster) was administered on 3/3/21. Subsequent TEE confirmed a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which was closed with a surgical procedure on 3/30/21.

                                                In addition to the (common) side effect of chills and body aches, at around 75 hours after getting the shot I developed extreme gas pains and nausea while running, and barely made it home, collapsing on our floor.  I then suffered severe diarrhea (which had not been listed as a possible side-effect).  It is now five days out, and the diarrhea appears to have abated.  But I continue to have lower abdominal bloating and discomfort.  (I also have painful swollen lymph nodes under the armpit of injection, as I did after the first dose, for at least a week.) Note: These gastrointestinal symptoms are NOT like those I suffer from with gastric dysmotility, which affects my upper GI tract.

Also, bouts of diarrhea  all week (not too unusually, hence possible dairy allergy referenced above).

I did that with the 1st dose too and had no issues that first time.  By 2pm I got very sleepy for no apparent reason. I took a 1 hr nap.  By 6 pm I had INTENSE stomach cramps. By 7pm I had non-stop cramps and diarrhea until 3am the next day at which point it abruptly stopped.  During that time I felt chills but I did not have a fever.  It was nothing I ate.

                                                Patient had COVID in October 2020 and was hospitalized for a few days due to  fever, body reactions and possible clotting. He was still required to get two vaccines (Moderna) and was sick with  high fever (102 degrees) for 2 days each time. Is it really necessary for people who had a  significant case of COVID  to get vaccinated twice. Seems like too much stress on the body in such a short time and maybe not even necessary.

When I woke up after a 2 hour nap I felt a little fatigued but other symptoms were gone. The next day I felt normal and had a normal Saturday, but in the middle of the night around 2:00am I woke up with chills, aches, headache, and nausea. I also had diarrhea. The chills with come and go but be replaced with being really hot. I spent all day Sunday in bed and went to sleep eventually in the evening. I woke up Monday morning with a small headache that went away and all other symptoms disappeared. I did feel tired or a lack of energy by Monday evening.

                                                I noticed a tingling sensation on my in my left arm that goes goes about mid way from my bicep to my hand.  It is best described as when your hand falls asleep and your getting sensation back, that pins and needle feeling.  When condition first occurred I figured it may have been dry skin as I just got done on 5/23/2021 working heavily in the sun and had a mild sunburn.  I did not even apply skin lotion at this time.  I did not notice anything unusual on 5/24/2021 as I worked hard the day before and my arms were tired.  On 5/25/2021 I noticed it and it still felt like a tired arm but the tingling never left.  While it is not painful or debilitating it&#39;s presence is known and is uncomfortable.    I have held my arm up and performed other tests to rule out stroke.  AT this time I am reporting it and will continue to monitor the situation and alert you if it gets worse or gets better.

                                                The morning after receiving the shot, I woke up at roughly 9am with a High fever (100&#43;), headache, and general felt very sick.  Upon getting up and going to the bathroom, I fainted which peeing (standing up).  Upon waking up on the floor of the bathroom, I got up, was light headed, took 4 steps to the bathroom door, and fainted a second time.  Upon waking up the second time, I made it to bed and fell back asleep until 11:30.   I took my temperature at 11:30 and found it was 99.9 degrees.  I was feeling cooler (less fevered) then I had been at the time of the fainting incident.  I called a nurse through my insurance company, who instructed me to go to the ER.  I waited 3 hours in the ER waiting room, and then received Fluids, A CT head scan, an ECG 12 lead, and blood work.  All normal.  I felt better, if banged up, by the time I left the ER.   I hit my head and Left shoulder in the fall.

                                                3 weeks after initial dose (4/23/2021), I started experiencing dizziness and a constant mild headache. With the dizziness, there was no visual perception of moving or spinning objects and no proprioception problems. The dizziness is more like a sense of being unsteady and an inability to maintain balance. The feeling has never gone away and persists in any position. On different occasions, many times per hour, there is a sweeping feeling that is never in a persistent direction. On the first day of symptoms, the headache was moderate with a feeling of facial puffiness with an elevated blood pressure near hypertensive crisis levels... which was on a Sunday. The following Wednesday morning, I visited the Emergency room at 0034 EST 5/19/2021 because the dizziness was not getting better. A review of systems was performed with no abnormal results. EKG was normal. Cranial CT scan showed no indications of stroke either although I have not looked at it myself yet.  Blood sugar level was at 90. Chem12 test was normal.  Well for more details, please contact me. Session is about to time out and I don&#39;t know how to extend it on my phone.  I have tried vestibular therapy motions. None improved the dizziness. I also have intermittent fog and below normal focus capacity.

After getting the 2nd dose, I got sick the same way as the first dose. I was very cold and very weak. Thursday and Friday I&#39;m very sick. I felt fine Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, my right arm swelled up so much that it couldn&#39;t handle it&#39;s own weight. The pain got really bad and I had to go back to the dr. I get naproxen sodium to take with Tylenol. Thankfully that worked. My arm still didn&#39;t work until later that Tuesday evening. I would not have been able to make it to the Dr. if I had to drive myself. The doctor called it Moderna arm and said it was something he has seen a lot of. Here is when I find out that something is not right. My mind starts getting trouble. If we went through the same thing in the winter, my heater would not be able to keep the house warm enough. I hear about the booster and I just know I can&#39;t handle it. I am not sure what to do about that.

                                                Besides the usual and expected muscle pain, injection site soreness, and headache, I experienced a mild allergic reaction. Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

After I woke up on Saturday (Days#1) morning I felt weaker with muscle soreness, cold. Before noon, I wrapped my self with clothes and  slept.  My body Temperature measurement (using oral and touch thermometer) started  to increase from 99, 100, 101 to 102 F on multiple different occasions. I was able to eat but with minimal appetite.   Before eating I took Theraflu which contains 650 mg Tylenol it didn&#39;t work well. Until evening I took 2 tabs Tylenol 500 mg , slept for 4 hours,  woke up with sweat, feeling better not very weak and my temperature went down to 99 F.   Took another 2 tabs an hour later and woke up in the morning normal but little bit tired (Day#2).  Monday( Day#3) normal not my usual energy, but better than Day #2.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

My skin was warm to the touch, body aches and pain and sniffles, lots of congestion and complete fatigue and severe muscle aches. I had a slight headache also but in the middle of the night 2/3 to 2/4 I woke up drenched from sweat and had to redress because my clothes were soaked.  On 2/4 I had to have the air on because I was so hot but never developed a fever.  On 2/5 I was still fatigue and still couldnt do much.  2/6 I still had arm soreness but felt better overall and by 2/7 all symptoms had subsided.

Immediately that evening I began to feel symptoms of fatigue. This grew into an overall feeling of sickness and 3 days later, I had major brain fog. This then developed into high anxiety.  However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.

                                                Soreness in arm with injection site started shortly after shot.  6&#43; hours later, both arms were extremely sore, though the non-injection arm may have been sore from having arm suspended for 4-5 hours of driving in one day.   Only soreness in injection arm remained the next day.  Moderate/noticeable fatigue lasted until second day after vaccination, when soreness and fatigue were barely noticeable.

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

My vision , I had to blink a couple times to get it right. From my pelvis down to my toes is was a warm sensation and felt like it was asleep, I went to the ER They did CT scan and blood work, everything came back fine.  My leg took a couple hours to go away, my headache took a while to go away.

On 11 Mar 2021, anaphylaxis 3 minutes post receiving the first dose of vaccine the patient developed numbness and his eyes became swollen, then numbness of the tongue, lips and closing of the throat, which all happened at the vaccination site.The attending EMT provided 3 pills of oral 50mg Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and did not apply an EpiPen. Patient&#39;s blood pressure went extremely high (180/111mmHg) instead of dropping. At that moment, it was decided to contact 911. The paramedics placed the patient on a stretcher and loaded him onto the emergency vehicle to be rushed to the hospital. On the way, the patient was given an EpiPen. While in the hospital, the patient was given more diphenhydramine and injected with methylprednisolone. Patient was in observation for 4 hours and then released with a prescription of an EpiPen. It was reported that the patient was extremely sleepy due to the medications given. When the patient arrived home, he went straight to bed. The patient was hospitalized on 11 Mar 2021 for Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Pruritus and released on same day after 4 hours. The next day, Friday (12 Mar 2021) the patient got up around 10:00am. Then at 10:05am, the symptoms began to reoccur with numbness of the lips, tongue, closing of throat and extreme itchiness.

Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal.

Shoulders are achy.  Thoracic back still mildly painful to touch and feels like it is bruised but there is no discoloration, swelling or otherwise notable signs.  Also had abdominal muscle pain that felt like he was being punched in the stomach - still feels like he did a lot of sit ups.  Still having loss of appetite, loss of taste, and general fatigue.  He took Aleve once with relief of headache but no other doses have been taken.

                                                I did not experience any adverse effects to the second shot until 50 or so hours until after the shot. From then on I felt extreme exhaustion, joint pain, and muscle weakness for 9 days. So much so that on day 6 after the shot I reached out to my Doctor and scheduled a Covid PCR Test, which came back negative.  It was not until 11 days after the second shot that I felt back to &#34;normal&#34;   In the past few days I have noticed a scar at the site of injection. I haven&#39;t seen any information on scaring after the second shot.

                                                After the 15 minute waiting period was up he was breathing deeply with his eyes closed and didn&#39;t respond to his timer going off. When I went out to check on him he said he had a sudden onset of chills and sweating, kind of funny feeling. The sweat was visible on his skin (arms &amp; Face). I told him to sit another 10 minutes while we watched him. He was visibly nervous when he arrived and had told me this was his first vaccination in 20 years. After another 10 minutes he said he was feeling  and was ready to leave.

Upon driving to work noticed headache worsened and left eye turned red as well as both eyes watering. That was 2:25p. Around 3p nausea began to set in. Called work and told then I could not work shift because of migraine headache, throbbing behind eyes, left being red and both eyes watering.  Side effects beginning to lessen now at 6:20p. Headache starting to go away but left eye is still red but both eyes are not watering currently.

                                                I received the vaccine around 11am and did not experience any adverse reactions aside from a sore arm throughout the day.  I went to sleep at 10pm and was awakened at 3am with moderate soreness in my arm and I began to feel feverish and woozy.  About 2 minutes later I could tell that I was going to faint.  The thing I remember was waking up on the floor next to my bed with my wife holding me up.  She said that I started making sudden, loud guttural noises and she was afraid that I had been choking.  She reached over to touch my arm and my body jerked out of bed and I hit the ground.  When I woke up, I realized that I had fainted (I have passed out after a flu shot a couple years ago, but that incident happened about 15 minutes after injection) and my entire body was trembling and sweating profusely.  My wife left the bedroom to get me some water and a cold towel.  I got myself back into bed and passed out again.  The trembling and sweating continued but gradually decreased for about 15 minutes until I felt back to normal.  After I had calmed down, I felt no adverse symptoms and fell back asleep and have felt fine since the incident.

                                                Around 6:30 pmI began feeling chills and incredibly tired.  I became sore all over and began shaking uncontrollably because of the chills.  I went to sleep around 7pm and woke up 20 minutes laterwith the worst fever I ever had.  I was extremely hot but when I lifted the covers I would immediately get cold.  I got out of bed around 3am because I was very thirsty and completly stuffed up in my head and sinuses.  I used vicks sinex and drank water and tea.  I was very cold when i got out of bed.  I went back to bed and woke up every 30 mins or so very hot and chilly when I lifted the covers.  I finally got out of bed at 6am.  At that point I had sweated through two shirts, my sheets and comforter.  When i got out of bed I was no longer chilly.  I had a mild headache, sinus pressure and soreness throughout my neck and shoulders.  Throughout the day (April 21, 2021) I would get chills and then get hot.  I continued to havce sinus pressure and a mild headache.  I went to bed around 8:30pm and woke up at 3:00am.  when I woke up I had sweated through half my shirt.  At the time of writing (April 22, 2021 @ 6:08am) I feel slight sinus pressure, no headache and get chills and hot from time to time.

                                                6 hours  after, I started experiencing  persistent traveling muscle aches?from my chest, to abs, to left arm.  12 hours after, I had extreme fatigue, headache, mild nausea, along with full-body muscle soreness. 36 hours after, the initial symptoms eased and eventually disappeared, but then I started having shortness of breath/chest tightness whenever I would become mildly active (casual walk for less than 10 mins) or if I was wearing a mask or taking a shower. The chest tightness would persist after these events for roughly 30 mins. This activity-related chest tightness  continued to occur until the 5th day after the shot.

                                                I periodically experience aphthous ulcers in my mouth that respond very consistently (100%) to treatment with topical Triamcinolone Acetonide. Even a single application will significantly reduce the size, duration, and severity of a developing ulcer.  I happened to have two small aphthous ulcers at the time I got the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, and those ulcers were completely nonresponsive to what became very aggressive treatment (topical Triamcinolone Acetonide 4x daily for 2 weeks.)  The size, duration, and severity (pain) of those two ulcers were as if they were completely untreated, despite continuous, aggressive treatment. (Ulcers grew to several millimeters in diameter, took ~2 weeks to subside, caused severe pain that interfered with eating/brushing/talking.)  I did not happen to have any aphthous ulcers at the time of the first dose of the vaccine. I also experienced whole body aches, chills, and fatigue with both doses of the vaccine.

Later the next day after he ate a meal he developed severe gut pain, 9 out of 10 in pain range.  This happened everyday for the next 6 days.  He contacted his gastro doctor on 3/29/21 and he was ordered to have blood work, X-rays, and CT.  He had been working w/ both his gastro and PCP to treat his symptoms.  He was prescribed Bactrim, renewed RX for diacylamine 20mg, and omeprazole. Also added proactizime, IV GARD, Gas X and Align.  His doctors believe the vax triggered his chronic conditions to flare up.  He feels some better but he still has pain and bloating after eating with vomiting and diarhea.    He says the pain is now a 4 to 5.  He continues to have to take additional medication daily.  He was told this would take weeks to recover from.

Pain radiated through body with slightest movement, felt in joints, muscles, bones.  Only alleviated by laying perfectly still.  Both injection sights became painful during this period, one in both arms.  Worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life, thought I might need to call ambulance and upon reflection, probably should have. Since then chills and sweating periods with minor exertion, getting less severe as time passes, but within norm.

The headache last to Saturday night. Saturday night as the headache faded I became nauseous and vomited.   By 36 hours after the vaccine (around midnight Saturday) I felt much better and was finally able to eat after not being able to all day. On Sunday I was tired but could function, and by today (Monday), I am fully better.

The patient was scheduled to receive his first Moderna dose. At registration, the patient did not have his COVID vaccine card.

The patient had neither allergic or adverse reactions from the first or second doses given within the 12 day timeframe. Follow up completed at the facility on 05/24/2021. The patient was no longer at the facillity but the nurse reports the patient reported fatigue but had no adverse events when he left the facility on 05/21/2021.

Initial workup was otherwise notable for WBC 17 and negative infectious workup. He was initiated on therapeutic Lovenox.  On 6/5, CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed to evaluate for other clots. Left renal artery was complete thromboses with evolving foci of renal infarction. No other clots were detected. He continued to have fevers. By 6/8, his leukocytosis, fever, and flank pain resolved.  Renal ultrasound with doppler showed restoration of some flow in the left renal artery. He is to be discharged 6/9 on Lovenox 1mg/kg BID without patient Hematology follow-up.  His coagulability workup was notable for positive LAC, FVII deficiency, and PET/CT without evidence of occult malignancy.

I went for the tachycardia and dehydration.  They did put me on betablocker (Metoprolaw).  I have been on the on that for the last month.  I have been to the cardiologist they cannot find anything to cause it.  My heart just beats very fast, and I take the betablocker to slow it down.  .  All the scans that were taken showed normal, I just have a very high heart rate.
