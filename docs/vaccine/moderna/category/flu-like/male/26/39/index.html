                                                I received the shot around 0730 on 12/30/2020. Went home and got ready for work. Around 12am 12/31/2020 my arm started to radiate at the injection site and was very tense. I placed a heat pack on the right harm but the pain did not dissipate.  My arm continued to be in pain for the rest of the night. Around 0240 I ate dinner, had water and still had some arm pain. Around 0345 my arm started to flare up and sent pain sensations throughout my body. My right arm was increasingly discomforting, I could barely move it. The sensations spread to my legs, numbing them and my throat had felt as if it were closing up. I got up to get the attention of the nurse and was able to flag her down. She said I was pale as a ghost. My vision was very blurry, I could not hear anything because my ears had filled up and everything was muffled. My head had begun to ring and I was on the brink of fainting when a chair was given to me. My eyes had become extremely sensitive to the light, I was given water and spoken to about what had happened leading up to the event. I was greeted by the paramedics who drew my blood, placed an IV and transferred me to the Acute Care portion of the Emergency Department. My vitals were 76/49, 80/50, 90/56, 100/60 before being brought to the ER.  On 1/1/2021 My thighs have been sore/tense, my knees and ankles have been stiff and just feeling sickly. On 1/2/2021 much of the same symptoms are present. The soreness in the muscles isn&#39;t as prevalent, however joints still are stiff On 1/3/2021, congestion and runny nose are still present, stiffness in ankles and now shins are prevalent.

                                                I woke up around 3 am because of body aches. The body aches worsened and i checked and had a fever of 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit. My head started to pound and my pulse was accelerated to probably 80 bpm (normally rest at 60 bpm). I felt a little lightheaded and  a bit nauseas. I took 2 200 mg tablets of EC ibuprofen and did not take Tylenol because i knew my immune response needed to take its course. it is about 3:33 in the afternoon and my body is still aching but my fever has dissipated and I still have a headache that throbs when I walk.

                                                Initially, around 1500hrs on Monday, January 4th, roughly 40 minutes after the injection, I developed a scratchy throat, a headache, and nausea.  I got home from work, and having no appetite due to nausea, I fell asleep on the couch around 1800hrs. Severe fatigue had set in. I did not wake up until 0500hrs the next morning to go to work on January 5th. I felt like I had not slept at all, however the scratchy throat had gone away. I worked all day with the nausea and headache. Throughout the day I developed chills, cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, and I felt like my mind was foggy (I had felt feverish since Monday night, but Tuesday was the first time I took my temperature that showed I had a fever.) I went home that night and slept all evening and well into the next morning. On the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, my symptoms had again gotten worse, so I called my primary care physician. He fit me in and tested me for the flu and for COVID. He prescribed me Ibuprofen for the headache/fever, and Ondansetron for the nausea/vomiting. My flu test came back negative on Thursday, January 7th, and my COVID test came back negative on Friday, January 8th. The fever finally broke on Friday evening and Saturday, January 9th  was the first day I woke up without a fever.  I still have the headache as of today, January 11th, and a low grade fever has returned. I am still very fatigued as well.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after the injection at 6 pm I began to experience right sided ankle pain and swelling and mild chills. The pain peaked about 2 hours later about a 5/10 and was constant. I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen and elevated my foot. The right ankle was visibly swollen and red compared to the left.  Prior to going to bed the pain had mostly resolved. Upon waking up in the morning the pain had entirely resolved. There was some residual stiffness that resolved throughout the course of the day.

It lasted the whole next day. But later in the evening of the next day I think to me the most concerning side effect was I started getting some chest pain as if I pulled a muscle around my chest or what not. And it has continued into the next day as well which is now 2 days after second dose of vaccine.

I had a light headache, which I&#39;d put at about a 3 on a 1-10 scale, but after being at work for a few hours it increased to about a 5. I left early, around 1pm, and slept again from about 3pm to 8pm. The headache eased up after this nap, but was still there in the background. The next morning (this morning, 1/29), the headache was nearly entirely gone.

                                                Received the first dose 12:30pm Thursday(2/11). Around 6pm that same night I notice the first symptom. I had a super strong headache that lasted the next 24 hours or so. Still lingering now but not as bad. Around 3am Friday (2/12) I woke up with chills and the inject spot was extremely tender. All day Friday I had signs of a fever. Chills and felt cold but body was hot to the touch. This lasted all day and it kept Me in bed the whole day.  Around 6pm Friday night, my injection spot was extremely sore , and there was a red circle, about the size of a gold ball around the spot. That?s also when I  noticed I had shortness of breath and was having a little difficulty breathing. Around 8pm I noticed I had really high anxiety that was abnormal. It went away in about 30 mins or so. I thought it was strange as I normally don?t have anxiety that bad. I went to sleep around 10pm and woke up at 5am itchy with a red rash/hives on the upper half of my body, mostly the neck and chest area. Also the red circle around the injection site grew to the size of a baseball. The headache is still there but not as bad . Maybe 2/10 Severeness. I feel better in terms of the fever and breathing today (2/13).  However the rash/hives has gotten worse and seems to be spreading slowly. I plan on taking Benadryl when I grab it from the store in 30 mins or so

                                                After receiving the Moderna vaccine on 2/10/2021, traditionally expected symptoms developed on 2/11/2021 and 2/12/2021 including fatigue, fever, headache, and general achiness. On 2/12/2021 and into the morning of 2/13/2021 I developed a persistent aching chest pain - Saturday morning (2/13/2021) I went to convenient urgent care in for a quick once-over including vitals and an EKG. The EKG showed ST elevations, and I was taken via ambulance to the hospital emergency room. With blood lab value analysis and an echocardiogram performed, the hospitalist and cardiologist determined the diagnosis to be peri myocarditis. I was admitted to the hospital for 24 hours of observation and was released on 2/14/2021.

                                                could no longer walk and could only crawl, just drags his feet; gets tired very quickly; seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down weren&#39;t working; A spontaneous report was received from consumer concerning a 26-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down, he could no longer walk and could only crawl,  just drags his feet and was also getting tired very quickly.    The patient&#39;s medical history included aphasia. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included diazepam, duwalpro and another, unspecified over-the-counter product.  On 15-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   That same day, according to report, the patient seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down were not working.  On 16-FEB-2021, the patient was unable to walk and could only crawl; he was just dragging his feet. He was also getting tired very quickly.     Treatment for the event included paracetamol and ibuprofen.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.    The outcome of the events, seemed drunk and his feet from the knee down, he could no longer walk and could only crawl,  just drags his feet and was also getting tired very quickly, was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association, a causal association between the reported events and the administration of the mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

                                                For BOTH initial (022621) and booster (032621) of Moderna, pt had moderate/severe eye reaction. Overnight about 3 days after first injection and 4 days after second injection.  Initial injection: pt went to bed on the 3rd night after vaccine having taken no medications and noted mild eye irritation. He woke up a few hours later (~midnight) to severe eye watering and blurriness which required him to keep his eyes closed with mild sinus congestion. No difficulty breathing noted. Pt had trouble getting it to stop despite taking loratadine 10mg and rinsing eyes with water. Pt seriously considered going to ER due to risk of blindness. Pt eventually fell asleep a few hours later and woke up with very sensitive eyes (irritated, very red) that took about 36h to fully recover.   Second injection: pt was on scheduled loratadine 10mg daily. Noted a similar eye irritation (this time four days after injection not three) when going to bed and took 50mg diphenhydramine (about 14h after loratadine dose). Woke up a few hours later to more minor but still debilitating eye watering with proportionally more sinus involvement. No difficulty breathing noted. Pt took an extended release pseudoephedrine, rinsed eyes with water  and waited for it to resolve about an hour or two later. Pt awoke the next morning to much less sensitive eyes than first time.   Note: due to first experience. From time of administration of second dose, pt was on scheduled naproxen (440mg loading dose followed by 220mg q12h), loratadine 10mg q24h,  and pseudoephedrine (120mg ER q24h). Pt took these scheduled days 1-3 and at time of second eye episode was only on scheduled loratadine still. Pt also had 50mg diphenhydramine on hand in case of episode.

He got very pale and the lost consciousness. He is in a wheelchair so we got him out of the chair and laying flat on the ground where he regained consciousness fairly quickly. 911 was called and they did take him in ambulance for follow-up in the emergency room. Vitals were taken while waiting for ambulance to arrive, but those were given to the EMTs.

                                                Since receiving the first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccination two weeks ago, I have had profuse sweating while I am sleeping. This is not normal for me, and the sweating is so bad that I have had to physically wipe it off of my whole body with a towel. Taking ibuprofen before laying down has no affect on this.

                                                Approximately nine hours after second dose, I began to feel as if a flu was coming on. Shortly after upon falling asleep, I started getting the chills and felt as though I had a fever. Waking up in the morning, I had a painful throbbing headache. My muscles ached and I felt very fatigued. I was unable to get out of bed due to said fatigue. I felt as though I had a temperature, but did not take it at that juncture. I had no appetite. When I did manage to stand, the headache would throb and I felt nauseated. Later that evening, I had a slight fever of 100.8 degrees fahrenheit. The following morning, I felt nearly recovered, but my head would still throb when changing positions, but not with the same severity as the previous day. Headache slightly persists to this day.

                                                Had no symptoms prior to injection. After injection, quickly developed moderate pain at injection site that eventually became severe. Over the rest of the day, developed a severe headache, severe muscle aches (not just at injection site), severe fatigue, fever of 100.6F, moderate joint aches (not just in arm, but all over body - neck is worst), and general weakness (I almost fell walking to the bathroom and I&#39;m in decently good shape). Toward the evening, I started struggling with thermal homeostasis - I was simultaneously sweating and shivering. The combination of these was severe enough that I had extreme difficulty sleeping last night and woke up at least once an hour, getting &lt;6 hours of sleep after lying in bed for almost 12 hours. Right now (23h post vaccination), the pain at the injection site has gotten significantly less bad, but I still have a splitting headache, fever of 100.3F,  moderate fatigue/weakness, and mild muscle/joint pains across my whole body. I&#39;m unsure how much the headache this morning is from sleep deprivation.   At no point did I lose sense of smell or taste, have a sore throat, cough, runny nose/nasal congestion, or shortness of breath.

                                                Patient was given a covid vaccine on 3/4/21 at approximately 5:40pm.  The administration went well according to the patient.  After approximately 10 minutes, while the patient was sitting in the post vaccination area, he appeared to be pale looking to the imx RPh.  The pharmacist asked him how he was doing, he replied &#34;I am doing so-so&#34;.  The RPh got up to check on him further when the patient fell to the floor.  The RPh rolled him on his back, got him in a comfortable position,  and elevated his legs.  RPh applied gauze to a cut in his lip, and with the immediate assistance of the health screener, applied cold compress to his neck and forehead.  Patient experienced faintness and sweaty skin only.  Patient did not show any other symptoms.  After about15 minutes, patient said he felt like himself again, and wanted to sit up in a chair.  The RPh assisted him into a chair, where he sat for 5 minutes.  At the request of the patient, he wanted to go home.  RPh escorted patient to his car and watched him get inside safely.  1 hour later, RPh followed up with a phone call to the patient and he was on his way to an urgent care clinic to get a possible stitch for his lip.

                                                My arm became very sore, to the point of near complete immobility, 4 hrs after injection. The condition has not improved, and it is now 39 hours after injection. Regular, everyday tasks are very difficult. Pain is about a 7.5/10.  Also, 24 hrs after injection I experienced a fever. The fever lasted for 12 hours without coming below 103 degrees, and went up to 105.2 degrees at its highest. This was accompanied by extreme chills. I have also have body aches, which are likely a result of the fever, and the fact that I haven&#39;t slept in 2 nights because of these side effects.

Once the Benadryl runs out then I start to feel an itch and the itch leaded to that whole area red and bumpy. The only thing I have gotten so far is a steroid and Benadryl. only thing that works is the Benadryl.   When I first went into the ER I went because I got hive and ive never had hives before in my life.   I went 3 days later because I had a migraine, felt sick and had trouble swallowing.

                                                Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine EUA  3/11/2021 received first dose of Moderna. By next day, expected flu-like symptoms were apparent such as chills, headache, and body aches. Then, full body muscle twitches and motor tics began. These continue six weeks later. On the 7th day post-vaccine, early AM sleep paralysis/seizure sensation 4-5 times before falling back asleep. When awoken, unilateral weakness (right side). Right eye vision blurry. Right ear muffled. Subjective weakness and numbness in right arm and leg. Went to the ER and was admitted under suspicion of TIA or mild stroke. CT w/oC appeared unremarkable. Scheduled for a brain MRI following day (3/19) WWO contrast. Appeared unremarkable, so acute ischaemia was ruled out. Blood work was done repeatedly during stay (CBC, metabolic, CRP, sed rate, urinalysis). Everything was unremarkable. Discharged with instructions to follow-up if symptoms did not improve.  The unilateral weakness is intermittent six weeks later. On 4/20, allergist tested against components of Moderna vaccine intradermally. This showed a reaction compared to the negative control. Allergist advised to avoid further vaccination with any of the ingredients in Moderna. Allergist posited that symptoms could be a latent reaction to the allergy, but wasn?t sure as prolonged presentation seems unlikely.   Future follow-ups: rheumatologist to rule out acute autoimmune reaction, 4/21/21. Neurologist second opinion 5/4/21. Primary care evaluation, as PCP was on leave for several months, 5/19/21.

As patient was standing to get vaccination card filled out, he told associate to call RPH that he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I ran out to give my attention and patient was sweating and looked dizzy. His eyes started to shut while he was standing and as I was holding his arm and back to support him he started to fall to the ground. Patient gently went to the ground, I pushed him over to one side and he was out for about 3 seconds and woke back up. Patient was very hot and sweaty. He wanted to move to a more private area so I made an area with a privacy panel available to him. Patient stated to me that he has no history of seizure, but suffers from mild anxiety. Myself or one of the associates was with him for approximately 45 minutes just to make sure he was ok. His blood pressure was taken (twice) and water was given. His BP readings were normal. Patient was on his way. Moderna series completed.

Loss of vision lasted for 1 minute.  Loss of vision occurred while standing.  Referral to primary care and ophthalmology specialist found normal eye exam and MRI of orbits but  presence of tachycardia especially while standing (fluctuations between 60 beats at rest/laying down to 130 beats per minute standing).   Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS)  is suspected.  Currently pursuing cardiac workup with cardiologist and Covid POTS specialist.  POTS specialist believes autoantibody development after vaccination could be suspected as recovering covid patients similarly present to clinic with POTS like symptoms.

Treatment: Took the day after the shot off of work and slept a LOT (approx 18 hours on and off), stayed hydrated and fed. Did not take painkillers due to hearing it would interfere with vaccine uptake. Most symptoms except for headache had gone away by 30-hour mark. Only some lingering fatigue and achiness left over past 36-hour mark.

I took medication for the pain but the symptoms were lessened not for much, I remained in bed until 2:30 PM on Sunday 7th. I am still weakened, fatigued and with a slight shortness of breath, I am assuming by tomorrow I will be feeling better. No regrets whatsoever.

                                                I received the 2nd vaccine at 1:30pm, by 8:30pm I was extremely fatigued and went to bed early. I woke up in the middle of the night (around 12:00AM) with terrible night sweats, chills, a fever of 101, a terrible headache (completely different from my migraines) and my arm was extremely sore and painful. I tried to avoid taking any medication as I heard that it could decrease the efficacy of the vaccine, but it became unbearable so I took ibuprofen around 3:00am. My symptoms lasted throughout the next day, the fever subsided after the first dose of ibuprofen however I still had chills and the headache. The chills finally subsided around 3:00pm and the headache did not subside until I woke up Friday (2/5/21) morning around 6:00am which was roughly 42 hours after my second dose was administered.

                                                One day after my first COVID19 vaccine, I experienced chills, headache, and myalgia when I woke up that day. I took two 500mg tablets of extra strength Acetaminophen to reduce the severity of my symptoms. And two more tablets six hours later to prevent further symptom severity. When I received my second dose one month later, began experiencing the same symptoms as before. But at 10:00pm of that day. And I experienced pain and discomfort at the injection sight. These symptoms were again reduced by appropriate doses and intervals of Acetaminophen. These general symptoms and injection site symptoms continued for one more day.

His pupils got large and he then passed out. Code white was called, 911 was called, we got an ice pack and placed on his chest and a cold rag on his head. After about 10 seconds, he regained alertness. EMT arrived and accessed the patient. His blood pressure was normal and pulse was normal. He was given a cold drink and sat in the chair until he felt better.

                                                The first night after the shot I was irritable and achy, woke up fatigued. By 5 pm the day after I had stomach/abdominal pain aches, nausea and fatigue. The fever started at 100. That night I woke up at least once an hour from the pain. I had to throw up. The next day I woke up drenched in sweat and with the chills and a fever of 101.5, I think. And then the joint pain started. Especially in my knees. I applied icee hot and drank some pepto. And only ate a few crackers to have something in my body, tried to drink a lot of electrolytes. By Sunday night I woke up every hour from joint pain, especially my knees and lower back. I woke up in the middle of the night shivering and unable to get warm. I took a warm shower, and had to sit on the ground and just let the warm water run. My knees were in so much pain I couldn?t stand. Monday morning I woke up with a fever of 100 but tolerable joint and stomach pain. By Monday afternoon my fever had gone down, but still has abdominal pain, headache and mild joint pain.  I Was able to eat dinner chicken soup. Then Tuesday woke up fatigued and mild to low abdominal and now muscle pain.

These began around 1AM approximately 9 hours after vaccination.  Side effects most strongly felt within 36 hours of receiving vaccination.  Continued fatigue, chills, night sweats and muscle pain for two additional days (Thursday 3/11, Friday 3/12) that gradually subsided over those days. Appeared to be a slight rash around the injection site for several days after. I previously had the COVID-19 virus in late March 2020.

Starting on March 19th, I experienced mild shortness of breath for 3 days.  I checked my O2 sat throughout those 3 days and never dropped below 98%.  My wife experienced the same shortness of breath for the same period of time with a low of 97% on her O2 sat.  She received a Covid test on the last day of her symptoms and received a negative result.  Now, on March 25th I have developed a red, circular rash at the injection site (upper portion of left arm).  It is itchy, warm, and has a firm feel, roughly 2.5 inches in diameter with a slight, inward, crescent-shaped curve of the red patch on one side.

One week later (Thursday, 3/18/21), sore arm and slight muscle/joint pain came back and has subsided. Friday evening I experienced left jaw and ear pain and has subsided. Saturday morning, small bumps/rash appeared on left forearm (vaccine in left shoulder). Saturday evening, same thing on right forearm. Bumps/rash are similar to blisters and some have pustules. Itchy and painful. Took Benadryl. Sunday morning, more on hands, feet, and ankles. Continued Benadryl and monitoring. Sunday evening, increased density of sites on hands, feet, and ankles. Some showing on lower legs and knees. Monday morning (now), itchiness and pain increased. Increased Benadryl intake. This has helped reduce itchiness slightly. Sites are still painful. Hands feel slightly swollen/tight where sites are.

My girlfriend was treating me during the event helping me taking my shirt off because i got desperate from the heat and cold at the same time i drenched my side of the bed and speaking incoherently at times, i asked my girlfriend to bring me my phone in case &#34;i needed to call 911&#34; but in the process i fell asleep while my girlfriend was watching me until 6:00am i finally slept, since that day i have been feeling better but not 100% i still have some sort of muscle spasms in ramdom areas of my body but more on my left upper arm

                                                AT 4:15am 1/4/2021 I was either dreaming or actually  massaging my left trapezius muscle which I was doing because it hurt and the pain was severe 9/10. Thinking it was because I was lying on my side, I sought to move onto my back. My wife was awake during the whole event.  Upon moving over to  my back I very quickly felt my legs jerking uncontrollably and could not open my mouth. This sensation last for about 10 seconds at which point my legs stopped jerking , and I was able to open my mouth. I felt a sudden rush of warmth, proceeded to throw off the covers, and was then followed not too soon after by intense chills and feeling cold.  Immediately after coming to, I noticed I felt nauseated which after a few minutes began to subside.  My wife mentioned she tried to gently rouse me but I was unresponsive by  touching and calling my name. After 5 seconds of jerking of the legs, she mentioned it sounded like I was trying to gasp for air but could not seem to get air in. This continued for another 5 seconds with the leg jerking. The episode ended as mentioned above.

                                                At 3 AM, 12 hours following the vaccine administration, I awoke with severe fever/chills, body aches and severe headache, which progressed to nausea and vomiting x 3 episodes and was very sick for one day, home bound and could not work.  This reaction was due to I believe the fact I had positive antibodies from a positive infection 8 months prior.  I had laboratory evidence of a positive serum antibody titer following the infection.  Was this vaccine studied in regards to patients who received the vaccine? because I believe it needs further study before it is given to patients who have already developed immunity from acquiring the actual COVID disease.

Rather moderate joint soreness, Chills, body aches, slight fever.It all started the night of the vaccine with the soreness at the injection site (1/5/21). Then the next morning I was riding in my car (1/6/21 around 9:45am) and a weird virtigo feeling settled in. After that was when the chills started with the body aches. I checked my temperature before I went in to the shower and it was running 99.7. Then when I was showering I had that uncomfortable feeling when the water hits you right before you get sick. Kind of a werid feeling to describe if you&#39;ve never experienced it before. I have just been monitoring my symptoms and staying home, and hydrating.

I started Experiencing the listed side effects from the morning of January 8th, 2021 to the morning of January 9th, 2021. It started with light muscle and joint pain at 8am and progressed to sever muscle and joint pain, chills, nausea, fatigue, headaches and eventually a fever averaging at 100 degrees Fahrenheit by 1-2PM the same day. These side effects were enough to leave me bedridden for most of the 8th. most side effects were gone by the morning of the 9th, the fever eventually broke by 930Am on the 9th.

                                                Symptoms emerged around 7pm(1/27): body stiffness/aches, headache, warmness in body. Gradually throughout night, I was feeling worse body warmness, mild nausea, worst bodystiffness/aches. I checked my temperature at 1200am 1/28 and it was 101.5 and my pulse was elevated and I felt a sense of warmness/flush feeling in my body and had tachycardia-palpitations and pounding headache/body aches and nausea sensation. At that point, I decided to go the ER. I contacted my work. I work at  Center and contacted a nurse on call who emailed my supervisor. I went to Hospital  around 1245 AM and was seen by an ER Doc around 1am. In triage in the ER area, I had an elevated blood pressure(151/92) and pulse(158), my body temperature was 99.5. The ER doc said the vaccine itself caused the issues I was experiencing and he said he had similiar issues. He ordered IV of medications Zofran and Toradol to address the mild nausea and fever and pain I was experiencing . I was given an IV of sodium chloride as well.  By 3am, I felt some slight improvement from the time I arrived at the ER department

My right arm, where the shot was, was painful all day. I felt really weak all day. I pretty much slept all day and all night (2/4) on 2/5, I was feeling a lot better, no fever, but still felt weak. pretty much relaxed all day and slept. the next 2 days I just took it easy and relaxed. Didn&#39;t take any medications during this.

                                                During the first day after taking vaccine, started having a fever, headache, and sore throat. By the evening, fever was severe and 102&#43;, with severe headache and sore throat. After sleeping on that nigh (had disruption of sleep from 2 - 4 in the morning), it was looking normal., just had usual fatigue after a fever. But on Thursday (Took vaccine on Tuesday morning, March 02, 2021), I suddenly started having a seizure, my whole body was shaking, legs were cramping. I thought it was going to go away, but after 10 minutes it was getting worse and I had to call the emergency services. The fire service members first came, they measured my blood oxygen level, it was 98%, but my blood pressure was high (140). I was still shaking and having the seizure. They tried to calm me down by talking, after some time, my blood pressure came to normal and I started getting normal (no seizure at that point). I declined the ambulance service as it is expensive and I was getting normal. I had a 101 fever just after that and went to visit the health care facilities .

When I came to about 10 seconds later, there was a public health official there rubbing my chest asking me if I knew where I was.  It took me a second to fully come to my senses but then I realized where I was and what had happened.  I was very pale, felt chills, was sweating, and it took effort to open my hands.  The EMTs ran a bunch of tests, my Blood pressure was low (I think the number I remember was 104/33), but the rest of the measurements like blood sugar or the number of ekg like tests they did all came back normal.  The EMTs in the field said they think it was a response to the vaccine.  After about 20 minutes of the EMTs monitoring me, my numbers came back up and I was feeling relatively normal.  I waited another 30 minutes before leaving just to make sure.  It has been almost a week and I haven&#39;t felt any symptoms close to that since then.

Patient was given a cold cloth around the back of his neck and his blood pressure was taken and it was 82/58.  Patients O2 sat was 98 and pulse was 78. Patient stated that he was allergic to nuts. We asked if he had eaten breakfast this morning and he stated that he had a bowl of cereal. I instructed for someone to have him sit on the ground and to get him some candy  and a sugary drink.  A package of skittles was presented along with a Mountain Dew.  After finishing both the candy and Mountain Dew  (aprox 4 mins) the patient started to get a little color back and he stated he was feeling much better.  A second set of vitals was then taken which were  BP: 106/78 the O2 sat 98 and Heart rate was again at 78.  We instructed the patient to please hang around for 30 more minutes and after that time left with the person he was with.

                                                This patient felt fine with the injection and for the 15 min following. He was dismissed to check out and make a follow up appt. While waiting in line to make his appt, he stated to his mother (who had given him a ride and stayed with him) that he felt faint. His mother shouted to staff nearby that he was going to pass out, so a staff person grabbed a chair for him. He sat in the chair, but did not fully lose consciousness. I ran to him with , told someone to get an ice pack, and asked his mother to sit in a chair next to him and place her hand on his right arm. I checked his bp at this time and it was 58/30. He was shaking all over, diaphoretic, pale,  and his muscles were weak.  He asked for water, so one was given to him, and he promptly drank the whole 16 oz bottle.  Over approximately 5 min, he came back to his normal LOC, stopped shaking and sweating, and stated that he was feeling better.  He was given a small bag of crackers and another bottle of water, which he quickly consumed before standing up. At this point, he stated that he was feeling hung over after staying out late the evening before drinking and celebrating St. Patrick&#39;s Day. Instructed him to make sure he is well hydrated before he comes for his second dose vaccination.

I suffered chills the prior night and decided to file this report to help add to the information available.

                                                syncopal episode- 1:33 pm individual fell head-first off from chair in observation area and hit her head. I was called over by the observation person that someone needed attention right away. I ran over the individual was lying on the floor and her husband was sitting on a chair right next to her. He said she fainted and fell forward. The individual appeared to be unconscious when I arrived and was very diaphoretic. I loudly asked if she was okay and then tapped her chest. She looked up at me and said ?oh snap.? She was oriented to person and place and her pupils were equal, round, and reactive. She denied that she had any tingling in her arms or legs. She said she heard everyone talking to her, but thought she was dreaming. She said that she has a history of passing out with finger-pricks (she cannot donate blood anymore because of this), shots, and she passed out when she got a piercing in the past. She said she felt her HR slowly starting to climb, but she felt she would be okay. She said she then started feeling lightheaded and passed out. I took HR BP at  1:35 128/74, 62 and again 5 minutes later 128/80, 62. Individual was given an ice pack for her head. She had a bump on the upper right side of forehead. She said she had not eaten or drank much before her shot. She said her stomach was a little upset. She was given water and granola bars and sat up for a while before standing up. She asked if I thought she should get her head checked out. I said it is never a bad idea to get checked and since she did hit her head hard enough for a bump to happen right away. Individual was feeling better before she left, stating just her head hurt. We told her to ice and ibuprofen or Tylenol to treat discomfort.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient  is a 29 y.o.  with a history that includes # Asthma # Diabetes, recently diagnosed # Obstructive sleep apnea # Remote pulmonary embolism, no longer on anticoagulation who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of known COVID-19, since admitted to Hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -&gt; 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.

He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                I&#39;ve prior had mild adverse reactions to flu shots where I&#39;d feel slightly ill for a day or so afterwards, but no significant responses to question the initial COVID vaccine. About 3 weeks from receiving the vaccine, I started to develop an intense pain along my left chest/back/and posteriomedial arm which was clinically dx&#39;d as Shingles by my physician. I have physical pictures to detail the areas of effect, but the symptoms remain as significant arm/chest pain with paresthesia along my scapula. Mild nausea and chills are also episodic. Having never exhibited these symptoms and the upcoming date for my second dose (1/27) I&#39;m concerned if this is a trigged immune response which could worsen or prolong with a second dose.

                                                On the night of the 20th, I experienced a mild headache and minor left arm soreness. I went to bed at 9:30pm and woke up at 2:00am unable to move my left arm due to severe pain, a pounding headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and minor nasal congestion. I couldn&#39;t go back to sleep the remainder of the night due to the pain. All symptoms persisted the morning and afternoon of the 21st as well. The severe arm pain subsided but I still struggled to lift my arm past 90 degrees without intense pain. I went to bed on the 21st unable to rest on my left shoulder due to the pain and woke up the 22nd with most symptoms gone except for a minor headache and moderate soreness in the left arm.

Alternating between chills and being overheated on and off all night, while headache became worse. Had to take ibuprofen at 7:30 AM after not being able to sleep, and was able to sleep. Woke up at 1 PM and had to take another ibuprofen for the headache. Chills were gone, but was overheated and sweating for an hour or two. Had to take another ibuprofen at night, but headache wasn&#39;t too much worse. Headaches were gone upon waking up at 9 AM on Sunday.  Experienced lymph node swelling in armpit of arm that got the vaccination. Tried to do pushups, but became too painful. I had also experienced the lymph node swelling after my first vaccination 28 days before my second one. About a week after, and they always felt minorly swollen up until the time of my second vaccination. I didn&#39;t know they were caused by the vaccine until after the second vaccination.  Currently 1:20 AM on Monday, and I have been experiencing redness and itching in a large patch around the vaccination site all day.

I woke up around 2:00 am and I had a high fever and I was having trouble breathing. My fingertips had turned blue. My oxygen level was about 92%. I took ibuprofen and that brought the fever back down. I had body aches the next day. My cough had gotten worse (that I had at time of vaccination).  I went to Urgent Care on January 6, 2021.  They did the COVID test that day. I had a sinus infection - antibiotics were prescribed.  It took about two weeks for symptoms to resolve.

Next day I was in bed all day the next day because of the severe body aches. Cough got worse for the next few days or so after that.  I had some shortness of breath because of the coughing. Migraines started - strong headaches. The first one was the morning after the vaccine. During the next day (third day after vaccine) I had another migraine.  Symptoms were acute for three days.

                                                30 yo man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED for chest pressure and SOB that started this morning when he woke up. It was a constant 8/10 pressure squeezing at the sides of his sternum with the sensation of a plate pushing down on his sternum, that worsened by taking deep breaths. He had never experienced anything like it before. The pain was neither worsened with exertion nor relieved by rest. It did not change with position, and it did not radiate to his arm/neck. He denies any tenderness to palpation of his chest. Ibuprofen 400 mg did not provide any relief. At time of interview denies SOB and reports decrease in chest tightness to 2/10. CP was significantly relieved with a bolus of normal saline in the ED. Tylenol also effectively reduced his pain. Of note, the patient received the second Moderna COVID vaccine shot 3 days ago. For 2 days after receiving the second shot he experienced fevers, chills, nausea, and intermittent vomiting (10 bouts of non-bloody emesis).

First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

Felt body aches and slight chills (temperature always below 98.6 though).   Began 50mg oral prednisone on 3/6. On 3/7, rash worsened and an urgent care facility gave me a 10mg shot of dexamethesone which helped immediately.   Dermatologist recommended antihistamine course beginning 3/9.

He was brought immediately to exam room where he became pale, diaphoretic, and stated he &#34;felt like he was in a dream.&#34; Seated BP was 74/palp. He was placed in supine position on exam table, cool compresses placed on forehead and back of neck. He complained of some nausea, which quickly improved. He never lost consciousness. His color and alertness improved steadily over the next 10 minutes. Repeat BP (lying) was 100/50. After a few minutes he sat up on exam table, dangling legs. BP remained stable at 110/60, HR 84. He continued to improve and stated that he felt better, drank some water and ate some goldfish crackers. Reported that he just remembered he had not eaten since lunch. After another 5-10 minutes he was alert, oriented, able to walk unassisted. Final BP 114/70, HR 80. His wife remained with him and confirmed she could drive him home. Discussed that although I feel confident this was a vasovagal near-syncope, if symptoms recur or worsen, he should go to ER for evaluation. Understanding verbalized.

                                                After I was administered the shot. I was directed to a space designated for observation for patients after they receive the  vaccine. Within the first five minutes after I received my vaccine my mouth filled with an intense taste of metal and some numbness.  My body became very hot and almost heavy as I tried to stabilize myself to get help from the nurse. I was ushered to an area to lie down as I was going to faint. I was sweating profusely and about three minutes after laying there  the room turned cold and it felt such relief from the heat and sweating I felt such a short few minutes before. Both my hands became tingly and filled with the sensation of pins and needles. That symptom did not go away until about 15-20 mins later.  As I felt a little more strength and cooled body. I was able to sit up again. Not even five minutes later the heat and sweating came upon me again but this time for a shorter episode.  A light pins and needle feeling came about in my chest and tightness in the back of my neck.  I stayed in the observation room for one hour until the cycle of symptoms became more stabilized. The nurse was very confused by my symptom of metal taste in my mouth. One other patient had mentioned that but never got sick like I did.

                                                Approximately 6 hours and 30 minutes after vaccination, patient became slightly dizzy and nauseous, and went to bed. The morning after, the patient had body aches and a headache, and took 500mg of acetaminophen at approximately 5am.  The patient also noticed swelling at the injection site (raised and approx 5 inches in diameter) and itching at this time as well. The patient took another 500mg of acetaminophen at 2pm, 200mg of ibuprofen at 3pm, and complained of a sensation of hypersensitivity and mild &#34;burning&#34; across the skin. These symptoms subsided by about 5pm, and patient felt well enough to stand up and have a small meal before returning to bed. At that point (~5pm), they developed a low fever (temp fluctuated between 99.5-100.6F), and took 400mg of ibuprofen and another 500mg of acetaminophen, and their temperature reduced to 98.6 at approximately 8PM. Afterwards, the patient had fatigue and some aches, and the swollen arm has not subsided at the time of report entry (~42 hours after vaccination).

Patient was then sat down again and given water. He stayed there another 30 minuets to make sure he felt ok. After that he felt fine. He said he has a fear of needles and that this was normal for him.

                                                I for my 2nd shot on may 5th 2021 at 5pm. By 1130pm I developed a headache and pushing on my left side neck on the back side (same side I got my shot also) by 1130pm. It turned into a migraine. I took Imitrex 100mg and fell asleep and it went away. At the exact same time last night on 5/6 around 110pm a headache started caused by the same muscle ache on my left back neck. I can push on one spot and the headache gets much worse. I took 50mg Imitrex an hour ago. It&#39;s bow 457am 5/7 and the headache went right away. I&#39;m now having hot flashes and had to take my shirt off. Not sure if it&#39;s the medication or both. This is unusual for me to feel hot when it&#39;s 58F outside and 71F inside. That means something unusual is giving me headache/migraine/muscle pain in neck/hot flashes. My Imitrex never causes hot flashes. Thank you. P. S the first shot had no reaction other then soar arm. Which I have now also.

                                                Chills; Fever; Loss of consciousness x 2; GI upset; Diarrhea; Difficulty sleeping; Pallor; Stomach flu; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse concerning a 31-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever.   The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergy to cefaclor and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Concomitant medications reported included desvenlafaxine succinate, gabapentin and dexlansoprazole.   On 23 Dec 2020 at 11:30 am, approximately six hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the morning of 23 Dec 2020, prior to receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt &#34;achy&#34;.  At 5:30 pm, the patient experienced chills, fever to 102, GI upset and diarrhea. At 11:00 pm, the patient reported difficulty sleeping, GI upset, LOC x 2 and pallor. The patient was transported to the emergency room via ambulance.  A COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction test and routine labs were collected; however, results were not provided. Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

He notes he was not until approximately 1.75 hours after vaccination that he began to develop a runny nose and aching primarily in his arm.  He felt this might be normal but then soon after developed a hot itchy tight feeling in his throat with ongoing rhinorrhea, mild tightness in breathing and soreness in his left arm. He has had similar reactions with Remicade in the past and they became severe and that is why he is no longer using Remicade.

The area around my ear remained 98.7*F. As it progressed I developed minor amounts of blotchy red areas along the hairline on the left side of my face only. Nothing occured on the right side of my body. Diarrhea developed with multiple episodes. All of this lasted approx. 3 hours before subsiding without treatment. I have had significant amount of vaccines and immunizations from the civilian and military sectors and never suffered this before.

I haven?t been able to sleep since then and my fever has spiked as high as 104.5. I?m also experiencing headache, ear aches, mild sore throat, nausea, and chest tightness/pain during deep breathing. No shortness of breath symptoms though. Aleve and Tylenol do not appear to be helping. I feel worse than when I had Covid back in November.

I have not had covid and have not been sick since pandemic started. The following morning I woke up with a fever of 101 and extreme arm pain. As the morning progressed, I continued to have increasing fever even after taking Tylenol 500mg every 4-6 hours. My fever peaked at 104.7 by 3pm on 1/20, then started to come down after taking 400mg of ibuprofen. By 9pm on 1/20, my fever started to spike again and then I took more inbuprofen. As of 1/21, I am still having symptoms of being unwell and nausea, as well as low grade fever of 101. I do not have any covid symptoms (no cough, no loss of taste).

Saturdays diarrhea slowed down - and I went to ER - muscles were pushing - I felt my electrolytes were out of whack. I02 degree fever so they gave me Tylenol. They gave me two bags of fluids. My heartrate was in mid 120s when I went in and after fluids it went down to the 70&#39;s. I was discharged after that. I was swabbed for COVID - negative. Sunday I was still lethargic and fatigue; diarrhea slowed down quite a bit and I was able to eat some food. Monday I came back to work - not 100% in health but felt better.

                                                I received it at 10am and around 2am that night I started to have a bad headache and body aches. I would fall asleep for a bit but then at 4am I woke up with the worst headache of my life. It was so unbearable that I would clinch my eyes shut. Bones and muscle pains all over. Violent hot/cold flashes. I would feel hot all over and after a minute or so of placing a cold pack on my head I began to shiver despite sweating. Around 5am I was looking at my phone wondering if I should go to the ER because I legitimately felt like I was in danger.  The unbearable headache lasted a total of 14 hours from its onset. No OTC medications were taken.  Around 6pm on day 2 from the dose the intensity of the headache began to subside VERY slowly.  I woke up on day 3 completely fine as if nothing happened.

                                                I had vaccine on 1/10/2021. I did not have any symptom at the time of vaccination. I started feeling Fever with Chills on 1/15/21 evening and then I had headache, and next day I lost smell and taste. I thought these are all COVID symptoms and went for lab testing for SARS RT PCR testing on 1/18/ 21. The result was Detected. I am now feeling well. I went for another testing again for the same test and waiting for the result. Now my question is I have second dose scheduled at 2/7/2021. What if my second lab result comes Negative and What if my second lab result comes Positive? I want to know if i need to take a shot or not? I was isolated in my room at home for all these days and still isolated until I get my result.

He reported sudden sense of nausea, tunnel vision, headache and light sensitivity. He returned to the clinic shortly after leaving due to his condition. We had him rest in one of the outpatient rooms while monitoring his vitals, was also given an instant ice pack for his head. The pt. was prescribed Banophen (anti-histamine), Ondansetron for nausea and Ibuprofen 800mg for pain relief. He was given 6 TAB of both the Ondansetron and Ibuprofen but took 1 tablet of each of the 3 medications after coming into the exam room. Our patient relaxed in the room and was closely monitored for 45mins.-1hr. following coming back. Pt. began feeling better about 30mins. into his stay where he waited another 20-30mins. to ensure symptoms resided and he felt better. He was free to leave once better. Instructions were to contact our clinic or return if the headache or nausea returned or if his symptoms worsened.

I woke up around the10 am  the 25th.the next day. I had a migraine that wouldn&#39;t go away. I was feeling nauseous and still had a light sensitive headache. I took Migraine medication, and eventually mid afternoon the symptoms went away. Less than 24 hours later I was back to normal. March 4th I was using Gold Bond Ultimate Mens lotion and had an adverse reaction. My hand swelled up, and got red.  I took Benadryl and it went away. March 5th I used Curel lotion and the same thing happened. Did not take Benadryl.

                                                Patient received vaccine and was fine until after a few minutes.  He started to say he felt lightheaded.  He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

A single small ulcerative lesion appeared in the upper soft palate of my mouth so I went to a walk in clinic and had a strep done which was negative. D/t the ulcers appearing in my mouth I had and HIV test done which also came back negative. I had a small low grade fever and muscle aches also associated but the lesion in my mouth is what caused the major concern which slowly resolved over the next few weeks.

                                                Within five minutes of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine,  I started to feel slight pain in the injection site (my arm) reminiscent of a bruise. An hour later, I started to feel tired and weak, and the soreness in my arm worsened slightly. The pain on a scale of 1-10 was a 3.  45 minutes later, I experienced stiffness in my neck and upper back, though that isn&#39;t unusual for me. I also started to feel nauseous and cold at that time, but the nausea subsided within an hour.  The severity of these symptoms stayed the same the rest of the evening. I went to bed at midnight, and woke the next morning at 8am. My arm where I had received the shot felt much more sore and painful, especially when I move it, and mainly when any pressure is applied to the area. I was woken by pain in my arm when I payed on that side of my body. The pain is now a 4, but a 7 when pressure is applied. It is now 12:30 pm.

                                                On the day of the vaccination, my arm hurt pretty badly. It lasted about 3 days. I pretty much had the same symptoms as the first dose: chills, body aches. headache, pain at the injection site, fatigue. It lasted for about 3-4 days. Now, I stared with bloody stools with my first dose and it never really resolved before I got the second dose. I noticed it increased the frequency, made it a little worse after the second dose. They were not so frequent anymore. I still have blood in my stool at least 2 times a week.

I also noticed the texture was a little harder and every time I went to the bathroom and had a bowel movement I had blood in my stool. I went to the walk in clinic and they did some blood work). I did not find any help and consulted with a GI doctor, (more than once) and I still to this date have blood in my stool (not as often as before but still happens).

He reported no swelling, so I gave him a 25mg of benadryl and took his BP, which was 142/92. He did not eat breakfast so I got him some crackers and water and watched him. I recommended he call his doctor, he did and they told him to go to ER so I offered to call a squad and he declined. He did not want to go to ER, but wanted to get seen at urgent care. I walked him down to urgent care since the numbness had not improved. He came back to the pharmacy a few hours later and reported that when the benadryl kicked in the numbness subsided and he feels just fine now. He is going to follow up with his primary care doctor tomorrow.

                                                The following day I became increasingly fatigued, roughly 30 hours later I took a 2 hour nap. I awoke and had dinner, about 5 minutes after finishing my heartbeat felt &#39;regularly irregular&#39; and was 55 bpm, which is normal for me at rest. I became nauseous, dizzy, full-body tingling, laid on the floor near the toilet for about 20 minutes. My wife reported my lips became purple and I was pale.  I assumed it was hypotension (vasovagal?) of some kind as I&#39;ve had this happen after blood draws in the past. I drank a bunch of water to get my blood pressure up and smelled peppermint oil to decrease nausea. I was okay thereafter, but I slept around 13 hours that night.

                                                I barely felt the shot and had plenty of energy all day, but by evening there was local pain/tenderness where the shot had been administered. The next day, I experienced severe fatigue and my temperature  was over 99*. My arm was still tender and I also had a lot of nausea. Last night after work, I took two aspirin and slept 10 hours and now I feel much better with some energy.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna on January 19, 2021. 48 hours later upon waking from sleep patient had myalgias, arthralgia in all distributions, and  a frontal headache. Patient was instructed to rest and increase fluid intake and Ibuprofen as this was likely a known adverse reaction to COVID vaccination. At 72hrs from vaccination patient began to have fevers Tmax 101.9 orally. Continued rest, hydration and ibuprofen, started Tylenol. At 96hrs from vaccination patient began to have a dry cough, diarrhea, severe fatigue and inspiratory chest pain. Patients myalgias and arthralgias continued, and Tmax increased to 104.5 orally. At this time bedside ECHO, iSTAT chemistry, COVID antigen, COVID antibody and COVID PCR, Rapid Flu, and Viral Respiratory Panel were obtained. Administered 1.5 liters of lactated ringers, Toradol 15mg and Tylenol 975mg  and patient was isolated.  EKG, troponin and Chest Xray were obtained 12 hours later (108 hours from vaccination) at which time the patient reported improvement  by 95%. Patient was afebrile and chest pain free. Only symptom at that time was fatigue. After  another 12 hours of rest/sleep (hour 120 post vaccination)  patient reports no symptoms and 100% well.  See below for lab/rad/test details.

Felt instant dizziness, fatigue, headache, and ear ringing when I stood up. Felt hot at first, then chilled, and continued to switch between hot and cold. These symptoms lasted for about 5 hours with varying levels of severity. My temperature high was 98.3 F according to the infrared forehead thermometer I used throughout the duration of symptoms.

Blood test showed that I am suddenly highly allergic to 19 different food groups. I have no known food allergies prior to C19 Moderna Vaccine. I have had hives every single day since they 1st appeared (3.5 days after vaccine). I have had multiple days of facial swelling as well and have been to the hospital multiple times. To this date (date of this report) I still have hives and facial swelling. Facial swelling is intermittent. I have stayed away from the list of foods that I am apparently suddenly allergic to and I still have hives and swelling. I occasionally have a irritated throat which makes it difficult to breathe in. I have a specialist appointment with an allergy/immunology doctor this coming Thursday to see what thier diagnosis is. My family doctor believes my potential angioedema diagnosis is directly related to my 1st dose of C19 Moderna Vaccine.

                                                Received 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 12/29/20. Besides general left arm soreness for 2-3 days following vaccine, I had no other symptoms until Sunday January 3rd, at which time I began to notice increased fatigue, chills, and mild cough. Symptoms did not subside by Monday morning, January 4th, and I called in sick to work and requested that I receive a Covid 19 test from an urgent care. I tested positive for Covid 19 that day, and remained off work until 1/14/21. I experienced moderate chills, moderate increased skin sensitivity, and significant fatigue from 1/3/21 to 1/8/21, sleeping ~16-20 hours per day every day during that time. I began feeling better 1/9/21 and symptoms gradually improved until I was symptom-free on 1/12/21. I returned to work on 1/14/21, &gt;10 days following initial symptoms.

Towards the end of the day I felt tired, however not sure if that was from the vaccine or because I did not sleep well. Tylenol reduced symptoms and they did not greatly interfere with my day.  The following morning all side effects were gone and I was back to completely normal.

Otherwise, only other noticeable s/s were or body soreness and a lingering headache.

I had a sharp and persistent headache that lasted most of the night. I felt a little pain in my chest, and even when I took deep breaths it never felt like I had enough air. I&#39;m wondering in the breathing difficulties might have been due to heartburn/indigestion. I had to stop taking my heartburn medicine because it&#39;s not good for my kidneys (I also have kidney disease). On rare occasions I have had symptoms from heartburn that feel almost like asthma. The fever-symptoms and chills subsided a few hours later after I took a Tylenol, but I continue to feel fatigued and I have a bad headache.

                                                Things were normal for about 6 hours, I started feeling very fatigued. It started with a low fever around 100.5 and I was a little achy. The next day I was about 25% worse. Overall, I felt badly for about 2 1/2 hours. After about a week I felt fine, but the symptoms came back. I was tested again for COVID and the flu. Both were negative and I was instructed to just rest for 10 days and work from home. Experienced the same with 2nd dose, but twice as bad. Did not see a doctor in person.

                                                My vision became burry and I was unable to see what I was looking directly at- similar to if I had been looking directly at a bright light source for several seconds- This lasted for approximately 5 minutes. After 5 minutes this went away, but my left-most vision (extreme left of my field of view) began getting blurry and having the kaleidoscope effect- This lasted for approximately 15 minutes, and then subsided. Since these two vision anomalies, I have intermittently had a dull ache in my right hemisphere of my head. This ache will just come in a flash for a second or two, and then won&#39;t happen again for hours.

                                                On 3/28, I began experience light-headedness, chills, aches, headache, brain fog, and fatigue.  The symptoms felt just like past instances of the flu I&#39;ve had.  Given this, I didn&#39;t go to work on 3/29, and instead went to get a covid test.  On 3/29, I also started to get consistent pain in emanating from the lymph node in my right arm, the same arm I received the vaccine in on 3/22.  The actual vaccine site no longer has any tenderness, and it was never painful after the shot.  I had no symptoms at all between 3/22 and 3/28.  The lymph node under my right arm is visibly swollen as well.  On 3/30, I was given the results of my covid test from 3/29, which was &#34;covid-19 not present.&#34;

Also lost my appetite and had a &#34;sour&#34; stomach. Not nauseus, but in the bathroom consistently throughout the day. These symptoms continued until 2 PM when the fever broke. Body aches lessened by 3 PM. Headache discomfort peaked around this time though. Worst headache I&#39;ve had in as long as I can remember. Sour stomach was resolved by 8 PM and I ate a small meal. By 1030 PM, the only symptoms I&#39;m dealing with now are a moderate headache and fatigue.

                                                Felt a bit odd on the couch, little shiver and what felt like adrenaline. I got up and went into the bathroom where the incident occurred. I used to be on 10mg of Ramipril years ago and moved to 5 due to light headedness when standing up. Yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly. Getting up too fast with heart pressure meds prescribed for albumin /T1D and not for heart pressure. The secondary use of Ramipril is normal for type 1 diabetes after 20&#43; years. So I went to 5mg and haven?t had that issue since. I should also mention that when this used to happen to me I would lay down and recover with no problem.  Back to the incident it felt exactly like that but on steroids. I was in the bathroom looking for Tylenol and I got light headed, yellow tinted vision, bright and sparkly, ringing in the ears, dizzy, and confused. I remember thinking I should probably get down on the tile floor and lay down like I?m used to from the episodes years ago with 10mg Ramipril causing the same symptoms but never anything so extreme. Next thing I know I?m on the ground waking up where I fainted and hit my head pretty hard on the way down. I probably have a minor concussion. Iced my head in the back where I hit it last night and this morning. Surprisingly 0 bumps, etc other than a little bit sore.  Trying to remember going down is impossible. There is a strange, I guess it?s not strange as I fainted, but to me being 1 moment thinking what I should do then the next moment still thinking that same exact thing but coming to on the bathroom floor with parents yelling over top of me as I was at their house is strange. I recall what almost felt like a dream while I was out but I was wondering why everyone was asking if I was ok, of course I?m ok I thought. Then I realized what happened and crawled around on the floor the rest of the night if I needed anything and was checked every hour through the night which was horrible but necessary.  Also my blood glucose was a 220 at the time of the incident according to my CGM so it didn?t have to do with low blood sugar.  In any case I feel better today but in a fog with a slight headache.

Patient stated that he has gotten flu shots in the past. Immediately after administering the vaccine, patient stopped responding, his eyes bulged, and his arms tensed and both arms went up to his chest. I was calling his name and asking if he was doing okay, he kept staring straight ahead and wasn&#39;t responding. Patient eventually came to after a minute. Measured blood pressure twice &amp;, average ~90/55. Offered patient ambulance, patient declined.

                                                Patient symptoms of chills, headache, and body aches began on Sunday 3/28, 6 days after vaccination.   One day later, on 3/29, patient started experiencing pain in the right armpit, the same shoulder where the vaccine was received.  That pain built up until Wednesday 3/31, when the arm was very swollen, purple, and rapidly loosing sensation.  The patient went to the ER.  In the ER, via ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of the right subclavian and axillary veins.  From 4/1 to 4/2 the patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure, thrombo lysis, using tPA directed by catheter to the site of the 12 cm long clot.  On 4/2, it was determined that the flow was not restored to the vein, and the radiologist informed the patient that right first rib removal would be necessary.  On 4/9, right first rib resection surgery was performed to alleviate pressure on the subclavian vein.  Patient is currently recovering on the blood thinner Eliquis.  Additional procedures for thrombo ectomy and angioplasty will follow in approximately two weeks to clear the subclavian and axillary veins.

                                                Pt. was very sick the day after the shot, then Friday morning his heart was going into atrial fibrillation and jumping between 110 heart rate and 160&#43;. He was out golfing when he noticed this. He rested later that day but was extremely tired and felt sick. Saturday morning (2.5 days after vaccine) he needed to go to the emergency room because his heart rate was back over 160. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia and gave him a message for it but it made it worse and the rate was over 200. They had to stop and start his heart then put on beta blocker which brought it to 180, then another beta blocker brought to 150. Following EKGs showed atrial fibrillation, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and super ventricular tachycardia. Pt. had this about a year ago but was fine after a few days. This was the first time he was hospitalized for it and is now on daily medications. He fears the Moderna vaccine triggered it and is very worried about the second dose.

Paramedics came and my pulse was From 100 - 170 changing rapidly, bp 150-175/x changing rapidly, symptoms would come and go about 8 times on way to hospital. In ER same thing then about 2 hrs go by and then all started again. Pulse remained at 90- 100bpm at least until 2am. (My resting hr is between 40 and 50, my normal bp is usually sub 120/80) I later realized my hands were swollen, mostly on my left side. Lingering symptoms include brain fog, tiredness, and headache. Maybe an exasperating issue was I had low potassium levels likely making symptoms worse - I worked out heavily early in the morning, probably had low intake of potassium that day and day before, and maybe slightly dehydrated from my workout - I do Functional lifting, run, and other types of exercise regularly.

At about 1030AM I had a very bad headache and was extremely nauseous for about 3 hours and felt like vomiting but did not vomit. This went away at about 1230pm and I felt my tongue get cold and a metallic taste which went away within the hour of onset. The nausea, headache, and metallic taste was gone at about 1-2pm on 1/11/21. I had a sore left arm on the injection site, which is to be expected and went away within 3 days. On 1/18/21 around 1pm, my arm started to feel itchy at the exact site of the injection from 1/11/21, and there is now (1/18/21) a red rash like appearance on that left arm where the Moderna covid vaccine was injected. Possible delayed local allergic reaction.

Thursday around noon most of symptoms resolved - 1st meal I could eat without throwing it back up. Worst of neck pain was Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.  Neck pain (from having injuries and being a physical therapist - I was use to pain but this pain was extraordinary).Thursday morning - my back pain was so severe I could hardly walk. It hurt too bad to stand up. Neck is still mildly irritated but it is resolving.. Mild fatigue and upset stomach today. Treated during the course of symptoms - Tylenol - 2 pills every six hours. Topical over the counter anesthetics and CBD lotion/essential. Took pepto Bismul and Imodium but that didn&#39;t help stomach discomfort. Mostly recovered, but a little lingering symptoms today still.

The next morning, 1/31, I noticed the area around the injection site was red, warm to the touch, and hurt when pressure was applied. The next morning, 2/1, the size of the red area increased slightly and it was still warm and hurt when pressure was applied. This afternoon, 2/1, I&#39;m noticing feeling warmer and sweating more than usual. I&#39;m not sure if that is related but I don&#39;t have another explanation for it.

                                                Within twenty-four hours I had a 102.7 degree temperature which lasted a day then gradually went away, I took Tylenol for the fever. For then next couple days just felt rundown. Then three days post vaccine I began having some chest discomfort and shortness of breath. That night around one thirteen the morning I went to Emergency Department. they took a ECG and drew labs. the ECG showed normal rhythm just a little elevated and my Blood pressure was elevated. Upon the attending physician getting my lab work back i was admitted for my triponin levels being elevated. I was taken for chest X-rays and a Cat Scan per their pulmonary embolism protocols. Both of which showed nothing.  The next day i had a Echocardiogram, and Cardiac Catheterization, and a Cardiac MRI.

                                                On 2/6/2021, beginning at around 6 p.m., I started experiencing a very severe headache. The headache became progressively worse between 6 p.m. and around 2 a.m. that night. It was one of the worst headaches I have ever experienced. The headache felt like &#34;pressure&#34; around my head - it was not concentrated in a single spot. It seemed to be slightly worse when lying down. I was alarmed at the strength of the headache, and how long the headache lasted. I considered going to the hospital but decided not to. I took two Advil, which did not resolve the headache, but did make it slightly less terrible. I was able to get some sleep, and when I woke up the next morning, I still had a headache (albeit not quite as bad). As of today, 2/10/2021, I still have a slight headache--I have had a headache every single day since 2/6/2021. My current headache is not nearly as bad as the headache on 2/6/2021, but it&#39;s still a headache. I experienced the other vaccine symptoms that others have reported (fever, chills, sweating, significant pain at the injection site, etc.), but I was surprised to experience one of the worst and longest-lasting headaches of my life. I am concerned about taking the next dose in a few weeks.

                                                No reaction after the injection however, after a little over a week I began having alot of itching, swelling and red blotches along with soreness at the injection site.  (Covid Arm) I also was fatigued for a few days.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night with a fever, took 400mg of ibuprofen to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I felt mostly normal, so I took my Bupropion dose (150mg) and drank a cup of coffee. I exercised and went to the gym. When I got back I noticed my heart rate while resting was 130. This persisted into the night. I felt tired, weak, unfocused, and cold at night again. It is possible I had a slight fever again. 48 hrs after my second vaccine, I still have a high resting heart rate (90) which goes up to 120 whenever I move. It is as though I am exercising. I feel like I could jump up and run at any moment. I do not feel fatigued today thankfully. The high heart rate with fatigue is what worried me most.

After second shot, I developed the usual thing of arm soreness, fever, chills, joint pain and generalized body aches as well as GI symptoms. All symptoms went away in two days except that I have had persistent symptoms of cramping abdominal pain, on/off nausea, bloating. I still have the symptoms 4 weeks after the shot and nobody knows what is going on.  I lost around 15 lb till now and will be following with my PCP soon to see what is next.

                                                Developed iritis form of uveitis shortly after getting vaccine. Felt feverish and very fatigued and sore the day after the vaccine (3/19/21), which was unexpected as I am generally healthy and do not recall having an adverse reaction to a vaccine before. Noticed prominent symptoms of iritis by around 2/22/21, but they may have been occurring earlier as I did not know what was happening to me. Symptoms started off as occasional aching of my right eye, but it eventually got inflamed and extra sensitive to light, and I experienced worse redness and aching/pain and photosensitivity by 2/26/21 when I scheduled an appointment with an optometrist. Pain/sensitivity was intermittent from 2/26/21 to  3/1/21, but redness remained. On 3/1/21, my optometrist tentatively diagnosed me with mild iritis and referred me to an opthalmologist. On 3/1/21, an opthalmologist diagnosed me with iritis/anterior uveitis, and I began a treatment of prednisolone acetate 1% drops. thought my development of iritis may have been related to me getting my first dose of the Covid-19 Moderna vaccine shortly before getting symptoms. Hoping to recover within  a few weeks. Have a follow-up appointment scheduled for 3/10/21.

All other symptoms experienced following severe symptoms more closely resembling flu-like symptoms that are to be expected following second vaccine.

                                                I had a sore arm almost immediately following the shot that slowly got worse throughout the evening. In the morning my arm was very sore. I woke up around 6:30 with a headache and chills. throughout the morning, my headache worsened as did my chills. I felt fatigued and noticed my lungs felt the same as they did when I had COVID. Essentially all my COVID symptoms came back I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I slept most of the morning and then felt nauseous around 3 pm. I vomited around 3:30 and almost felt completely better after that. My headache, chills, and fatigue were still present but significantly less once I vomited. In the morning I woke up with a headache that lasted through the morning the second day after vaccine administration. By the end of the second day, I felt completely fine. My arm soreness was almost completely gone. I also had some aches and chills on the second day in the morning upon waking up but those were gone by mid-day. On day three I feel completely fine.

                                                Approximately two to three minutes after receiving the second dose of the vaccine, my face began feeling flush. I also felt a tingling sensation in my face and neck, and I began sweating profusely. I walked up to one of the rescue/paramedic staffers and told them that I had a &#34;flush&#34; feeling in my face. The paramedic asked me a few questions about how I was feeling, then a second paramedic brought a wheelchair. I sat in the wheelchair and was brought to a separate room. The second paramedic noted that I was covered in sweat. The second paramedic and I decided to remove the top layer of my clothing (a polo shirt) because it was drenched in sweat. After about 10 or 15 minutes of sitting in the wheelchair and focusing on my breathing, the tingling/sweating sensation subsided and I was able to walk back into the observation area. I felt a second &#34;wave&#34; of sweating/tingling come over me a few minutes later, but it was minor compared to the first &#34;wave,&#34; and did not require additional attention from the paramedics. I did not require any medication during this event.

                                                I have not felt the same since I received the vaccine. Initially, I felt tingling in my fingers after receiving the injection. I also got chest and throat tightness. I felt very slightly shaky and just a bit off.  After that subsided a bit, I left the facility and started heading home. Ten miles from the store, I went back as I got another wave of feeling pretty terrible. I waited outside there for another hour until I felt better again. The next few days I had terrible fatigue and constant headaches, and the obvious sore arm. I had a couple days where I was a little better but then it would come surging back again.  For three weeks I&#39;ve had on and off migraines, extreme and dreadful fatigue like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced before (feels like I&#39;m dying of cancer or something), and feeling out of it and spacey. It&#39;s been awful and I&#39;m terrified to get the second dose if the first one did all this to me. I was feeling great in the weeks leading up to the vaccine so I am certain that my reaction is to the vaccine. I hope this gets better soon. I&#39;m not sure what to do about dose 2.

The morning after the shot I also woke up with a 102.5 degree fever, but the fever went away shortly after I woke up. Additionally, I also experienced severe headaches and exhaustion for about two to three days after the injection. On the fourth day, all the adverse side effects dissipated and eventually went away completely.

He went to CVS and rapid COVID test came back negative; throat culture for strep came back negative. Pt said he&#39;s feeling better with Advil, but sore throat starts to hurt when Advil wears off. He&#39;s staying hydrated and getting better but hasn&#39;t full recovered yet.

Concerned I should have taken longer time between having COVID and getting the vaccine. It was a approximately 3 days from time of being clear of isolation and any symptoms. There was no concern on the consent form of recently having COVID just a concern if you were presently positive.

Following his initial vaccination at approx. 530pm, the patient (EMT) walked back to the ambulance in which he was working and bypassed the observation area.  He reports approx. 20min later he began experiencing the sensation that his throat was swelling and immediately began dry heaving.  He returned inside and was tachycardic on monitoring and shivering.  The patient never lost his ability to breath during his time at the vaccination clinic but ultimately received a single dose of IM Epinephrine, Zytec 10mg, and Benadryl (unknown dose) and transported by ambulance to the local ER.  no rashes were observed at the time of intial onset through the time of transport (approx. 20min)

                                                For several hours I had no side effects, including soreness at the injection site. In the evening, maybe 6-8 hours after the injection, the site became sore. After midnight, I started having severe chills and needed several layers of clothing and blankets to stay warm. I checked for a fever and did not have one. In the morning the chills were gone but I had a strong headache that lingered with varying intensity throughout the day. It is unclear if the headache was more from the vaccine or more from a lack of sufficient sleep because I couldn&#39;t sleep with the chills. The injection site has continued to be sore and seems to be increasingly sore. After waking up on 1-13-2021, I found myself feeling fatigued and lethargic, not dissimilar to the fatigue I felt when I had COVID. The fatigue has somewhat subsided over the course of the day, with lots of rest helping. The headache and soreness are ongoing, and the fatigue is present but less than earlier today. There&#39;s been somewhat of an ongoing lack of appetite, but I&#39;ve been able to eat in small amounts and keep down what I eat. The chills have come and gone a couple times throughout the day today, but that doesn&#39;t seem to last long.

Standing for more than a couple of minutes caused lightheaded feeling.

The next day mild headache remained but was much better overall other symptoms did not remain.

                                                I recieved my second covid 19 vaccine by moderna.  I still have the subtle altered taste/smell that occured after receiving the first dose a month ago (I have previously reported that).  On 1/25/21, I recieved the 2nd dose of vaccine at 10 am and felt fine all day.  Around 10pm, I started to have chills.  This rapidly evolved to whole body rigors.  My tempature spiked.  I couldn&#39;t move, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would pass out or throw up.  I had to have my wife bring me a makeshift urinal since I couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  Went from freezing to boiling, back and forth.  Felt absolutely miserable.  Around 2-3 am broke out into a cold sweat and finally started to feel better.  I was drenched in sweat througout the night.  It was a very long 4-5 hours.  The following night I felt fine although I also was drenched in sweat when I woke up.

However, the site of the injection on my left arm has turned red. I would say it is a red circle with a radius of 1.5-inch around the injection location. It is painful when pressed on. Also my left armpit (lymph nod) is swollen and is painful. Hopefully I won&#39;t die :/

Chills, dizziness, and body aches continued mildly through Sunday.   I also passed out/blacked out the night of getting the vaccine while using the bathroom. Unclear if this was simply due to standing too quickly while experiencing the above mentioned symptoms and blood rushing to my head or a true side effect of the vaccine.

To date, he is still experiencing headaches. He will be visiting his PCP for his annual 2/26/21 and will bring up the reaction to him for further direction.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

Over the course of the night, I fell more ill and finally took my temperature in the morning around 7 AM and had a fever of around 100.4 F. I took Tylenol about every 6 hours for the next 24 hours with my temperature fluctuating between normal and 100.4 F. During this time, I was too ill to do anything more than sleep or lay in bed. The following day, my temperature broke, but I was still experiencing aches, chills, and brain fog, along with the pain at the injection site. After about 84 hours from the time of the vaccination, I felt normal enough to resume my daily activities.

Finished a conversation at left the facility after approximately 9:55am. While driving back to office (appx 5 minute drive total), experienced clammy skin, sweating at 3 minutes into drive.  I considered pulling over, though I knew I should be around people where I could be monitored, so continued on. Experienced elevated temperature, blurriness of vision and my vision began to turn bright and white.  As I pulled into the parking lot, I thought I may be passing out.  I got out of the vehicle, sat down on the nearest bench and asked two individuals who where outside to stay with me, and I explained my symptoms to them.  I remained seated for approximately 10 minutes, and when I felt the symptoms subside, went into my office and am now filing this report.

                                                Patient had just received the vaccine.  I walked by and he indicated that he was feeling light headed.   I asked my pharmacy staff to call 911 and attend the patient.  I was attending a patient who was feeling faint after her vaccination.  Staff was in contact with 911 and were attending patient.   His initial blood pressure reading was 138/92. He was sweating profusely.  He was no longer talking.  his next blood pressure reading was higher in the 160&#39;s according to our other pharmacist who was attending him.  The paramedics were here very quickly and took the patient to a local hospital.  I believe the attending pharmacist will also be reporting this.

                                                I am experiencing vertigo which I?ve never experienced prior to this shot.  It seems like others are experiencing the same issue around 8 days after the shot.   I?m not sure if these individuals have reported this but I have provided a forum where people are reporting this same issue.    The vertigo was so intense on Monday 3/8/2021 at around 4:30am that I ended up getting sick and throwing up.  Symptoms are still around today 3/10/2021 but not as severe.

                                                Gastro symptoms started the Monday following the vaccine. Acid reflux was continually getting worse and causing difficulty eating, and sleeping. Thursday I went to the ER and was diagnosed with pneumonia and given a gastro cocktail and recommended follow up with gastrointestinal physician. On Friday I felt worse and had a fever of 101 I took Tylenol and Motrin and continually felt worse. Went to ER with 103.4 fever and racing heart rate. BP was normal. Was discharged and told to continue medication. The next day (Saturday) I woke with a swollen penis and went back to the ER where I was given a steroid shot and told to ice and watch for any additional swelling. Fever has stayed down but have had aches and pains throughout the day

Pain radiating to testicles.  Entire body aching.  Couldn&#39;t find comfortable position to sit/stand/walk.   Worse than any illness I&#39;ve had, but without the brain fog Within next 48 hours: Armpit swollen on right arm (same as vaccine arm).  Pain in head persisting.  Pain behind ears.  Dizzy/lightheaded feeling. Third Day after vaccine: Armpit is still swollen.  Headache persists.  Ache in muscles and joints seem to be re-emerging.  But, overall, I&#39;m fine and can work today. Note: Pollen count high - and I typically do get headaches from pollen - so, headaches could be attributable to pollen, but timing is suspicious.

On 29-Mar-2021, PRESYNCOPE (felt like he was about to pass out), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy), PALPITATIONS (felt like his heart was racing), NASOPHARYNGITIS (felt like he had a cold), SOMNOLENCE (felt like he wanted to sleep) and NAUSEA (felt nauseous) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant drugs were reported.  On 29 Mar 2021, the patient went to emergency room and was monitored for a couple hours, not medical treatment was provided for side effect relief.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 34-year-old male with a serious unexpected event of presyncope, palpitations, and nonserious unexpected dizziness, somnolence, palpitations, nasopharyngitis and expected nausea. Event onset Day1 after first dose. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

In addition, I developed a rash on my arm and was bedridden. I took a small walk that day and proceeded to swell up on the left side of my body but it subsided within a few hours. The next day, I suffered a stroke due to blot clotting and the clot flowing to my brain. I had to go to the hospital and was there for a few days.

                                                At approximately 3am (~13 hours post-injection) I experienced chills. I was asleep in bed and was awakened by my own shivering. My bedroom was its typical temperature, I had my usual bedding on the bed, and my wife (next to me) did not feel that the temperature was unusually low. I added additional blankets and suffered through these chills for approximately one hour until they passed.  At approximately 9am (~19 hours post-injection) I began to experience severe body aches and fatigue. I got up, had breakfast, and then slept approximately 3 more hours. I awoke for lunch, played with my children, and then fell asleep for approximately 2 more hours. Body aches continued through the day. Over-the-counter Tylenol was sufficient to ease the discomfort. I would describe the level of body ache as similar to having completed an extremely strenuous physical activity the previous day; the last time I can remember feeling this sore was following a multi-day 100-mile backpack trip at high elevation. At present (10pm, approximately 32 hours post-injection) the body aches are subsiding but still present. My fatigue is also subsiding.

By 130am 1/1/2021 I awoke from my sleep terribly dizzy, shaking violently and experiencing a fever of 101.3 F. I took advil and tylenol and fell asleep about an hour later. I woke up with similar symptoms at approximately 830am on 1/1/2021 took an additional dose of advil and tylenol and slept till 12p. I woke up with a bad headache and coughing fits similar to when I had covid back in March. I went to an urgent care who assessed me and ordered me to the ER. medical center administered IV fluids, an inhaler, steroids, epinephrine and benadryl and a few hours later my symptoms had subsided for the most part and a dose of IV antibiotics was administered. I am currently admitted for observation with likely discharge on 1/2/2021.

                                                I felt nothing for the 15 minute waiting period after the shot.  About 35 minutes after the shot (while driving home) I noticed tingling on the tip of my tongue with mild lightheadedness, sweating, and shortness of breath.  I pulled over, drank some water, and all these symptoms went away in less than a minute.  I felt a little malaise on the drive home.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA After receiving the vaccine, I felt my throat swell up a bit, which caused me to slightly panic during the 15 minute observational period; however, it went away after approximately 5 minutes. I initially wasn&#39;t convinced it had anything to do with the vaccine. Later that day, I went into work for third shift. At approximately 1:30 am (approx 11 hrs. after the vaccine), I began to feel very ill. I developed flu like symptoms and a headache, which caused me to leave work. I continued having flu symptoms, chills, nausea, body aches, and a very severe migraine on and off until I woke up on  01-22-20 at approximately 6:00 am. At this time, the migraine had subsided and I just had some minor body aches,, which over the next 24 hrs. also went away. The migraine should be noted as debilitating to the point I was dizzy, my mind was foggy, but worst of all, the pain was so bad I was constantly nauseous and my eyes were regularly watering.   I never was tested for COVID-19; however, I believe my family had potentially had the virus in October. My wife and I exhibited many of the signs and symptoms of the virus, including my wife losing taste and smell for an extended period of time.

                                                Around 12 hours after the second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine I experienced the expected severe fever, chills, and rigors.  This eventually subsided to a large extent by hour 30; however at hour 36 I slightly bent over to pick up an item from my nightstand and felt what seemed to be a pulled muscle in my left back.  I immediately went to bed and awoke with severe muscle spasms in that same area.  The muscle spasms continued lying, standing, and sitting.  Nothing relieved them and they were intermittent brought on spontaneously and also by movement.  I could not perform most daily functions and sought medical attention at the local urgent care.  There they diagnosed it as a thoracic myofascial strain.  They prescribed me cyclobenzaprine which helped decrease the frequency but not completely alleviate the spasms.

My right side of my face around the cheek, eye, and ear area began to tingle and feel numb around 20 to 30 min. After the shot was administered. It was only on the side of my face that Moderna covid vaccine was given. It ended up going away after 4 hours or so. The next day I had normal reactions to the shot for someone that had covid such as low fever, muscle inflammation, aches, and this brain fog, chills in my sleep.

                                                An employee received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine on 01/28/2021. This store had entered and scanned the patient&#39;s VAR into the system. On 02/11/2021, the patient was called into our store location to receive his second dose, even though it was 14 days too early. The patient&#39;s VAR and vaccine was not immediately entered into the system, so the fact that the patient had received the first dose only 14 days ago was not immediately discovered. On 2-12-2021, our team was entering the patient&#39;s vaccine into the system and this was when the error was caught. Patient was contacted and instructed to call the nurse triage line. So far, the patient has only reported normal vaccine-related side effects such as sore arm, malaise, fatigue, and sweating.

My shirt was soaked through when i left the clinic. Felt fine and took some benadryl (to sleep) and (tylenol) to stop arm pain and then went to sleep. Woke up at 1am with chills, shaking, chattering teeth and body aches.  Took a hot shower and attempted to go back to sleep, but had intense body aches. Slept a few more hours. Woke up again feeling worse at 7am. fever of 101 degrees. Took more tylenol and more benadryl. Slept until 2pm. Woke up still had fever and body aches. By 530pm body aches stopped and fever went away. By 7pm i felt normal. Injection site soreness lasted for less time on 2nd shot than on first shot.

                                                Confusion and disorientation in the morning following the injection. There were flu-like symptoms throughout the day including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and body aches. Treatment was a light diet, increased fluids and some Tylenol. I had several periods of heavy sweating as the fever broke overnight. I was tired but felt better the following morning.

He received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine (lot number 003B21A, expiration date 9/9/2021) around noon at the vaccine facility.  About 2 1/2 hours later, the patient developed burning and itching of the eyes and rhinorrhea.  The patient&#39;s co-workers and a medic looked at him and said that his eyes were red and puffy, and told him that he should report to the ER.  He also experienced some throat itching, and said that his thinking was &#34;cloudy&#34;.  The patient said that he had eaten nothing in the previous several hours.  He had not taken any medications that day.  He is not aware of any known drug or food allergies, and he has not been sick in the past few weeks.  He denies having had any vaccinations in the previous 2 weeks.

                                                Saturday afternoon (2 days after dose) I broke out in extremely bad hives all over my back, face and head. I called ER to see what I should do because this has never happened before. I&#39;ve never had any allergic reaction to anything and I was concerned since I just received my 2nd dose. ER recommended I come in, since nothing in my normal life changed to cause this also because my lips were getting swollen and throat was scratchy. Once I was checked out in ER they gave me an IV with another antihistamine to get in my system faster. I was releases later that night with a script for prednisone (2 pills for 3 days). Everything was fine Sunday however, i woke up Monday with the rash and hives coming back. I then made another appointment with a Dr, who prescribed more prednisone. Hives have since been gone and not returned.

The symptoms progressed and my fever was over 102 most of the day and hit a max of 103.5 around 2:30pm.  Nausea started around 4pm, which I alleviated by taking Zofran.  I eventually went to bed and awoke on the second day around 4:30am with a fever at 101 still.  Then around 7:30am, the fever broke with the most intense full body sweats.    Later on that Friday, in the afternoon, I noticed a large red rash on my right arm at the injection side, it was slightly swollen and very hot.  It got bigger over the next 12 hours or so and by Sunday afternoon the swelling had subsided and now appears and feels like a sunburn where the redness turns white if you press with a finger and then returns to red and it also itches now.  I treated the itchiness with some hydrocoritizone cream.

                                                In the 3 weeks leading up to February 10th, I became progressively more bloated with fluid in my stomach area, with an increasing feeling of fullness.  By the 10th, I felt so full that I had only eaten one meal in two days.  I had also been sleeping upright for days to attempt to clear what I perceived to be a stomach blockage and therefore was quite tired.  I walked in to the ER and the x-ray revealed the blood clot in my portal vein.  The physician immediately had enoxaparin administered to me and I was admitted.  I received another enoxaparin dose the next morning.  I was discharged on Xarelto 15mg twice a day in the afternoon of Feb 11th.  I am continuing on Xarelto as my hematologist runs various tests and I have an EGD on 4/16 due to a possible stomach ulcer.  I was diagnosed with: Mesenteric venous thrombosis Elevated transaminase measurement Fatty liver

                                                Immediately felt weak and light headed the same as the first shot, but did not incur breathing difficulties. Gradually became weaker as the day went on. 13 hours later, at 3AM, awoke due to severe pain, chills, and fever that progressively worsened to about 103 degrees and did not drop below 100 for another 17 hours.  Resting heart rate elevated over 30 bpm and respiration rate doubled. Pounding heart made it impossible to sleep. Had to double beta blocker dosage to reduce heart contractility to prevent chance of further scarring of ventricular tissue due from any myocarditis caused by the vaccine. Could not leave bed and could barely stand to go to the bathroom. Lost 5 pounds in one day. Couldn?t eat. Felt nauseas. Contemplated going to ER but didn?t feel I?d make it without passing out.  Still having difficulty walking any distance without feeling like passing out more than 72 hours after vaccination absent any arrhythmia.  Experienced non-sustained arrhythmias after the first vaccine dosage doing normal household activities that required me to stop what I was doing to prevent a defibrillator shock. I have a feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating or sleeping. It was a struggle to drive a vehicle to restock of fluids and electrolytes today. I fear this vaccine is making my health worse.

This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of MENIERE&#39;S DISEASE (Meniere&#39;s Disease) in a 35-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 024M20A and 027L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.   On 09-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In January 2021, the patient experienced FACIAL DISCOMFORT (facial pressure), TINNITUS (tinnitus) and HEADACHE (headaches). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MENIERE&#39;S DISEASE (Meniere&#39;s Disease) (seriousness criterion medically significant), EAR INFECTION (ear infection) and AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER (Autoimmune response to the vaccine). At the time of the report, MENIERE&#39;S DISEASE (Meniere&#39;s Disease), FACIAL DISCOMFORT (facial pressure), EAR INFECTION (ear infection) and AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER (Autoimmune response to the vaccine) outcome was unknown and TINNITUS (tinnitus) and HEADACHE (headaches) had not resolved.            On unknown date, the patient was given antibiotics for a possible ear infection and the ears, nose and throat (ENT) physician put the patient on prednisone.  On unknown date, the patient was seen by a neurologist for the persistent headaches and tinnitus and was told by the doctor the patient had an autoimmune response to the vaccine that was affected the nerves.

                                                Developed tinnitus after 2 days of vaccination. Prior to vaccination I was having mild ringing in my right ear due to moderate hearing loss caused by ear drum perforation.  2 days after vaccination I started having tinnitus on left side of my brain on and off and now it&#39;s continuous , also ringing in my right ear has increased , it is causing to me to have sleepless nights and groggy days. It has not improved even after a month. It could be  a permanent damage but I am not sure.

                                                at around noon the day following my shot, I started feeling soreness all over my body. I took aleve. I felt some chills and a slight headache. These lasted until Sunday. Monday I started feeling very tired, very week, and still sore in my arms and a little in my legs. I took aleeve. Tuesday I still felt lingering soreness but no headache. I started feeling anxiety towards the end of my workday. At around 4pm I started to feel my legs quivering as if I had just run several miles and my muscles were week. This gave me anxiety as I was still working and assisting clients. at around 4:15 I started feeling like I was going to break out in hives around my neck area, which does sometimes happen to me. I got home and around 7pm I took a Zyrtec, but by that point hives started forming on my neck and head. I felt my lip start to swell. I woke up at about 3am on Wednesday to find both of my lips swollen and I took a Benadryl and went back to bed. I woke up at about 7am and my eyes were both swollen almost completely shut and my lips were swollen. I could feel itchiness from incoming hives around my neck and shoulders. I took two Benadryl and rested all day. The swelling mostly went down by the end of the day and I continued to nurse the Benadryl. I saw my doctor on the 15th. He advised how to proceed and prepare  with the second dose and referred me to an allergist.

                                                Slight fever of 100.2, nausea (I did vomit), major body aches, migraine, uncontrollable shaking, soreness at the injection site and lack of sleep (due to the pain in my arm and body aching) all from 1/4 to 1/5 early morning. During the daytime hours of the 1/5, took Tylenol (1,000mg) every 5 hours (or so). Also had nausea (as well as had difficulty wanting to eat because I was nauseous), slight fever of 100, headache (no longer a migraine) and major body aches. Stayed home from work and relaxed on my couch (mostly). Today/currently, on 1/6 at 12:50pm, only symptoms I still have is soreness at injection site (not as sever-more of a discomfort) and slight body ache (not as sever). Last does of Tylenol was taken at 01:30am on 1/6.

                                                The evening of the vaccine it started with severe fatigue and a sore throat. The next morning I woke up with a sore throat so bad that I could hardly swallow which continued through the evening then went away. I treated it with salt water rinses and Benadryl. Over the next several days the severe fatigue continued but severe muscle and joint pain as well as intestinal upset began. On Monday 1/11 I had spiked a fever which only lasted for that day. On Tuesday night I began to vomit and on Wednesday 1/13 I had lost my sense of smell and most of my sense of taste. At this point I contacted the CDC which had me complete this form in addition to the V-Safe reports I had been doing daily and encouraged me to see my primary care. In late June of 2020 I had COVID and one of the first symptoms was loosing my sense of smell and taste completely.

I gargled salt water, and took some allergy medications including Benadryl and the sore throat went away later that day. The extreme fatigue continued and late during the day following and into the third day started extreme muscle and joint pain, and intestinal upset. On Monday 1/11/2021 I had also spiked a fever which only lasted for the day. These as of today 1/14/2021 have yet to go away as well as the extreme fatigue. The major one the made me call into the agency who had me start this report was that I lost my sense of smell and some sense of taste. I had been diagnosed with COVID in late June of 2020 and one of the first symptoms was the loss of taste and smell.

Self treatment with previous prescriptions: Azelastine, Albuterol, ibuprofen, multi vitamin, lots of alternating cool and warm drinks.  Day 2 after the vaccine was the worse for abdominal pains. Had constipation since.  Day 3 was the start of the symptoms that mirror cold or flu like ones.  Current prescriptions seem not to be working. Especially the Azelastine for opening up the nasal passage.

Followed by back and neck muscle spasms causing pain at any slight movement. Telemedicine visit to doctor suggested the sore throat was something viral (not Covid), and that it should go away. Two PCR tests were negative for Covid. Muscle pain has not been addressed yet, as I cannot make an appointment until I have been symptom-free for 72 hours.

                                                Just after getting the vaccine had a sore shoulder for 2 days, then after that nothing until 8 days after getting the vaccine.  On the 26th, started feeling slight soreness in joints in muscles kind of like they were locked up, didnt think much of it, thought it was maybe from overdoing a gym workout.  The next day on the 27th, woke up and was feeling chills, along with mostly full body soreness and feeling very lethargic.  I also had a baseball sized red area on the injection site on my shoulder, it was itchy, swollen and felt very firm to the touch especially compared to other shoulder.  I also had hive like red circular welts on my back, butt, and upper legs.  Two of my fingers had spots on them that felt like blisters.  Felt very sore and tired all day.  In the evening I took 50mg benadryl to try and combat the symptoms.  When I woke up the next morning (28th) still had all the same symptoms just felt slightly better overall.  Took 50mg more benadryl and felt pretty tired and lethargic throughout the day.  In the late afternoon I have started feeling more sore again, and have a slight headache.  The hives and red area on my shoulder are still present but not as red.  So far during this time I have not had any issues with my throat and breathing, but my sternum has been super sore, more sore than any other part of my body during this time.  If i take as much air in as I can, it feels sore and hurts as I get to the last 10% of my lung capacity inhaling.

As the day progressed my symptoms became worse and I developed a fever and chills/shivers.  At 1600 I took 1000 MG of Tylenol.  By 1730 my fever had increased to 103.4 and my shivering was intense.  I took a cold shower and another 600 MG of Ibuprofen.  By 1845 my fever had increased to 104.7, so I proceeded to the Hospital.  Before triage I began to sweat. During triage my fever read 103.8 and my heartrate was 120. I was given 1,000 mL of fluids via an IV.  My fever continued to diminish as the IV was administered and was 100.8 at the time of discharge.

                                                Chills/fever,  mild headache, fatigue. Vaccine was given on a Friday afternoon, symptoms presented around 2200-2300 that night and were at their peak all day Saturday. By Sunday all symptoms were still present but the fever had mostly resolved. Some fatigue persisted the rest of the week (Monday through Friday).   The following week after receiving the vaccine I experienced fever (up to 104F taken in clinic) fatigue, lack of appetite, abdominal discomfort. I was diagnosed with diverticulitis in the ER so the fever was attributed to that. Just wanted to note that I have had flare ups over the past few years but was never febrile. Also of note is that I had been taking INH and Rifampin which may have caused and/or contributed to some of the adverse effects.

                                                5-10 minutes after patient received vaccination he complained of feeling disoriented.  Patient was seated  approximately 6 feet in front of pharmacy counter and I went out to check on him.  Patient was sweating profusely and again complained of feeling disoriented.  I asked if he was feeling nauseous and he said no.  I placed a cold compress on the back of his neck and had him try to relax and breath evenly.   I then  got a ice pack for him and wrapped it in towels to protect the patient from the cold.  Offered patient some water which he denied.  Offered to call an ambulance and patient denied.  I took the patients blood pressure and it was 140/84. Patient states this is slightly higher than normal for him.  After 5 more minutes patient began to recover quickly.  Sweating stopped and his color returned to normal.  Patient stated he felt much better.  I took patients blood pressure again and it was 133/94.  Patient stayed under observation for another 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left the pharmacy.

                                                I am unable to regulate my body temperature. I fluctuate between shivering from chills to sweating profusely. I have a mild headache and joint pain. I am heavily fatigued to the point that walking to my kitchen is laborious. My temperature is only slightly elevated to 98.8 degrees F. My normal temperature is 98.1 degrees F.  I have been drinking Gatorade when I?m able to make it to my kitchen and taking acetaminophen.  The events started approximately 7 hours after vaccination and have been constant to this point.

Had been sitting at computer for at least six hours straight (and probably smoking more pot than I should have), felt dizzy and short of breath, got up, ended up losing consciousness on the living room floor. Woke up a few minutes later and put myself to bed; felt fatigue, aches, chills, and like I might have been running a mild fever. Slept unusually well; woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine. Not particularly concerned but felt like I should report it.

He recognized that the fullness was worse when he was laying down. By the next morning, the fullness became more of a dizziness, he felt unstable, nauseated, weakness, and intermittent tightness in his chest. His symptoms have been mostly stable until this morning (12MAR2021) he woke with a disturbing feeling of fullness in his nose and sinuses. Then suddenly had a significant flow of blood from his RIGHT nostril. As of this evening he still has congestion in his sinuses, and intermittent tightness in his chest.

                                                Patient became very pale and sweaty and was close to passing out.  Patient moved from the bench where he was sitting down to the floor.  I came to check on him and gave him water and orange juice to drink.  I checked his blood pressure twice, approximately 2 minutes apart.  The first blood pressure reading was 73/46mmHg and a heart rate or 46bpm.  The second reading was 110/74mmHg and HR 66bpm.  After the second BP reading, patient stated that he was feeling better.  This was just likely vasovagal syncope.   Patient remained on the floor because it was a cooler location for approximately 15 minutes and was feeling better and went home with his father-in-law and mother-in-law.

                                                After 24 hours right arm was sore, swollen with large amount of redness around injection area, could not raise it above the shoulder. Entire body was weak and fatigued.  48 hours everything seemed back to &#39;normal&#39;.  Roughly 80 hours later from the vaccination, suddenly body cramped up and had trouble speaking and pronouncing words. Fell to the ground and had hand spasms similar to bells palsy or cerebral palsy. Could not speak fluently or get up on my own. After 45 minutes to 1 hour, when paramedics were called and came they sat me up. Within a few minutes, like a switch, I could speak normally again and could walk on my own. Walked out to the ambulance and waited for 15 minutes or so, and everything seemed fine and back to &#39;normal&#39;. Declined to go to hospital, and since that episode things are still &#39;normal&#39;.

Attempting a foam roller to stretch my muscle and release some pin to no luck. I considered going to the ER because of the pain not subsiding.   Around 2:30 AM I started throwing up, which lasted off an on for about a hour.   I returned to bed around 3:30 AM with the muscle tightness still happening. Around 4:00 I began having chills and my muscle started to relax. By 5:00 AM I was sleeping. No ongoing effective expect fatigue, and my throat was sore from throwing up.

                                                Patient had flu-like symptoms while deployed at start of pandemic (approx. Jan/Feb 2020), but testing was unavailable. His symptoms (URI-like) completely resolved. He received Moderna dose 1 on 02 Feb 2021 without incident, and Moderna dose 2 on 02 Mar 2021. Approximately one week later, he developed mild, dull, diffuse chest pain and shortness of breath which has persisted since.   He was seen in clinic for chest pain and dyspnea on 15 Mar 2021. Patient noted his chest hurt ?all over? especially with deep or with normal inspiration. Reclining, laying down, and sleeping on his right side increased his pain (he did not trial sleeping on his left). Leaning forward decreased pain. He endorsed feeling short of breath, and stated he felt light headed twice while going up stairs, without passing out. He denied recent illnesses and other symptoms. He is a very physically fit Active Duty Marine, who has continued running despite his symptoms. During this encounter and later f/u encounter, he expressed he did not believe running made his symptoms significantly worse.  Vital signs were within normal range and he did not appear in distress. Cardiac and lung exam were normal, and no friction rub or murmur was appreciated. EKG showed sinus bradycardia, with HR consistent with his known, athletic-type normal variant heart rate. No other abnormalities were detected. Due to limited ancillary services within clinic, he was sent to USNHO ED for evaluation. There, he had basic labs (including Trop I) drawn, which were normal. EKG and portable chest xray were also unremarkable, and he was discharged with Motrin 800mg PO TID.  He was seen in clinic again 29 Mar 2021 for continued, unchanged symptoms, and reported he had been taking his Motrin only in the mornings and afternoons. Vital signs were unchanged (normal limits). Exam, including heart and lung, were normal. EKG again demonstrated sinus bradycardia, consistent with his normal resting heart rate. He was started on empiric therapy for pericarditis. He was released from clinic and will follow up in several weeks.

                                                Day 1: Common symptoms: Fatigue, chills, headache. Day 2-Day14: Began experience upper gastrointestinal symptoms.  Pain, Bloating, Feeling of extreme fullness, Nausea, constant gurgling of the stomach.  This lasted for approximately ~ 2 weeks.  These symptoms have not fully resolved but have improved 85-90%. Day 3-current: Twitching and muscle spasms began in the arm that I got the shot in.  Shoulder, bicep, and into the forearm were CONTINUOUSLY twitching all day long.  Sleep became difficult for a period of a few days due to this.   This muscle twitching then began to occur in all other parts of the body.  Eye lids, arms, legs, torso.  Everywhere.  The rate of the twitches at worst was approximately 30 twitches per minute bouncing around from one area of the body to another.  I am currently 3 weeks post vaccination and although I have seen significant improvement in the twitching, I am still currently experience this symptom.

Left Arm pain in the place of injection is normal.  Fatigue on the day of vaccination and 2 days after. It is getting better by time. I forced myself to do some light activity and walk around. I felt better.

My arm where the injection site was became incredibly sore to the point where I couldn?t sleep on it at all.  Otherwise I felt decent. I woke up the next day and my arm was about 50% as sore as it was at the peak. I had about 90% energy level so still very slight fatigue. Towards the end of the night the soreness in my arm dropped to about 20% of the peak.

I was not able to leave the bed at all the day unless to use the bathroom to which I would be out of breath from that. I slept most of the day as I was so very weak. This lasted all that day. On 12/31/20 I was still weak and tired but able to get out of bed with bad headaches and pain in my bones all over. I would still loose my breath walking anywhere in my home. Sharp pains would come and go throughout the day at least once and hour if not more. Sleeping was next to impossible due to the pain. On 1/1/21 which is my current day my headaches are still here along with slight pain and weakness. I can breath better but the injection site on my left arm is still sore but not as bad as the last few days where it was on fire and very sensitive.

I felt strong muscle pain at the injected arm around 12 hours later and woke by the pain multiple times. The next day (1/14/2021),  my left arm is still very painful if I lift it. This strong pain lasted a whole day (1/14/2021) and alleviated quite a lot since 1/15/2021. I&#39;m likely to be one of the reported 90% with musle pain.  2. A mild headache similar to mild cold on the night after the injection. It dimishes next morning. This can be ignored.

The pain elevated as the evening went on to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand for too long or sit.

At the time of patient&#39;s vaccine (01/19/2021), the patient was unaware of his spouse&#39;s COVID-19 status, as they had little contact with others and thought it was a cold. Patient began having COVID-like symptoms on 01/23/2021: cough, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, muscle/body aches, headache, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Patient has had two subsequent negative COVID-19 tests while symptomatic. Because of his symptoms, his spouse&#39;s symptoms and positive COVID status, practitioners have cautioned patient to act as if he has COVID. He is under quarantine orders per Public Health. The concern from the patient, Doctors and Public Health officials has been the patient&#39;s negative status while obviously symptomatic, and if he can pass COVID if he is symptomatic but testing negative. He has another test scheduled for Saturday 1/30/2021.

Then still chills and insomnia. Fever that persisted over the next 36 hours. Responded well to Ibuprofen 400mg for 4.5 hours until symptoms returned. Began alternating with Acetominophen 650mg for better effect. Fever was highest (recorded) at 102.2 F 29 hours after injection. Woke up 40 hours from vaccine after a night of sleep and with reduced fever. Still going up and down a bit off any medication. Last reading 46 hours from vaccine 100.6, but two hours earlier was 99.4. I?ve also had nausea, exhaustion, and tiredness. Also cold symptoms which may be related to the slight cold I had the morning of the vaccination that I didn?t think was anything to worry about - my kid is in daycare and I feel like this for a large part of the winter!

Neck stiffness and soreness began Thursday evening.  Severe chest pains early Saturday morning (3am).  Taken to urgent care - EKG showed irregularity and high level of troponin. Transported from there to the hospital.  They did angiogram, and diagnosed me with pericarditis. The on call physician believes this was most likely caused by the second dose of the vaccine.

I was unable to speak for a few minutes due to the uncontrolled muscle contractions and was just generally too uncomfortable to move. It was not a seizure, but it was temporarily debilitating. Once I got myself wrapped in a warm blanket, it only took about 10 minutes to pass (and never returned). The rest of the day I did feel generally ill, but the day after I felt completely back to normal.

Three days after the shot, I experienced the worst headache of my life.  I received my shot 6 days ago and I still feel very &#34;hot&#34;/low grade fever and experiencing flushing of the face.  The symptoms haven&#39;t felt serious but I&#39;m hearing approximately 60% of individuals I speak with are experiencing the same or worse symptoms.  I worry that individuals won&#39;t want to receive their 2nd shot due to the reported side effects.  I believe more awareness should be communicated to the general public, so they aren&#39;t caught off guard.   I had a covid test conducted on Friday (negative) and will get another one this week to be certain I do not have covid.

                                                Just the side effects that literature said I might have. I had COVID last June, and I was very fatigued and had muscle aches. For about 36 hours, I felt exactly like that after receiving the shot. I?m fine today. I plan to get shot #2. This was NOT an allergy and I?m not even sure it qualifies as a reaction. They were side effects that I was told I might have. I?m reporting I had them.

We monitored him for over an hour and during that time, he continued to c/o dizziness, frontal headache, photophobia, and worsening when opening his eyes are trying to look straight ahead. We had him isolated in a dim room and had air blowing on him as he complained of being hot. His O2 Sat, pulse , and BP all stayed stable and within normal range. Pt. denied sx of swelling around face/neck or difficulty breathing. RR was stable and unlabored at all times. Pt. refused EMS services and after some time, insisted he needed to get up and leave. Our staff and his co-worker assisted him out of the facility and to a vehicle where we was transported off the premises.  We were informed later through his supervisor that he got worse after leaving and went to the hospital where he &#34;seized.&#34; He is reportedly stable at this time but further information on his condition is unavailable.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

The day after I received the vaccine I was very tired feeling, my left arm very sore, and I noticed my heart rate was staying higher. At one point at work my heart rate went up to 140 bpm. I went to the doctor after work and was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia. I was prescribed metoprolol for tachycardia. I do not know what caused my heart rate to increase, but the metoprolol has my rate controlled now. I felt the fatigue lasted about 3-4 days and then I was back to normal.

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

                                                Very sore arm, fatigue within hours of the vaccine. Then 6th day (morning) throat swelling and face when waking up and rushing to the emergency room where I was given a steroid and Pepcid to open my airways and was discharged by 9:30 AM ET on 03/10/2021 after throat opened back up and swelling decreased. I was given a script for EPI, Medrol Pack and Pepcid. Upon returning home I had began having hiccups at 8 PM that lasted through Saturday 03/12/2021, where I was admitted to the hospital for a lot of antihistamine rash reactions over my body that continued from the morning of 03/10/2021. Then went to the hospital again on 03/13/2021 and was given a muscle relaxer baclofen around 7 PM to rid the constant hiccups that were concurrent from what seemed to be the steroid used to open my airways. Went home and have had fatigue, but feel mostly better with appetite back. My family doctor saw me on 03/16/2021 and saw that I was still having a reaction on my back and arms with antihistamines and said it was the Moderna shot and I needed to consult with a pharmacist on what to do or the FDA/CDC as he didn&#39;t know enough on it. Now Pharmacy won&#39;t give me my second dose due to the CDC guidelines and they want me in a medical setting to have the second one, if I am allowed - something I am not privy to. I need help and guidance ASAP on what to do.

A little itchy. I&#39;ve always had headaches this past week almost daily but could not rule out computer eye strain and not drinking enough water.

                                                Moderna Covid 19 vaccine - Got first dose 1-8-2021 -   Side effects.  Right arm is very sore.  Weakness in arm.  More painful than the ankle surgery.  Took a couple hours then it started  1-9-21 at about 1130pm got headache. Took two Advil 1-10-21 at 11am got a headache  1-11-21 around 830pm shoulder and arm finally started feeling less pain 1-13-21 headache around 134.  Took Advil 1-14: arm and shoulder still cracking. Got really bad constipation. Forced it out. Hurt like hell. Tore something took 2 senna plus pills  1-15. Morning had thick and super long poop again. Forced it out a lil quicker but tore again or hemorrhoids  or both. Took 2 senna pills. Moved my neck wrong way.  All muscles are super super tight in my neck. Cracked with shoulder.  Now I can?t move my neck to the right   1-16: poop was pretty normal. Came out nice.  Still some in rectum wasn?t ready to expel. Had to use badee three or four times and lots of wiping to get clean.  1-18: right arm hurting again about half as bad. Still very painful when I lift etc.   Neck is a lot better  1-19: arm still hurts.  Can?t lift up without pain. Weak to lift other things pain actually seems to be in my shoulder and cracking a lot.  Not in my arm itself.  By the nighttime the pain became more intense in my shoulder and very difficult to lift it or move it.  Like the first day I got the vaccine.  1-20: shoulder hurts worse than ever.  Worst pain ever even if I keep it still has some pain. Horrible.    Became worse over the day  1-21:  at 330pm had loose bowels.  1-22-21 at 1118am.  Loose bowels again after an initial drop of on bowels.   1-23.  Normal poops.    2-5-21.  Got second dose at 1250am in left arm this time instead of right.  At 215pm still fine. But as I got up slight headache. Arm not hurting yet  247pm started having some pain just at injection site. Later at night around 9 or so I got really tired also felt slightly nauseous  2-6-21 at 1207pm.  Arm is sore but bearable.  Can move it fine.   Doable.  At 1221pm felt nauseous.  Sick to my stomach.  130pm or so was able to eat Mac n cheese.  Had raspberries about a half hour earlier to settle my tummy  2/7 at 122am:  laying in bed.  Got a bad headache since I got up.  Arm pain is minor. So long as I don?t touch it it?s fine.   I am tired.  Worn out. Congested.  Left arm and shoulder starting hurting around 2-15?   Once I started working out. Hurt like hell.  800mg Advil helped some but still hurt.  2-26: shoulder left still hurts and tight.  Did not take Advil.   Tried to stretch it.  Feels a little better at 9pm 2-28-21: slight nausea Again.  Still sore arm on and off.  Dried out.  Tired.  Drinking tons of water 3-3.  Last day I worked out and did cardio.  3-5.  Left arm still hurts a bit at injection site.

I would rate the pain when I pushed on the injection site at 6/10. It was only painful when I touched it or tried to use the muscle to lift my arm in certain ways. I also experienced some level of fatigue and slight dizziness the day after I received my shot.

I began to feel ill. Arm hurt, headache, weight on chest. Body hurt. I went to bed early. I woke up on 13 JAN and felt worse. I stayed in bed until around 1300. I got up and went and sat in my office to work. At around 1700, I went to go get my children from a neighbors yard to bring them for supper. I made it to my back yard before feeling to tired to continue. I went inside and laid down. At around 1900 or 1930, I was putting my kids to bed. I then fainted once more. I don&#39;t know how long I was out each time. I don&#39;t think I hit anything with my head. I got up and went to my bed and texted a Doc.

At 3:00 that same afternoon, I began running a fever, which ranged anywhere from  99.8 - 102.6 over the next few days. I experienced body aches, fatigue, chills, nausea and vomiting (one episode), and headaches. I did receive a COVID (Rapid and PCR) and Flu test on the following Monday, all of which came back negative. On the 21 and 22 I woke up without a fever, but within approximately 3 hours of waking up my fever would return. Fever was treated with a rotation of acetaminophen and ibuprofen with success, however, it never dropped the fever below 99.0.

                                                Lower Back Spasms just a few hours after vacine was administered.  I went to bed with what I thought was just flu like syptoms like achy muscles.  But this was more then that.  Even laying in bed my back would spasm and almost take my breath away.  That night did not sleep due to the sporadic unpredictable pain when laying in bed.  Describe pain as electic shock or stabbing pain that takes your breath away it&#39;s so intense, but then goes away very quickly.  The next couple of days I was forced to stay immobile due to the pain that was sporadic in nature.  Even when laying down it spasmed.   I could barely walk for a few days.  I started taking NSAIDS to help with the pain and I became more mobile after a few days.  Work has been very difficult and spasms have not gone away even now Im still having problems and am struggling making it through the work day.  I have to lay down flat on my back as soon as I get home from work and take ibuprofen to relieve the pain.  I was absolutely fine healthy and very active person prior to the vaccine.  Just hours after getting vaccine it&#39;s almost like my joints and back were inflamed for some reason.

At around 08:00 pm I started to get really cold and had the worst case of the chills I have ever had. I was shaking so hard my body hurt. At around 10:30 pm I went to bend and started to get a low fever of about 101.4* and could not get warm. I started to get a bad headache and my body hurt. It was so bad I had to call in sick the next day for work. On 01/28/2021 I stayed home and had sever body aches, bad headache, the chills and I felt nauseas. From my left hip to my left knee it felt like I had a bad charley horse. That night I got another low grade fever of about 100.1*. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating and still had a headache. I took some Aleve and went back to sleep. I called in sick again the next day and that day I was a little better only had a headache, a little nauseas and body was only a little sore. I went to bed and am fine today. A note I have never tested positive to COVID-19 and I test weekly.

                                                Eleven days after the vaccination the patient developed 2 days of heartburn followed by a worsening nonproductive cough, substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, palpitations, and an episode of near syncope. These worsened over about 6 days and then slowly decreased. During this time he was referred to the ED and then admitted to a civilian host nation hospital. Echocardiogram and CT scan were performed and a paericardial cyst was discovered measuring 7.4 cm. He was then referred to another facility for evasluation. The pericardial cyst was confirmed, now 6.5 cm and laboratory tests were performed on 4 FEB, but there was at that time no elevation in inflammatory markers. Cardiology and Cardiothoracic Surgery consultations were obtained, but the consultants and the attending physician (who is an infectious disease physician by training) did not think that the crescendo-decrescendo symptoms could be explained by the pericardial cyst, which was likely an incidental finding. A milder cough may have preceded these events by up to a year, and this may possibly be related to the cyst. The heartburn, chest pain, tachycardia, diaphoresis, palpitations, and near syncope may well be adverse reactions of the vaccine.

                                                I had a major headache that lasted just under 48 hours.  I have no history of headaches or migraines and have very rarely had headaches and they were never major.  After lunch on Saturday I got a headache and took 1 Aleve 12 hr and slept it off but it was still minor after waking.  The next morning it returned and I took another Aleve 12 hr and it took over an hour for relief.  The next day I still had a minor headache but it went away by lunch time without additional medication.

                                                Received dose around 5pm, by between 7-8pm I had body aches, and severe chills - almost to the point of convulsion. Woke up with a fever in morning, fever off and on the following day, fatigue the following two days. By day two I was having difficulty breathing while laying down, shallow breaths. I went to urgent care by the fourth day because the breathing difficulty increased, to the point where it was hard to breathe sitting up. Dr. at the urgent care did chest Xray and EKH, which were both normal. He tested me for COVID-19 and the results were negative. It is now day 7 and I am still having shallow breathing, with what feels like an unclearable chest congestion, and cough.

Reports that after 5-10 min his symptoms improved/resolved, and he has felt fine since. States he is feeling great today.  He was advised by PCP NOT to get the second dose of the vaccine, and if he would like a second opinion, will need to be referred to an allergist. Patient declined referral, leaning towards not getting the second dose.

I slept until Noon on 2/27/21, then was so profoundly fatigued (like having a severe case of influenza, but worse) that I couldn?t even tolerate being anywhere but bed.  I went back to bed at 1:30 pm on 2/27/21 and slept the entire rest of the day and night, with only brief wakings and then falling back asleep.  I had a fever until late in the day, and mild diffuse badly pain.  I have never experienced fatigue that severe in my life.  On 2/28/21, most of the symptoms had resolved except fatigue, which was still moderately severe, so I marked the box saying I haven?t recovered from the adverse effect as of reporting on 2/28/21 at 11:30 pm.

The lymph nodes swelled to roughly marble to golf ball sized protrusions in the occipital region of my head. This swelling as also accompanied by more swelling on the top right side of my head and also my skin began to break due to the swelling. Extreme headaches and swelling only started to subside on the right side of the back of my head after I received a steroid shot at an urgent care clinic. The steroid did not diminish the swelling and extreme pain on the right side of my head. A few days after this, I went to another urgent care clinic which diagnosed me some kind of infection due to the swelling and then prescribed me topical and oral antibiotics. As I right this, over three weeks from my first dose, I have scabbing and still some pain in the right side of my head.

I have experienced some shortness of breath and became quickly exhausted with light physical activity (including standing and walking). These two symptoms appear to be better after 24 hours.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after my second Moderna vaccine, I experienced the typical body aches, chills, headache, and tiredness expected in someone my age (38).  I was initially happy that my immune system seemed to have a positive response to the second dose.  About 24 hours after my second dose, I developed a severe headache and nerve pain all over the right side of my head.  No over the counter medicine would relieve the pain.  The next day, I developed a rash on my forehead.  The rash quickly spread and consumed the right side of my face and my right eye.  I was seen by medical staff, and received a diagnosis of severe shingles.  I was given Valtrex and, eventually, gabapentin.  My eye continued to get worse and I lost clear vision in my right eye.  I saw an ophthalmologist and was told that the shingles had activated in the eye.  My eye pressure was dangerously high.  I was given steroid drops and drops to relieve eye pressure.     Since February 22, I have battled shingles.  My rash is gone and my eye has cleared.  But, I still suffer from intense nerve pain in my head, forehead, and eye.  All medical professionals opined that the moderna vaccine must have played a role given the timing.  If shingles can be considered a side effect, it is one that has been intense and long-lasting.

Patient was sitting crossed legged on the floor with head down.  Asked patient if he wanted 911 called and patient adamantly declined.  Patient was alert and oriented.  Pharmacy gave patient  a water bottle.  Had patient lie back with feet up.  After a few minutes patient started to feel better.  Had patient stand  up and sat patient in the chair in waiting room.  After going into the exam room for a few minutes to get ready for next patient, I went back into waiting room and patient was sitting on the floor again with legs crossed and head down.  Had patient come back to exam room and lie down on exam table with feet up.  After approx. 10 more minutes, patient was standing up in hallway and stated that he was feeling better and would walk around the store.  Patient left the store without checking back in.  Called patient to follow up at end of shift and patient did not answer.  Left a message letting the patient know we were checking on him.

During this time, he saw ENT for a chronic cough pre-dating his first shot and underwent CT to rule out sinus disease which revealed bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. He then underwent 2nd dose and had exact same constellation of symptoms along with worsening of cervical lymphadenopathy and has persistent lymphadenopathy on exam at the time of consultation with infectious disease 3/16/2021) albeit symptoms and lymph nodes are improving.

                                                I began experiencing a high pitched, singular buzzing in my ears the morning after I received the vaccination. It initially started as an intermittent noise that came and went throughout the day.  Unfortunately, the sound level and length of buzzing both increased as the days passed. By Saturday, March 20th, the buzzing was loud and continuous and was affecting my ability to carry out day to day activities. Now. on March 23rd, I hear the buzz whenever I&#39;m awake. It&#39;s now accompanied by a headache that usually begins in the early afternoon. I haven&#39;t been able to find any respite or cure for the noise, and have been taking Tylenol to help the headache and using a white noise machine to help sleep. I&#39;m very, very hesitant to receive the second dose if the ringing may further worsen.

                                                On March 24, 2021, the day of the shot, I only felt soreness in my left arm. The next morning, March 25, 2021, I began to feel body aches, chills, and I was in a cold sweat. I took ibuprofen throughout the day to combat the symptoms. The evening of March 25, 2021, the pain was much more severe (body aches all over my body, including my face, teeth, my hands were sore and stiff, etc.). I did not sleep much of the night because the symptoms were very uncomfortable due to the chills and cold sweats. The morning of March 26, 2021, my left armpit began to swell. By the afternoon, my left armpit (the arm where I received the vaccine) was swollen, tender, and soft. There is some redness and the swelling and tenderness are more pervasive. It is difficult to hang my arm at my side due to the pain and swelling. I understand, after calling the nurse hotline, that this is a common side effect but I also have a skin condition (Hidradenitis Supparativa) and it is difficult to know whether flare-ups are triggered by environmental factors.

                                                Started with the regular symptoms shaking (like with a fever) nausea. Was on a road trip in a snow storm don?t know if it just was a combination of the nausea and the dizziness of the snow flying towards the windshield. But started to feel like throwing up. Pulled over and passed out, my wife says I was shaking. Came back to and throw up a few times.  After that I was just not feeling well and had nausea. Started feeling better later that day.

                                                I had a heart attack or major cardiac stress event after receiving the vaccine . This is concerning because when they did all of their imaging and test my heart is in perfect condition and there are no blockages and there was no reason for this to happen. After the vaccine I was fighting massive fatigue and muscle cramps. In the hospital ran my labs and found out that my potassium had bottomed out to critical level and is very likely the cause of this. But why did the vaccine cause my potassium to bottom out?? I eat healthy and take potassium supplements. I?ve been weight training and competing in bodybuilding and powerlifting competitions for about a decade. So having a healthy diet and understanding nutrition is something that I understand a lot more than the average person.

                                                At 0100, approximately 12hrs after receiving round two of the series, I started shivering uncontrollably. I would characterize this more as spasms than chills. I experienced steady dull muscle ache with occasional sharp jolts of pain, especially in my extremities. My joints began to ache severely and I was unable to sleep.  I registered a fever of 100.3 (my normal temperature is ~97.5). Additionally, I experienced nausea and a moderate headache. I shivered most of the evening and finally got out of bed at 0700. I immediately noticed that I was lethargic and fatigued. My doctor recommended I take 1000mg Tylenol to address the symptoms. This was effective, but only for two hours. After that my symptoms returned - most notably the fever and uncontrollable shivering. Symptoms appear to be declining at this point, approximately 31 hours after injection.

                                                In addition to the (common) side effect of chills and body aches, at around 75 hours after getting the shot I developed extreme gas pains and nausea while running, and barely made it home, collapsing on our floor.  I then suffered severe diarrhea (which had not been listed as a possible side-effect).  It is now five days out, and the diarrhea appears to have abated.  But I continue to have lower abdominal bloating and discomfort.  (I also have painful swollen lymph nodes under the armpit of injection, as I did after the first dose, for at least a week.) Note: These gastrointestinal symptoms are NOT like those I suffer from with gastric dysmotility, which affects my upper GI tract.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported).    On 23-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Mar-2021, the patient experienced BODY TEMPERATURE INCREASED (elevated temperature at night.), BACK PAIN (back pain in his left side.), VOMITING (throw up every hour from waves of pain/vomit every time his pain increased) and NAUSEA (nausea and vomiting that correlated to the dull burning pain). On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced NEPHROLITHIASIS (passed a kidney stone in his urine.) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, NEPHROLITHIASIS (passed a kidney stone in his urine.), BODY TEMPERATURE INCREASED (elevated temperature at night.), BACK PAIN (back pain in his left side.), VOMITING (throw up every hour from waves of pain/vomit every time his pain increased) and NAUSEA (nausea and vomiting that correlated to the dull burning pain) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.

                                                I developed a headache the day of the vaccine.  The headache however has persisted intermittently for several weeks since the vaccination. The headaches are not daily and are generally mild to moderate.  I have had to take Aleve on occasion.  What is unusual is that I rarely used to get headaches.

                                                Besides the usual and expected muscle pain, injection site soreness, and headache, I experienced a mild allergic reaction. Within 5 to 10 minutes after getting the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Lot#, handwritten), I experienced a mild swelling of my face and throat. I noticed the throat swelling when I drank water and also noticed my face tightening up. I have a severe allergic reaction to peaches, so I&#39;m hypersensitive to these types of reactions, and I was a little worried.  My throat and face were swollen for about an hour, but very mild compared to my reaction to peaches,  and it subsided after about 2 hours or so.

After I woke up on Saturday (Days#1) morning I felt weaker with muscle soreness, cold. Before noon, I wrapped my self with clothes and  slept.  My body Temperature measurement (using oral and touch thermometer) started  to increase from 99, 100, 101 to 102 F on multiple different occasions. I was able to eat but with minimal appetite.   Before eating I took Theraflu which contains 650 mg Tylenol it didn&#39;t work well. Until evening I took 2 tabs Tylenol 500 mg , slept for 4 hours,  woke up with sweat, feeling better not very weak and my temperature went down to 99 F.   Took another 2 tabs an hour later and woke up in the morning normal but little bit tired (Day#2).  Monday( Day#3) normal not my usual energy, but better than Day #2.

As a result I felt the need to go to bed early at about 9:30 PM. At about midnight I woke up with severe chills and intense body aches. I didnt get much sleep but the chills went away before 6:00 AM. The achiness remained but not as intense. I then had a migraine with a lost of appetite and more fatigue most of the day on February 10. Around 4:00 PM on the 10th all the symptoms suddenly started to leave and I began to feel normal.

                                                Nurse/doctor hit blood vessel during vaccine injection. I bled afterwards but did not feel it.  Immediately that evening I began to feel symptoms of fatigue. This grew into an overall feeling of sickness and 3 days later, I had major brain fog. This then developed into high anxiety.  However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.

                                                @ 3-5 min... arm started feeling a little sore, like a dead arm. That was the extent of things for a few hours.   @ 4 hours... randomly while doing absolutely nothing started getting short of breath &#43; breathing through a tube feeling &#43; drastically increased brain fog.   @ 11 hours... splitting headache &#43; arm at the injection site painful to the touch &#43; combination of pain/discomfort kept me awake all night despite my sleep Rx for insomnia.   @ 17-18 hours later... leg muscles were sore and achy and cramping if I stayed in any position for too long. Began to feel feverish yet had no temperature (yet). My saturation which frequently drops but always rebounds fairly quickly stayed at about 90% for over an hour.   @ about 20 hours... I began to get swollen lymph nodes and my temperature started climbing into the high 90?s (my ?normal? is around 97° so this made me feel like I was on fire). My SpO2 dropped to 84%... the lowest I?d measured it, even when hospitalized for a week back in December. Everything also felt heavy?every part of my body, anything I?d try to pick up... as of gravity had suddenly increased.   @ 22 hours... low grade fever of 100.2° while on Tylenol... so w/o it likely would have been higher.   @ 24 hours later... (330pm next day) it all really hit me... my saturation dropped to 79%. With otc cans of oxygen it only went up to 84% and kept dropping back to 80%. I was unbearably hot and uncomfortable and sore everywhere, but especially my neck and shoulders. I had zero appetite.   @ 26 hours... chills so bad I couldn?t get warm when wearing a fleece, under 3 blankets, and head covered.   @ 29 hours... so nauseous I couldn?t eat &#43; my temperature (still with Tylenol in my system) peaked at 101°.   @ around hour 30... so unbearably hot had to shed all the layers I?d put on &#43; over me. My temperature was just barley back under 100° at this point (Tylenol still in system).   @ 34 hours... Overnight arm pain &#43; chills retuned to the point woke up from sleep Rx. I had to take more Tylenol due the pain. Got fully dressed with hoodie &#43; fleece on all under my comforter in bed. Despite deep chills my forehead felt like it was literally on fire, but I couldn?t find the thermometer so who knows what my temperature was.   @ 42 hours... dizzy &#43; disoriented &#43; saturation 86% &#43; injection site pain.   @ 48 hours... appetite still suppressed &#43; injection site pain (though less than at worst)

Shoulders are achy.  Thoracic back still mildly painful to touch and feels like it is bruised but there is no discoloration, swelling or otherwise notable signs.  Also had abdominal muscle pain that felt like he was being punched in the stomach - still feels like he did a lot of sit ups.  Still having loss of appetite, loss of taste, and general fatigue.  He took Aleve once with relief of headache but no other doses have been taken.

                                                Around 6:30 pmI began feeling chills and incredibly tired.  I became sore all over and began shaking uncontrollably because of the chills.  I went to sleep around 7pm and woke up 20 minutes laterwith the worst fever I ever had.  I was extremely hot but when I lifted the covers I would immediately get cold.  I got out of bed around 3am because I was very thirsty and completly stuffed up in my head and sinuses.  I used vicks sinex and drank water and tea.  I was very cold when i got out of bed.  I went back to bed and woke up every 30 mins or so very hot and chilly when I lifted the covers.  I finally got out of bed at 6am.  At that point I had sweated through two shirts, my sheets and comforter.  When i got out of bed I was no longer chilly.  I had a mild headache, sinus pressure and soreness throughout my neck and shoulders.  Throughout the day (April 21, 2021) I would get chills and then get hot.  I continued to havce sinus pressure and a mild headache.  I went to bed around 8:30pm and woke up at 3:00am.  when I woke up I had sweated through half my shirt.  At the time of writing (April 22, 2021 @ 6:08am) I feel slight sinus pressure, no headache and get chills and hot from time to time.

The chest tightness would persist after these events for roughly 30 mins. This activity-related chest tightness  continued to occur until the 5th day after the shot.
