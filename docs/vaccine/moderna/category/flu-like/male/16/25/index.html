                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

However, when I received my 2nd shot, I received the Modena manufacturer, and have experienced many concerning side effects. Fever, cold chills, trembling, fatigue, that lasted 2 days after the vaccine was administered. The side effect I am still experiencing is a metallic taste in my mouth, that gets worse when I drink water or other beverages. My hands and fingers turned a rust orange color the day after getting the shot and resolved within 48 hours.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the first dose of my vaccine at about 8:30am on January 12. Around 6pm on January 12 I started to experience chills. As the night went on the chills got worse and I developed a terrible throbbing headache. In addition to that I was feeling hot and sweating profusely. I fell asleep around 10pm and woke up around 11pm, at this time the headache was worse, the chills were getting better, and I was still hot and drenched in sweat. I was able to fall back to sleep shortly after. I then woke up at 1am on the 13th, I still had a headache, the chills were gone, I was still hot and sweaty. At this time I also started vomiting. I preceded to vomit until there was nothing left in me and went back to bed. I woke up at 3am and proceeded to dry heave as there was nothing left to come up. My headache was extremely bad at this point and I was still hot and sweaty. I could not keep down Tylenol so I used a cold wet rag to help with the headache. I was finally able to sleep again. I woke up at 5am still with a headache and still hot at this time I was able to take my temperature and it was 99.8. I fell asleep again and woke up at 9am with a temperature of 100.1, at this time I was able to take Tylenol and keep it down which broke my fever and alleviated the headache. Now at about 1pm on the 13th I am still only able to sip liquids and my stomach is upset. This was the sickest I have been in a long time. I have spoken on the phone with a triage nurse at my doctors office and I am waiting for her to consult with a doctor and call me back.

Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

The story sounds c/w localized vaccine reaction, but the area is indurated/warm, so just in case of cellulitis I plan to treat w/ keflex. I do think there is an inflammatory/allergic component, so I also prescribed topical hydrocortisone for itching. Discussed plan/SRP w/ pt in detail. Answered all questions. Pt verbalized understanding, agreed to plan/SRP, and pt was d/c&#39;ed in stable condition.

All those lasted about 4 days. They really bad ?COVID toes? that were like chlybains and now 3 weeks later look like petechiae on top of toes (reddish - purple , a few are bleeding). By the way I had Mono 13 months ago that was pretty bad and had COVID in November not that severe at all.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

We assessed and then he began to report difficultly breathing and a very difficult time swallowing. Blood pressure was taken and lung sounds assessed. EMS was called.   Epi pen was given. Within 5 minutes he reported feeling much better and no issues with swallowing or breathing. EMS arrived on site and he was transferred to the local hospital.

                                                I received the vaccine through my employer.  7 Days after the vaccination event, my left deltoid muscle became significantly swollen, stiff and tender. There was pain when I tried to elevate the arm laterally. The site was very warm to the touch. I experienced periods of malaise and fatigue at random intervals throughout the week after which I received the vaccine. On day 8, a red rash began to appear on the vaccination site. It was slightly itchy. The area was still stiff and swollen, and painful to move past a certain angle. This night I felt especially fatigued. On day 9 I woke up to see the swelling was mostly subsided, however the rash had spread down the arm to roughly the elbow. The site was no longer warm. It was still slightly irritable. As the day is progressing (this is written on day 9), the rash is starting to fade.

My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

                                                Headache, muscle aches, and fever reaching 101.8 started at around midnight of 1/9/2021, roughly 8 h after receiving the vaccine. The fever broke this morning (1/10/21) so a rough estimate of the time course is 32 h. The fever was also reduced with acetaminophen. The headache still persists, albeit milder. The muscle aches resolved with the fever, so a time course for that would also be 32 h.  I recently had a COVID19 infection (symptom onset was 12/25/20), but had cleared my isolation date of 1/4/21. The symptoms from my COVID19 infection (headache, muscle aches, chills) had virtually resolved by 1/8/21 before I received the vaccine.

This was with chills, extreme fatigue, diaphoresis, nausea, and diarrhea. I realize that these are side effects, but I?m reporting it because I am not going to get the second dose. The effects of the vaccine were worse than when I had covid.

I took ibuprofen, but was later advised against it.  The next day around 1300 i experienced chills and began shaking uncontrollably. It didn&#39;t stop for an hour, where i got incredibly nauseous and tired and slept the rest of the day.  The next day, starting at 0700, i felt the need to vomit and had diarrhea. This continued until i fell asleep at 1030. Afterwards the majority of my problems passed.

I was working at the time and went to my local EMS station to get checked out. They checked my blood pressure and blood sugar. Blood pressure was normal but my blood sugar was low, around 68. They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

The patient came back into the store about on hour later to pick up some things for his pharmacy and reported feeling a little chest pain. The patient was then informed to keep monitoring the pain and if it got any worse to go to the doctors office. About 2 hours later, the patient called when on the way to the emergency room and reported chest pain and a fever of 102 degrees (at the highest). Around 3pm, which was about 6 hours after the vaccination was administered, the patient reported chest pain was alleviated and that the emergency room treated him for a migraine/nausea with Tylenol #3, Fioricet and Zofran.

Additionally, I woke up the morning after to pain in my toe, which spread to my foot and groin lymph nodes. I eventually went to the ER and was told my toe was infected. I had previously had a small cut on my toe and the doctor believes that the inflammatory response my body initiated from the vaccine exacerbated this infection.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

At the time of this writing, my pain has not disappeared but is reducing as anticipated.  Throughout the day of 01/19/2021, I experienced symptoms of a mild fever and proceeded to nap at 5:15 PM.  At 7:30 PM, I was experiencing body chills and felt more defined effects of the fever.  I proceeded to take two Acetaminophen pills by 8:00 PM and my symptoms subsided later into the night.  At the time of this writing, I am only experiencing light headaches (I think) and reduced arm pain.  I believe my fever/body chill symptoms are no longer affecting me.

No fever but intense pain in back. We believe the vaccine may have triggered a sickle cell crisis.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

Headache today is 5/10, right sided, pressure, similar in character to his chronic recurrent headaches.  No nausea, no vomiting.  No respiratory symptoms or swelling.  I offered him Tylenol during his waiting period, and he accepted.

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.

                                                The morning after I received both vaccine shots, I posted hearing from my right ear. The first time I received the vaccine shot, the morning after, I could barely hear out of my right ear.  It almost sounded like there was a clog or earwax build-up. I didn&#39;t really think much of it and it gradually went away several days later. The worst day was the next day after the vaccine and it lasted, even though in a small amount, until 3 days after. The second dose caused the same problem. The morning after the second dose of the vaccine, I lost my hearing in the same way as before. I could barely hear out of my ear, however, I was also exhausted and ended up sleeping most of the day. When I woke up in the afternoon, I couldn&#39;t hear from my right ear, but I could hear better. (maybe 25% back to normal). The two days after the vaccine, my hearing came back way better than the previous time. It felt like 80% back to normal and later in the today, it felt like it up to 95% back to normal. The best way I can describe the feeling was as if the sound was still being received to my hear, but it sounded muffled and turned down. I was still able to hear the deeper sounds during conversations and deeper &#39;beats&#39; in music, but the sharpness of everything was turned off.

I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.
