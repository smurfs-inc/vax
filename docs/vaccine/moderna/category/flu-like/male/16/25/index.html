The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No relevant medical history reported.).    On 02-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site). On 04-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FATIGUE (some fatigue). On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia). At the time of the report, DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia) had resolved and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site) and FATIGUE (some fatigue) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. On 03-Apr-2021, patient took Tylenol for the sore arm. On 09-Apr-2021, patient went to his doctor. He got some blood work done. His A1c was fine, his fasting glucose level was fine. Doctor doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s diabetes but had an episode of hypoglycemia. He also did not rule out possible side effect of the vaccine. He has not had another episode since then. Caller is asking if there have been any other reports of hypoglycemic episodes and also asking if Moderna would recommend getting the second dose given the reaction he had with the first dose.   This case was linked  ( Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was administered I experienced the usual side effects of mild headache, fatigue and localized redness and swelling  Around 11pm the night the vaccine was administered I developed a migraine that resulted in blurred vision. and when I checked my temperature it was approximately 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit.By the next morning, approximately 7am, I was weak to the point I could not get out of bed myself, I was nauseous that resulted in a single Emesis episode approximately 8am, I had mild swelling of my face since 7am, between 7:30am and 12pm, I had multiple times where I would temporarily lose my vision. Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

This slowly got worse, and we called EMS and he was taken to hospital. We are unsure of treatment at the ER, but he was released the same day with the diagnosis of &#34;arm pain&#34; with no mention of it being an adverse reaction from the vaccine.

                                                I received my first vaccine as the Pfizer manufacturer, and did not have any side effects. However, when I received my 2nd shot, I received the Modena manufacturer, and have experienced many concerning side effects. Fever, cold chills, trembling, fatigue, that lasted 2 days after the vaccine was administered. The side effect I am still experiencing is a metallic taste in my mouth, that gets worse when I drink water or other beverages. My hands and fingers turned a rust orange color the day after getting the shot and resolved within 48 hours.

                                                For the first two days a had pain in my left arm but it went away. Around 2pm on that following Sunday (4 days after) I suddenly come down with a fever and headache. I felt so tired, but I took Tylenol and I felt better through the following day. Now, on Tuesday almost a whole week after my shot I get this itching on my chest and arms. Turned out that I got hives, I am not aware of any allergies and I have only broken out into hives one other time in my life and it was 8 years ago and I still do not know the cause. It is now Thursday and the hives have somewhat gone down but I still feel the itchiness around my body. Also to note that the itches are almost about my waist (arms, chest, stomach, back, and neck) I also used the itching cream to relive the itching but I am so tired of the feeling on my body.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the first dose of my vaccine at about 8:30am on January 12. Around 6pm on January 12 I started to experience chills. As the night went on the chills got worse and I developed a terrible throbbing headache. In addition to that I was feeling hot and sweating profusely. I fell asleep around 10pm and woke up around 11pm, at this time the headache was worse, the chills were getting better, and I was still hot and drenched in sweat. I was able to fall back to sleep shortly after. I then woke up at 1am on the 13th, I still had a headache, the chills were gone, I was still hot and sweaty. At this time I also started vomiting. I preceded to vomit until there was nothing left in me and went back to bed. I woke up at 3am and proceeded to dry heave as there was nothing left to come up. My headache was extremely bad at this point and I was still hot and sweaty. I could not keep down Tylenol so I used a cold wet rag to help with the headache. I was finally able to sleep again. I woke up at 5am still with a headache and still hot at this time I was able to take my temperature and it was 99.8. I fell asleep again and woke up at 9am with a temperature of 100.1, at this time I was able to take Tylenol and keep it down which broke my fever and alleviated the headache. Now at about 1pm on the 13th I am still only able to sip liquids and my stomach is upset. This was the sickest I have been in a long time. I have spoken on the phone with a triage nurse at my doctors office and I am waiting for her to consult with a doctor and call me back.

                                                Patient was seen in my office on 1/15/21 due to a reaction from the  covid. Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

                                                I obtained my booster shot on my left deltoid at 2:30 PM 2/4/2021. I had slight soreness in my arm til 8:00 which the soreness disappeared. Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

For the record, I tested positive for Covid in September 2020.  Upon arrival at the ER at Hospital, white cell count was 14.3 and creatinine levels were at a level that the doctors were not comfortable with. Diagnose with Acute Kidney Injury. Tested negative for Covid.  Admitted and started on fluids and antibiotics for an unknown infection.  Clear chest ex-ray and given blood thinners as a precaution.  By Sunday night in the hospital fever was at 104. By Monday midday, fever was finally lower at 100.9 and received another blood thinner shot.  White cell count was 11 at this point.  Doctors wanted me fever free for 24 hours before being discharged.  Blood work still showed an infection and white cell count was still not where they wanted, an infectious diseases doctor was called on Monday.  On Tuesday, March 30, temp was finally within a normal range, kidney function was improved and the infectious diseases doctor finally examined me and determined that this was a very rare reaction to the first dose  of Moderna vaccine due to previous positive Covid in September 2020 .

The herald patch of pityriasis rosea appears 1-20 days before the rash, and I don&#39;t know when it appeared since it was not itchy and on my back, but I did have some mild symptoms such as a mild sore throat that can be early signs of this disease.

All those lasted about 4 days. They really bad ?COVID toes? that were like chlybains and now 3 weeks later look like petechiae on top of toes (reddish - purple , a few are bleeding). By the way I had Mono 13 months ago that was pretty bad and had COVID in November not that severe at all.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

                                                22 Y male with past medical history of environmental allergies presents with a chief complaint of abdominal pain and nausea/ vomiting. He states that on 4/7 he had some nausea and one episode of non bloody nonbilious emesis that morning. He had previously received his first dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine on 4/6. He states this morning he awoke and had significant nausea and abdominal pain and then had approximately 10 episodes of non bloody emesis that eventually became bilious. He did have some diaphoresis. He states that he eventually did have some chest pain that he attributed to all of the vomiting. He went to urgent care and did receive Zofran but this did not alleviate his symptoms. He denies shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, genitourinary symptoms, or other pain. He states that he has been having a few episodes of loose stools, but did not have any bowel movements today. In urgent care CT was performed and was suspicious for pneumomediastinum within the partially imaged lower chest and a CT esophagram was recommended. Patient presented here for CT esophagram. He is admitted for further treatment, and required a three day admission with IVF, and IV narcotics and antiemetics to control his nausea and Abd symptoms. He denied dyspnea. On 4/11 the patient was tolerating a diet and stable to dc home.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Asthma and Eczema.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea). On 09-Apr-2021, DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea) had resolved. At the time of the report, DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) and COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Colonoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) it appeared to be an &#34;ulcerative colitis&#34; on the entire colon.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medication mentioned topical cream NOS for eczema.  Treatment information mentioned IV Methylprednisolone and Metamizole. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Company comments This case concerns a 22-year-old female hospitalized with serious unexpected events of diarrhea hemorrhagic and colitis ulcerative, nonserious unexpected dizziness, malaise, and expected pyrexia, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea. Event onset 24 hours after second dose mRNA-1273. Serious event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I received the vaccine through my employer.  7 Days after the vaccination event, my left deltoid muscle became significantly swollen, stiff and tender. There was pain when I tried to elevate the arm laterally. The site was very warm to the touch. I experienced periods of malaise and fatigue at random intervals throughout the week after which I received the vaccine. On day 8, a red rash began to appear on the vaccination site. It was slightly itchy. The area was still stiff and swollen, and painful to move past a certain angle. This night I felt especially fatigued. On day 9 I woke up to see the swelling was mostly subsided, however the rash had spread down the arm to roughly the elbow. The site was no longer warm. It was still slightly irritable. As the day is progressing (this is written on day 9), the rash is starting to fade.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

                                                Woke up with a headache and fatigue, as well as soreness near area of injection. Energy was very low and felt very tired. Tried to sleep at around 12:00 PM but had a thumping in my head that would not let me fall asleep. Around 3:00 PM tried to sleep again but being shivering/shaking a lot despite being under a blanket and comforter. Eventually needed to take a hot bath for around 45 minutes to an hour. Took my temperature while in the bath which read 96°F (although that thermometer may not be the most accurate.) After the bath I went directly to bed with a comforter, blanket and weighted blanket and was able to fall asleep for about 90 minutes. Was no longer shivering when I awoke and felt much better. Went to sleep at around 9:00 PM and felt fine when I woke up the next morning.

Temperature gradually rose. ~99.7 at 6pm, 100.1 at 7pm, 100.7 at 8pm, 101.7 at 9:30pm. I took some Tylenol around 7pm, and then some theraflu at 10pm.   Fell asleep at 11pm. Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.  Taking another day off from work. Temperature is currently 100.0. Taking more theraflu now, have not taken Tylenol today.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the events, included allergy medication unspecified.  On unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10-FEB-2021, after vaccination, the patient experienced faint, migraine, dizzy, fatigue, disoriented, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea and slight fever. Treatment  for the event included Ibuprofen and Excedrin.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The event of faint was considered recovered. The outcome for the events of migraine, dizziness, fatigue, disoriented (disorientation), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), nausea, and slight fever (pyrexia) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Headache, muscle aches, and fever reaching 101.8 started at around midnight of 1/9/2021, roughly 8 h after receiving the vaccine. The fever broke this morning (1/10/21) so a rough estimate of the time course is 32 h. The fever was also reduced with acetaminophen. The headache still persists, albeit milder. The muscle aches resolved with the fever, so a time course for that would also be 32 h.  I recently had a COVID19 infection (symptom onset was 12/25/20), but had cleared my isolation date of 1/4/21. The symptoms from my COVID19 infection (headache, muscle aches, chills) had virtually resolved by 1/8/21 before I received the vaccine.

This was with chills, extreme fatigue, diaphoresis, nausea, and diarrhea. I realize that these are side effects, but I?m reporting it because I am not going to get the second dose. The effects of the vaccine were worse than when I had covid.

I took ibuprofen, but was later advised against it.  The next day around 1300 i experienced chills and began shaking uncontrollably. It didn&#39;t stop for an hour, where i got incredibly nauseous and tired and slept the rest of the day.  The next day, starting at 0700, i felt the need to vomit and had diarrhea. This continued until i fell asleep at 1030. Afterwards the majority of my problems passed.

I was working at the time and went to my local EMS station to get checked out. They checked my blood pressure and blood sugar. Blood pressure was normal but my blood sugar was low, around 68. They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

                                                The patient was administered the vaccination, observed for 15 minutes following the vaccination, after which he left to return to work at a pharmacy. The patient came back into the store about on hour later to pick up some things for his pharmacy and reported feeling a little chest pain. The patient was then informed to keep monitoring the pain and if it got any worse to go to the doctors office. About 2 hours later, the patient called when on the way to the emergency room and reported chest pain and a fever of 102 degrees (at the highest). Around 3pm, which was about 6 hours after the vaccination was administered, the patient reported chest pain was alleviated and that the emergency room treated him for a migraine/nausea with Tylenol #3, Fioricet and Zofran.

                                                Headache, fever, chills, fatigue around 18 hours after shot. Additionally, I woke up the morning after to pain in my toe, which spread to my foot and groin lymph nodes. I eventually went to the ER and was told my toe was infected. I had previously had a small cut on my toe and the doctor believes that the inflammatory response my body initiated from the vaccine exacerbated this infection.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

At the time of this writing, my pain has not disappeared but is reducing as anticipated.  Throughout the day of 01/19/2021, I experienced symptoms of a mild fever and proceeded to nap at 5:15 PM.  At 7:30 PM, I was experiencing body chills and felt more defined effects of the fever.  I proceeded to take two Acetaminophen pills by 8:00 PM and my symptoms subsided later into the night.  At the time of this writing, I am only experiencing light headaches (I think) and reduced arm pain.  I believe my fever/body chill symptoms are no longer affecting me.

No fever but intense pain in back. We believe the vaccine may have triggered a sickle cell crisis.

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

                                                The day following my first COVID vaccination, I had pain in my upper arm for 36 hours and could not lift it above my shoulder. I also experienced 6 hours of constant chills throughout my body, which came on suddenly around 1PM (24 hours after my vaccination) and was sent home early from work. During the 6 hours at home I believe I experienced body chills, I experienced what I believe to be brain fog. My coworkers described my motor skills (walking down a hallway) as slow and lethargic, and my thoughts being delayed. I do not consciously remember the 6 hour timeframe when I experienced these symptoms. Around 7PM that evening, I remember having a &#34;coming to&#34; moment where I remember the chills subsiding, and being able to think again.  The following day I felt back to normal other than pain at the injection site.

I fell back asleep, woke up at 9:00 AM and was hungry again so I ate more food. I became hungry again at 12:00 PM and ate again. At 2:00 PM the body aches returned, I took two 500mg  acetaminophen tablets and fell asleep until 3:30 PM. At 4:00 PM I became hungry again and ate. At 6:00 PM I ate another meal. At 9:00 PM I took two 500mg  acetaminophen tablets and went to sleep. When I woke up the next day all symptoms had subsided.

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.

It was bad enough to halt daily activities (I canceled a phd interview because of how bad I felt).  This occurred from late 2/4 through morning of 2/6. Taking tylenol seemed to help and I felt immensely better the two or three times my fever broke.

Member went to urgent care and was advised to buy Zyrtec which he stated helped. Member has since recovered and is doing fine.

                                                The morning after I received both vaccine shots, I posted hearing from my right ear. The first time I received the vaccine shot, the morning after, I could barely hear out of my right ear.  It almost sounded like there was a clog or earwax build-up. I didn&#39;t really think much of it and it gradually went away several days later. The worst day was the next day after the vaccine and it lasted, even though in a small amount, until 3 days after. The second dose caused the same problem. The morning after the second dose of the vaccine, I lost my hearing in the same way as before. I could barely hear out of my ear, however, I was also exhausted and ended up sleeping most of the day. When I woke up in the afternoon, I couldn&#39;t hear from my right ear, but I could hear better. (maybe 25% back to normal). The two days after the vaccine, my hearing came back way better than the previous time. It felt like 80% back to normal and later in the today, it felt like it up to 95% back to normal. The best way I can describe the feeling was as if the sound was still being received to my hear, but it sounded muffled and turned down. I was still able to hear the deeper sounds during conversations and deeper &#39;beats&#39; in music, but the sharpness of everything was turned off.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.
