                                                My son is 16 years of age and was given the Moderna vaccine despite it only being approved for patients over the age of 18. He is experiencing mild fatigue post injection and some soreness at the site. My main concern is the second injection that is scheduled for April 15th at the same location. Should he continue with the course and get the 2nd shot of Moderna? I have been trying to speak to medical center regarding this because not only was his age stated at the appointment and he was found in the medical center system, but he provided id to a woman with the title of director who did not catch it.

He then received the vaccine.  He is not as energetic as normal, lethargic, sitting, resting, no activity, very tired, sore arm, maybe low grade fever.     The facility did not tell them anything to do about giving him the wrong vaccine, father said very cavalier.  They told them to come back in 28 days on 6/16/21 for the 2nd vaccine of Moderna.   The facility supposedly reported the error.     Father states that the facility told him that the Moderna vaccine was going to be approved very shortly, there were no issues with it, they are all the same, and that he should not have any side effects, and to return to get the 2nd Moderna shot in 28 days.

Color drained from my face and I also began to lose track of the conversation I was having. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace of the conversation and eventually realized I couldn&#39;t remember what we were talking about. Looking back on the event now, I could only remember what was happening for around. 2 minute span before I forgot it. After losing my ability to form new memories, I began to lose old ones. I would look through pictures and not recognize faces, listen to songs and not remember the artists, and lose entire gaps of my past. My parents described my memory loss as that of a concussion but, to be frank, I don&#39;t remember much of any of it. All of my past memories have returned, but I still have yet to regain my memory from 2 PM to 10 PM of that day.

                                                History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 18 y.o. male with no pertinent past medical history who presents to the ED with complaints of chest pain.     The patient notes that he started noticing chest pain this AM after he woke up that is associated with nausea.  The pain is described to be in the center of his chest and is persistent.  EMS was called who administered 2 SL NTG and 1 dose of ASA 325 mg.     He notes that he received his 2nd Moderna vaccine on Thursday April 15th.  He is currently a senior in High school.  He had no adverse reactions to his 1st dose of the Moderna vaccine but after the 2nd dose he notes that he was having fever, malaise, body aches, and decreased appetite.  He also tells me that he has been so fatigued that he has not really gotten out of bed in the last 48 hours.  In regards to his oral intake he had (1) 16.9 oz bottle of water yesterday and nothing else but did have a glass of orange juice and some cereal this morning.   During my evaluation with the patient he notes that he is still having chest pain that he reports to be retrosternal any 5/10 in severity.  He denies any radiation into the left arm or jaw.  He feels the pain is worse with movement and better when he is resting.  He has had associated nausea and shortness of breath.  He has been having low-grade fevers at home but denies any coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria, burning or itching with urination, congestion, rhinorrhea.   He denies any tobacco use, drug use, alcohol use.   In the emergency department initial workup is notable for potassium 3.6, magnesium 1.7, phosphorus less than 1, troponin 7206 with repeat at 10,212.  CPK noted to be 380.  Initial EKG was nonischemic.  COVID swab was noted to be negative.     After I evaluated the patient around 1520 an RRT was called due to hypotension and bradycardia.  His blood pressure had dropped to 80/40 and heart rate was in the low 50s and he was symptomatic with diaphoresis and feeling as if he was going to pass out.  1L fluid was given running wide open.  Repeat EKG did show some diffuse ST segment elevations concerning for pericarditis.  Cardiology and ICU team were notified and evaluated the patient.  Response is likely that the be vasovagal from acute pain.     History obtained from:  ? patient                    ? outpatient clinicians  ? family                                  ? staff at facility  ? other                                   ? review of medical record as summarized below   Pt unable to provide reliable history because: ?

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No relevant medical history reported.).    On 02-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site). On 04-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FATIGUE (some fatigue). On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia). At the time of the report, DEPRESSED LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS (seemed to almost fall asleep and become unconscious like) and HYPOGLYCAEMIA (hypoglycemia) had resolved and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (sore arm at injection site) and FATIGUE (some fatigue) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. On 03-Apr-2021, patient took Tylenol for the sore arm. On 09-Apr-2021, patient went to his doctor. He got some blood work done. His A1c was fine, his fasting glucose level was fine. Doctor doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s diabetes but had an episode of hypoglycemia. He also did not rule out possible side effect of the vaccine. He has not had another episode since then. Caller is asking if there have been any other reports of hypoglycemic episodes and also asking if Moderna would recommend getting the second dose given the reaction he had with the first dose.   This case was linked  ( Linked Report).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The client affirmed that these symptoms started within a 4-hour period after receiving the vaccine, but after he had left the vaccination center.  He said that the symptoms lasted about 2 hours and then resolved.  He reported that he did not seek medical care.  Vaccination with the 2nd dose of Moderna was deferred and client was directed to see one of the allergists here  for evaluation prior to getting any additional COVID19 vaccinations- he said that he could do this and he was given the names of the allergists and instructed to call them or his family doctor (he has one).

He slumped in his char, nearly falling to the floor, but was caught by a nearby patient who noticed patient falling. Patient was assisted by staff to lie down on a cot. At that time he regained consciousness and was able to state his name. Staff attempted to check his blood pressure, but the electronic cuff was unable to measure b/p despite multiple attempts. Because of this, and persistent pallor, drowsiness and low pulse, EMS (who was standing by in the parking lot) was requested to enter the building to assess the patient. After evaluating him within the vaccination site for approximately 30 minutes, patient was transported to the hospital due to persistent low pulse and low blood pressure.

                                                Patient received second Materna vaccine 5/28/2021 around 630 pm.  Around 10 PM felt fatigue and headache.  Felt very fatigued and unwell and slept most of 5/29 - 5/30. On 5/31, began experiencing chest discomfort radiating to left arm and palpitations.  Presented to hospital which was notable for abnormal EKG with diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions, troponin peak of 25.  TTE revealed low normal systolic function with EF 50%, no valvular disease or wall motion abnormalities.  Cardiac MRI revealed subepicardial delayed myocardial enhancement in the mid, apex lateral wall of the left ventricle and adjacent pericardium consistent with myopericarditis.  Patient was treated with colchicine and improved.  Infectious work-up for cardiotropic viruses were sent, viral swab was notable for positive rhinovirus/enterovirus.  Patient&#39;s presentation and timing of vaccine should be looked into as it is unclear wheter this presentation can be entirely due to presence of virus as above.  This is notably at least the second presentation of teenager with myopericarditis on this cardiology service in the past 2 weeks in setting of recent Covid vaccination.

                                                I got the injection at 3:35pm on 1/20 in my left arm. Within the first 30 minutes, my shoulder around the injection site was incredibly sore, my left elbow had a lot of joint pain, and my left thumb and index fingers went numb within the first 30 minutes, I woke up at 8:00am on 1/21 and noticed that I had a light headache, felt extremely groggy, and was experiencing an uncomfortable amount of muscular and joint pain. I went to work at 9:00 and on the drive there, I began to feel dizzy and I felt as if when I turned my head, my vision would lag behind and take a second to process my surroundings. By 10:00, my muscular and joint pains were significantly amplified, my headaches were increasing in frequency and amplitude. I also began to have the chills, followed by periods of radiating heat from my body. Coworkers told me I looked very flushed, however, I never developed a fever. By 11:00, the muscular and joint pains, coupled with the headaches forced me to sit down and I almost broke down into tears. There were three sperate times where I began to get very lightheaded and thought I was going to pass out ( I did not). I went home at noon and noticed that my muscles felt like they were on fire. I took Tylenol and Advil whenever I could, which helped to reduce the symptoms.  we had dinner at 7:00, however, I had no appetite, without eating since noon. On 1/22, I woke up at 8:30 with a pounding headache, muscular and joint pains still there, however reduced, and the same groggy feeling. This morning, I also noticed that I had a very sharp stomach pain in my abdomen. I also woke up with a severe nosebleed, which is extremely uncommon for me.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine was administered I experienced the usual side effects of mild headache, fatigue and localized redness and swelling  Around 11pm the night the vaccine was administered I developed a migraine that resulted in blurred vision. and when I checked my temperature it was approximately 104.9 degrees Fahrenheit.By the next morning, approximately 7am, I was weak to the point I could not get out of bed myself, I was nauseous that resulted in a single Emesis episode approximately 8am, I had mild swelling of my face since 7am, between 7:30am and 12pm, I had multiple times where I would temporarily lose my vision. Throughout 1/25 I continued to have a fever ranging from 102 degrees Fahrenheit to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At approximately 8am and 1pm I took two acetaminophen pills each time which alleviated the migraine and to an extent helped with the visual deficit episodes. Throughout 1/24 and 1/25 I suffered with extreme chills resulting in shivering that lasted for several minutes despite a room temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit and covered in two blankets. PCP was consulted via telephone and she advised to go to the hospital via EMS given the high grade fever, abnormal vitals and severity of symptoms

I was advised to seek immediate medical attention, so I had an RA at my university dorm walk with me across the street to M Health Fairview hospital. I was seen by an RN in their emergency room, but was ultimately never seen by a Doctor as I did not present a clear risk of anaphylaxis at the time. After waiting in the ER for four hours for medical care, I ultimately left because most of my symptoms subsided. My most lasting symptoms cleared up late yesterday (1/25) and they were extreme soreness/tenderness at injection site and fatigue.

                                                I received my first vaccine as the Pfizer manufacturer, and did not have any side effects. However, when I received my 2nd shot, I received the Modena manufacturer, and have experienced many concerning side effects. Fever, cold chills, trembling, fatigue, that lasted 2 days after the vaccine was administered. The side effect I am still experiencing is a metallic taste in my mouth, that gets worse when I drink water or other beverages. My hands and fingers turned a rust orange color the day after getting the shot and resolved within 48 hours.

This slowly got worse, and we called EMS and he was taken to hospital. We are unsure of treatment at the ER, but he was released the same day with the diagnosis of &#34;arm pain&#34; with no mention of it being an adverse reaction from the vaccine.

                                                Vaccine was administered to patient.  Within 10 minutes of administration, the patient had an episode of syncope and fell out of his chair.  I immediately went out to help the patient and a technician called for EMS.  The patient woke up within 2 minutes and reported feeling dizzy, tired, and numb. While waiting for EMS to arrive, the patient was situated in a sitting position and I continued talking to him to keep him awake. EMS assessed him and took him out to the ambulance to wait for a relative to come.  It is unknown if the patient went to the emergency room or not.

Unable to sleep but very tired. Not able to breather through nose. Sore and numb right arm. Tingling of my limbs. Occasionally sharp pain in muscles. I got the shot at 11 and was just fine but I had work. I drove for a little over an hour and progressively my arm got weaker. I did physical labor until 10 pm and then started some school work, but found my arm almost unable to move and my mood was deteriorating. When I went to bed and lied down, it hit me. It is 4 am and it is still going strong.

These symptoms lasted for roughly 26 hours. At that point, the fever and body aches went away. Currently, 4 days after vaccination, I am still dealing with a persistent cough and congestion.

He was fine and they cleared him. Neither he or ems felt it was necessary to transport him to the hospital. I called him later in the day and he was feeling fine.

                                                Patient experienced loss of consciousness after administration of vaccine.  This happened within 45 seconds of administration.  This happened 3 separate times within a 5-10 minute time frame.  No signs of anaphylaxis were identified during this time.  Patient would &#34;faint&#34; briefly (approximately 10 seconds) and then regain consciousness and confirm that he had no symptoms of anaphylaxis.  Symptoms observed were loss of color of the face and lips and some diaphoresis.  The patient was monitored for any changes and EMS was called.  The patient refused EMS service or hospital service.  He stated that the &#34;fainting&#34; happened to him regularly whenever he received a vaccine.   The total time of the event was approximately 30 minutes and the patient was advised to stay longer for monitoring if he would refuse EMS service, which he did.  The patient has since been called and is currently feeling &#34;normal except for being somewhat tired&#34;.  He has been advised to follow up with his primary care.

                                                Patient had parked in the COVID vaccine waiting area, and was observed to fall forward onto his steering wheel within a few minutes of parking by 2 other participants waiting in the car next to him. One of them immediately notified one of the parking lot volunteers who came and got me within 1 minute of this observation. 2 students and I came quickly to the open drivers side door and began talking to assess the situation. Mr. Bannister appeared pale, mildly diaphoretic (sweating) and slightly confused as to the passage of time, but was able to state and spell his name and talk coherently about his circumstances. He stated that he was not allergic to anything that he knew about, and that he had no prior history of similar reactions to vaccines or medicines although he had not taken any shots in several years. He noted that he had not eaten anything since breakfast (now mid-afternoon). He described himself as initially feeling weak, faint, and nauseated with his vaccinated arm feeling heavy and numb. He also reported that he had a sensation of blurriness before passing out, but denied any spinning sensation, visual loss or ringing in the ears. There were no obviously visible abrasions or bleeding on his face or forehead. The nursing students brought a chair, and we elevated his legs and gave him some water to drink during the time we were monitoring his vital signs. He refused a cupcake because of the nausea, but as time progressed he gained facial color and was more comfortable in conversing. His hands had equal muscle grip and strength, visible fingernail beds were pink and his capillary refill was less than 3 seconds. Towards the end of our monitoring, he did accept some nuts and M &amp; Ms to eat. A University Safety Medical Report was completed by the appropriate safety personnel. He was fully AAO x 3 at the end of our monitoring, and stated that if he felt better he would drive to his apartment (less than 5 minutes away) but would wait for his girlfriend to get out of class if he did not feel fully capable of driving. We encouraged him to eat something light when he got home, to use cool water/warm water soaks at his shot site, exercise his arm, and to take an NSAID for pain relief the next day. We recommended that he eat something light before his second shot (which had already been scheduled), that he bring someone with him the next time, and as a precaution to wait 30 minutes following the second shot. He left at 3: 15 pm driving his car without any apparent difficulties. An online report was completed for the incident 04/20/2021.

                                                i had regular symptoms the day of and after my vaccine. Headaches, body ache, tired, sore arm, slight difficulty breathing, and slightly faster heart rate. Those didn&#39;t really concern me since i took it as the vaccine is working like it?s supposed to. but starting yesterday when i woke up until this moment i?ve had a really weird pinching feeling by my heart and the side of my rib cage on the left side of my chest. that?s the only thing scaring me now since my other side effects have already gone away.

I asked him if he was ok and he said that we was dizzy and wanted water. I had him sit down. I had my coworker 911 and I got him a bottle of water. He was sweating but felt better after drinking water. He reported to the Firemen that he had not eaten or drank that day yet. I asked him if he was feeling anxious and he said yes. The paramedics arrived and they checked his blood pressure. They said he looked good and was ok to leave.

                                                For the first two days a had pain in my left arm but it went away. Around 2pm on that following Sunday (4 days after) I suddenly come down with a fever and headache. I felt so tired, but I took Tylenol and I felt better through the following day. Now, on Tuesday almost a whole week after my shot I get this itching on my chest and arms. Turned out that I got hives, I am not aware of any allergies and I have only broken out into hives one other time in my life and it was 8 years ago and I still do not know the cause. It is now Thursday and the hives have somewhat gone down but I still feel the itchiness around my body. Also to note that the itches are almost about my waist (arms, chest, stomach, back, and neck) I also used the itching cream to relive the itching but I am so tired of the feeling on my body.

                                                Patient reports routinely having spells of syncope with injections and still insisted on receiving COVID-19 vaccination. Gave injection into left deltoid. Had patient scoot up to table in immunization room with both legs fully under the table just in case there was an issue. I set the timer for 15 minutes and left him in the immunization room with his girlfriend, who also received a vaccine. A few moments later the girlfriend asked for our help stating he was feeling like he was going to pass out. I went into the IMZ room and checked with him. At the time, he was sweaty with a rapid hearbeat. I instructed him to take some deep breaths and went to get a cold paper towel to apply to his head. When I returned he had passed out, not responsive but still breathing, in his chair and his girlfriend was holding his head in her hand. We gently lowered his head to rest on the table while another associate called 911 per girlfriend&#39;s request. He began moaning a few moments later and was able to talk to us. He was very hot and sweaty, light headed and breathing rapidly. We applied a cooling pack to his forhead as he continued to lie his head on the table. He then said he might feel more comfortable lying on the floor. We assisted him to the floor, elevated his feet on a chair and placed his head on a roll of paper towels. At that time the paramedics showed up and said his blood pressure was fine and he was just having some hyperventilation. The paramedics got him back up in the chair and his girlfriend got him some apply juice. After about 30 minutes he was talking fine, shaking had stopped and his breathing a temp went back to normal

The fatigue started the day after the vaccine and lasted for about 4 days. The lymph nodes became swollen 3 days after the vaccine was administered and stayed swollen about one week. They were very sore, even turning the neck hurt, and this lasted for about 4-5 days.

                                                My 20-year-old son received his first Moderna shot on March 16, 2021, at his college health clinic with no obvious side effects. He received the second Moderna shot at the same location on April 13, 2021. On the morning of April 14, 2021, he began running a high fever with repetitive vomiting and stomach cramping. He did not immediately seek medical attention because he had been told of side effects of the vaccine. When it was no longer tolerable, he reported to the local ER where it was later discovered he had a 4 mm kidney stone, which he passed two days later. We were told that the kidney stone would likely have begun forming about 31 days earlier, which would approximately coincide with his first COVID injection. There is no family history on either side of any kidney stones in the family. While my son&#39;s lifestyle may introduce some risk factors for kidney stones, I felt it was reasonable to report it as potentially relating to the vaccine.

                                                Admission HPI: Right-sided chest pain began 2 days prior to admission (3/19) after getting out of car, without identifiable trigger. Pain was sharp, pleuritic, and worst with movement; didn&#39;t feel it when still. Pain not responsive to ibuprofen or heating packs. Reported 30-60 seconds of self-resolving heart racing during ocular migraine which has been his baseline for years. Not associated with SOB (at rest or with exercise), palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. No viral URI symptoms, N/V, or rash. He did receive his 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine about 1 week PTA, followed by 36hrs of fevers, chills, and body aches. Given persistence of pain, Patient asked his parents to present to urgent care.   In UC, he was noted to tachycardic with CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and b/l effusions, per report. Given continued tachycardia, decision was made to transfer to ED to r/o PE.      In ED, tachycardic to 104-116 and tachypneic 22-26. Had one episode of tachycardia to 182 iso ocular migraine. Endorsed chest pain but points to R middle abdomen when asked where worst. Exam was unremarkable. He received 1 dose of morphine which reduced pain from 10/10 to 0/10. Labs notable for leukocytosis (14.61), thrombocytopenia (422), elevated d-dimer (1.56), and elevated CRP (5.6). Otherwise normal chem and coags. COVID/RVP negative. CXR unremarkable. CTPA showed scattered PEs in b/l lower lobes with small pulmonary infarct in RML. No evidence of right heart strain. Heme was consulted who recommended starting him on lovenox and sending lupus anti-coagulant. Cardiology was consulted who recommended EKG, BNP, and troponin, all of which were normal and reassuring against right heart strain. ECHO was therefore deferred to the AM. The decision was made to admit.   Upon arrival to the floor, Patient was tachycardic 114 and tachypneic to 22, otherwise stable vitals. He denied any pain since morphine. Denied any unexpected weight loss; reports that car ride was short. Mom reports that Patient has been less active d/t cold weather and baseball being on hold. Denies family or personal history of clots. Last seizure ~13 years ago.  Hospital Course: (3/21 - 3/22)  Patient was admitted to the hematology service. He was therapeutically anticoagulated with LMWH injections and his anti-Xa level prior to discharge was 0.92. (goal 0.5-1.0) Lower extremity ultrasound with Doppler showed patent veins and no evidence of DVT and upper extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, though there was potential evidence of collateralization seen in mid and distal third of right subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Since this was an unprovoked PE, a full thrombophilia workup was sent and will be followed up by the outpatient hematology clinic. Cardiology consulted regarding possibility of right heart strain and the tachycardia during migraine episodes. Echocardiogram performed on 3/22 was technically limited but showed no gross abnormalities. The cardiology team requested a repeat echo scheduled outpatient for 1-2 months after discharge.

                                                As with the first shot, I was very fatigued and achy.  A day or two after the shot I began having pain in the left side of my chest.  It was a tight feeling that made it difficult to breathe.  The pain only got worse and after a couple of days, I decided to go to the emergency room as I feared I was having some kind of heart attack.

                                                Awoke with incapacitating headache the day after the second dose. Headache has still persisted at the time of this report but has gone down in severity and is accompanied by a feeling of pressure in the head. Severe brain fog also started the day after second dose. Brain fog still continues but is intermittent and gets worse when other symptoms do. Profound fatigue started the day after the second dose and still continues and leaves me mostly housebound. Multiple episodes of post-exertional malaise have occurred in which symptoms are severely exacerbated after mental or physical exertion. I am now unable to exercise.

He went to work and began to feel worse.  His co-workers noticed that he was not completing his paperwork correctly and he struggled doing his daily tasks.  He stated he felt like he was going to pass out and was out of breath.  His supervisor sent him home.  He attempted to drive home and swerved off the road.  He parked his car and got a ride home.  He slept for several hours.  He stated he is feeling better this evening.  Now he has a headache, but does not have dizziness, unsteady gait, or feeling like he will pass out.  I advised him that headache is a possible side effect of the vaccine, but the other symptoms are uncommon.  I asked him to seek medical attention if the symptoms come back.  He voiced understanding.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the first dose of my vaccine at about 8:30am on January 12. Around 6pm on January 12 I started to experience chills. As the night went on the chills got worse and I developed a terrible throbbing headache. In addition to that I was feeling hot and sweating profusely. I fell asleep around 10pm and woke up around 11pm, at this time the headache was worse, the chills were getting better, and I was still hot and drenched in sweat. I was able to fall back to sleep shortly after. I then woke up at 1am on the 13th, I still had a headache, the chills were gone, I was still hot and sweaty. At this time I also started vomiting. I preceded to vomit until there was nothing left in me and went back to bed. I woke up at 3am and proceeded to dry heave as there was nothing left to come up. My headache was extremely bad at this point and I was still hot and sweaty. I could not keep down Tylenol so I used a cold wet rag to help with the headache. I was finally able to sleep again. I woke up at 5am still with a headache and still hot at this time I was able to take my temperature and it was 99.8. I fell asleep again and woke up at 9am with a temperature of 100.1, at this time I was able to take Tylenol and keep it down which broke my fever and alleviated the headache. Now at about 1pm on the 13th I am still only able to sip liquids and my stomach is upset. This was the sickest I have been in a long time. I have spoken on the phone with a triage nurse at my doctors office and I am waiting for her to consult with a doctor and call me back.

Reports that &#34;3 of the reserve doctors were running a covid vaccine clinic and were giving the injections themselves.&#34; He reports that he &#34;received the first dose/shot in his left arm then about an hour later received the second dose/shot in his right arm.&#34; This happened on Saturday 1/9/21 in the evening and he reports his symptoms started late Sunday night/early Monday morning and were significant by later in the day Monday 1/11/21; he reports he had severe headaches, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, numbness and tingling in both arms from injections sites to forearms, &#34;felt like he was going to die.&#34; He is unsure if he had a fever because he did not check it. He reports his symptoms improved on Wednesday and &#34;were pretty much gone by Thursday.&#34; At his appointment on with me on Friday 1/15/21 he had no symptoms and his physical exam was normal. No injection site irritation and normal neuro exam. He reports he &#34;notified the reserve doctors about his reaction and symptoms and was told at that time that he was given the vaccine incorrectly because both doses were given at once instead of a few weeks apart.&#34; He reports his comrades that also had the vaccine given incorrectly on Saturday &#34;were also really sick&#34; but states that &#34;by Sunday the doctors realized their mistake and were giving the doses correctly just one at a time.&#34;

                                                I obtained my booster shot on my left deltoid at 2:30 PM 2/4/2021. I had slight soreness in my arm til 8:00 which the soreness disappeared. Around 2:00 AM, I was awakened by a pounding headache, fever of 102, and my upper left chest (unilateral between the midline of my left chest and the axillary region) started to hurt. I took Tylenol 1000 mg at 3 and took a hot bath (recommended by  friend who also displayed a fever and headache). After a while, my fever began to lower but my headache and chest pain did not disappear and I could not sleep until 7 AM. I woke up today (2/5/2021) at 10 AM with a fever of 101.4, another pounding headache, and still unilateral chest pain. I took another 1000 mg of Tylenol around 10:30 AM and it only helped with the fever. I went back to sleep and slept until 4 PM. I understand that the fever and headache are normal symptoms but my chest pain does not seem like muscle soreness. It doesn&#39;t hurt when I touch it, it comes and goes every few seconds, I have 4 or 5/ 10 on the pain scale for most of the pain but it turns into 6 or 7/10 occasionally (10 being the worst pain). What does help with my pain when it is 6 or 7/10 is when I clench my chest really hard like I am flexing it. It is a sharp pain that stays for a few seconds before it disappears and it feels like a deep pain. I didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol again because I am about to max out (can only take 2 more capsules until 2:00 AM because it states not to take more than 6 capsules in 24 hours, and each capsule is 500 mg) (Also, the Tylenol does not help with the pain so I am only taking it for my fever.) I was wondering if anyone else reported this and if this is an adverse side effect.  This has not cause any issues regarding my breathing but just pain.

                                                I almost fainted the night after my shot. I had vaped cannabis prior at around 1:00am, and probably re-dosed at around 3:00AM, before falling asleep at around 4:30AM. I had a harder than normal time falling asleep that night, and I didn&#39;t sleep very well. At around 6:00AM I woke up and walked to the bathroom, feeling pain in my anal region. As I started to sweat profusely, I recognized that I was likely about to faint, so I pre-emptively lied down on the floor of the bathroom until I felt well enough to stand up. I don&#39;t remember exactly how long I was on the floor but most likely a few minutes. I then had a bowel movement, still feeling pain in my anal region but to a lesser degree, and then drank some water and went back to sleep at around 6:30AM.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.

The consumer reported that eight of ten people that were at girlfriend&#39;s house, contracted the COVID virus. The consumer stated that the patient had fever, a hard time breathing, and chest congestion. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of events, chest congestion, Contracted COVID three weeks after second dose/exposed to someone with COVID, hard time breathing, and fever were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and the known safety profile of the vaccine, a causal association between the event of fever and mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The event of COVID s not consistent with the vaccine profile and is of an infective etiology, hence assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Pulmonary congestion and dyspnea are assessed as symptoms of COVID-19 also assessed as unlikely related.

                                                While giving the patient his first vaccination, the needle was not properly secured to the syringe and the two parts separated while giving the vaccine. He got at least part of the dose, but we discussed giving him a second shot so he could receive the full dose. The patient seemed fine so I went to draw up the next dose, and as I was doing that, he started to get a little pale and said he was not feeling well. I gave him some water and sat with him while he was in a chair. He then began to fall forward and was unconscious. I caught him before he hit the ground, laid him down on his side, and he woke up fairly quickly after. We did not administer the rest of the dose and the patient waited around the pharmacy for 30 minutes, but he stated he felt much better with no concerns fairly quickly after the reaction.

Suddenly while he was sitting in the waiting room His eyes began to roll back into his head, his head dropped and his body tensed up and he began to shake. The event lasted approximately 30 and then the patient became alert and oriented again. When he became alert again he seemed very sweaty and pale. Nurse Practitioner took blood pressure and it was 100/58. Paramedics arrived on scene approximately 5 minutes after and transported him to the hospital.

                                                He had Moderna vaccine #2 on 5/13/2021. The day after the vaccination he had fevers and chills.  Two days after his vaccination (5/15/2021) he developed mild midsternal chest pain. This worsened and on 5/16/2021 he felt like someone was sitting on his chest. This pain was worse with deep breaths and radiated to his shoulders. He sought care at an urgent care clinic where EKG unexpectedly showed diffuse ST elevations. He was referred to the ED where he had an elevated troponin and there was concern for myocarditis.    TTE done showed a normal ejection fraction and normal heart valves.    He denies recent illnesses. He denies recent sore throats or skin infections. He works in the hospitality industry but denies known recent COVID-19 infection.    Since admission he was seen by cardiology and was started on colchicine, indomethacin, and protonix. Telemetry has been reassuring. He reports feeling much better.

                                                For the next few days after I received the second dose of the vaccine, I experienced muscle and body aces, fatigue, and a low grade fever. About 3 days after getting the vaccine I woke up at about 2 AM on the 18th with severe chest pain, the other side effects had subsided at this point. I ended up going to the ER after about a half hour of the pain not going away. They ran a Troponin blood test and foinf my levels to be high. They also tested me for Covid which came back positive. They ended up doing an ultrasound of my heart, using a catheter to take a look at my arteries, a chest xray, a CT scan, and an EKG. The final diagnosis was myocarditis of the heart. I had to stay in the hospital for a few days while my heart stabilized. I was given orders to only participate in light exercise and to take it easy for now. I have a follow up visit with the cardiologist in about a week frok now. It was also found out through testing that I may have Wolf Parkinson&#39;s white syndrome.

The herald patch of pityriasis rosea appears 1-20 days before the rash, and I don&#39;t know when it appeared since it was not itchy and on my back, but I did have some mild symptoms such as a mild sore throat that can be early signs of this disease.

By the way I had Mono 13 months ago that was pretty bad and had COVID in November not that severe at all.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The patient was in his usual state of health until he received his second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday 2/23. He had previously had no side effects from the first dose other than soreness at the injection site. After the 2nd dose, he noticed arm soreness at the injection site more quickly than before. 10-12 hours later, he noticed headache and subjective fever, which was relieved by Tylenol. On Wednesday he woke up with subjective fever and chills, and felt sternal chest pain during deep breathing and attempted cough, but did not notice any effect from positional changes. Other than attempting to cough to elicit pain, he did not experience any other symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, sneezing, congestion,  shortness of breath, palpitations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or dysuria. The following day, he noticed that the chest pain was more severe and persistent throughout the day.  The pain location would vary from the sternal area to the left side of his chest. The intensity of pain would vary between a 2-3/10 to 7-8/10. When the pain peaked, it would be accompanied by feelings of fever, chills, and brief headache, and he felt that the pain would &#34;spread&#34; across his chest. The pain would persist for a variable amount of time but then eventually disappear before returning. The pain was not affected by deep breath, position, or analgesics (he took an ibuprofen at around 2 AM when he couldn&#39;t sleep). After he fell asleep he was not woken up by pain. On Friday, he pain continued to be intermittent, and peaked during a work meeting. At that point he told his boss and an MD co-worker, who recommended that he presented to the ED. The EKG that was obtained in triage showed sinus tachycardia widespread ST elevations, PR depressions, with reciprocal changes in aVR. At this time he was continuing to experience chest pain. After getting a room in the ED, he no longer felt pain. He received a 2nd EKG showing improvement in ST elevations in some, but no all leads. He received ibuprofen and he continued to feel no symptoms. He was found to have a troponin elevation of 8.84 that peaked to 11.2. Transthoracic echo showed no motional wall abnormalities, normal EF, no pericardial effusion. He was admitted to the CICU out of concern and workup for myopericarditis.

                                                Pt received the first of the two-series COVID vaccination at 1512. Once in observation area, pt became unresponsive shortly after sitting down. This provider was called over by staff to pt, which was noted to have become unresponsive while sitting in the chair. Pt remained in the chair, did not fall or injure self. Upon arrival to patient, he was noted to have severe diaphoresis, prominent pallor, with shallow, slow breathing, no cyanosis noted.

Pt verbalized that he would not respond to the hospital with the paramedics and was encouraged to at least call someone to take him to the hospital.  This provider spoke with the patient?s mother and explained the events. The patient?s mother stated that the patient had febrile seizures when approximately 4 years old, associated with asthma exacerbations; but pt was evaluated with a neurologist and there were no abnormal findings.

                                                Around 11:30pm I started to get chills and my teeth started to chatter. At the same time my body was shaking slightly. I was laying on the couch during the start of it for the above events, this lasted for about 20&#43; minutes. Then I tried to get up to go to bed. I was shaking very badly at this point, teeth chattering a lot and I was very cold. I tried to use the bathroom and I couldn&#39;t even stand still to use the bathroom. My chest was also tightening and it was hard to breathe.   I went to bed to lay down and I was practically hyperventilating for about 15 minutes at a time and I would stop for a minute then it would start up again. I tried to go to sleep but I couldn&#39;t because I couldn&#39;t breathe and my chest was closing in, it felt like.   I called my parents in and they sat with me and gave me ibuprofen and benedryl. I started to feel better after about an hour. During that time, though, my body was extremely hot (but no fever) but I was still cold and had the chills. My head also was hurting like a headache and my eyes were really hot too. It was hard to get air and if I sat up I would get dizzy.

He states this morning he awoke and had significant nausea and abdominal pain and then had approximately 10 episodes of non bloody emesis that eventually became bilious. He did have some diaphoresis. He states that he eventually did have some chest pain that he attributed to all of the vomiting. He went to urgent care and did receive Zofran but this did not alleviate his symptoms. He denies shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, genitourinary symptoms, or other pain. He states that he has been having a few episodes of loose stools, but did not have any bowel movements today. In urgent care CT was performed and was suspicious for pneumomediastinum within the partially imaged lower chest and a CT esophagram was recommended. Patient presented here for CT esophagram. He is admitted for further treatment, and required a three day admission with IVF, and IV narcotics and antiemetics to control his nausea and Abd symptoms. He denied dyspnea. On 4/11 the patient was tolerating a diet and stable to dc home.

                                                I got the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday April 1st and then 2 days later on Thursday April 3rd I started developing headaches and they got worse and I would say they fluctuated to migraines. Every day I would have a degree of a migraine (which I do NOT have history of) and most days the head pain limited my activity significantly. I had 2 evenings where it got really bad. Once on Saturday April 3rd and then again on Wednesday April 7th. I have had headaches continueally since then. Some days better than others and some days worse.

Use of both ibuprofen and acetaminophen reduce the fever to about 100 degrees. Injection site pain began the day of vaccination but subsided after 2 days.

I had nerve damage to my tongue from oral surgery so I dont know if its related. I started to develop vertigo today the 15th around 1pm. Vertigo has come and gone on waves. Have had a mild headache all day as well. In addition Ive had alot of trouble concentrating.

I woke up at 1:30am to brush my teeth but I couldn&#39;t take full breaths. When I was trying to take full breaths, I could only get ~70% of an inhale. This lasted for about 10 minutes. I then experienced the rest of the symptoms, minus vomitting for the rest of the day.

Around 6 pm, I started to experience lower back pain and my legs began to throb and my whole body became very sensitive to touch. I took tylenol or ibuprofen every 4 hours for the rest of the night. This went on until Thursday 4/15/21, when the dizziness and throbbing headache started. Every time I would stand up I would become off balanced and need to hold on to something. I was still experiencing the lower back pain, leg throbbing and skin sensitivity but the dizziness and headache became much more intense. Around 9:30  pm on Thursday, I felt like I was hallucinating and was experiencing euphoria along with a fever. I did not sleep the night of 4/15 into 4/16. I was sweating profusely with a throbbing headache that would cause spinning when I would stand up. Around 3 am on 4/16, I fell asleep until around 4:30 am when I woke up in a pool of my own sweat. The body aches, leg pain and skin sensitivity went away along with my fever. Throughout Friday 4/16, I had a throbbing headache and was dizzy with no relief. This continued into Sunday 4/18 when I started to feel some relief. My headache was pretty much gone but the dizziness is still very much there. I have also an experienced elevated heart rate and respirations throughout the last 5 days.

                                                Approximately 3 to 5 minutes after immunization, patient was observed  in a waiting room chair unconscious, unresponsive and not breathing (respiration was not immediately observable or recognizable).  Patient was carefully and quickly placed in a supine position on the floor.  Pulse was present but the patient was completely unresponsive.  Respiration was not observed.  EMS was immediately notified.  Pharmacist and staff prepared for resuscitation and utilization of Epinephrine if needed.  Patients face was flushed, arms became flushed and the patients skin became moist.  After approximately  45 seconds in the supine position the patients eyes opened and he became responsive to auditory communication.  Respiration became reestablished.  BP was recorded at 130/91 with a pulse of 91 BPM.  EMS arrived on scene and provided further evaluation.  After an additional 5-10 minutes, patient was completely conscious and coherent.  Patient indicated that he had a similar experience in a grocery store over 1 year ago that was unrelated to immunization and was attributed to dehydration.  Patient refused additional medical care or transport to ED.  Patient was released to a friend who drove him home.  Patient was observed 1 day later picking up his car from the pharmacy and has recovered.  Patient was advised to seek additional medical evaluation to assess the root cause of this event.

Performed my daily routines uneventfully other than just not feeling 100 percent. By that evening the chest pain returned. On 4/18, I awoke with severe chest pains. I then presented to the ER where was presumed I was having a heart attack vs. acute pericarditis/myocarditis.

                                                Bloody diarrhea; Ulcerative colitis; Dizziness; Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;; Fatigue; Fever; Chills; Headaches; Nausea; This spontaneous case was reported by a physician (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) and COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) in a 22-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Asthma and Eczema.   On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea). On 09-Apr-2021, DIZZINESS (Dizziness), MALAISE (Feeling &#34;very sick&#34;), FATIGUE (Fatigue), PYREXIA (Fever), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headaches) and NAUSEA (Nausea) had resolved. At the time of the report, DIARRHOEA HAEMORRHAGIC (Bloody diarrhea) and COLITIS ULCERATIVE (Ulcerative colitis) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Colonoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) it appeared to be an &#34;ulcerative colitis&#34; on the entire colon.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medication mentioned topical cream NOS for eczema.  Treatment information mentioned IV Methylprednisolone and Metamizole. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Company comments This case concerns a 22-year-old female hospitalized with serious unexpected events of diarrhea hemorrhagic and colitis ulcerative, nonserious unexpected dizziness, malaise, and expected pyrexia, chills, headache, fatigue, nausea. Event onset 24 hours after second dose mRNA-1273. Serious event outcomes unknown. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                * Tuesday, March 16th, I received my first Moderna shot. No immediate symptoms, felt fine. * Thursday, March 25th (9 days post-vaccination), I was sitting at my desk and experienced some kind of visual distortion (my computer monitor bounced up and down 4 times in quick succession, even though I was perfectly still). Got up from my desk and laid down, and it went away. * Tuesday, March 30th (two weeks post-vaccination), I started experiencing persistent dizziness/imbalance. It was manageable for the first couple of days, and I still went about my daily activities. * Thursday, April 1st, symptoms got noticeably worse. I had a really bad episode of vertigo/dizziness in the afternoon. This spell of bad symptoms lasted until Saturday evening/Sunday morning. I wasn?t falling down, but I would describe it as akin to being on a boat in rough seas or a plane flying through a storm. Pressure in head and ears was intense. I?ve had longstanding tinnitus, but pitch/volume definitely seemed to change somewhat. My neck was incredibly stiff, and my throat felt somewhat ?tight? (tonsils or lymph nodes in neck felt enlarged). Took ibuprofen and Benadryl on and off over next several days. * Tuesday, April 27th, symptoms are ongoing. Still having imbalance, dizziness, and non-spinning vertigo, though less severe than previously.

                                                Pt felt nauseous, hot, started getting red, and sat down on floor about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I was alerted and I helped him into the vaccination room to lay down on the floor with his feet propped up. His girlfriend was there to help calm him down. I offered to call 911, he refused. I grabbed a fan for him, and turned it off when he requested. He then began shivering rather uncontrollably and said his left arm (injection site) was hurting and tingling, and at one point, said his right arm was beginning to tingle as well.  We had him breath and relax, he began to return to normal and he and girlfriend discussed how he must be partly having an anxiety/panic attack. He trialed standing up a few times until he felt good enough to leave the room, all in all about 20 minutes. He sat close by for additional 15 minutes of observation, at which point he left stating he felt more like himself.

                                                I got diagnosed with Facial Paralysis (Bell&#39;s Palsy) on the left side of the face.  One of the signs were weakness on my face when trying to make gestures. The day before (May 15, 2021) I got a headache and when I woke up the other day I felt the weakness in my face. By the end of the day around 9:00 pm I went to the Emergency Room and got injected with Decadron, but the doctor didn&#39;t diagnosed me nothing only to see a Neurologist. The other day (May 17, 2021) I tried to get in contact with my primary doctor to explain the situation but I had to wait for the next day for an appointment. By the end of the day (May 17, 2021) I went again to another Emergency Room where the doctor Diagnosed with Facial Paralysis (Bell&#39;s Palsy). He ordered a CT Scan, blood sample and anti-inflammatory.

When I got to him he was sweating and his arms were twitching. Even though he was alert, he was struggling  to straighten his arms. I made a 911 call and then administered one dose of epipen then within  a minute he thanked me for the epipen and he said he is feeling much better. Finally the paramedics came in and asked him if he still wants to go for further checkups. He agreed and left the store with the paramedics.

                                                Got the shot at 12:30PM on Thursday. Started feeling fever, chills, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and slight headache at 3:10AM. Recorded temperature of 100.7 degrees with an ear thermometer. Took Tylenol, drank 32oz of cold water, put a cold wash cloth on forehead. After an hour my temperature dropped to 98.8. Felt less achy but still warm.

                                                Patient is a 22 y.o. male with no previous cardiac history, no known cardiovascular risk factors, and no significant past medical history.  2 days ago he received his second dose of the Maderna Covid vaccine.  Yesterday he reported flulike symptoms with fever to 102 degrees, generalized myalgias, and fatigue.  He awoke at 2 AM this morning with sharp somewhat diffuse substernal pain unrelated to activity, inspiration, exertion, position, without radiation or associated symptoms.  He took Tylenol which eventually caused the pain to decrease in intensity.  He called his family, discussed it with his girlfriend, did some online research, and came to the ER for evaluation where his EKG demonstrated anterior T wave abnormalities and his high-sensitivity troponin came back elevated at 16,072.  His pain is now fully resolved, he is being admitted to the hospitalist service, and cardiology consultation was requested. June 6, 2021

                                                I received the vaccine through my employer.  7 Days after the vaccination event, my left deltoid muscle became significantly swollen, stiff and tender. There was pain when I tried to elevate the arm laterally. The site was very warm to the touch. I experienced periods of malaise and fatigue at random intervals throughout the week after which I received the vaccine. On day 8, a red rash began to appear on the vaccination site. It was slightly itchy. The area was still stiff and swollen, and painful to move past a certain angle. This night I felt especially fatigued. On day 9 I woke up to see the swelling was mostly subsided, however the rash had spread down the arm to roughly the elbow. The site was no longer warm. It was still slightly irritable. As the day is progressing (this is written on day 9), the rash is starting to fade.

                                                Early on in the day of 1/6/21, I felt very sluggish and spaced. My boss asked me early in the day if I was okay because she said that I seemed &#34;out of it.&#34; It wasn&#39;t to the point that I was unable to work, but it was a noticeable difference from my typical state. At 11:31 AM, I texted my wife and said &#34;I feel gross and weird today.&#34; When she asked me how so, I replied, &#34;I just feel run down, my neck hurts, and I can&#39;t focus.&#34; My arm was more sore than it typically is from the flu shot, but it wasn&#39;t unbearable.  As the day went on, I felt the cloudiness in my head start to dissipate a bit and I started to feel a little better. By dinnertime, I was feeling sick to my stomach and was not able to eat very much. I chose to head to bed around 9 because I was feeling pretty ill (my neck had really started feeling sore again and my stomach was very upset.) At 1:30 AM on 1/8/21, I woke up with a horrible headache. I get migraines from time to time, but this was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It felt like my head was in a vise and I was very close to asking my wife to take me to the ER. I never go to the doctor, but it legitimately scared me. My neck was extremely sore and my head hurt so bad that even laying it on a pillow hurt. I was extremely nauseous as well. I took a few extra strength Tylenol and laid my neck on a heating pad with an ice back on my forehead. The sound of our humidifier was too much for me, so I also out in earplugs. After an hour or so, I fell back asleep. When I woke up this morning, I still had a headache and I took an Excedrin. To this point, I have felt a little sick to my stomach, but the intense headache has been kept at bay. My neck is still sore but it is also somewhat better.

                                                Woke up with a headache and fatigue, as well as soreness near area of injection. Energy was very low and felt very tired. Tried to sleep at around 12:00 PM but had a thumping in my head that would not let me fall asleep. Around 3:00 PM tried to sleep again but being shivering/shaking a lot despite being under a blanket and comforter. Eventually needed to take a hot bath for around 45 minutes to an hour. Took my temperature while in the bath which read 96°F (although that thermometer may not be the most accurate.) After the bath I went directly to bed with a comforter, blanket and weighted blanket and was able to fall asleep for about 90 minutes. Was no longer shivering when I awoke and felt much better. Went to sleep at around 9:00 PM and felt fine when I woke up the next morning.

Periodically waking up every 30min from 1am onwards. Muscle discomfort, sweating, and nausea continued until 3:45 AM, at which point I was feeling better and was able to sleep continuously.   Feeling much better in the morning on March 4th. Temperature was 99.9, then rose to 100.0 at 11am. Now, at 3pm, feeling fatigue, exhaustion. No headache. Normal sense of taste and smell. No couch.  Taking another day off from work. Temperature is currently 100.0. Taking more theraflu now, have not taken Tylenol today.

Later at around 6:30 PM I took an Advil tablet for the pain. At around 7:30 PM I took a second one since the pain was still strong after the first one. I took a third Advil tablet at around 11:30 PM. At around 12:30 AM on March 6, while going to sleep, fever-like symptoms started such as high body temperature, chills, congestion and aches. Fever symptoms continued as I intermittently woke up around 6-8:00 AM, and as I woke up again around 9:50 AM the feverish side effects had mostly subsided. Arm soreness has also decreased dramatically but is still present.

                                                Shortly after receiving the second dose, I began experiencing some soreness around the injection site in my left arm. This worsening throughout the day, and around 5:30pm that day I began to experience some cold-like symptoms (fatigue, soreness, chills). This continued into Sunday, and it tapered off until I felt relatively normal around 4pm.   I only treated this with some generic Nyquil.

                                                Starting about 10 hours after receiving the second Modern vaccination I experienced a minor headache and drowsiness, which continued until about 30 hours after the vaccination. These symptoms resolved without treatment. Around 20 hours after the vaccination an itchy rash developed on the lower lip, around the left eye, and in the genital area (including: penis, testicles, and upper inner thigh). Rash continued to get worse until about 4 days after the vaccination. At this point I sought treatment at a local urgent care. The urgent care personnel said they believed the rash symptoms were caused by the Modern COVID-19 vaccination, did not identify any other possible causes, and encouraged me to report it to the VAERS system. The treatment followed was topical 1% hydrocortisone cream applied to the affected areas, and 12.5 mg of diphenhydramine taken orally before bed. The rash symptoms improved with treatment but have not fully resolved at 5 days after the vaccination.

Also developed chest discomfort that progressively got worse over the next 1-2 days which prompted him to visit the ED   on 04/18.   He was found to have troponin elevation  with diffuse J-point elevation.    He received aspirin and was started on heparin drip.   Chest pain completely resolved by the next day. Coronary angiogram was negative. Cardiology attributed stroke elevation and chest pain to myocarditis secondary to vaccine.  Echo was normal with no evidence of pericardial effusion.

He also had a headache, vomiting, then lost consciousness overnight and had a tonic-clonic seizure lasting 10 minutes. He was brought to the emergency department and had 2 more seizures there which was controlled with lorazepam. He was admitted to the hospital and started on broad spectrum antibiotics (acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin). On 4/11/21, the patient was extubated and improved symptomatically, and antibiotics were narrowed to doxycycline. He was then discharged on doxycycline and levetiracetam.

                                                I took the FIRST dose of the Moderna vaccine this Tuesday on the  20th of April at 11:30 AM. Around 10:00 PM Wednesday I have been feeling short of breath. This feeling has persisted throughout the entire day of Thursday and I continue to feel the same way (I think it has slightly worsened). I can breath, but I am completely unable to take a full, deep breath. I sometimes can achieve a full deep breath but it&#39;s completely at random. I find myself trying to forcefully take a deep breath but can&#39;t seem to fully fill my lungs how I normally am able to.  Additionally, my throat feels mildly swollen/sore, starting from the back of my mouth and down my esophagus. The lowest point of my esophagus at which I feel the soreness/mild swelling is near the center of my chest.  I think my shortness of breath is progressively, and slowly worsening, but its hard to tell for certain. Some of the muscles around my back are beginning to feel uncomfortable due to me constantly trying to forcefully achieve a full and deep breath.

We had him sit-down and place his head lower than his chest. He almost immediately felt better. He had flown in. He mentioned he had not drank much water since, but he had eaten. He was fine after the observation period and left.

Immediately following vaccination, the patient had some blood running down his arm. I reached for a cotton swab to apply pressure and stop the bleeding, but the patient began to faint. I immediately positioned myself next to the patient; and held his head and arm to keep him in a sitting position. The patient regained consciousness after about twenty seconds. I began talking with the patient to ensure it was only a fainting spell. The patient was groggy but became clear-headed after about a minute. Upon further discussion, the patient stated this happens every time he sees blood, has bloodwork done or receives vaccines. The patient recounted a time when he cut his hand at work and fainted immediately. The patient was doing deep breathing exercises immediately after regaining consciousness. When asked, he said it helps him focus. I asked the patient if he wanted us to call anyone to pick him up but he refused. The patient was advised to remain seated, and we would transition him to the waiting area once he felt stable enough. After about 5 minutes the patient was helped to the waiting area (from our counseling room about 10-15 feet away). I advised him to remain in the waiting area for 30 minutes for further monitoring. The patient was offered juice, water and a snack but declined. After the 30 minute waiting period, the patient was clear-headed and appeared to be in the same state as when he arrived for the vaccine.

At 1948, EMT noticed that the client?s face was becoming pale and diaphoretic. EMT alerted PHN and both responded to the patient at 1948 and transitioned the client into the zero gravity chair. Client was reluctant to sit in the zero gravity chair and stated, ?I?m feeling anxious and this is not helping especially with my aunt.? Client?s aunt was very concerned and was anxious about what was happening and was standing over the client. PHN asked the aunt to sit in her seat and allow us to assess the client. PHN also explained to the client that this was a precaution and not meant to create more anxiety. PHN offered the client a juice which he accepted and drank. At 1952 client stated, ?I?m feeling fine now, I?m not sweating anymore.? Vital signs were taken at 1952 (Blood pressure 130/70, heartrate 87, Oxygen 98%). At 1952, client?s color had returned to his face and his skin was no longer diaphoretic. PHN  asked the client if he has history of fainting from needles, and the client stated, ?no, but I have anxiety.? Vital signs were taken at 2002 (blood pressure 112/70, heart rate 68, oxygen 97%). Client stated that he ate two hours before receiving the vaccine. Vital signs taken at 2010 (blood pressure 114/74, heart rate 78, oxygen 97%). Vital signs taken at 2018 (112/74, heart rate 66, oxygen 97%). Client does not have any medical conditions or allergies and is not taking any medications. PHN  provided education to the client on when to seek emergency medical services and to follow up with his primary care provider before receiving his second dose. At 2019 client stated, ?I?m feeling fine,? and left the facility unassisted with a steady gait.

I then felt nauseous and threw up, and my body began to ache. 12 hours post vaccination I began to develop a fever of 99.8 with the use of acetaminophen and had severe chills / muscle aches.  The fever progresses to 101.1 about 36hours post vaccine and declined to 100.8 48 hours post vaccine. By 72 hours the fever was gone as well as all symptoms excluding fatigue and a slight headache.

                                                Headache, muscle aches, and fever reaching 101.8 started at around midnight of 1/9/2021, roughly 8 h after receiving the vaccine. The fever broke this morning (1/10/21) so a rough estimate of the time course is 32 h. The fever was also reduced with acetaminophen. The headache still persists, albeit milder. The muscle aches resolved with the fever, so a time course for that would also be 32 h.  I recently had a COVID19 infection (symptom onset was 12/25/20), but had cleared my isolation date of 1/4/21. The symptoms from my COVID19 infection (headache, muscle aches, chills) had virtually resolved by 1/8/21 before I received the vaccine.

                                                One hour after injection, at 1500, i experienced high sensitivity to pain. Every inch of my limbs ached, including headaches. I took ibuprofen, but was later advised against it.  The next day around 1300 i experienced chills and began shaking uncontrollably. It didn&#39;t stop for an hour, where i got incredibly nauseous and tired and slept the rest of the day.  The next day, starting at 0700, i felt the need to vomit and had diarrhea. This continued until i fell asleep at 1030. Afterwards the majority of my problems passed.

This was with chills, extreme fatigue, diaphoresis, nausea, and diarrhea. I realize that these are side effects, but I?m reporting it because I am not going to get the second dose. The effects of the vaccine were worse than when I had covid.

                                                On 2/24/21 around 1:30 PM, Patient was not feeling well and temperature was 100.8.   He was able to take Tylenol but then the staff noted his eyes rolled back in his head.   911 was called but he was not transported since his temperature was now normal and he seemed  to be at baseline.   He did not eat or drink much liquids later that night and in the morning of 2/25/21 around 9 AM, staff could not get him up from bed.   He was incontinent and had temperature of 97.7.  He was staring off and not talking or responsive.   911 was called and he was transferred to the ER and later admitted.   All labs and Xrays were normal and later on 2/26/21 he was awake and alert.    Of note, Patient also received news on the afternoon he got his second vaccine that a favorite staff person had been killed in a MVA.   Patient  was upset at this news at the time.

                                                I did not feel anything shortly after the injection, but later in the evening, started to develop a normal post-vaccine soreness. I thought little of it and went to bed. I woke up just after 3am with chills, fever, and worsened arm pain, to the point that it restricted my arm&#39;s range of motion and speed of motion. Interestingly, the arm is not red or swollen, but is painful near the injection site, and the area around my clavicle on that side is somewhat swollen, but not red or painful (likely a lymph node). I was unable to get back to sleep due to these side effects (primarily chills and fever). After a few hours of trying to get back to sleep, I took some Tylenol and tried to eat breakfast. I was unable to keep much down, and had to arrange a day off of my internship, and was finally able to sleep on and off for the next few hours.  The symptoms have somewhat lessened, but have not resolved, after about 22.5 hours post-injection. I fully expect this to resolve or mostly resolve by the 48 hour mark. I mostly found this unusual due to the severity of the reaction and after only the first dose, and wondered if my young age could have something to do with the clearly robust immune response so soon after inoculation.

A large portion of patients deltoid around administration site continues to be swollen and red 3 days following administration. The patient hasn&#39;t noticed the area getting any larger and is going to continue to monitor for any worsening symptoms. Patient was advised to seek medical care if symptoms worsened.

Patient stood up fine after receiving it, but when he reached over to the counter to grab his keys and phone, he collapsed and hit the counter, breaking the counter off the wall on the way down. Patient remained conscious and sat up and leaned against the wall for around 20 minutes. He was sweaty but did not want us to call an ambulance. After around 20 minutes of resting, the patient looked much better, was no longer sweating, and was able to stand up just fine. He said he felt totally back to normal now, he absolutely did NOT want us to call an ambulance or a family member to help him. He said he was more than fine driving home. He looked much better and then left.

                                                I kept a log of the events that occurred. Notes: 25mg amitriptyline taken nightly for the last month, 200mg motrin I?ve never taken pain killers before this, time is in military.   Mar 18  1430 (1 hour 30 mins after my shot) i have a compressing headache toward the back of my head so i take 1 motrin.  1700 i head home, take 1 amitriptyline and head straight to sleep. ( i have no apatite so no dinner ) Mar 19 0100 The pain starts, it?s unbearable. I am sweating heavily and im also shivering cold. i have a high fever I have body aches which turns my shivering into shaking which keeps my wife up all night. In my dreams i feel pain. I talked to my deceased mother, i hold my deceased cat and i relive some of my most regrettable moments.  0700 I wake up, the bed is soaking wet. I take a motrin and get dressed. it takes me an hour longer to get ready for work because, the pain has sapped my energy. My supervisor sends me home seeing how horrible I look. 0900 I take an amitriptyline and lay down. I ask me wife to close to the storm shutters to darken the room. They are normally pretty quiet to close but, this time they are deafeningly loud. I struggled to get 1 hour of sleep.  1500 I wake up due to shaking so bad that i hit my head on the wall. I then take 2 motrin and about 30 mins later i notice theres a tightness in my chest. i take 1 tums. I know that my body is exhausted from the pain and my mind is clouded but i really wanted to do all of the tasks that i was planning on doing this weekend. All of the tasks end up failing. 2100 i try the tasks again and end up failing again.   20 Mar 0100. I eat a pear and 2 cheetos. i do not take a amitriptyline and i lay down. i have no pain or fever. (Dream start) The dream i had is of me watching myself get thrown around by a ghost. The ghost possesses my body for a short time. I grab some kittens (cats are a comfort to me so im guessing that my subconscious trying to reel me back in) I then wake my sleeping wife and tell her theres a ghost and we need to leave. We walk outside and im in an old neighborhood that i grew up in, everything darkens and im in pitch black feeling my way around a room. I open my eyes and im in a hotel. The front desk staff will not let me take the kittens up to my room so i leave them. When i walk into the room, it?s full of kittens (dream end) and i wake up  21 Mar 0900 I wake up and I have a sore throat and tightness in my chest. The soreness prevents me from going back to sleep and the tightness in my chest causing some anxiety. Once I calm myself down and convince myself that im not having a heart attack I take 2 motrin and some tums and the pain goes away from the day. These could be some withdrawals from not taking amitriptyline since 19 mar in the morning. This is still happening as I write this report. (23 March 2021)

I also had minor chills and fever but that cleared up after I took acetaminophen. By Friday (two days after my vaccination) the soreness had reduced but I had developed a 4&#34; x 3&#34; rash around the injection site. It was both itchy and slightly painful, but not enough that I felt the need to take a painkiller. Today (five days after my vaccination) it has finally receded away.

                                                Earlier today, a Moderna patient at 3213 experienced a 15-30 second seizure after receiving his 1st Moderna vaccine. Shortly after sitting down for his 15-minute post immunization observation period, patient X began seizing resulting in him falling to the ground from a seated position to his left side and seizing for about 15-20 seconds. Patient was positioned in a left lateral recumbent position. Code white was called and EMT arrived on site within 10 minutes.   Patient&#39;s immunization questionnaire did NOT have any contraindications that would warrant he should not receive the vaccine. Patient reported no allergies to medications/past immunizations/foods and reported no seizure and/or neurological condition.   Once recovered and at baseline, patient reported having a light breakfast this morning and also having a needle phobia that may have played a role in his adverse response.   Shortly after recovering, patient was coherent and aware of person, place, and time. He remained weak and fatigue and BP readings from EMT indicated hypotension. EKG was normal.   Patient&#39;s mother happened to be waiting outside in the car. One of my associates was able to call her in and we updated here on the event.   EMT recommended, and patient agreed, to be taken to the hospital for further examination.

                                                Woke up on the morning of April 10 with nausea and chills. Had a headache since the night before, but I sometimes get headaches due to neck pain so I cannot fully attribute the headache as an effect of the vaccine. Vomited three times within two hours and experienced diarrhea at the same time. Fell back asleep for four hours and felt little nausea and no chills afterwards. Took ibuprofen for headache 24 hours after time of vaccine. Felt back to normal the next morning.

                                                Fatigue, for about Two days afterwards. Diarrhea has persisted for four days afterward. Anxiety Disorder has been acting up, this could be from anxiety over the vaccine or a side effect of the vaccine. I?ve felt more anxious since I received my vaccine, not severely, just noticing more than a typical day. I?ve only received the first dose, if it happens more after the second I will file an additional report.

                                                At 3:15 PM, pt entered observation immediately after receiving his second dose of the Moderna CV 19 vaccine. Pt reported to the RN that he was feeling dizzy (Client reported feeling dizziness after receiving his first dose as well.).  Pt also complained of piercing headache above his left eye and pain on the right side of his neck. The pain radiated down his entire left side of his body. The pt also felt tingling in the arm he received the vaccine in.  Vitals were initiated and water was provided to the pt. Ice packs were applied to the patients forehead and nape of the neck where he felt the pain.  Vitals NOT within normal limits. O2 saturation fluctuating and blood pressure was a bit elevated.  Pt reports having a history of hypertension, but could not accurately recall having taken the medication that morning. EMS was activated at 3:35 PM because the pts O2 saturated was fluctuating dangerously and interventions were not successful in relieving the patients symptoms.  Vitals were taken approximately 10 minutes apart. Vitals were not WNL. Pt continually reported that the pain was increasing and beginning to feel unbearable. It was noted that the patient had increasingly poor circulation in the arm he received the injection. O2 was taken on the opposite arm and saturation levels appeared normal.  EMS at 4 PM. Vitals were taken, all WNL. Patient left with EMS at 4:05 PM and was transported to Hospital.

                                                I received dose #1 of COVID and planned to walk through the store to shop. While walking passed the observation chair, I began to feel dizzy and decided to sit down. After I took a seat, I immediately began to feel numbness in my arm which spread to my entire body. I was also feeling a piercing headache with ringing in my ears and my dizziness was extreme. At this point I called for help to the individual who had administered my shot as I had feared I would have fainted. I was in this extreme state for approximately 3-5 minutes. The individual at the pharmacy then checked in on me, gave me a bottle of water and after drinking it I began to feel better. I was then able to walk around and buy some food. Approximately 20 minutes after that event and eating and drinking some food, I felt like I was back to normal. I am writing this 5 hours later, and I currently feel normal, with some soreness in my arm I received the vaccine in.

Uncontrollable shivering 6 hours after, alternating (rapidly) with overheating and uncontrollable sweating. Eventually fell asleep ~11:00 PM. Woke up at 2:20 AM thirsty, shivering. Used restroom and stomach started to feel &#39;off&#39; or &#39;upset,&#39; followed by ~45 minutes of dry heaving. After bouts of dry heaving ended, instantly overheated and began sweating profusely (to the point I was as wet as if I had just gotten out of the shower). Eventually fell asleep again. Day after - headache, body aches, sweating alternating with chills. Feels like flu now (6:50 PM 17 April)

                                                Pt was sitting in post-vaccination area for his 15 minute observation time when he passed out after a few minutes. He had fallen onto the floor beside his chair. I immediately went out to pt. His eyes were fluttering. I shook pt and asked if he was okay. Pt opened his eyes and sat up seemed disoriented and said that he felt nauseated. I told pt to lay down on his back and elevate his feet on the chair, and told my technician to grab a bucket, an ice pack, and to call code white. We applied the ice pack to pts head. A member of management and an EMT who happened to be in the store reported over very shortly. Pt said he did think that he hit his head and his head did hurt. We asked the pt if he wanted us to call an ambulance. Pt said no, he was feeling a little better and he just wanted to wait a little bit and then finish his shopping. Pt was feeling better and was able to get back into the chair and sit. Pt appeared pale and we got him a drink of water. Pt sat and rested for sometime and after about an hour he said he was okay and was going to finish his shopping.

                                                Initially I had experienced the standard adverse effects of drowsiness, a little difficulty sleeping, minor chills. The next day following my Dose 1 of the Moderna Vaccine, I started noticed chest pains on both sides of the chest. It wasn&#39;t from breathing and not very consistent or something I could re-create on command. It seemed to happen every hour for a few seconds and was a sudden, sharp pain. That was a concern for me so I did some basic internet searches and found that Chest pains are a symptom of the vaccine. I didn&#39;t think too much of it after that but It was a concern I kept in my head. My timeline gets a little foggy here but either that same day or the following day, the chest pains were still happening and I wasn&#39;t feeling 100%. One evening I went to take a bath. As I was laying in the water, my heart rate felt off, almost as if it was skipping a beat or not in the right rhythm. I remember laying in the bathtub, trying to count my pulse or seeing if I could &#34;catch&#34; the incorrect beat.  Rather than one normal heartbeat it felt like there was 2 beats very closely timed with each other. My heart rate felt faster than normal considering I was only laying down in water and didn&#39;t do any exercises the past few days. Unfortunately I never was able to find a good way to track the pulse and timing, but I was sure that something was wrong. I had difficulty sleeping that night because I kept feeling something wrong with my heart rhythm.  I got worried that I would need to go to the emergency room, but I told myself to sleep it off and if the chest pains and awkward heart beat continues for 5 days, I would go see a doctor. As for an outcome, thankfully I stopped noticing it around day 4 and haven&#39;t had chest pains since.  I am extremely worried as to how my body will react to Dose #2.

I was shaking a lot. I never experienced chills that extreme before. At 10:30PM on 5/11/21, I took one Tylenol.  At about 2:00AM on 5/12/21, I woke up with heat flashes for an unknown time due to sleeping.  At 7:30AM on 5/12/21, I woke up to a heart rate of 105 beats per minute. This lasted for about six hours. I could feel my heart pounding through my chest. During this event, I also experienced shortness of breath. That lasted for about the same time. At 9:00AM on 5/12/21, I took one Tylenol. By 4:00PM on 5/12/21, I started to feel better and my heart rate got down to my normal level of 70 beats per minute while resting.

I was working at the time and went to my local EMS station to get checked out. They checked my blood pressure and blood sugar. Blood pressure was normal but my blood sugar was low, around 68. They gave me a coke to drink and I went back to the Sheriff&#39;s office and about an hour later my blood sugar was around 90. I took the rest of the day off and come home. I took Extra Strength Tylenol and rested. I did have a headache a few hours later. I feel fine now but I have a mild headache.&#34;

The patient came back into the store about on hour later to pick up some things for his pharmacy and reported feeling a little chest pain. The patient was then informed to keep monitoring the pain and if it got any worse to go to the doctors office. About 2 hours later, the patient called when on the way to the emergency room and reported chest pain and a fever of 102 degrees (at the highest). Around 3pm, which was about 6 hours after the vaccination was administered, the patient reported chest pain was alleviated and that the emergency room treated him for a migraine/nausea with Tylenol #3, Fioricet and Zofran.

                                                Headache, fever, chills, fatigue around 18 hours after shot. Additionally, I woke up the morning after to pain in my toe, which spread to my foot and groin lymph nodes. I eventually went to the ER and was told my toe was infected. I had previously had a small cut on my toe and the doctor believes that the inflammatory response my body initiated from the vaccine exacerbated this infection.

                                                After receipt of the vaccine, I developed a low grade fever the next day (1/7/21) that persisted throughout the day until it progressed into a fever of at least 101.3 F at night. It might have been higher, but that was the best reading I could get. It felt like the fever came on extremely fast bc all of a sudden I started shaking vigorously with rigors and chills. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed without experiencing the most uncomfortable chills I&#39;ve ever experienced. I previously had Covid in early November, and this fever felt worse than what I experienced when I actually had Covid. Also, I experienced moderate to severe pain in my left arm on 1/7/21 at the injection site, which was far worse than any other muscle soreness I&#39;ve experienced from any other vaccine I&#39;ve received. The hour preceding the sudden fever attack, my left arm was feeling blazing hot, looked a little red, and swollen. I also experienced a strange allodynia type pain, whereby parts of my body hurt from simply touching them. Although I did not develop a significant rash, I experienced pruritus all over my body, predominantly affecting the areas around my ankles and wrists. I have a hx of multiple dermal filler injections in my lips. I don&#39;t think I had any problems with my lips after the injection. But other symptoms that I developed included a tickle in my throat and some shortness of air. On 1/8/21, I woke up drenched in sweat so I presumed that I broke my fever while sleeping. I have felt much better ever since. I&#39;m a nurse practitioner student, and I had to miss a day of clinical on 1/8/21 bc of this reaction to the vaccine. I used ibuprofen the morning on 1/7/21 and Tylenol at night on 1/7/21 to bring down my fever

At the time of this writing, my pain has not disappeared but is reducing as anticipated.  Throughout the day of 01/19/2021, I experienced symptoms of a mild fever and proceeded to nap at 5:15 PM.  At 7:30 PM, I was experiencing body chills and felt more defined effects of the fever.  I proceeded to take two Acetaminophen pills by 8:00 PM and my symptoms subsided later into the night.  At the time of this writing, I am only experiencing light headaches (I think) and reduced arm pain.  I believe my fever/body chill symptoms are no longer affecting me.

No fever but intense pain in back. We believe the vaccine may have triggered a sickle cell crisis.

                                                During the first night after receiving vaccine I started to have SEVERE shaking / full body muscle spasms-hypertonicity that  lasted 60-90 minutes. Required 30 minutes hot shower to calm down shaking symptoms. Initially thought episodes were caused/triggered by cold temperature (still possibility) but now thinking its triggered by anxiety. Heart rate almost spikes to 120-130 BPM. No fever and normal blood pressure is noted when episodes happen.  Occurrences is not routine and seem to be random.  Very concerning considering symptoms lasted for 2 &#43; weeks now. I do not have health care or ability to see PCP/GP without paying out of pocket.   Now please understanding the severity of these episodes, to the point where it resembles severe Parkinson&#39;s symptoms.   Along with those I still have the normal side effects, fatigue  (extreme)  , mood changes, joint aches, intolerance to cold off and on,  and elevated HR.

Laid in bed all day, fell asleep around 10PM. 3:30AM woke up panicking with fever, tremors, chills, myalgia and very lethargic. Got out of bed to get tylenol and was shaking.  Tuesday morning - woke up feeling the same as I did at 330 AM, plus no appetite on top of headache, chills, myalgia, lethargic and slept pretty much all day, felt fatigued. Wednesday was doing better, thought it was the end. Then suddenly about 7-8pm started having chills and shivering.  I would say Thursday night is when I actually felt better and by Friday morning I was good with just residual ?brain fog/feeling dazed?

                                                The day following my first COVID vaccination, I had pain in my upper arm for 36 hours and could not lift it above my shoulder. I also experienced 6 hours of constant chills throughout my body, which came on suddenly around 1PM (24 hours after my vaccination) and was sent home early from work. During the 6 hours at home I believe I experienced body chills, I experienced what I believe to be brain fog. My coworkers described my motor skills (walking down a hallway) as slow and lethargic, and my thoughts being delayed. I do not consciously remember the 6 hour timeframe when I experienced these symptoms. Around 7PM that evening, I remember having a &#34;coming to&#34; moment where I remember the chills subsiding, and being able to think again.  The following day I felt back to normal other than pain at the injection site.

Temperature has been controlled with alternating therapy, although waves of chills and heat flashes remain. Headache was never reduced with therapy. In addition, adequate amount of water was taken throughout the day beginning at 7am on 1/29. Muscle aches subsided around 7am on 1/29.

I fell back asleep, woke up at 9:00 AM and was hungry again so I ate more food. I became hungry again at 12:00 PM and ate again. At 2:00 PM the body aches returned, I took two 500mg  acetaminophen tablets and fell asleep until 3:30 PM. At 4:00 PM I became hungry again and ate. At 6:00 PM I ate another meal. At 9:00 PM I took two 500mg  acetaminophen tablets and went to sleep. When I woke up the next day all symptoms had subsided.

Has slowly gone away since, but there is still some of it left.  About 8 hours after dose, had severe chills, likely fever (did not measure), and lots of shivering. Skin felt very sensitive all over body. Arm was already sore at this point. Fatigue, drowsiness. Felt like a flu.  The next day, large red splotch on left arm at injection site, with red line extending into the armpit area. Swollen lymph nodes in neck. Previous symptoms resolved, except for chest rash.  Two days later, large red splotch on left arm at injection site is now very itchy and warm, firm, and slightly raised.

Pt did not have tongue swelling and did have a patent airway.   No rash.  Patient was given a total of Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg.  He was observed for 1.5 hours, during which his vitals remained normal, airway remained patent, and no rash was noted.  Patient continued to have sensation of throat tightness after the observation period, and we recommended that he proceed to the ER.  He declined to do so.  He was then given a syringe of epinephrine 0.3mL of 1:1000 solution for the ride home.  He was driven home by his parents.  We attempted to contact him later that evening but received no response.

                                                The morning after I received both vaccine shots, I posted hearing from my right ear. The first time I received the vaccine shot, the morning after, I could barely hear out of my right ear.  It almost sounded like there was a clog or earwax build-up. I didn&#39;t really think much of it and it gradually went away several days later. The worst day was the next day after the vaccine and it lasted, even though in a small amount, until 3 days after. The second dose caused the same problem. The morning after the second dose of the vaccine, I lost my hearing in the same way as before. I could barely hear out of my ear, however, I was also exhausted and ended up sleeping most of the day. When I woke up in the afternoon, I couldn&#39;t hear from my right ear, but I could hear better. (maybe 25% back to normal). The two days after the vaccine, my hearing came back way better than the previous time. It felt like 80% back to normal and later in the today, it felt like it up to 95% back to normal. The best way I can describe the feeling was as if the sound was still being received to my hear, but it sounded muffled and turned down. I was still able to hear the deeper sounds during conversations and deeper &#39;beats&#39; in music, but the sharpness of everything was turned off.

                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The day after I received the 2nd dose of the vaccine I had a headache. That same night I ran a fever and woke up the next morning feeling ok. I was taking a shower and it was reported to me by my fiancé I had passed out, started to seize, my eyes rolled to the back of my head. A few minutes later I woke up on the floor and asked what had happened. I was not sure what had happened.  I felt fine when I woke up. When first responders arrived they asked me if I knew who I was, the date, the president, where I lived to all I was able to answer correctly. I went to the ER and they did a ECG, blood test, urine test, chest x-ray, CT of my head and they said everything came back normal. I was prescribed Keppra and have an MRI scheduled in the coming week.

                                                Had a sore left arm where the injection site was, after about an hour later i began to have a mild headache and became tired (i took 2 aleve liquid gel pain killers and that didn&#39;t do much). The next day the pain in my arm got about 50% better, and the head ache was gone right when I woke up. I still felt tired throughout the 2nd day and my left under eye lid began to start twitching for about a minute long every 30 minutes. On the 3rd day, I was no longer tired and my arm no longer hurt but the under eye lid twitch is still occurring and at the same frequency.

Three minutes after vaccination, I lost consciousness and forcefully fell on the floor, scraping my head and biting the front of my tongue. I was immediately wheelchaired over to a nearby bench and tended to by a nurse and two doctors. I was sweating profusely, had a low heart rate and chills, and felt tired. After forty-five minutes, a bottle of water and a can of orange juice, I had recovered and was dismissed. I already had a ride waiting to take me home.

A minute or two later at most, we heard his mom yelling for us and I could see him kind of slumped over while she kept him sitting up. I ran out with an EpiPen and saw him on the bench, slumped forward but coming to - he was able to speak with us and answer questions (his name, DOB, today&#39;s date, where he was). He was dizzy and his face was pale and sweaty, but he said otherwise he was okay. We provided him water and Gatorade, which he drank and said it helped. We had them stay for 30 minutes from that point to monitor for improvement, and there were no further issues. We checked in with them before they left, and the patient said he was fine and back to normal.

During the 15 minute observation period following the vaccine, the patient&#39;s father asked the pharmacist to check his blood pressure.  While the pharmacist was checking his blood pressure (approximately 2-3 minutes following the vaccination), she notices the patient was starting to look pale and shut and squint his eyes as if he was having trouble focusing his vision.  The pharmacist questioned the patient to make sure he felt ok, and the patient said his vision was going black and he was  getting dizzy and lightheaded.  The pharmacist moved nearby objects out of the way to prepare to lay the patient on the ground. When returning to the patient, he was staring blankly, hunched over, unresponsive, no pulse felt on a 5 second check, and had rheum dripping from nose and eyes. At 12:50pm the pharmacist instructed technician to call 911. Patient was lowered to the floor in the supine position where he remained unresponsive and no pulse could be felt on a 10 second check, but chest rise could not be evaluated as patient started to have convulsions.  Convulsions ceased after approximately 15 seconds and patient started groaning and moving his head and said he could hear but he couldn&#39;t open his eyes yet. Patient remained supine and the Pharmacist continued to carry on conversation with patient until EMS arrived at 12:57pm to evaluate patient. EMS attributed  the instance to syncope related to the vaccine.  The patient denied ambulatory care to the hospital for any further evaluation. Patient denied history of fainting expect for ?one unprovoked episode at his grandmother&#39;s house when he thinks his blood sugar got too low.?

                                                24 hours after the second Moderna dose, I began to feel very weak with a strong headache and a low grade fever. By Thursday (48 hours after vaccination) the headache was very strong and by that night it was debilitating. The fever had increased as well to between 101-102 degrees. Thursday night Friday I treated symptoms with alternating doses of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen, which succeeded in reducing the fever but did not rid of the headache. Saturday the debilitating headache persisted with extreme light sensitivity and nausea. The pain became so great Saturday night that my wife took me to the Emergency Room. There they performed a brain scan with an MRI that came back normal and treated the pain with Morphine. I was sent home around 8am Sunday morning with a prescription for Toradol. The pain did not decrease with the Toradol and by 6pm Sunday I was vomiting blood and the pain was excruciating. At the advice of my primary care doctor, I went back to the Emergency Room. In the Emergency department they performed a Lumbar Puncture and collected spinal fluid for testing, as well as blood for lab work. The pain was managed with Fentanyl. Late that evening the Hospital admitted me. I was given two more MRI&#39;s of the brain - one with contrast. I also underwent an upper scope of my esophagus, stomach, and upper colon which found 3 small ulcers likely due to the high volume of NSAID pain relievers taken over the previous days. The lumbar puncture revealed that my white blood cell count was 51 and they officially diagnosed aseptic meningitis.

                                                First night after receiving 2nd dose of the Moderna Vaccine,  I experienced a high fever and chills, sweating and a disturbing Ringing in my head. The second day after was roughly the same as the first night. I expected some of these symptoms and was willing to power through them.   It is now past 2 weeks since I have had the Vaccine. I still have a maddening Ringing in my head. Different than a Ringing in my ears. It does not feel the same. I feel pressure in my head, resulting in constant headaches that never subside. I have felt nauseous at random times, stomach pain from not being able to eat, and I am for the first time in my life experiencing anxiety and depression. I feel like my pain will never go away and I am scared. This pressure/pain in my head accompanied with the constant ringing is driving me insane. I have lost time at work, lost time with friends and family trying to sleep off my pain and symptoms but it never helps. I have taken headache medication which helps a small amount for the head pain, but leaves me with an upset stomach. I can not take these pain pills any more.  My Doctor, had me do a blood test and we are awaiting results as of today 5/25/21. I do not think they will find anything that will be able to help me with what I feel this Vaccine has done to me. I do not know what to do besides try not to cry myself to sleep anymore. I hate this and I do not want to feel this way anymore.
