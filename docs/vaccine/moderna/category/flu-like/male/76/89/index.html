Extreme pain in area of left arm/shoulder where the vaccine was given. Arm severely ached for 48 hours in any position, was very tender/painful to touch, and difficult to use or move. I&#39;m pretty tough where pain is concerned with past injuries (broken leg in 17 pieces, severely sprained ankles, broken ribs, broken tail bone from horse accident. This vaccination arm pain was right up there with the worst.

On 31 Dec 2020, the patient experienced chest pain that got worse when he took a deep breath.  He also felt warm, and his temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The patient visited the emergency room where an electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal and his COVID-19 test were negative.  Because of his history of coronary artery disease, he stayed in the hospital overnight.  On 01 Jan 2021, the hospital cardiologist called it a reaction the vaccine, and he was discharged.  On 05 Jan 2021, on a follow-up visit with another cardiologist, another EKG was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.  The cardiologist increased his carvedilol dose to 6.25 milligram from 3.125 milligram and added apixaban, 5 milligram, twice daily.  At the time of the report, he felt fine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, chest pain and fever, was considered recovered/resolved on 01 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76-year-old male patient with medical history of coronary artery disease, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation and the non-serious listed event of fever.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. However, the events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation may be explained by the patient&#39;s history of coronary artery disease.

                                                Patient received Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/30/2020 at a Pharmacy clinic where he was a resident. Nurses at the facility reported that he was responsive and showed no signs of any adverse effects until 1/2/2021 when he was observed slightly unresponsive and staring at the ceiling and trembling. He had a fever of 101F at this time. The facility ordered labs and a rapid COVID test (all of which came back normal) and started IV antibiotics. A few hours later, patient began bleeding from his eyes, nose, and mouth and was sent to the local ER. The patient refused being admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis/hemorrhage and died the following day on 1/3/2021. All healthcare professionals involved agreed that this was not likely due to the vaccine, but needed to be reported nonetheless.

                                                chills from neck to waist; received it up on my shoulder higher than normal; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 76-years-old, white, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and received it up on my shoulder higher than normal and experienced chills from the neck to waist.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 20 Jan 2021, six days prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first dose of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 20 Jan 2021, the patient received his vaccine and reported that he &#34;received it up on my shoulder higher than normal&#34;.  On 26 Jan 2021, the patient experienced chills from his neck to waist. He felt fine the next day. Treatment for the events, included 3 teapots of Earl Grey Tea, which did not help.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, received it up on my shoulder higher than normal, was not reported. The outcome of the event, chills from the neck to waist, was resolved on 27 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a white male patient who received their first dose of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection and received shot up on shoulder higher than normal and experienced non-serious listed event of chills from the neck to waist. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event of chills, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of chills is possibly related to the vaccine.

Took two rolaids and set on toliet in case I needed to throw up or had dirarerra.  Nothing happened so 30 minutes later took acid reducer pill and went back to bed.  Saturday morning pooped and it was black.  Extremely tired all day and about 11:00pm again got an upset stomach.  Threw up dark red liquid and had dirarerra and it was black.  Sunday again extremely tired and drank lots of water and avoided alcohol drinks.  (Had drank some beer on Friday and Saturday.)  Poop still black but no upset stomach.  Monday felt much better and poop became more brown.  By Tuesday I felt back to normal.

                                                Woke up the morning after my second injection feeling slightly ill, maybe 75% of what I normally feel like.  Did a two mile walk instead of my 4 mile run and continued the day as usual although somewhat subdued.  I did have chills off and on all day and a temperature of 99.2 which is high for me.  Went to bed and slept 11 hours and I am back to 100% this morning.

I had a significant fever that lasted for 18 hours. The first night I was unable to sleep because the body soreness and pain would not allow me to get comfortable. I started taking Tylenol shortly after the symptoms started but it did little to mitigate the symptoms during the first 24 hours. By the end  second day following vaccination, symptoms were beginning to subside. On the morning of the third day, I pretty much back to normal.

Presented to ED with newly diagnosed AML, in MDS with WBC counts ~250, 000.    He had a normal (EX ANEMIA) CBC on Jan-21. He had COVID vaccine #1 on Jan-25.  About 4-days later he developed diffuse dermititis and severe fatigue. He had an  ED visit on Feb-8 for these issues and was prescribed Prednisone and Cefalexin  (completed Feb-15).  CBC was NOT done at that ED visit. He called HEME clininc  on Feb-16 (see also the Hematology Note) stating that he was just NOT feeling  well in general with increased fatigue and DOE. He noted that the dermatitis was  mostly resolved. We rechecked CBC on Feb-17 (results available about 4-PM) that  indicated ACUTE LEUKEMIA.  Presents to the MC with MDS on FEB18.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.   On 15JAN2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly (Lot number: 026L20A). On 16JAN2021, the patient noted a start date for Pneumonia.  On 10FEB2021, the patient called the medical information call center and reported, &#34;he is on antibiotics for pneumonia. His 2nd question is can he delay the 2nd dose since he is suffering from pneumonia. Patient was administered 1st dose of vaccine on 15/Jan/2021 in his left non dominant arm. The lot# was provided, but expiration date is unknown. Patient experienced some expected side effects, which he is not concerned about&#34;.  The event(s) were arm swollen, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and tested positive for pneumonia 1 day after receiving the vaccine.  The action taken for Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine was reported by the patient as Tylenol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the events of fatigue, arm swelling, myalgia, muscle weakness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.

Patient is consistently in A-Fib post PaceMaker insertion (June 2020). He is paced at 70 bpm when in A-Fib.  His hearth rhythm went into sinus ~2.5 days post vaccine, and has remained so since.  Change is quite unusual and has only occurred once since pacemaker insertion (October 2020) when he had a significant flu/cold event.   More relevant is the increase in systolic blood pressure by over 20 pts.

Was sat down on sofa for maybe 2 mins. all of a sudden shoulders drooped, head fell forward, I asked &#34;dad are you ok&#34; there was not a response, I walked closer to him and his head flew back, his eyes were slit open, and he started gasping for air 3 times then slumped forward and passed out. 911 was called paramedics checked all vitals including blood sugar, oxygen, heart rate etc everything registered as normal.

Began to ease off after 26 hours. Awakened 20 hours after shot with sense of lassitude, sluggish thinking  - like the drowsiness an antihistamine may cause.  Just felt strange almost not really present in the moment sensation.  This is still still ongoing after 30 hours but easing off significantly.  no fevers, chills, myalgias or flu feeling. no local swelling or redness at injection site. This odd feeling did not interfere with daily 10000 step walk.  Feel much improved after exercise.

                                                The first three day I felt achy all over, if the afternoon felt chilled. My right arm was sore to movement ,like triceps/bicep area. It was very sore when I moved them.  I did have a stiff lower back, sore when I get up and down. I did see my PCP and she put me on a topical cream and arthritis medication, but doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s related to the vaccine.  It seems like it&#39;s getting better, but I will make a move and will hurt again.

He was scheduled to receive 2nd dose on March 11 and I was concerned about having a cough at the time of 2nd vaccine.  He went to walk-in clinic and got a covid test was negative, he said his exam was normal, they gave him prescription of Benzonatate 100mg he took one and it did not help so he never took any more.  On March 5 while working in the yard he collapsed, paramedics arrived and he was in cardiac arrest, they started CPR,  they used AED was in vfib, he was taken to Hospital then transferred to second hospital.  I was told he had blood clots in both lungs, one in his leg, and possible clots in the mesenteric area of abdomen.  His heart stopped due to the blood clots in his lungs.   He remains in the hospital in the Intermediate Coronary Care Unit.  He has not yet gained full consciousness.

I took 500 mg of Acetaminophen and by 3:00 P.M. my temperature was back to normal.  On 3-6-2021 my temperature was normal all day.

                                                Approximately 8 hrs after the second Moderna vaccination I starting having chills. These continued and increased in intensity along with the onset of fever. I did not have an accurate means of taking my temperature at the time. Over the course of the night on the 17th/18th of February the chills and fever never subsided, even with two doses of Tylenol. The day of the 18th, fever and chills continued along with a feeling of intense malaise. My sternum was very sore and it hurt to breathe as a result of the prolonged shivering. I had no appetite and ate absolutely nothing the day of the 18th. In the early morning hours of the 19th my fever broke as did the chills. However, later in the day, a thermometer was obtained and my fever was 101.4 degrees. When taken at bedtime, it was down the 99 degrees and returned to normal later with no future spikes. On the morning of the 20th when I awoke, I noticed a stinging soreness in my mouth and lip area, followed later in the day with my nostrils and inner nose. This turned out to be an intense outbreak of Herpes. The roof of my mouth, gums, upper surface of my tongue, lips, nostrils, and inner nose ultimately became covered and extremely painful. These lesions were not typical blebs, but were tiny, albeit most painful. After five days they resolved and I have had no further issues. As a possible area to investigate - I had had the second Shingles booster 14 days prior to my first Moderna COVID vaccination. I understand Shingles is also a Herpes family virus.

On 28-Feb-2021, Body temperature: 104.4 - 103.8 degrees f (Inconclusive) temperature range was 97.3 - 99.7 degrees F.. In 2021, Chest X-ray: pneumonia (abnormal) Pneumonia was confirmed.         Treatment for the event included paracetamol.  Pneumonia is of an infective origin, hence assessed as not causally associated with mRNA-1273 administration based on the known profile of the product.  However, based on the information provided which includes a temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the other reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and chills are consistent with the product known safety profile.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-031492 (Patient Link).   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 29-Apr-2021: Medically confirmed changed.

Vitals were taken, pulse was in the 40&#39;s, pt alert and oriented, soda given to see if blood sugar dropped. Continued to monitor, pulse remained low and pt continued to complain of feeling dizzy. 911 was notified and EMS arrived by 12:35pm. EKG strip performed, along with vials from the EMT in the health department. Positive orthostatic hypotension found by paramedic. EMS notified ER doctor on call for recommendations. ER doctor said vitals were consistent with dehydration and could be admitted for IV fluids or return home and encouraged to increase fluids. Wife and pt declined ambulance ride and request to return home.

But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

I noticed that the injection was inserted in the top of my shoulder and not on the side. The injection hurt more than any shot I have ever had, and I have had many. I don&#39;t know if my shoulder pain was caused by the way the needle was inserted of because of some reaction. I am in excellent health and have the long term covid antibodies.

                                                By 1:30 am on 2/4/2021; patient was shaking uncontrollably.  This continued about 1 1/2 hrs. then he could not get out of bed to go to the bathroom; thus wetting himself multiple times during the night; Patient was restless for about 5 hrs. but still could not get up even with me (his spouse) trying to help.  He also could not understand how to help move his body to keep from falling out of bed (never fell out but I could not get his entire body on the bed until our daughter arrived around 9:30 am.  It took our grandson who is 6&#39;5&#34; tall &amp; 275 lbs. to help get patient up and walked him into our sunroon.  throughout the day, patient could not stand without help &amp; continued to urinate on himself.  He could, however, feed himself breakfast &amp; lunch.  At 7:30 pm grandson and daughter had to walk patient into bedroom.  patient could not walk without us telling him how and pushing his feet forward.  It took both grandson and daughter to pull him onto the bed as he collapsed when he got to the bed.  Patient slept until approximately midnight. at that time our daughter helped him to the bathroom and helped to change his underwear and tshirt which was wet from having a fever.  Afterward, patient was able to go to the bathroom by himself but was very tired.  He was able to walk outside with the help of a cane on 2/5/21 2 pm.  On 2/6/21, patient complained of his back hurting and itching.  We discovered he had shingles!  Not a full body rash but shingles on his left side around his waist.

                                                Pneumonia; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 78 years-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and who experienced pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol trifenatate, irbesartan, amlodipine besilate, metoprolol, glipizide, metformin, omeprazole, magnesium, and omega 3.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly on 22 Jan 2021 for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Jan 2021 within a few hours of first dose, the patient developed fever, chills, weakness, and productive cough. On 24 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted to hospital due to oxygen levels in the 60s with productive cough, yellow sputum, and short of breath. He was diagnosed with pneumonia. During hospitalization, the patient had two negative PCR COVID-19 tests.  Treatment information was not provided.  The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the events.  The outcome of event pneumonia  was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s medical history of COPD and pulmonary fibrosis may have been contributory.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Dramatic drop in %SpO2: from a range of 94 - 97, to 88 - 89, with occasional drops to 87. I checked it because I found, even on waking, that I needed to make an effort to breathe more deeply - which did make enough of a difference. In a setting where it would have been available, I am sure I would have received O2. I also had a fever of up to 101.3, and felt &#34;rotten&#34;, but not dire. In 2017, I had some sort of incident - I was traveling at the time, and it was never &#34;determined&#34;  - that may have been a &#34;scatter&#34; pulmonary embolism - where the clot breaks apart before distributing into the lung. Initially, I did have quite low %SpO2 readings, but over the years that has improved. But these readings were even lower than I had ever seen. I have two oximeters, to, um, verify each other, so I am reasonably confident of their readings. I have a background in physics so I have some experience with instrumentation.  This situation continued for perhaps 6 hours, then the fever slowly went down and the %SpO2 increased to 90 ? 91, which was ?manageable?, then slowly higher. It is still lower than it had been, but feels normal enough.    Since this dramatic drop in %SpO2 seemed a part of COVID-19 symptoms, I thought this might be significant, and that is why I am reporting it.

                                                Starting about 5 or 6 hours after the injection I became extremely tired and that persists through today, 7 days later. At times, I found even a small exertion like walking up a couple of flights of stairs to be exhausting. At times my head felt buzzy, although I haven&#39;t had a fever. At times I also felt fine but then would relapse. My sleep has also been erratic, although not very good normally. Arthritic joints are more painful.

It didn&#39;t itch, it hurt when something was dragged over it, like a finger or clothing.  It was deep, deep red and some parts of his body there was no regular skin showing.  Took him to ER, where tests were run, showing his liver counts were way off.  Biopsy was taken of the rash.  It was determined that the rash was similar to Stevens-Johnson and he was admitted for 2.5 days.  They put him on large doses of steroids, which helped the rash.  All labs were headed in the right direction except his liver panel.  He was sent home and returned to doctor in 3 days to run panels again.  All were headed in right direction, even the liver.  He will see his cardiologist to be put back on his heart medicines.

Currently alert and resting.  States that patient had his 2nd covid vaccine yesterday AM and then develop chills and clammy skin last night.  Symptoms worsened today and patient became weak and fainted.  Was unconscious for about 5 minutes and while unconscious, mouth was open and drooling and became incontinent and eyes rolled back in head.  Is awake and alert now, but still weak and only able to take 1 or 2 steps.  No chest pain or breathing difficulty and no fever.  Feeling very nauseous.  Caller requesting prescription for zofran.      Yesterday AM 2nd vaccine. Last night chills. This AM feeling weak. Today at 11am he felt weak with ambulation. He fainted. Was unconscious for 5 min. Had drooping of the face. He was unresponsive during this time. Had incontinence of urine. Then became awake but very weak still. Only able to walk a few steps. He is communicating. No chest pain. No current fever. No shortness of breath. BP 107/75 with HR 70. He has been very nauseated. He is drinking only small sips of water. Does not seem like a usually COVID-19 vaccine reaction. Given the LOC with urinary incontinence and sustained weakness, I advised ER evaluation to rule out neurological issues. Pt&#39;s daughter in agreement. They will go to ER.  From Emergency Department:  Patient presenting with chief complaint of syncopal episode which was witnessed by his wife.  He reported the got dizzy and lightheaded and then passed out while seated.  The reported duration of his loss of consciousness was somewhat inconsistent, unclear how long he passed out for, there was however no postictal state.  He was not noted have any shaking or seizure activity, he did have an episode of urinary incontinence.  He has not been feeling well ever since receiving his 2nd COVID-19 vaccine.  By the time of my exam patient states that he is completely asymptomatic, he states he is feeling much better after receiving IV fluids.  His lab work is remarkable for a slightly low sodium, compared to his previous levels which were many months ago.  Unclear of the acuity of this, although upon further discussion with the patient he has been drinking large amounts of water since his vaccine trying to stay hydrated.  I advised him to substitute to some electrolyte balanced fluids and to have his sodium rechecked by his PCP to ensure that this is transient.  With negative testing and resolution of his symptoms he is stable for discharge home.  Close return precautions were given.

The patient acquired a Stevens-Johnson like syndrome which required a three day inpatient stay and the consultation of Infectious Disease and Dermatologic consultants. Per his SCORTEN score, he had roughly a 3% chance of mortality from the event. He was closely monitored for signs of decompensation but did not have excessive desquamation or duskiness after treatment was initiated. With IV steroids and IV rehydration, the patient improved over the hospitalization course and labs were essentially back to normal a week later on follow up.

Called his physician who felt that these symptoms were due to the vaccine, encouraged him to go ahead and get second dose.

By noon felt lethargic and slept the remainder of day. He experienced incontinence while sleeping. He had trouble walking, and could not make it to the bathroom without support. While in the bathroom he went to the floor, (did not fall), could not get up. I had him crawl on his hands and knees to the living room. It&#39;s a though his muscles went soft. Remained lethargic the remainder of the day. Did not see a doctor.  Stayed at home and waited for symptoms to pass.

Explained to him about the same. Pt was given the 1st dose, made to wait for 15 minutes , no reaction so was sent home. He apparently did not feel good the night of vaccination and subsequently developed rashes all over his torso, the next day. He had a lot of itching as well. He did not go to any facility for care. He said that he did some home remedies. Per pt, the rash lasted for 8 days. He is ok now.

                                                Had muscle and joint pain and low fever for 2 days after vaccination. Stayed in bed. 4 days after vaccination a bubble the size of 3/4 of a golf ball popped up on the tip of my left elbow, Olecranon Bursitis. The pain was minimal but I could not put the elbow on a table or the arm of a chair without sudden pain. Bubble stayed the same for 4 weeks and then slowly went down over 10 days. Elbow is still sore when hit or put on a table. Got vaccinated 2nd time in the right arm on 02/22/2021. Right knee started hurting after 4 days. Could only walk by keeping the leg straight. Went away as suddenly as it came after 4 days.

                                                He had the injection, had the sore arm and approximately 3 hours after the vaccination he began to experience severe chest pain across his entire chest and into his jaw, which was exacerbated upon taking a deep breath.  He called his cardiologist who advised him to go to the ER.  He was worked up, subsequently admitted from 2/8/21 to 2/11/21, a lot was ruled out but no specific diagnosis made at that time.  They did note some pleural effusion and pericardial effusion at that time.  Upon discharge on 2/11/21, starting Thursday evening he continued to have pain in the chest, but not as severe as when he entered into the hospital.  Every evening including last night has began with severe night sweats, low grade fever and the chest pains have continued.  Went to see his PCP,  Cardiologist and his Electrophysiologist several days later the following after discharge, he does have a pacemaker, and was told by all three of them that he has pericarditis and that the reaction could have been related to the vaccination.  It seemed more than coincidental that the symptoms did not appear until 3 hours after the vaccine.  Was put on Colchicine to treat the pericarditis and then received a 2nd opinion and has reinstituted the colchicine.  His low grade fever has finally dissipated.  During the day he feels okay, but still continues with the chest pains and the night sweats.  His hemoglobin dropped in the hospital possibly related to the heparin and then put on Eliquis postop, and now discontinued, and received an iron infusion to boost his hemoglobin.  He is scheduled for another iron infusion this Wednesday.    He  went to see GI physician and feels that he may have a bleed due to the infusion.   He has had an anastomosis due to Crohn&#39;s disease and feels that&#39;s where the bleed may have been coming from as he did have an ulceration at last colonoscopy.  He did have atrial flutter due this and was advised to have an ablation, and trying to reduce the pericarditis and FU later with other heart related problems.

                                                Patient awoke the morning of March 5th feeling weak, fatigued, and unsteady. He went to his primary care provider 5 days later on the 10th of March, as his symptoms were not improving. He told his PCP there that the past few days he was suffering from unsteady gait, walking around like hes &#34;drunk&#34;, and bouncing off walls. It was thought his symptoms were caused by a low serum potassium value, so he was given a rx for potassium. 3 days later the patient presented to the emergency room where his problems persisted. He was still having trouble keeping balance when he walked around. One of the providers treating him reached out to neurology, who recommended that the patient be started on high dose steroids followed by a prednisone taper for tranverse myelitis, The patient was then admitted and treated at Hospital.

                                                Hallucinations; Dizziness; Fatigue; Nausea; Vomiting; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning her husband, a 77-year-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On an unspecified date, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 01 Mar 2021, approximately three days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: unknown) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 03 Mar 2021, after second dose of vaccine, the patient experienced nausea and vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, and hallucinations. The event hallucinations were considered to be medically significant. The patient was also not been out bed for seven days. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not applicable.    The outcome of the events, hallucinations, dizziness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events (dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding these event (hallucination) has been provided at this time. Medical history and concomitant medications are required for assessment. However, further information has been requested. However, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting are expected for mRNA1273.

                                                Not sure if covid vaccine caused this, but this is what happened - Received covid vaccine.  two days later had violent shakes in the night.  Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

It was discovered he did not get his second Moderna Vaccine and it was beyond 42 days. since he had the vaccine. His first Moderna Vaccine was given on 2/11/21. On 3/30/21 the second dose of the Moderna Vaccine was given here at hospital. He began to have symptoms that at first seemed like a  normal but severe reaction to the vaccine including, fever and myalgias.  His labs showed neutropenia. He tested positive for COVID-19 on 4/3. It was determined he had Covid-19.   While this is not truly a reaction to or caused by the second vaccine we considered this was good information to make known. Patient who had one dose of Moderna vaccine contracted Covid. His symptoms are mild and he is improving. He has several comorbidities that put him at risk. We moved him to  an isolation negative pressure room and we continue to monitor.

                                                Received my 1st Covid shot yesterday at 11:45. No problem. Went home and went for a 4 mile walk. Still no problem. At about 2:00 AM this morning I woke up shivering. Added another blanked and turned up the heat. No improvement. Finally got up and woke up my wife. Temperature was 101.7° F. Blood pressure was 149/90. Took some ibuprofen and sat on the sofa with a heating pad on my chest for about two hours. Blood Pressure dropped back to its normal 125/75 (may have been high because I took it the moment I got up) but temp was the same. However, shivering had stopped, so I went back to bed.  When I woke up this morning (about 8:00) temperature was 99.1° F, blood pressure was normal (125/71) and no other symptoms. My arm isn&#39;t sore either. It appears that the elevated temperature was my only reaction from the shot. It&#39;s interesting because during the entire time I did have COVID symptoms, I never had any elevated temperature.

THE WEAKNESS AND FEVER CONTINUED FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS.  I AM STILL VERY WEAK AND CAN&#39;T HARDLY WALK. MY HIP FLARED UP AND CAUSED ME GREAT PAIN AND IMBALANCE.  ALL THE AREAS THAT I HAD OCCASSIONAL OSTEOARTHRITIS I AM NOW IN CONSTANT PAIN.  I CAN NO LONGER SLEEP ON MY RIGHT SHOULDER.  BOTH OF FEET FLARED UP AND HURT ALL THE TIME.

Rolled out of bed, could not stand up or hardly walk to the bathroom.  Felt very faint, had to hold onto wall.  Was very sweaty, running temperature, cold sweats.  Just kept getting worse and thought about going to the ER and then decided to put it off until talking to somebody.  Called 2-1-1 and the lady told her that it was part of the side-effects to it.  She told her to call her doctor, and they were not in on the weekend.  This morning, the doctor called and asked if she had Corona, his other doctor retired and got this one the first of January.  Took 3 months to recover from the COVID and was on antibiotics, and told her because he have antibodies.  Feeling better, still having some achiness.

I tried my hardest to stay up awake until bedtime to try and not mess up my sleep schedule. When I went to bed I slept for 10 hours which is unheard of for me. I am still tired this morning. The other thing is on my Eliquis I take it twice a day, I set my cell phone to go off. I apparently just turned my phone  when it went off in the evening, I didn&#39;t remember to take my 2nd dose of my medication. I worried if the vaccine caused some confusion.   I am going to call my Primary Care doctor today. I did call the VA as well and talk to a nurse who said that I should be feeling better today.

                                                About 4 hours after his vaccine, the injection site starting hurting, but not bad.  He could not sleep on it at night as he felt like he was sleeping on a red hot pocker.  On Saturday he was extremely tired in the afternoon.  Had to come in from yard work as he could not function.  He also had pain in his neck and shoulders.  On Sunday he the feelings were going away, but his muscles started aching.  On Monday he felt really strange, felt like he was in a fog, and his muscles ached.  He could not get relaxed, did his normal Monday chores, laundry and house cleaning.  He then tried to relax but his muscles and nerves were very tense.  He went to bed around 9:30 on Monday, fell asleep and awoke at 2:00 AM and could not go back to sleep his muscles in his arms and legs were in spasm and his arm would jump like a shock reaction and jump off of the mattress, as well as his leg.  It was worse on the left side than the right arm.  This went on every 10-15 minutes for about 3-4 hours.  Around 4:00 AM this morning it eased off to sleep and woke up at 10 and felt better today.  He hasn&#39;t had any more of the seizure type feelings in his arms or legs.  He did speak with Moderna who told him that he was the 4th one with this reaction and to report this to us.

                                                Late Friday evening, my upper front gums became extremely sensitive, to the point I could not brush my teeth that night.  Saturday morning, the sensitivity spread to the back side of my upper teeth and it felt like I had small blisters on the roof of my mouth from drinking too hot a beverage.  That evening I developed a deep cough, and I started taking Halls cough drops.  Sunday I started taking a cough syrup and chest expecturant.  Monday I call my dentist but his office was closed.  My temperature was in 100.1 range.  On Tuesday I saw my dentist and he was somewhat taken back.  My temperature was in the 99.5 range.  He mentioned COVID Tongue issues but had no data, and he put me on a fungal mouthwash.

                                                Patient had a sore arm on the evening of vaccination.  The next morning at 8am he had a fever of 103 degrees, violent shaking, and his lips were numb.  He was transported by ambulance to the ER and admitted.  He received IV therapy and acetaminophen.  He states he vomited February 4th.  An X-ray was performed on his abdomen and he was given a diagnosis of Ileus.  The next day, February 5th, he was able to have a BM and eat.  After he was able to eat, he was released from the hospital.  Shortly after being released from the hospital his lips started breaking out in fever blisters.  He estimates he had 50 or so cold sores and his lips were extremely swollen and red.  After seeing his regular health care provider, he started a round of Valcyclovir.  On February 10th, the date he reported the adverse reaction, he stated his lips were getting better and he still had more Valcyclovir to take.

I found him bent over a chair in the bedroom @ 3 am and he couldn&#39;t straighten himself out. He needed help to go to the bathroom. He was very off balance. He hit his head into a cabinet that is above the toilet. I had to hold him  up as he used the toilet. He also had a problem getting back into the bed twice.

                                                3/2 I got my first moderna shot yesterday. Last night I started developing chills, a couple degree fever, overall body aches much like the flu and persistent slight nausea. Did not throw up but was uncomfortable for sure. Slept in 2 to 2.5 hour shifts then up to pee and back to bed. Finally this morning I lslept from 10 am to 2 pm. 4 wonderful hours of blissful unconsciousness. My O2 this morning was 98/74 BP 135/81/69. I just took my bp 315 pm and it was running 141 high end. O2 was good at 97 but heartrate was 99 and temp was 99.7 to 99.1.

                                                March 3, 2021 SUBJECT: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, Side Effects This letter/email is addressed to a number of individuals with a request that you seriously evaluate the below discussion, take action to alert medical staff of your respective agencies of these side effects, and work with the manufacturer, Moderna, to address them.  As the recipient of them it has thus far been debilitating and interfered with my daily activities.  It is my hope that the medical community can find ways to prevent or treat them such that daily activity can be unimpeded.     I will first provide a chronology of my medical history and my Moderna vaccine experience.  Then I will discuss my observations. My medical history: Age: 78 Gender: Male Pre-existing Conditions: Medications  Hypertension: Blood pressure medication, 50 mg of Metoprolol Succinate ER daily  Cholesterol: Atorvastatin, 40 mg daily Medical History   2018: Triple By-Pass Surgery 2019: Passed out, Hit head on falling, Brain bleed: Subdural Hematoma, Hospitalized: No surgery required and released.  Subsequently, pacemaker installed. 2021: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine administered.  First Dose: Lot Number: 011J20A, Date: 01/08/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Second Dose: Lot Number: 032L20A, Date: 02/05/2021, Clinic Site: Pharmacy  Side Effects to Moderna Vaccine administration  First Dose: Administration Site: Swelling, Site Redness and Fever.  All dissipated within week after administration  Second Dose: Fever and Chills day following administration.  Lethargic for several days following administration.  These symptoms disappeared. Observations  February 24, 2021: Began to experience dizziness, symptoms progressed to mild vertigo.  Based on history of presentation of these symptoms, assumed I had an inter-ear problem and began taking Zyrtec D, half a tablet.  Experience with Zyrtec D has been that ear dries out and symptoms of dizziness and disorientation disappear.  In this case the symptoms of vertigo progressed to the point of difficulty in walking and loss of balance. Stopped taking Zyrtec D on Friday, February 26th.  February 26, 2021: Had more severe vomiting, walking difficulty and lose of balance.  Used walker to stabilize walking.  At approximately 7 to 7:30 PM, following consultation with wife and daughter, decided to go the emergency room of the Medical Center (MC).  Was quickly seen by emergency room staff.  Following questions on medical history, the ER doctor, based on head bleed history, I believe, had a CT conducted.  I do not recall any questions about COVID-19, but do think we told them that both myself and my wife had been vaccinated for COVID-19.  I specifically recall that prior to my transport, a nurse came in to do a nasal swab for COVID-19.  I informed her that I had been vaccinated, but she said this was a requirement for admission to the location where I was being transported.  Following the CT scan, the ER physician determined he believed there was a possibility of a small new brain bleed.  At approximately 2 to 2:30 AM I was transported by ambulance to Health Center at approximately 5:00 AM.  I am not certain about the exact times here.  February 27, 2021: Health Center administered a number of tests including CT scan, EKG, and an echocardiogram.  While there, physical therapists came to see me twice and exercised me to improve my balance and walking ability.  The last one recommended exercises to help reset my vestibular system.  Based on the administered CT scan there, the physicians saw no evidence of a new brain bleed and were prepared to release me.  At the time of that discussion in my room, the attending nurse pointed out to the physician there that my blood pressure was elevated.  He ordered a new EKG and deferred on releasing me until a cardiologist reviewed the results.  Their concern was that I was experiencing episodes of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Subsequently, the cardiologist reviewed the new EKG and concluded the episodes were within the normal range, my understanding, but did note that my heart rate was elevated.  At no time did the medical staff raise or question the possibility of COVID-19 side effects as being a possible explanation for my disorientation or heart rate problem.  I was released later that day.  February 28, 2021:  While speaking to her sister, my wife shared with her my experience of dizziness and disorientation.  Her sister related that her husband had and was experiencing a similar event.  Further, her husband?s sister had experienced a similar event.  Additionally, the husband?s sister had experienced vertigo.  On further discussion it was determined all three of us had received the Moderna Vaccine, and approximately three to four weeks post second dose administration, developed these symptoms of vertigo.  This prompted me to go to the internet for information on vaccine side effects.  The Food and Drug Administration Fact Sheet, revised 12/2020 in the Section Titled: What are the risks of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine? speaks of severe allergic reactions including: a fast heartbeat and dizziness and weakness.  I believe that I have suffered these two reactions.  March 1, 2021:  Called both hospitals to alert them to inform their respective staffs of the need to question the possibility of these side effects should other patients present in their emergency rooms.  In my case, it may have helped to alleviate my concerns had I been informed of these possible side effects.  At MC I left a voice mail for the Chief Medical Officer and at Health Center I spoke to the Nursing Supervisor.  The nursing supervisor advised me to report my side effects and directed me to call the entity who had administered the vaccine doses.  I called the Pharmacist and spoke to her.  She said she would report my concerns through her reporting system.  Further she informed me that there was a medication my primary care provider could prescribe.  I called my primary care provider, and he has prescribed Meclizine, 25 mg tablets.  I am currently taking ½ tablet, three times per day.  A whole tablet made me drowsy.  As of today, March 3, 2021, I am still experiencing disorientation.  Hopefully this will subside and disappear. The above discussion is provided to assist medical professionals to further assess the side effects of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine.  I am glad that I received it.  I have no complaint about the care I received at the two medical facilities referenced.  In fact, I think it was excellent.  However, it would have helped me to have raised by either or both of them that my symptoms may have been COVID-19 Vaccine related.  Further, it may have changed how they proceeded in assessing my situation. As an industrial hygienist with statistical training, it seems to me somewhat unusual to have three members of my extended family experiencing similar dizziness and weakness side effects, and for us all to have similar time periods following the administration of the second dose.  Perhaps, if related to the vaccine, this cluster would suggest that this side effect may be more common than a ?remote chance.?  Should any of you have further questions or wish to speak to me, please do not hesitate to call.  Since I get a lot of calls from numbers I do not recognize, I do not always answer, but a voice mail left with a return call number normally results in a return call. Today, I received a return call from the Chief Medical Director of MC and told her she would receive a copy of this document. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Then saw the news report about women getting false positive  mammogram results only on the same side they had their vaccine in and that seems to be the case with my events - all on left side.

He did not have the core strength to even help him sit up. Sometime after he was assisted back on the couch around 4:30 am  he must of got back up and attempted to go to restroom because he was found on the floor with his arm and face resting on the love seat which looked as if he was trying to pull himself up. His wife found him in the morning around 11:00 am and he had been died for some time according to EMS. His death was unexpected. Even when contacting his doctors they were confused as to why he had passed away.  No autopsy was done but as of this moment he has not been cremated yet and is at Funeral Home.

                                                I experienced this rather immediate unexpected gradually increasing dizziness with impaired balance while walking at accustomed pace over approximately 12-15 minute time period.  I was compelled to leave the track and lay down on an exercise mat where fortunately my wife came by t Within half hour of this attack i coiuld not stand and walk independently without support. My first time to a hospital ER  in my 78 years of life. Recommended for observation and additional tests I stay overnight in observation unit. Diagnosis appeared to be perplexing for physicians.  My wife  came by to assist me in standing , walking to the car and driving me to nearby ER. What happened to me was a frightening, anxiety-producing and dangerous situation. I could have easily fallen with substantial head or other bodily injury. Being in excellent health and with nothing else unusual having occurred recently to affect my general health (no changes, no illnesses), I cannot help conclude this episode was a serious adverse reaction to my 2nd Moderna vaccination.  I now consider what happened on 3/28/21 a &#34;Vestibular Attack&#34;. I think possibly my body for some reason related to the vaccine might have been attacking itself, if that makes sense to scientists.  I hope this doesn&#39;t happen to others. I am not anti-vaccination. But individuals should be warned about this possible dangerous reaction or adverse side effect, which in my case did not occur immediately after the 2nd Moderna dose. I&#39;ve complained to the hospital that possibility of severe dizziness with extreme loss of balance being related to recent Moderna 2nd vaccination was NOT discussed or commented.

On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain), DYSPNOEA (labored breathing), ASTHENIA (very weak), RASH (got rash on both of his forearms), HEADACHE (headaches), FATIGUE (fatigue) and CHILLS (he had chills). On 27-Apr-2021, the patient experienced NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and DEHYDRATION (he was dehydrated). On an unknown date, the patient experienced MYALGIA (hurting all over). The patient was hospitalized on 28-Apr-2021 due to NEPHROSTOMY. At the time of the report, NEPHROSTOMY (nephrostomy bleeding), DEHYDRATION (he was dehydrated), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (arm pain), DYSPNOEA (labored breathing), ASTHENIA (very weak), RASH (got rash on both of his forearms), HEADACHE (headaches), MYALGIA (hurting all over), FATIGUE (fatigue) and CHILLS (he had chills) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter. After the patient got the vaccine, he was very fatigue for a few days. He had a lot of arm pain. The doctors noticed that he got rash on both of his forearms. He complained of headaches and it was hurting all over. He was very weak and had chills. He had labored breathing. His nephrostomy was bleeding a lot in the tubes so they had to hospitalize him. He went to hospital on 27-Apr-2021 and was currently in the hospital. He had blood transfusions and he was very dehydrated. He was put on IV saline. He took Eliquis but doctors wanted to stop it because his kidneys were not in good shape.  Company comment: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which indicates patient&#39;s underlying history of nephrostomy, a causal association between the event of nephrostomy bleeding and dehydration and the administration of mRNA-1273 and the events is assessed as unlikely as  the event is common local complication from nephrostomy tube placement,  The other events are temporarily associated with the product use and a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Approximately 26 hours after the vaccination extreme dizziness occurred and he lost consciousness for a few  seconds.  He was clay and completely lost his coloring . His son is a retired HCP and we took vitals and within 30 minutes after drinking electrolytes he was back to normal.  We believe he was dehyrated. He has had vertigo in the past and has a pacemaker.  His blood pressure was taken in 3 positions and within less than 30 minutes after having him hydrate all symptoms subsided.  I emailed these symptoms to his Medical Doctor.  We also had him use his pacemaker monitoring system to send a report to his healthcare specialist.

                                                Currently waiting for dental work (crown removal and replacement to treat cavity).    2/18/21 Started to experience toothache (R) which got worse as the day progressed.  Tylenol didn&#39;t help.  Took one tab of Percocet (5-325) to allow me to sleep.    2/19/21 Contacted dentist and was prescribed Penicillin VK 500 mg. Started Penicillin around 3 pm.   2/19/21 ~6 pm onset shakes, chills, sweating, low grade fever (~100.2), nausea, headache, weakness,  difficulty in standing.  Took more tylenol, lay down, fell asleep for approximately 3 hours. Woke briefly took my nighttime meds (atrovastatin, metoprolol, ranolazine, baby aspirin.) Additional information for Item 18:  2/20/21 Felt better when I woke up.  Temp normal. Ate breakfast.  Mild stomach ache. Around 3 pm onset of sweating and chills, shakes. Low grade temp (~100)   2/22/21 Fully recovered.  No lingering issues.  Not sure whether what I experienced is related to the Moderna vaccine or a reaction to the Percocet I took to alleviate the severe pain associated with my toothache.

Moderna Dose #2:   About 7 hours post-injection I experienced a temperature (101 F peak) and mild chills, a short-term mild headache, mild muscle /joint aches, and an ache at the injection site.  These effects lasted for about 36 hours and then were gone.  I would compare them to a mild 2-day case of the flu.

He fell on the floor and was unable to get up.  His face was very flushed and he broke out in a sweat several times.  We had to have fire dept come and pick him up off the floor.  He was able to get around a little bit with a walker, but spent most of the day in bed and was transported to bathroom by wheelchair.  He was also a bit confused.  He had very little appetite and was unable to eat very much.  At dinner time, he ate a little bit of soup and when he stood up at the table, fell again onto wood floor.  We had to call fire dept to pick him up from floor and EMT&#39;s/ambulance to come out and check him over.  VItals were all normal.  He was just a little bit better on the next several days.  We made an appointment for him to see Dr. on 3/3.  Doctor did blood work which came back normal. Pt. is still not back to normal.

Over the course of the day I alternated taking Ibuprofen (200mg) and Acetaminophen (500mg) every two hours for eight hours to drive down the temperature.  I also pushed water, and took naps.  I continued this treatment throughout the day of Feb. 19, and once on Saturday, Feb. 20.  I experienced a deep degree of lethargy beginning these days and continuing for several days later.  I did not &#34;feel like my old self&#34; until Friday, Feb. 2, eight days following the vaccination.

                                                By 3:00 he had a whole body chill.  He was then incoherent, lost all control of all body muscles and was incontinent both bladder and bowel.  He continued as such when Dr. said to give him Prednisone along with the Benadryl he was receiving every six hours starting at 3:30 p.m. 3/8/2021.  He was given a Prednisone at 4:00 p.m. 3/9/2021 and again at 8:00 p.m. on 3/9/2021 along with his Benadryl.  He was unable to ambulate or even turn his body over in bed.  He was able sip water and sports drink but ate nothing since noon on 3/8/2021.  It wasn&#39;t until early Sunday morning that he was able to move his legs and get to a walker and use the toilet.  He slow, very slowly has improved since then.  Late Sunday he was able to get up, and sit in a chair.  Later he was able to take a sit down shower and shampoo and   be an to feel &#34;nearly human&#34; again.  He has slowly progressed since then and Monday morning was able to navigate by himself and to descend and ascend a 13 stair step to the basement.    In discussing the 24 hours he spent in bed he was unaware of any of the things going  on such as not being able to move, but knew he was in pain if he moved his legs.  He also had a temperature of 102.3 which rose to 102.9 and then with cold compress on his forehead and time his fever dropped to 95.4 and the back up to a normal of 97.5.  These are similar symptoms he had after the first injection of the Covid 19 Moderna vaccine and he had had a similar reaction in 2017 from the first flu shot he ever had in his life.  He felt he needed to take this vaccine in order to be able to &#34;have a life&#34; even though we assumed he would have such a bad reaction.  He is slowly improving and if it is like the first injection it will take him nearly two weeks before he can ambulate at the level he was before the vaccination.  Still, he is grateful to Center for being so proactive as to have available the vaccine and it being more convenient for cancer patients than waiting in line at a mass inoculation center.   He would appreciate an acknowledgement that this information has been received and could possibly passed along to help others in his situation.  Thanks.

                                                Within 4 hours of vaccination my arm swelled up noticeable, became very stiff and sore and made it painful to move my left arm. By 8:00pm I began to feel weak, tired and poorly. By 11:pm I had developed a fever and aches and pains in most joints and muscles which mimicked flu symptons. During the night I became chilled and found it hard to sleep from all of the discomfort. Most of these symptons were almost gone by the next night except for the swelling, which took another 2 days to go down. I have had no other symptons since then.

                                                On the fifth day after vaccination I found myself disorganized in routine, everyday activities, such as washing &amp; dressing, preparing meals, etc.; for example, I omitted washing my ears and forgot to put the kettle on.  In the afternoon I was troubled by a headache of a novel sort, not with indefinite perimeter, but more specifically delimited, with ragged edges.  Then that evening after ascending a flight of stairs, I heard a loud thumping, then suddenly realized that it was my own heartbeat that I could hear in my head.  These bizarre effects disappeared by the next day. On the seventh through fourteenth days after the vaccination, I experienced a soreness in my trunk below the rib-cage, at first toward the sides, but then becoming more insistent and less localized; this was accompanied by headache (normal dull sort), along with irritation at the back of my nasal passages, and a feeling of being tired already upon waking.

I was shaking all over, ached all over as well as a headache.  very similar to my 1st vaccine reaction only much worse.  Again i was planning to play golf Friday and Saturday mornings but cancelled.  Can&#39;t play golf when you can barely walk.  I drank pedialyte and gatorade to  rehydrate and basically had no energy to do anything but sleep off and on for the next 2 days.  It wasn&#39;t until Tuesday that I began feeling normal.  Temperature slowly went down and finally was normal Monday night.

Over the next few days the pain got worse so that I couldn&#39;t lie on that side of my body. The symptoms progressed towards my shoulder and neck and other lymph nodes became painful. The next phase a few days later was red spots and blisters around the injection site on my chest near my neck on my left side. At the present time the blisters have mostly gone away but they&#39;ve been replaced by welts where the red spots were these are swollen and red. All of these symptoms are accompanied by fatigue and muscle pain also around my left shoulder. I have been treating it for the past 3 days with ice and am now taking an antihistamine Benadryl.

Then on 12/22/20, he received his first COVID vaccine. On 12/26/20, he began to have c/o hurting all over. Noted history of aspiration and COPD. On 12/29/20, he began to have coughing, increased shortness of breath and runny nose with course breath sounds in his bilateral lower lobes. A chest xray was done and he was initiated on oral azithromycin and cefepime for a bilateral pneumonia. On 1/3/21, he continued to decline with increasing shortness of breath and was subsequently transferred to acute care medicine. All COVID tests have been negative since the presumptive positive on 11/9/20. He did have a CTA that ruled out PE but did show bilateral pneumonia. His antibiotics have been changed to meropenem, vancomycin and IV azithromycin. He remains on acute care at time and has not required ICU care.

                                                Saturday morning (30 hours after vaccination) onset of widespread abdominal pain and tenderness, extending all over the whole surface of the abdomen; tenderness to pressure over the same area; pressure accentuated the abdominal pain symptom.  The pain was associated with mild nausea.  These symptoms continued through Sunday and into Monday following vaccination.  Moderate to severe lethargy, expected with COVID vaccination.  On Monday, the symptoms stopped. No cramps, diarrhea, constipation, fever, cough, loss of smell or taste or other expected side effects of COVID or its vaccinations.  No symptoms relative to an allergic reaction.  No treatment was necessary, other than bedrest. I am a retired public health physician.  My theory:  peritoneal inflammation.  Question: should I take the second dose?

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included type II diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, heart failure, acid reflux, and urinary retention. Concomitant medications included metformin, gabapentin, furosemide, spironolactone, omeprazole, and tamsulosin.   On 06 Jan 2021, hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the evening of 06 Jan 2021, hours after vaccination, the patient began feeling chills and discomfort. Overnight he began to experience night sweats and did not sleep at all.   During the night on 07 Jan 2021, the patient experienced night sweats and had delirium. When he tried to get out of bed, he collapsed. No treatment information was provided.   On 11 Jan 2021 and 12 Jan 2021, the patient began to feel better. He no longer had night sweats or delirium. He returned to his exercise routine at about 50 percent of what he normally did although he continued to feel weak.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided, although the patient reported he was not sure if he would take the second dose.  The outcome for the events, night sweats and delirium, was considered resolved. The outcome for the events, chills, discomfort, did not sleep at all, and collapsed, was considered resolving. The event, weak, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the events, chills, discomfort, night sweats, did not sleep at all, delirium, collapsed, and weak, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine due to feeling well before the vaccine and feeling more or less disabled after receiving it.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 80-year-old, male subject with medical history of type II diabetes and diabetic neuropathy, who experienced a serious unexpected event of delirium and non-serious unexpected event of asthenia, discomfort, insomnia, fall, and night sweats, and non-serious expected event of chills. The event of discomfort, insomnia, chills and night sweats occurred 1 day; the event of delirium, and fall occurred 2 days and asthenia occurred 6 days after mRNA-1273 administration.  The subject was on metformin for diabetes ty II and gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy, Lasix and spironolactone for heart failure, omeprazole for acid reflux and Flomax for urinary retention. Treatment details not provided. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Was given Tylenol and temp went up to 104.  She called the doctor at 2:00 PM, told her to see the doctor.  Lethargy and weakness.  Tested him for COVID and flu and still had fever.  Was negative for both, told to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen, went down to 102.  At 6:30 PM went up to 103.8, at that point she called the doctor, could not speak to him until 6:45 PM instructed to bath down with warm rag, and was told it was probably a reaction to the vaccine.  Was called in a steroid pack.  He went to bed running about 103.6 at 8:30 PM.  Was able to get up, was given more Tylenol/Ibuprofen and his fever finally broke around 101 about 4:00 AM.  Got up this morning and does feel better.  Running around 100-101 temp.  The vaccine is the only thing that has been different in his normal routine.  Still has warmth to the injection site, red.

                                                Client developed a mild covid infection 12/8/21 and recovered. He was admitted 12/25 with hypogycemia and mild weakness and sent home He was given his first dose of the Moderna vaccine 1/4/21 at approximately 9AM covid vaccine clinic He developed weakness the next day  (1/5) prompting admission to a hospital and then transition to subacute rehabilitation briefly  Work up at hospital revealed progressive respiratory failure and pneumonia requiring intubation and progressive ascending weakness and sensory loss without upper motor neuron changes.  MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

I advised that he remain seated or lying down, to give Tylenol per dosage on pkg/bottle.  To call 911 if symptoms worsen.  Wife stated that  did have COVID infection in Sept. 2020.  He walks with walker.  I called wife back at 1:50 pm.  States  took Tylenol, fever went down to 99, and he has been able to keep small amt of fluid down.  He has remained seated to avoid risk of falling.  Wife has him urinating in bucket.  Re-emphasized calling PCP to consult, or 911 if symptoms worsen.  To continue Tylenol per pkg instructions.  Wife voiced understanding.

The next day around 11am, started to feel very achy, weak nauseous and a headache. Then had severe shakes and felt very cold had to put on a jacket. Lasted about 4 hrs then gradually diminished but not 100% Unable to eat. .Today.(Thurs )feeling much better 90% normal.

                                                The day after the shot, my husband fell asleep on the couch for several hours. He was freezing and had a fever of 100.5 taken orally (under tongue). I gave him Tylenol and water He perked up that evening. People say the second dose is worse and I am concerned about him having a worse reaction. He was in the hospital with COVID 19  last August and September and was very ill.  He came home in a wheel chair and oxygen 24/7. He is walking with a cane now and only uses oxygen at night.  I am wondering what you think about him getting the second dose of Moderna. .?.?  Please let me know what your expert opinion is. Thank you very much.

On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted into the hospital with a diagnosis of low blood pressure,acute renal failure,acute pancreatitis,alanine aminotransferase increased,aspartate aminotransferase increased, troponin increased,lipase increased and blood bilirubin increased. Abnormal lab results included &#34;significantly elevated&#34; aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, lipase up to 1900, and &#34;slightly elevated&#34; troponin of 0.079.  On 13 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had improved, and he was discharged. Treatment for the event included two liters of intravenous fluid and supportive care.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.    The events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, were considered resolved on 13 Jan 2021.   The physician assessed the events, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, weakness, decreased appetite and fatigue, as not related to mRNA-1273. The physician&#39;s rationale was that the patient may have had a gallstone obstructing the pancreatic duct and once the stone passed, the patient got better with supportive care and slow administration of fluids.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 81-year-old male patient with medical history of dementia, heart disease, pulmonary embolism, and possible leukemia, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, low blood pressure, the non-serious listed event of fatigue, and the non-serious unlisted events of weakness, decreased appetite, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine transaminase, elevated bilirubin, elevated lipase, and elevated troponin.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on the current available information and in agreement with the physician reporter&#39;s assessment, the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273, noting the rapid improvement after administration of IV fluids.

The following day I started feeling like my equilibrium was out of balance. I can not even walk a straight line. The headache and soreness in my shoulder went away but I am still experiencing equilibrium issues.  This is making it hard for me to walk. It feels I have been on ship. I called in to my ARNP this morning; She and I are waiting on a return call from her.

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

On Saturday, 13 Feb 2021, she brought him a coffee and he couldn&#39;t hold it because his hands were shaking, so she gave him the coffee and then made him pee on the bed because he couldn&#39;t get up. At lunch time she made him eat something and he fell sleep again. His wife was hanging around him all day and around 7:30pm she realized that he was cold, and his neck was sweating, she couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat.

                                                Per neurology consult: &#34;Patient was at his baseline until when he received his 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.  He complained of dyspnea and fear of impending doom after waking up the following morning with some disorientation.  He was found to be in AFib with RVR after it was brought to ER  the following morning  and the rhythm was converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient continues to have confusion after admission yesterday that seem to get worse today to the point where he did not know his own name or birthdate, and seemed to have global amnesia.  Patient has been more drowsy this afternoon after receiving lorazepam 1 mg IV for potential seizure activity so no reliable neurologic exam was obtained.  Patient remains afebrile with pulse ox in the low 90s on 4 L of supplemental nasal oxygen in the hospital.  He had moderate decrease in kidney function upon admission that has improved.  He has baseline anemia with hemoglobin at around 10. Incidentally patient had shingles in the right thoracic dermatome week ago for which he received valacyclovir.

In the afternoon, around 3:30pm he was in the bedroom to change clothes and got severely weak and fell.  He felt like he was going to vomit too.  He was so weak that he could not get up off the floor by himself.  My son lifted him up.  He also noticed Friday night that there was a bubble where the vaccine was given in his arm.  02/27/2021, the bubble had burst and liquid was coming out.  It was an open wound which was sore and really red.  He also had a headache and continued weakness.  02/28/2021, he still had a headache and the arm was sore.  03/01/2021, felt pretty good.

He called 911 and 911 came to his home and checked him.  Once they arrived at his home, he started feeling better. His blood pressure was normal per patient. He thinks they didn&#39;t check his temp.  He told me once I asked him if he has any heart problem. He has 4 stents and he thinks he had similar problems  about 4 months ago.

Within 5 hours after the injection, I developed a fever of 1-2 degrees with chills and lethargy. In the next hour (6 hours after the injection), I believe my ulcers ruptured with extreme stomach pain and discomfort.  Pressure began building in my stomach and I felt worse and worse. By the evening, I was in pain, had pressure, was chilled, nauseous, and sick.  I felt unwell the next day, but did not begin passing blood and black stool until 2 days after the injection.  I saw my doctor that day. I went on a low fiber restricted diet. This continued for 10 days. I am still recovering.

Given extremely low platelet count on presentation, a diagnostic workup for TTP vs. ITP was commenced. It was determined by the inpatient hematology/oncology service that the patient was likely experiencing alterations in mental status and weakness and thrombocytopenia due to TTP.  Fresh frozen plasma was administered. Plasma exchange daily x 5 days and corticosteroids were initiated.

Earlier in the day he complained of not feeling well, but non-specific.  He was assessed and given an albuterol nebulizer treatment. In the coming hour, his wheezing resolved, work of breathing improved, heart rate and respirations decreased. He was ambulating around without signs of activity intolerance. It was felt that he was stable and back to baseline, so he was monitored by the nursing staff. A chest x-ray was ordered but not completed.  On 1/1/2021 at approximately 0925, a nursing assistant described loss of consciousness for 20-25 seconds. It appeared that he was not breathing, slumped over in the chair at the breakfast table eating cream of wheat, eyes rolled back in his head. He regained consciousness, breathing normally after coughing. He did not appear to be choking. His heart rate was recorded as irregular, rate 32 by the nursing staff. He was transported to the Emergency Department at Hospital for evaluation. No concerning findings.

                                                My dad got the Moderna Vaccine on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 in his left arm at the Mall injection site for the Health Department. He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

He also had low-grade fever and difficulties ambulating. In the ED he was febrile at 38.5C and HR 159bpm. EKG revealed Afib RVR. BP was stable. He was given Cardizem 10mg IV x1. Basic labs were unremarkable. COVID negative. CXR negative. He was given Tylenol for fever and admitted under observation. He remained afebrile and heart rate remained controlled with home Cardizem dosing. Cardiology was consulted who will refer him to their clinic to establish routine care with their service. PT/OT recommended home with home PT/OT. The patient overall felt much improved compared to admission and felt ready for discharge. He was discharged home in stable condition.

I had no appetite when I woke up at 6am, took my morning meds and went back to bed. Noon I felt a little better and it gradually went away and it seem to gradually go away. Because I have an auto-immune disease I seem to have had a reaction to the vaccine because it did not bother my wife, except for her being a little tired.

                                                I heard patient coughing about 10 minutes after his vaccination so I sent the staff member to check on him. I went to his room,I told the staff to call 911. He had started eating his lunch and felt that the food was stuck at the notch at the bottom of his neck. I prepared to give the EpiPen. He stopped coughing and said he was feeling better, but the staff member . said he didn&#39;t sound right. I decided not to give the EpiPen.

It seems to have gotten worse.  Yesterday, he slept most of the day and then slept for 11 1/2 hours.  Today he got up about 7 am and stayed up for about 1/2 an hour. Then went back to bed. He wolkeup about 12:30 pm and I gave him some lunch. He has gone back to sleep for the rest of the afternoon. I don&#39;t know what is going on.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 Vaccine: My dad has never had any sort of odor in his life and 3 days after getting the first vaccine shot, he has an incredibly foul odor (that he cannot smell) and it has not yet gone away. He showers frequently and I wash all his clothing and pajamas but this odor is strong and relentless. It&#39;s not a typical body odor smell though...it&#39;s like a &#34;medical odor,&#34; or something else very strange that is quite hard to describe.  I cannot seem to attribute this new odor to anything other than a negative side-effect to his first shot of the Moderna vaccine as nothing else has changed in his day-to-day life.  He also began experiencing cold symptoms about 4-5 hours after receiving his first dose of the vaccine. He was stuffed up, very congested, and extremely tired. He slept a LOT more than usual. I believe it is quite possible he actually just ended up with a cold because his immune system was so busy responding to the vaccine. (Is this possible/likely?)  Please let us know if others are experiencing this too, or if something can be done about it. Is his body not metabolizing an ingredient to this vaccine or something?

                                                Renal failure; Horrible Headaches; Body ache; A spontaneous report  was received from a consumer concerning an 83-year-old male patient, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and one week later, he had horrible headaches, body ache and hospitalized for kidney problem (Renal failure).  The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Products known to have been used by patient, with in two weeks prior to the event, included apixaban, sitagliptin, carvedilol, furosemide, glipizide.  Patient became COVID positive on 14-DEC-2020 while in the hospital and survived.  On 02-Feb-2021 prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09-Feb-2021, approximately one week later, patient had horrible headache and body ache. Patient is better now but he is in the hospital because he has kidney problems (Renal failure) started on 14-Feb-2021. Patient&#39;s wife mentioned in call that this has never happened in past and she already asked MD not to give him the second dose. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was discontinued.  The outcome of the events, he had horrible headaches, body ache, were considered resolved. The outcome of the event hospitalized for kidney problem (Renal failure) was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s elderly age and medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure may have been contributory for the event of renal failure.

                                                Daughter calling to ask about side effects of COVID vaccine? She said her 83 yr old dad got the COVID- 19 yesterday and overnight he became confused, had severe weakness, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, and became feverish.  She said mom said they both got first dose of COVID vaccine yesterday around noon- then last night he started to feel unwell. Around 2am- her mom said her dad- became very weak, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, confused, started coughing, he had chills, felt feverish. She said so concerning by 4am her mom called EMS who came and took him to the Medical Center.   She said he had pretty severe case of COVID in December that he need hospitalized for-she said  he as really weak, foggy headed at that time, kind of out of his mind- she said was told that is how he was acting last night.   After being seen in ED and getting put on some fluids and then antibiotics he now seems to be acting more like himself. They hydrated- have some concerns about possible pneumonia dx so they started him on antibiotics- was told this might be due to his rxn post &#43; COVID vaccine - which is what prompted her to call today.   He is supposed to follow up with his PCP doctor.  He seemed better when he got home this morning- she said just left him a little bit ago after eating early lunch with him. She is not sure if getting him hydrated &amp; sent home with antibiotics is what helped or just time since now about 24 hours post vaccination dose.  Confirmed he has had no prior rxn to any other vaccines in the past.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off. On Sunday, 28 Feb 2021, in the evening, the patient got cold, and within minutes his entire whole body was in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe were in pain. It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.  Results for chest MRI, neck MRI and viral tests were not provided.  The hospital also performed a blood culture for bacteria. Results were not provided.  The patient was unable to move much, his blood pressure and oxygen were a little unstable.

                                                Acute on chronic hypoxia; diarrhea; headache; nausea; This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) in an 83-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Ventricular tachycardia, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, Hypertensive and COVID-19 virus test positive (Hospitalized with mild hypoxemia at that time) in January 2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Latex allergy, Allergy (pregabalin), Weakness generalised, Dementia, Atrial fibrillation, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Mixed hyperlipidemia, Depressive disorder, Polyneuropathy in diabetes, Peripheral vascular disease NOS and Cognitive impairment. Concomitant products included ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN (E.C.)), AMOXICILLIN, FLUOXETINE, FUROSEMIDE (FUROSEMIDE ACCORD [FUROSEMIDE]), GABAPENTIN (GABAPENTIN &#34;PCD&#34;), MEMANTINE HYDROCHLORIDE (MEMANTINE ABDI), METFORMIN, METOPROLOL TARTRATE, PANTOPRAZOLE, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, ROSUVASTATIN and ZINC OXIDE for an unknown indication.    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 18-Mar-2021 to 21-Mar-2021 due to DIARRHOEA, HEADACHE, HYPOXIA and NAUSEA. On 21-Mar-2021, HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 18-Mar-2021, Angiogram: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 18-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 18-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram head: negative (Inconclusive) negative. On 18-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: non ischemic (v-paced) (Inconclusive) non ischemic (v-paced). On 18-Mar-2021, N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide: 3620 pg/ml (Inconclusive) 3620 pg/ml. On 19-Mar-2021, Angiogram: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 19-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: chest clear with no pneumonia or pe (Inconclusive) chest clear with no pneumonia or PE. On 19-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram head: negative (Inconclusive) negative. On 19-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: non ischemic (v-paced) (Inconclusive) non ischemic (v-paced).     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered HYPOXIA (Acute on chronic hypoxia) to be related.    After the patient received the 2nd vaccine dose on 03/17, he became weak and unable to walk. He also experienced headache, nausea, and diarrhea. On 03/18, he was sent to the  emergency department where we received a diagnosis of acute on chronic hypoxia related to the 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. He required up to 2 L of O2 during the night time. He was given his regular home medications and Lovenox 40 mg SQ QD for DVT prophylaxis.  On 03/21 he was discharged as his SpO2 improved. His hypoxia returned to his baseline level upon discharge.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My uncle started feeling unwell the evening he got his 2nd Covid 19 vaccine. By the next evening, he started vomiting violently, trembling and sweating. He lived in country and his caregiver didn&#39;t think to take him to the hospital. The symptoms calmed down after a while, but he was not able to hold any food or liquids down. Eventually, he fell asleep and his caregiver left for the night. He returned on Easter Sunday at 9:30 am and found my uncle deceased.

                                                Admission Note: ? Weakness - Generalized     Patient reports feeling weak prior to dialysis, but demanded clinic to perform dialysis. Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.

In addition, my chest was wheezing and felt as if &#34;bubbles&#34; were in my chest. My arm felt very hot and tender at the injection site. This attack lasted for half an hour. I went back to sleep and awoke the following morning feeling very weak and confused. Feeling extremely fatigued, all I wanted to do was sleep. I also lost my appetite. The next day, I had occasional coughing which subsided with my over the counter cough medicine.

About 8pm, 5 hours after first getting dizzy, the chills were gone and I was able to get up and get in bed.   About 10 pm I took 2 asprins and went to sleep.I had to get up

Upon stepping out of bed I collapsed to the tile floor, cutting my arm and head. My legs and arms would not function.  I squirmed on the floor for about fifteen minutes but was unable to stand up. Finally, I did and was able to slowly make my way to the bathroom.

                                                Mini seizure; Diarrhea; Slight temperature; Vomiting; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning an 84-year-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced events of slight temperature/fever, vomiting, diarrhea and short seizure early in the morning.  The patient&#39;s medical history include type 1 diabetic, history of mini seizures and had a pacemaker installed a week ago-did have check up after and was good. Concomitant medications reported were levetiracetam  - anti seizure, Insulin 2 times per day taking for type 1 diabetes.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 029120A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  He was fine after taking vaccine, but on 28 Jan 2021 started developing symptoms.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient experienced the events of slight temperature, vomiting and diarrhea. On the same day, patient experienced the event of mini seizers for about 5 min in early morning and took levetiracetam. No other treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s history of seizure was a strong confounder of the event of short seizure early in the morning.

                                                Became febrile, poorly responsive. Taken to the MGH ED. En route while in ambulance, he experienced a convulsion with rhythmic shaking in all limbs lasting several seconds.  He had a second episode requiring midazolam and levetiracetam. On arrival to MGH ED, the patient was afebrile, heart rate 133, blood pressure 173/93, oxygen saturation 99% on a nonrebreather.  He was found to be severely encephalopathic, mute, and not answering questions or following commands.  He was admitted to the neuroICU and intubated for airway protection given his poor mental status. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of meningoencephalitis, but these were discontinued after his CSF was not concerning for a bacterial infection herpes simplex encephalitis.  Antibiotics were discontinued. He was extubated on hospital day 2.  After extubation he had persistent mixed receptive-expressive aphasia that was slowly improving over time. At discharge from the hospital, he was able to occasionally say a simple sentence, could repeat simple phrases, and could follow simple commands. He was discharged to Rehab

                                                Patient has long standing COPD and asthma. He has been stable on his home medications for years. No hospitalizations for these issues in the past. During Covid times he has been very restricted to his home with no visitors. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, he started having increased difficulty with breathing. Over the next few weeks he continued to get worse and required home oxygen and an adjustment with his medications. He was started on steroids and antibiotics about 3 weeks after the vaccine and then hospitalized on 3/16/2021 with COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. He tested negative for Covid at that time. He was in the hospital for 9 days and discharged home on steroid taper and home oxygen. A few days after being at home, he had gradual onset of subacute dementia/delirium. All workup has been negative. MRI/MRA normal. He is currently continuing on oxygen and again on steroids and mental status may be starting to improve.     The concern here is that patient was stable and had been stable on his medication regimen for years. He was doing well until approx 5 days after his second Covid vaccine when he started having worsening pulmonary complaints and eventually ended up in the hospital. He continues to be on oxygen at home and was recently started back on steroids. There has been no explanation for his subacute onset of Dementia/Delirium. MRI/MRA normal. This has been discussed with both Pulmonology and Neurology specialists.

                                                Awakened with very severe chills that seemed to come in waves and lasted for about 10 minutes. Felt too weak to even get out of bed. Temp was slightly elevated to 99.6F when checked later that morning. Had ?unusual? aches and pains throughout his body all yesterday and then one brief episode of chills this morning, 1/17.

                                                Upon awakening at 07:00 began an uncomfortable feeding in chest. Over the next few hours, the feeling became painful. The pain was radiating from the center of my middle chest  outward. It became more painful to breath deeply. At about Noon I began feeling worse all over my body. Joint aches, sensitive skin and just feeling  not well. It is now 1:48 and I feel no better, but no worse. A nurse from the facility, is going to give me and my wife a Covid-19 test momentarily.

                                                Initially, the night of January 18, the left arm was somewhat sore as expected. The next day, within about 24 hours after the injection, I felt slightly queasy, somewhat weak, what we called on the farm, being &#34;off our feed.&#34; The left arm was increasingly painful, although I slept reasonably well that night. On the second day after the injection (Wednesday, January 20), the left arm was even more painful, I was actually nauseous, weak,  and in the afternoon had a temperature of 99.8 (my normal temperature is 97.4). I had some abdominal pain for a few weeks before the injection and that pain had increased. But by bed time (about 10:30 p.m. CST) the temperature had returned near normal and I was feeling much better. Today, Thursday, January 21, I felt normal, no general weakness and minimal abdominal pain, and there was only very slight soreness in the left arm. My wife (81 years old with a history of nut allergies and asthma) received an injection at the same time I did and had minimal side effects from the Moderna vaccine with the same Lot Number. I note the EUA Fact Sheet says the Modern vaccine is still being studied so I hope is a small contribution.

                                                Patient presents today with his wife and son. He was recently hospitalized having developed a fever the day after his Covid vaccine 1 with associated confusion and some ataxia. He was admitted to the hospital overnight where an MRI scan suggested no acute change showing only moderate cerebral atrophy and some small vessel occlusive changes. He tested positive for Covid by PCR in the emergency department on 1/22. His oxygen saturation was stable. He did have a fever and describes falling off the toilet because of some generalized leg weakness and uncoordination. He has had some chronic left greater than right upper extremity sensory loss following prior cervical spine stenosis requiring urgent surgery in 3/2019. He has had some chronic left foot drop as well. He reports being somewhat deconditioned having spent some time in bed to the above episode but is now ambulating with a cane at home and has occupational and physical therapy in place. He has been mildly dyspneic on exertion above baseline but attributes this to some deconditioning. He did have an episode of lower dental pain with ambulation in the office that was more than usual though denies associated chest pain or pressure and has had no jaw or shoulder pain with exertion. Review of systems is negative for headache.

                                                I am a four-year resident of facility and have never experienced a serious illness or traumatic injury in all of my adult life (I turn 86 this year). So on January 23rd I received my initial shot of the Moderna vaccine, for which I experienced no reaction, whatsoever. One month later I returned to hospital for my Moderna Booster shot on Saturday, February 20. I felt a few chills that evening, with nothing to speak about, but awoke on Sunday morning feeling so ill that I could barely sit up in bed. I borrowed my wife?s walker and managed to make it to and from the bathroom, and got back to bed again, whereupon I called my son, an emergency-room physician, who told me to take two Advil tablets (or its equivalent), and welcomed me to the club. I stayed in bed through the rest of Sunday and continued to sleep and rest throughout Monday morning, only feeling well enough to get out of bed without assistance by noon on Monday, thereby missing the February meeting of the monthly meeting that had been scheduled for that morning (and for which I had regularly been a member of and had attended every meeting for over three years). My personal takeaway from all this was that ?the cure was worse than the disease.?

On Wednesday, I had what I thought was a bug bite on my forehead but my wife said it looked like a broken blister.  Thursday morning I had more blisters on the right side of my head (Forehead to the back of the my hairline).  and went to a doctor.  We all thought it ws a burn from a barbecue blow back on Sunday but the ophthalmologist a week later diagnosed it as Shingles.  A week later the wound care specialist also said it was shingles..  I am starting the 6th week of Shingles.

The next morning I began a bike ride and within a few blocks was having sore arms and extreme fatigue.  I went home, took my BP and it was 101/59.  On 3/07 I used a stationary bike at the gym, came home very fatigued and BP was 92/63.  On 3/08 it was 111/61 after I spent 2 hrs or so flying airplanes, my other hobby.  Today I tried a bike ride again, quickly got shoulder, arm and back pain and extreme fatigue--came home and BP was 90/59.  I ate lunch, drank a Coke for caffeine, tried to ride again and it was 104/61 after a short ride.

The blood pressure has gradually returned to normal over 3 days.  Tachycardia has also been present (110 bpm), but has returned to normal of 70 - 75 bpm.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately 10 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot 012L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient woke up at 10:00 pm with severe left hip pain. His left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), and he took 2 ibuprofens then went to bed.   On 10 Jan 2021, he was still in pain with a low grade fever of 98.8 which is 1 to 2 degrees higher than normal for him. He reported using his wife&#39;s walker to ambulate and took 4 ibuprofens which helped his hip.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient was still in pain, had a limp, and ran a low fever until the afternoon. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the event, low grade fever, was considered resolved on 11 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, left hip became paralyzed (pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t move it), low grade fever and limp, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events of low grade fever, gait disturbance and severe left hip pain are temporally associated with the administration of mRNA-1273 and a causal association cannot be excluded. Fever and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the product.  The event of paralysis is considered unlikely pending additional information.

His blood pressure was low then high (I don&#39;t now have the readings) By 5 pm I called the ambulance.  He was in the hospital until I transferred him to hospice 6 days later.  He died in hospice 4 days after that.

On 2/24/21, he was sent to the ER at a facility from a nursing home where he was admitted for skilled nursing care. He was sent to the ER due to fever, decreased mental status, renal failure, possible UTI and possible pneumonia. He was admitted and received IV fluids, Zosyn and Solu Medrol. On 2/26/21, a consult was placed for hospice care and he was accepted for hospice care at a contract nursing home.

EMS arrived within 5 minutes, resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, CPR terminated at 1503 and the patient pronounced dead.  The Medical examiner refused the case on the basis of lack of jurisdiction, and the remains were moved to a local funeral home.  No autopsy was performed.  This event is not thought to be related to the vaccination event or the vaccine, the death is thought to be from natural causes.

This has continued, along with general tiredness,  and I have seen my primary care doctor who referred me to a cardiologist. Both reported low heart rate. I am seeing a Electrophysiologist tomorrow and expect to have pacemaker surgery.      I have heard anecdotally now of a relative who developed low heart rate after 2nd Moderna shot . I wonder if there is a relationship between low heart rate and the vaccine.?

For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The reporter stated, the patient had been taking Imbruvica for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia for almost one month, but he complained that the drug had not helped to reduce the swelling, which might be caused by swollen lymph nodes. The swelling started before he started to take Imbruvica. The patient also said that the Imbruvica had not helped with his fatigue. He emphasized that he had no side effects from Imbruvica. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient was hospitalized for fluid overload, and 4.9 liters of fluid was removed from his body. He was discharged on 05-Apr-2021 to go home with a prescription of furosemide, to be taken orally daily, for the treatment of fluid overload. When he was admitted to the hospital, he weighed 194 pounds. When he was discharged from the hospital, he weighed 182 pounds.

At 0800am he awoke again with the chest pain and took 2 nitro which again helped the pain.  At that time he did experience shortness of breath and diaphoresis.  He was found to have decreased O2 sats when the EMTs got to him and he was placed on a non-rebreather.  On x-ray the patient was found to have a right pneumothorax, cardiac markers were negative.  A chest tube was placed and the patient was transferred to a hospital.

His wife got up and he had urinated on himself, and his wife felt his forehead and he did not feel hot.  Went back to bed, he went to sleep and the next morning 2/13/21, wife got up and when he got up around 7:30 he was dressed, but not buttoned right and had his hat on and was confused.  He sat in front of the fireplace not moving, and starting talking nonsense until 9:00 - 9:30 when he started talking to her.  He could not differentiate between morning and night, and then slowly progressed back to normal.  Did not eat much, and said that he could eat anymore.  He was pacing back and forth and then finally cleared mentally and was ok around 10:00 AM.   He is now back to his normal self today 2/16/21.   She gave him 250 mg of Tylenol around 9:30 AM on 2/13/21 as his temp was 100.1.  HIs blood pressure at that time was 103/59 and pulse 100.   She then checked it in the other arm and it was 104/60, pulse 99.  She then checked it again on Monday and it was 108/61 with 68 pulse rate which is normal for him.

Didn&#39;t eat all day.  This morning,  March 7, he said he felt better and slept well.  I fixed him a bowl of oatmeal.  He took one bite and said he couldn&#39;t eat anymore.  All of a sudden he appeared to fall into a state of unconsciousness and could not respond to anything I said.  I tried to shake him with no results so I decided to call 911 and when they got here he came around a little and said he didn&#39;t want  to go to the hospital.  Still not eating and just wants to sleep.  He is 88 years old.  I am the same age and had no adverse event (yet).

He has begun to have mild memory changes after suspected COVID illness (covid testing negative) in November, but daughter of patient, with whom he lives, states that his memory and orientation now significantly changed- he seems to have forgotten the last &#34;3 years&#34; of memory.  Presented to ER 1/16/21 as she checked his O2 and found him to be hypoxic in 60s. He is being treated for possible CAP with underlying perviously undiagnosed ILD vs post-covid lung changes (per pulmonology), and his energy and ability to walk have returned but memory is significantly impaired, confabulating and oriented only to self despite good oxygenation on 5L O2 by NC.

Comes to the emergency department today after getting his 1st Monday and a COVID-19 vaccine at 7:30 p.m. and about 5 minutes after while sitting down developing significant diaphoresis, nausea, dizziness and feeling very warm.  The symptoms lasted for about 15 minutes and then resolved.  Since then the patient has felt a little off in his stomach but has not had any difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, chest pain, diarrhea, rash or itchiness.  With this episode the patient did not have any changes to his vision or feel like he was going to pass out.  Patient will be given 25 of Benadryl, 125 of Solu-Medrol, 20 of famotidine of concern for possible allergic reaction.  Additionally the patient will be given a small bolus of normal saline.  Given the patient&#39;s reassuring vitals and reassuring physical exam he will simply be monitored here were sure.  I do not feel any lab workup is necessary this point this is resolved episode seems either like a mild allergic reaction or a vasovagal episode.

Within a few hours, my left hand began to tingle and my right leg felt stiff. I experienced a loss of balance that made walking difficult.  For the next 24 hours I became very fatigued. But two days after the vaccination, I have begun to regain my strength.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included metformin, glimepiride, atorvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid, norvastatin, irbesartan, triamterene, finasteride, mirabegron.   On 13 Jan 2021, approximately three days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced weakness, sweating, and shortness of breath.    On an unknown date, the patient tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the hospital for supervision.  Chest x-ray results were negative. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the event, tested positive for COVID-19, was considered not resolved. The outcome of the events, weakness, sweating, and shortness of breath, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 89 year-old, male patient with history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, who experienced events of tested positive for COVID-19, weakness, sweating, and shortness of breath.  The events occurred 3 days after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  However, the patient was positive for COVID and may provide an explanation for the events.  Further information have been requested.

                                                I received a Moderna vaccine injection on January 19, 2021 at approximately 3:15 p.m.  Later that evening at about 7:40 p.m, I was suddenly hit with pain in my back like someone had hit me with a board.  The pain continued to surround the midsection in a swath of about 15 inches.  I felt like my muscles were failing me.  I made it to my bed where I started shivering and shaking uncontrollably feeling like I was having a seizure.  The shaking was sporadic, lasting about an hour. I was covered with a blanket and continued with liquids for dehydration and was given an Xanax to calm nerves. Later that night while attempting to sleep, I was perspiring and my heart was beating 90 to 100 beats hindering sleep.  Through the night I attempted to go to the bathroom but with absolutely no control over my arms and legs I was unable to stand.  Rolling off the bed and unable to pull myself back, I lay on the floor and pulled a cover over me.   At about 4:30 a.m. (Wednesday morning.) I was covered with another blanket and a pillow was put under my head.  I slept until awakened at about 11 a.m  My heart rate and oxygen level was chedked and appeared to be within normal range.  I was greatly fatigued, and light-headed. Continuing a regimen of liquids, I was fed a small amount of soup and some fruit. I ate nothing the rest of the day. I slept most of the day.  In the evening, I was fatigued and nauseated and spent 2-3 hours through the night on my knees in the bathroom attempting to vomit.   Thursday morning I was awakened around 11.a.m. and was barely able to lift my head.  I slept more until needing to use the bathroom and receiving more liquids. Two hours later I was able to eat only a half a piece of toast ? the first and only thing I was able to eat that day.  Early evening having no control of  my legs, I attempted to walk. It was difficult getting legs out of the covers, but I got up and walked a few feet with the help of a walker. However, an hour later (about 8:30) I went to the bathroom and was unable to pull myself up from the toilet and fell to the floor and crawl flat on my stomach to my bed.  I had no strength in my legs and arms and needed assistance from two people to put me on my bed. Periodic rapid heartbeat and fatigue caused restless sleep. Some strength began to return on Friday and with caution over the weekend, and support from a loving family, I appear to be making a slow recovery.  Checking with several family medical people working in hospitals, my experience with the serum seemed more extreme than most.  Therefore, it was felt that I should report some information on how the Moderna injection affected me that it may be of help to others. (Some of the above information was related to me as I was not always cognizant of conditions at particular times.) I am still puzzled, as members of my family are, as to what happened to me.  We would be grateful for any information that might be helpful for us to understand my situation as it relates to others that may have had similar experiences with the Moderna serum.
