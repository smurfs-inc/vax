                                                I received the vaccine 30 min. prior to starting my shift as a Nurse in the ED. About 1 hour after receiving the shot while standing I felt off balance and began to have a vertigo like dizziness. I sat down and tried to drink some water but began spitting the water back up and dry heaving after trying to drink. I did not feel nauseous if I was not drinking. I did feel the sensation of a slight lump in my throat. I did not have any shortness of breath, tachycardia,  rash or fever. I did not want to check in as a patient so I called my wife to come and pick me up from work. Before I left I had the pharmacy send me some Pepcid and Benadryl and I took 25mg of Benadryl and 20mg of Pepcid before leaving. I left work around 1400 and now at 1500 I am able to drink fluids. The slight lump in my throat seems to have improved. I still feel a little dizzy and off balance.

Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                After about 15 minutes, I began to feel lightheaded and experience a tingling in my arms/hands. I&#39;d guess it was related to the nerves in the arms, because it specifically affected my pinky and ring fingers on both hands. I was also unsteady on my feet, but did not lose consciousness. The lightheadedness and tingling continued off and on for most of the day. The tingling appeared to go away the next day, but I still experienced periodic (though rare) feelings of lightheadedness. Perhaps 2-3 time the next day (Saturday) and experienced maybe 1-2 times the following day (Sunday). I did not take Adderall on the weekend. On Monday, I did take Adderall and returned to work, where I experience some tingling again and longer bouts of lightheadedness. Again, I have not lost consciousness.

Caregivers heard a loud noise and found patient on the ground in the hallway right outside the observation room.    Patient states &#34;I got dizzy and started getting tunnel vision&#34; also states that this happens at times with needles/ blood draws since he was a kid.    Patient set up on his own, denies head/neck pain.  Denies any injury.  Stood on his own and guided into observation for more time- set in chair.   0832 checked with patient , still denies injury, denies anymore dizziness.  Encouraged him to go to the ED to get checked out.  Patient denies head/neck pain or any S/S at this time.  Declines ED.   0847- Patient denies dizziness, s/s and declines going to ED.  Walked out, gait steady.

We treated it like a stomach ache and he went through the rest of the day, even at work, in gut wrenching pain. This morning when I woke up, I noticed he was out on the couch. When I went to check on him, he was as white as a ghost and his lips were greying around the edges. I immediately told him to call into work. I thought he would say no because he has not called in in over 10 years, but to my surprise, he did so. I put him in bed and the abdominal pain is still present and now his fever is over 103!!!  I bought Tylenol and Motrin and will be alternating between the two until the fever breaks and if the pain persists by 8 pm, we will be headed to the emergency room...

On 1/12/21 I experienced SOB/labored breathing for approximately 24 hours. O2 sat did not go below 95%. HR was between 80 and 105 for approximately four hours (75 is a typical resting heart rate). No history of asthma, but I felt how people with asthma describe difficulty breathing. Given the length of time between the dose and the SOB, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to the vaccine. But I am submitting this just in case you end up with other, similar reports. Thank you.

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

Then one week later on 1/26/2021 I started having vaccine shoulder itchiness I didn&#39;t think anything of it and then my arm swelled and got hot. The next day on 1/27/2021 it had a red area around it and was hot. I have never had a fever or anything else except minor pain the day after the vaccine.  I continued ibuprofen and benadryl at night it took the itch away and was bearable. I want to know if I should get the second shot?

                                                I work at a Hospital sterilizing surgical equipment.  After I received the vaccine, the hospital staff observed me for 15 minutes to see if a reaction occurred.  I felt fine, and they told me I could go.  I was working that day (2-10:30pm) and had gotten vaccinated at the beginning of my shift.  The rest of my shift went fine.  Near the end, though, my arm began to feel sore.  Driving home, I began to feel tired.  By the time I got home, it felt like a cold was setting in.  I ate a large bowl of chicken soup to try to feel better.  I stayed up a little bit, but was feeling woozy by this point and went to bed.  Bad chills set in and I began to shake I felt so cold.  I used a heating pad to help with this.  I tried to sleep, but my head was throbbing.  The next morning, I tried to sit up in bed but my first attempt proved too difficult.  I took it slower.  I was able to sit up eventually.  Standing was also difficult.  I spent the day mostly lounging on the couch.  I slept a little better that night, but my head was still throbbing somewhat.  No chills this time.  Getting up the next morning went a little better.  I was able to sit up in bed without issue and walking around did not prove as much of a chore.

After observation for 4 hours I was feeling better, and was discharged home.   Ordered to take 40mg of steroids for 2 more days.  After one day post vaccination, I have significant pain at the site and body ache.

Then that night, I woke up at 3:30 am 1/16 with severe chills, full-body aches, and high fever (although I was unable to walk to get the thermometer). During the day 1/16, as I write this, I continue to feel similar symptoms to when I was Covid positive in March 2020. Tylenol and Motrin help the symptoms to subside.

Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

This persists/worsens accompanied by chills. Temp taken at 10p (99.1, my normal is 97.6) By 0150, temp up to 100.4 along with continuing alternating sweats/chills and persisting headache. 1000mg Tylenol used at 0150.  At 0240, symptoms settle a bit and got a little sleep. 0445, woke up- headache persists. Mild chills/sweats. Afebrile at 98.6. Still fatigued. At 0800 on 1/5/21, another 1000mg Tylenol used as aforementioned symptoms worsening.  Now at 1035 (time of this report), chills/sweats have settled - left with fatigue, headache, and nasal congestion.    Of note, I tested positive for COVID and was sick for about 2-3 weeks in Sep 2020.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

I also experienced a fever for 2 days after the injection along with dizziness, weakness, fatigue, headache, body aches, vision changes, and ringing in both ears. As of today 1/12/21 I am still experiencing symptoms even while using Benadryl allergy tablets by mouth and anti-itch cream applied to the injection site.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

                                                I have existing peptic ulcer and acid reflux I have been dealing with for years. I also have elevated cholesterol level for which I am being treated. Within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, the pain from my peptic ulcer went from 2 to 10 on a scale of 10. It became so severe that I could not sit at work. I had to leave work and went back home. Then on January 13, 2021, I started noticing a back pain that radiates throughout my left back side. On January 15, 2021, I went to the ER because the pain was so severe that I could not not lie down, sit, or breath. I was diagnosed with pleurisy (inflammation of the lung linings). The X-ray also showed enlarged heart but the ER doctor said my heart is fine. They also performed EKG on me. I did not mention receiving the vaccine to the ER doctor because I never thought the vaccine could result in such side effects. I did not mention it to my PCP also because I believe the vaccine is safe. But recently I went through the sequence of events myself and the only thing that happened regarding my health was the vaccine. Nothing else. After vaccination, I went to ER on Jan 15, 2021 at around 11:30PM due to severe back pain and was diagnosed with pleurisy through X-ray. My X-ray also showed an enlarged heart but I suspect that was due to the fact that I could not breath properly when the x-ray was taken. I will repeat the X-ray in a couple of weeks. Never experienced pleurisy or heart enlargement in my life prior to the vaccine. Not sure the vaccine was responsible but the coincidence is suspicious.

Symptoms after 2nd shot01/19/2021 - slight fatigue recovered after 24 hours.  4 days after 2nd shot - Developed cold sore on lower lip area. To my recollection, I have never had a cold sore before which is a bit concerning. I understand that I may contracted HSV-1 and not have know it as child. I am curious if somehow the COVID vaccine somehow compromised immune system to a degree that the HSV-1 is now active? May very well not classify as an &#34;adverse event,&#34; but since I haven&#39;t heard of any such issues I thought I should report.

Around 1am I woke  up with SOB which continued thru the night, with off and on sleep. I woke back up at 5:45am, went to work with the SOB which lasted until 12N and resolved on its own.  Around 3-330pm I began to feel feverish and had chills and was told I was disoriented.  My temp was 100.5, HR 122 R 34 BP 170/100 O2-93%. I notified the DON of my feelings who advised me those were possible side effects of the vaccine and made me continue to work until I just couldnt take the feelings anymore and went to the ER.  I was there for about 2 hrs and my body began to calm down.  I took taken 100mg of Tylenol on my own just to help with the fever which did break shortly and I have been fine every since. I was positive for COVID 12/14.

The fever ultimately rose to 103.3 and stayed around there for several hours. I took Tylenol for the symptoms. I woke up in the night with chills and night sweats. Into the second day of symptoms, only a slight headache and tiredness remain. Continuing with Tylenol for treatment.

My Leg (calf) and penis (glans) very itchy and obviously broken out. I can&#39;t be only assume it&#39;s vaccine related.

                                                Day after the vaccine I awoke with a very sore left arm which was to be expected.  Upon moving I experienced vertigo, dizziness, headache, and extreme pressure in the left side of my face to include sinus cavities and deep inner ear pressure.  I had some episodes of loose stools, not diarrhea, but not formed stools.  These symptoms still persist to today, 1/15/2021, except for loose stool, that has returned to normal.  I had a Dr. appointment today and the doctor would not rule out post vaccine side effects. I was tested for COVID on 1/11/2021 as a precautionary measure as I was displaying symptoms, but the test result was COVID not detected.

As time went on the are immediately at injection site got red and inflamed. By Thursday the redness transversed the width of my arm. Friday a large red ring began to go around injection site and the center began to be less red and then appeared blanched.  The Ring was maybe 4&#34; x 8&#34; which got more inflamed through Saturday. By Sunday the ring was still there, but less inflamed.  I did not take any medication except Tylenol starting on Thursday at 10:00 AM as I developed 102.8 fever until Friday morning.  I did experience Headache and chills, but I considered that minor compared to my arm and the local reaction that occurred. I did not go  to Doctor, but rather waited to inform medical staff at my employer, as I am a healthcare worker.

The big change from dose 1 to 2 is muscle twitching.  The twitches coincide with the more extreme joint aches.  Sore arm  All started about 9 hours after vaccine. Sore arm was mitigated with movement and stretching (as compared to the first dose). Other symptoms have lessened since 7am (19 hours after shot), but linger.  Ibuprofen seems to lessen, but not end eymptoms.

                                                My brother has epilepsy. His seizures can be triggered by low grade fever and exhaustion. He had covid in early October. His seizures are generally well controlled but he had several after the vaccine. I understand that the vaccine did not cause the seizures. The fever caused the seizure. I just think it?s important to neurologists to have this info to see how we can go about mitigating the seizures and if the 2nd dose is necessary. Keeping him hydrated may have helped and also giving him something immediately for the low grade fever. Just knowing these things may help others.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

He didn&#39;t sleep well, and this morning his sleep app indicated his heart rate during the night was between 100-110.  After noticing his heart rate was between 130-140, he called the clinic and was told to go to the ER.  Hospital ER administered several tests and did blood work. The MD&#39;s determined his heart was fine and it is likely vaccine related.  He is home again and is feeling better (no chills, etc.) and his resting heart rate is now in the low-90&#39;s.

                                                Within 48 hours of receiving the COVID vaccine, I began having extreme pressure and discomfort in my right ear.  Symptoms included dizziness, fullness in the ear and hearing loss.  This persisted for several days.  As a first course of action, I took Tylenol and antihistamines.   I saw my PCP a few days later and he misdiagnosed my condition and suggested that I continue with antihistamines and Flonase.  Two weeks later my condition had improved only slightly and I became more concerned.  I asked my PCP whether a short course of steroids was warranted (at the suggestion of my mom and wife, who are both health care professionals).  He prescribed a &#34;dose pack,&#34; which I started on or about Monday, Feb. 22.  Later that week, I connected with an ENT  who is a friend of a friend .  When I told him my story and symptoms he was extremely concerned and got me an immediate appointment on Friday, Feb. 26.  At that visit I was diagnosed with acute and severe Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) that had resulted in 92% hearing loss in my right ear.   Additional symptoms continue to include fullness, tinnitus and other discomfort.  None of these issues existed prior to my COVID vaccine shot.  I am currently undergoing a treatment of high dose prednisone and steroid injections in my ear.   I am scheduled for another visit with doctor on Friday, March 12.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

Hypotension, shakiness and mild nausea.  I&#39;ve never had this symptom in my life and have taken 3mg melatonin before bed for years.  (3mg, not 4mg as reported on the previous page).  I was back to normal after ~10 minutes and woke up perfectly normal. Also, minor shoulder pain.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medication included escitalopram.  On 04 Feb 2021, on the same day as the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 030L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 04 Feb 2021, a couple of hours after the vaccination, the patient couldn&#39;t feel his arm and he had no range in motion.  He also had pain in his upper shoulder area by his neck.  The reporter thought the administration was done incorrectly but she &#34;wasn&#39;t there to conform 100%.&#34;  At night on 04 Feb 2021 and 05 Feb 2021, the patient had aching in his legs &#34;as if he was getting sick.&#34;  Treatment for the events included ibuprofen which helped, and the patient was feeling better at the time of this report.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, couldn&#39;t feel arm and had no range in motion, pain in upper shoulder area by the neck, and aching in legs as if was getting sick, were considered recovering/resolving at the time of this report.  The event, thinks administration was done incorrectly, was considered recovered/resolved on 04 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44-year-old male who experienced NS unexpected events of hypoaesthesia, joint range of motion decreased, arthralgia, neck pain, product administration error, malaise, and NS expected arthralgia.  The events occurred 1 day after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-012275: US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-012263:

After one day of pain and discomfort I woke the following morning (~44hrs after receiving the vaccine) to extreme acute abdominal pain in the lower right abdomen.  Went to Urgent Care facility and was diagnosed by CT scan as having acute appendicitis.  An emergency appendectomy was scheduled and performed for later that evening.  I stayed at the Hospital overnight on 12/24/2020 post operatively on IV antibiotics to recover from the appendectomy.  Was discharged from the hospital on 12/25/2020 and have been recovering for about 10 days now with limitted activity.

Later in the day, while at work, I became extremely fatigued and my chills were getting worse.  I left work early, came home and checked my temperature.  It has been between 102.5 and 103.7 the entire time I have been home.  Even after taking Tylenol.  My arm is also a little tender at the injection site.    I had COVID prior to this but they say I recovered.    My symptoms started on November 13 and was hospitalized for 3 days starting around day 9 of symptoms.  My current symptoms are pretty much identical to the symptoms I had when I first contracted COVID.

The staff member monitoring saw me going to the floor and called the head doctor over to help.  They called EMT&#39;s.  I was laid onto the floor on my back and legs up onto a chair.  The staff took my blood pressure which was low.  Approximately, 2 minutes later, they took my blood pressure and it went back up to a more normal level.  The EMT&#39;s helped me up and took my blood sugar levels and pulse oxygen levels which seemed normal.  I was able to feel better, but the color of my skin was yellowish and pale.  The EMT&#39;s suggested that I talk with my doctor before getting another vaccine and talk about my symptoms.

The patient&#39;s medical history included type 1 diabetes. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30 Dec 2020, the evening after vaccine administration, the patient experienced chills and tiredness.  On 31 Dec 2020 the patient woke up with his face numb and a little paralyzed. At the time of reporting, the patient mentioned that the numbness and paralysis on his face had been like that for various days and was still ongoing. Treatment for the event was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, chills and tiredness, was unknown. The outcome of the events, part of face numb and part of face a little paralyzed, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 45 year old male patient with medical history of type I diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Facial paralysis, a NS unexpected event of Hypoaesthesia, and NS expected events of Chills and Fatigue. The events of Chills and Fatigue occurred on the same day when the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273. The events of Facial paralysis and Hypoaesthesia occurred the next day of administration of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

The initial symptoms were only very painful muscle pain on the injected arm, and some mild body ache and mild chills for 2-3 days but nothing major. On Monday 2/15/21 was feeling very well and had nice workout in the morning , feeling energetic .  However, in the morning on Tuesday 2/16/21, I started having very strong abdominal cramps, feeling bloated, nausea, that was lasting for several hours and increasing in pain . After 5 hours of pain, I asked my wife to take me to Hospital. There I was diagnosed with Appendicitis after a Cat Scan. My appendix was inflamed and I had to go thru surgery that same day .

I was a bit restless that night and just did not feel well. These symptoms lasted until about 8am the following morning, 12/24/2020. I was still fatigued and still had a headache, which had lessened in intensity. I no longer had chills. The fatigue wore off throughout the day, but I still had a slight headache. Later in the evening I again became fatigued and still had a slight headache. The following day, my headache subsided, and I was only tired once evening came around. My symptoms had completely dissipated by 12/26/2020.

                                                Beyond the sore arm, around midnight the same night as the vaccine, I experienced a 10 minute time period of chills with uncontrollable shivering that persisted until I laid under the covers as still as possible and let it pass.  The following day, I felt like I didn&#39;t want to do anything and was easily irritable.  All symptoms resolved after 48 hours.

About one minute later he felt like he could not get a full breath and he felt the need to run away. We connected a heart monitor, did serial vital signs, listen to lung sounds. He symptoms seem to worsen. He did not have hives, his lungs were clear. His HR was normal but his B/P was elevated. We started and IV and gave him 25 mg mg of IV Benadryl. We contacted Dr. via phone. He talked to the patient and he agreed with our assessment and treatment.  He began feeling better about 10 min after the Benadryl and he symptoms cleared by 30 min after Benadryl. We kept him on the heart monitor for 1 hour.  He reported he felt fine and back to normal when he left to go home. He refused ambulance transport to the hospital. All reports will be filled out by me.

Nurse called 911, and I was transported to emergency. About 1.5 hour later, my heart was even beating more quickly, and I could hardly talked and difficult to breathe. This happened when I walked to the restroom by myself and came back. After they did some medical tests, gave me medication for allergy (the doctor gave me this since he was not sure if it was my allergy reaction to the vaccines), injected 2 IV bags and rest for few hours, my blood pressure went down to about 140/9x and heart beat back to normal. I was released from ER on the next day at 4:00am.

This stayed painful for 48-60 hours, then the swelling subsided and was left with a bruise.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence.

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

                                                Patient got his Covid vaccine this past Thursday, 2 days ago.  He experienced typical side effects of a sore left shoulder and some fatigue but was feeling well until this afternoon around 1:55 PM when he noticed throbbing of his left hand.  He looked down and noticed that there was a purple discoloration to his middle finger and distal palmar aspect of his hand.  He felt like there was maybe some swelling as well and that he might have been having an allergic reaction so called the emergency department for further advice and came in for evaluation.  By the time I arrived to the emergency department the patient&#39;s left hand was no longer swollen and there was only a small purple discoloration to the palmar proximal middle finger.  I was concerned that the patient developed a small blood clot that was resolved upon evaluation.

                                                Early in the morning of January 9th, 2021, the day after receiving my first injection, I woke up in bed with extreme soreness and moderate swelling at the injection site. On a scale from one to ten, the level of discomfort was seven or eight. I had expected at least some soreness as I normally have soreness after receiving flu shots and other injections. However, I was very surprised as to how sore my arm really was. Fortunately, when I woke up the next day, January 10th, the pain had mostly subsided, with just a little swelling evident at the injection site.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on January 11, 2021.  The morning of January 12, 2021 I woke with severe muscle and joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue.  As the day progressed I developed chills to the point I could not get warm.  I also developed a low grade fever.  After taking two ibuprofen around 3p the pain subsided to an ache about my entire body by 9p, headache had subsided and I had no more chills or fever.  On the morning of January 13, 2021 I woke with a red rash going up the inside of both arms and around the outside of my upper arms and down my entire back.  As the day has progressed that rash has spread down the back of legs as well.  I did take one Benadryl with minimal effect.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia without fever was made, patient started azithromycin on 1/5 and albuterol treatments every 4-6 hrs. Initially he improved, but then worsened.  chest xray on 1/6 was negative for pneumonia, PCR covid test was negative, albuterol treatment did not bring much relief. He started respiratory distress on 1/10 and was taken by car to the local ER where another covid test was negative and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. The leg US revealed blood clots in both of his legs. He had an emergency catheter-delivered thrombolysis and was discharged home from the ICU on 1/12 on oral anticoagulants. He is gradually improving, but very weak. He tires easily and gets a drop in oxygen to 90- 93%, as well as an increase in the heart rate to 120  when walking less than half a mile. He runs out of breath with exertion.

The symptoms lasted all night and were improved in the morning but not fully resolved.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                Sore area around injection site, irregular temperature, severe fatigue - fatigue lasted the equivalent of two days with the next full day after injection being the worst.  The day after the injection fatigue was debilitating requiring sleeping or resting for most of the day and night. Half way through the second day after the injection fatigue is still present though significantly improved. The Item 21 box for Doctor visit has been checked as I will meet with my primary care provider as soon as possible and have already discussed it with my employer&#39;s health department.

Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

The patient developed headache, lack of taste, fatigue as well as the aforementioned rash on 1/14/2021(6 days after receiving first dose of covid vaccine.  A rapid covid test was positive on 1/14/2021 also.  The patient was prescribed claritin, methylprednisolone for the rash after seeing his family physician virtually and the family physician recommended he contact where he was vaccinated to report these symptoms.  I have reached out to the patient for additional information and he has declined, so I do not have any access to details on his positive covid test or records from that virtual encounter.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccination, I started to have severe chills, fever, intense headache, body aches, inability to sleep and sweating.  This last 24 hours and then began to dissipate.  The headache left first.  These symptoms mirrored the symptoms I had with COVID minus the sinus drainage and sore throat I had with COVID.  Yet, the symptoms were more intense.  The reaction to the vaccine was the sickest I recall being in the last 20 years.  It was a long 24 hours. I went to the ER and obtained a liter of fluids via IV and motrin type medicine.  I was advised it should last about 24-36 hours and discharged.

Duration approximately 5 minutes then tachycardia and dizziness resolved.  Also had a tremor.  No angioedema, urticaria or other skin/mucosal findings.  Was not anxious.  Arrived home and wife and children told me I looked flushed and noticed my pupils were significantly dilated.  The flushing and dilated pupils resolved over the next hour.  No shortness of breath or hoarse voice of any kind however my mouth felt extremely dry.  I did not do anything for treatment.  Spontaneous resolution.

The fever broke after about 5 hours with 800mg of ibuprofen and 1000mg of acetaminophen. The nausea subsided somewhat with 8mg of Zofran sublingual. The headache resolved about 01:00am on 01/10/2021. The dizziness and fatigue resolved significantly by 04:00am on 01/10/2021. Mild fatigue continued for another 24 or so hours, but seemed mostly resolved by 01/11/2021 and may have been exacerbated by my overnight (7p-7a) shifts.

When I sat at my computer and started to work my headache got worse and worse like a very bad migraine.  I went outside and the headache subsided.  When I went back to my desk my headache got worse again. I then tried to go to Urgent care but was refused because of possible Covid symptoms. I had to go to Covid Hot zone in our Emergency Room. They released me from work for 2-3 days.  When I came back to work my headache was much more milder and I could handle the slight pain..

                                                Narrative: Patient is a 49 year old man with past medical history of hypertension and kidney stones who presented with a chief complaint of word finding difficulties and slurred speech. Patient was last seen normal at 1230 pm on 1/21/2021. He got his covid vaccine and shortly after he developed a headache that was on both sides of his head. Felt like 8/10 pain. He then had difficulty with speaking - he didn&#39;t know what word to say so he would make a noise. He was on the phone, and that person recommended that he come to the ED to get evaluated.In the ED, a stroke code was called. BP 169/97. NIHSS 0. A CT non con did not show any acute bleed or any signs of a stroke. After the stoke code was ended, the patient has a headache severity 1/10 and did not have any word finding difficulties. Patient was non focal by the time that the stroke code was ended. In the setting of hypertension, a blood pressure of 169/97 on admission and fluctuating symptoms, most concerning on the differential is a TIA. Given his risk factors and episodic presentation, he will need to be worked up for a stroke. The differential also includes post-vaccination reaction vs complex migraine.

The patient experienced a medically significant and unexpected event of Facial paralysis and unexpected non-serious events of Influenza, Pain, Photophobia and Lacrimation increased. The events of Influenza and Pain occurred approximately one day after receiving their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Photophobia and Lacrimation increased occurred approximately four days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Event of Facial Paralysis was diagnosed approximately ten days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 025J20A). Treatment included Valtrex. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

                                                pt stated that on 2/2/2021 he developed and SOB, choking sensation and fatigue.  On 2/3/2021 he went to the ER for these symptoms.  His O2 level was 98.  He as given EKG, XRAY, tested for pneumonia, heart condition and Covid.  All test came back negative. He was diagnosed w/ Acute Bronchitis and prescribed an Inhaler and Mucinex.  .  On 2/4/2021 pt went to his ENT Dr.  where he was scoped for possible cancer reoccurrence.  The triage of head and neck was negative for any illness.  He was told to continue the Inhaler and Mucinex.  On 2/5/2021 he went to his PCP and was told there was nothing they could do for him.  Told him to wait about 10 days to see if his symptoms subsided, if not he was going to refer him to a Pulmonologist.  From 2/5 to 2/19  the shortness of breath and choking sensation continued but the fatigue had subsided.  On 2/19 pt woke up w/ severe SOB and choking sensation so pt went back to the ER.  They performed another EKG, CT of neck and lungs, Covid Test, blood work, O2 level was 99 with wheezing symptoms. All test were negative but pt still had SOB.  Pt was released and referred to ENT Doctor once again on 2/25 w/ Dr. which they will do another scope where they will go further down.  Pt thinks his next option maybe a referral to a Pulmonologist.

                                                I experienced insidous onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations after approximately 2-3 minutes of inoculation.  This episode lasted about 1-2 minutes.  I was not expecting this having no prior history of adverse response to vaccines.  I also felt a flushing sensation in my head.   My breathing felt slightly more difficult.  No sweating, throat closure or itching.   I did not measure pulse and instead tried to breathe/meditate to bring it down.  I estimate it was about 140 bpm .  Breathing/meditation brought it down but it was still elevated when the nurse checked me after 20 minutes.  I remained onsite an additional 15 minutes until I felt well enough to leave but my heart rate was still somewhat elevated, about 20 bpm higher than my usual.   My heart rate seemed to fluctuate throughout the evening and my sleep was subsequently very poor.  I feel much better this morning, just the usual arm soreness after a vaccination.  I have reached out to my primary doctor concerning whether she feels this event would warrant my not getting the second dose or perhaps having a prescribed epipen on my person.  Having no personal history but a family history of severe heart disease (father had first MI at age 42, second at 44 followed by triple bypass and CHF) this incident with my heart rate certainly raised some anxiety.  I had a routine EKG done in June which was normal, I am a physical therapist and in good health.  I am hoping to have the next vaccine in a proper medical facility.   I have read CDC recommendations to not have the second shot if certain adverse responses are experienced and I am not certain whether this would qualify.   I have no history of adverse reactions to vaccines.    Considering the role of anxiety versus the insidious and nearly immediate onset of rapid heart rate with palpitations and persistent elevated heart rate for more than 12 hours, I feel this event was primarily driven by the vaccine.

Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                Right after the vaccine I just had a slight head ache. I had pretty typical symptoms. Around 8pm my arm got to 8/10 pain. I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

This spread to involve pain throughout the posterior upper arm for about 6 days before resolving. Did get moderate relief with use of ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q 8 hrs PRN. Received vaccine on 12/23/20 at 6pm.  Woke up at 5am to go to work on 12/24/20 and felt flu-like symptoms with subjective fever (did not measure), joint pain, and diffuse myalgias.  Symptoms progressed over the next three hours and culminated in about half an hour of significant rigors with uncontrolled shivering.  Ibuprofen dose of 600mg orally did help symptoms enough to allow me to finish my shift but I needed two more doses every 8 hours before symptoms resolved in 24 hrs.

                                                Patient is a 52 y.o. male who was seen at COVID Vaccine Clinic today for his first dose of the COVID 19 vaccination.    He denied any history of previous adverse reactions to vaccines.   He was given the Moderna vaccination in the right deltoid muscle.   During his 15 minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience lightheadedness.  He denied difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, throat tightness and facial swelling. He denies eating or drinking anything today.   This provider was notified of patient reaction and he was then assessed in the emergency bay area.   Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to rapid progression of symptoms.

                                                Very mild but noticeable numbness in tongue towards back of tongue (not front) on either side.  Seemed to dissipate after six hours.  Was not immediately noticeable and seemed to be more pronounced about 1/2 hour after injection.  I had the other expected soreness at injection site and general malaise approximately 24 hours after  - 96 hours after vaccine and I am only reporting this as I was not expecting the numbness in the tongue and was not sure if it was an adverse effect or just stress related.

                                                The patient had a very severe side effect profile from the second dose of vaccine:  &#34;worst I&#39;ve ever felt&#34; with myalgia, headache, fever and fatigue.  This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.   This appears to be immune mediated myocarditis from the Moderna vaccine

                                                22 hours after receiving the vaccine, I had  fever and the chills.  This was followed by a headache.  This was not unexpected.  I fell into a deep sleep that lasted 2 hours.  I awoke suddenly with a very bad headache.  I drank about 3 ounces of orange juice and then took 30 ml of pharmacy brand liquid Tylenol.  This is the bad symptom that I want to report.  As soon as the liquid Tylenol hit the back of my throat it felt as if my throat constricted tightly.  I immediately stopped drinking it and was able to spit out some of what was in my mouth.  I was unable to get air in or out.  I stood up  and eventually was able to get a big gulp of air into my lungs before everything closed up again.  Eventually I was able to get another gulp of air in and I began to cough a little.  Once I drank some water, I could feel the liquid Tylenol on the back of my throat get washed down  and I was able to breath normally in about 2 minutes.   The cup of liquid Tylenol still had about 20 ml of fluid in it and I spit out perhaps half of what entered my mouth; I&#39;m estimating that 5 ml of liquid Tylenol went down  my throat.  Note that this is not a case of the liquid Tylenol going down my windpipe by mistake.  I know what that feels like and it is different.  It was all very traumatic.

I had antibodies test completed on 12/22/2020 at hospital, my results were positive for antibodies with score of 205.  Dec 31, 2020:  Severe Chilling and shaking, teeth rattling shaking, unable to get warm,  Extreme fatigue, unable to stay awake, watch registered 4k steps despite me being in recliner for the day due to the shaking of body.   Jan 1, 2021:  Intense head ache, muscle aches and red and swelling welt at immunization site.  Recurrent fever, excessive sweating, soaked through tshirt, polo shirt twice, extreme fatigue. Same symptoms continue until Jan 5, 2021.  Symptoms were definitely more intense than just a casual body ache or fever. It felt like my body had covid again even though i know it is not possible to catch covid again from vaccine.

On the night of 12/31/2020 I began to feel more SOB than usual and was unable to correct my SOB with rescue inhaler. Became more SOB with exacerbated tachycardia and tachypnea, My family had to call 911 because I became aphasic and showing signs of possible stroke. I was taken to the ER and admitted for respiratory recovery and to role out stroke. The stroke was ruled out and I recovered with IV prednisone therapy, twice daily and supplemental oxygen. Released after HR, BP, &amp; respiratory effort returned to normal: 01/03/2021

I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

                                                I am a front line physician. I had moderate Covid in March 2020.  After my vaccination at 2:15pm on 1/6/2021 I had very slight chills at 11:30 pm as I went to bed. I awoke at 5:30am 1/7/2021 with severe chills and very slight fever of 98.8 (oral). I took 800mg Advil then. I remained in bed with chills until 4pm. I had a fever of 100.0 at 11:45am. Took 800mg Advil.  Chills subsided to mild around 4pm. Was able to walk around house. Ate dinner. No GI symptoms. 11:30pm had fever 100.0  and moderate to sever chills. Took 800 mg Advil.  Felt better and went to sleep at around 1am. Woke up 6am 1/8/2021 and was able to go to work. When I got to work I was able to sign up for this reporting service but could nit document my first day of symptoms. I took that opportunity now. I believe it is important that I had these reactions after having the covid illness 3/2020. I had small amount remaining antibodies at time of Vaccination, which surely contributed to my response.

I was incredibly fatigued for about three days after. Also, the entire right forearm felt sore for about a week, as well. The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

We instructed him to take off his jacket and gave him a cool rag. After the 15 minutes of observation were up, he felt good. He denied any s/s of dizziness or light-headiness or shortness of breath. I called to check on him today and he reported that he feels a little tired and has some nausea at times. His arm is a little sore, but he is doing ok.

During his observation period he reported that he had a racing heart, shaky hands, and was sweating.  Staff monitored him and got him some water.  He stated that he had a history of hypoglycemia as well but had not had issues with it in a while.  Patient reported that his BG had been 80 that morning and that he had eaten Chick Fil a prior to coming for the vaccine.  We offered a snack or glucose tablet but patient refused.  We did recommend that the patient remain in our observation are a for an extra 15 minutes and he agreed.  After monitoring and water the patient felt better and purchased glucose tablets when he left.

It hurt on the back right and above the right ear. It hurt to touch. My tongue is not functjioning now.  I had to get a MRI because they thought it could of been a mini stroke. MRI came back negative the doctors told me Bell Palsy.  They advise me not to get my second dose on 2/3/21.

The morning of 2/16 he was found to have a fever of 104.8, altered mental status, possible seizure like activity and taken to ED. ID consulted due to high fever, AMS, LP recommended to rule out meningitis. Due to the patient being on warfarin he needed to be reversed first which was done. The following day he was back to his baseline and afebrile. LP was canceled at that time.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

                                                Patient received 0.5mL Moderna Covid19 vaccine at mass vaccine clinic on 12/30. This patient was a walk thru and not a patient of HP at this time.    Daughter reported to ARNP,RN Director Clinical Support on 01/03 the following outcomes:    Patient first exhibited the first signs of reaction started about 60 hours after vaccine: hives only (no difficulty breathing, dizziness, lightheadedness); applied hydrocortisone cream, took diphenhydramine. Patient slept for a few hours then woke up for lunch. Around 12:30-1:00 the patient exhibited three episodes of syncope. Emergency services was called after the first. Firefighters couldn&#39;t find BP, was in 70s by doppler only. Patient taken to hospital for care.    Discharged from ED around 5, suspecting hypotension 2/2 to diphenhydramine use. Monitored vitals at home; became severely hypotensive (BP 70s/40s both with automatic monitor and manual read) and lethargic again about an hour or so after, but normotensive again right before about to call ambulance. Pt claimed to be okay and had some dinner. Fourth episode of syncope, ambulance was called.         Patient remains at hospital ED since, still in observation unit. BP&#39;s normalized but itching returns periodically. IV steroids and diphenhydramine. Took head CT yesterday; no word on the results. Stable and alert enough since yesterday to communicate with us with his phone. Patient is scheduled for an echo to be done today.    No hx of severe allergic reaction. Treated for active TB 30 years ago, shingles x2 in the past few years; otherwise healthy 55 y/o male.     Pt discharged 01/04 to home with fatigue and malaise. Not additional symptoms reported since then. Provider doing full cardiac and neurologic work up.

                                                I felt like I had  a cold for the first 3 days after shot. I was fine for 3 days. On the morning of the 6th day, 1/21/21, I had very intense deep muscle pain in my lower back, left arm, hands and headache. About two hours after this started I started to have the very intense chills, my headache got worse and for the first time a low fever of 99 degrees. I felt like this for 2 days, couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days because of the pain. On the third day 1/24/21, it was much better and almost all gone by the fourth day, 1/25/21. Thank you

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.

                                                Presented to ED for evaluation of generalized lower extremity weakness, falls. The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

                                                Mild case of pneumonia; Tested positive for COVID; Shortness of breath; A spontaneous was received from a healthcare facility staff member concerning 55 years of old, male patient who developed shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID. The patient&#39;s medical history included back issue. The patient had an epidural for bulging disk in back in an unknown date in December. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 29-JAN-2021, eight days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) on left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20-JAN-2021, the patient had COVID symptoms including congestion and cough but tested negative on rapid testing. Since tested negative, the patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled on 29-JAN-2021 at Hospital.  On 06-FEB-2021 after experiencing shortness of breath, the patient was retested by rapid test, which was also negative. However, the patient tested positive for COVID on Polymerase Chain reaction test at Urgent Care. The patient had a mild case of pneumonia  The reporter believes that the patient probably was positive before, as patient had been home since 19-DEC-2020 due to a back issue. Thinks that the patient&#39;s son may have been asymptomatic and all eight members in the household tested positive except the reporter. Treatment for the events included antibiotic azithromycin 5 days z-pack.  The events shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID were considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and high probability of corona infection from the close contacts where all eight members in the household were tested positive except the patient immediately before the vaccination, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                Moderna COVID?19 Vaccine EUA Got vaccine 4pm.  I ate dinner at 6pm.  At 8pm felt slightly nauseous.  By 9pm it was worse.  By 9 30pm I was nauseous and full blow stomach pain.  My stomach was &#39;roiling or churning.&#39;   Then between 9 30pm and 2 30am the next day I was nauseous, had stomach pain, I felt hot and cold and my head became more congested and I got a headache.  Note: the head congestion was there prior to getting the vaccine, but it got worse.   I sipped water throughout and it felt like I had to vomit (but I did not vomit).   I took my temperature a few times it ranged from 98 to 98.8.   My normal temperature is 97 to 97.5.   By morning, or about 4am the worse symptoms were gone.  My stomach felt more or less ok and at 7am  I ate a light breakfast without incident.   My temperature seemed to be elevated through the day.  I felt somewhat weak during the day.  Worst effects seem gone by Jan 8 evening.   The only effect left is pain in my left upper arm.  I consider these to be significant and worrying side effects and I may not take the second dose.

Had some numbness in fingers and toes.  These symptoms were actually more severe that when I had Covid 19. Taking Tylenol would help ease the symptoms, I did rotate in a dose of Ibuprofen on a 2 hour interval one time during the worst of the symptoms. After the 36 hour mark the symptoms faded and I returned to a normal state, although very drained and fatigued. The severity of the symptoms seem like they would be dangerous for someone who is not in good health.

                                                I became  dizzy and heart racing after 2 minutes of receiving  this vaccine.  I had a pulse oximetry. My heart rate was 132 (my normal is around 60). I told the  RN was having a reaction. I had brought my liquid benadryl in case I might have a reaction due to my severe food allergies. I immediately drank 50 mg of benadryl.  In 2 to 3 minutes my heart rate came down and I felt better. I was able to leave and drive home. I am an RN myself so I knew how to manage this situation.

                                                About 3 days later started getting not headaches but a sharp pain in and around left temple region.  Pain is sharp, like a stab, but first 2-3 days of the pain, it last a few seconds to a few minutes and nothing for the day, occasionally I might have the incident 2-3 times in a day.  But today 01/21/2021, the pain around 4pm, lasted longer, about 2 hours but on and off, not constant. At midnight, the pain seems to have stopped.

Son took me to ER - Medical Center - and they put me on an IV and gave me Meclizine. Kept me for obsevation for 36 hours as it was not subsiding (the vertigo). Ruled out stroke with CT scan. They sent me home with Meclizine and I&#39;m still taking it. I get Vertigo every day still.

                                                4 days after receiving my vaccine I experienced a painful sore throat.    Examination of my oropharynx reveals a solitary 1mm pustule  with surrounding erythema on the posteriolateral edge of the hard palate.  I have not experienced any fever or URI symptoms.  It is on the same side as my vaccine.  I am not sure if it is relevant but I reached out to my Infectious Disease colleague and he recommended I report this to you ( I am a Dermatologist). The lesion is still present today 36 hours later without any new lesions or progression.  I do not have any history of herpes or aphthous ulcers and have never had a lesion on this part of my hard palate before.

I wonder if people who have had the virus should be being told to get the vaccine since I suspect intense reaction is due to pre existing immunity.

He ate a little bit of food, took some food, went home and rested and his symptoms calmed down. The next day (Saturday) he just felt fatigued. He did say that he had not ate breakfast before receiving his vaccine. He also spoke with a family member who is a doctor but did not actually go to a doctor&#39;s office/clinic.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Was in a nursing home until he moved into his parent&#39;s house.  His mother actually passed away and December and his stepfather has been trying to take care of him since.  Patient may periodically stand but is a house where he is pretty much confined to his bedroom and bathroom.  Patient received his COVID-19 vaccine at the prescription shop 03/04/2021 and since then he has had a steady decline starting with aches and pains to increased weakness and confusion and then collapse which brought him to the emergency room.

BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.

That night experienced fevers (101.7F) and fever like symptoms (sweats, chills, body aches). Continued to &#34;not feel well&#34;. 3/15/21, presented to ED with chest pains and dx with pericarditis again.  Treated with IV Vanco x1 and IV Zosyn x2 until blood work came back and cultures were negative. Due to no infection and negative for an MI, Dr. determined pericarditis was a rxn to the vaccine.   Other tests results include: Elevated BNP, BUN, and CRP.  CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis is clear. 5 covid tests since admission, all negative. IgG antibodies for COVID negative.   PT currently is stable and bloodwork somewhat improved. On O2, fluids and Morphine for chest pain. An acute Hepatitis panel is currently pending.

I have experienced all these side effects every day for the last 10 days. Additional side effects are: Sweating profusely every night. Not being able to sleep very well nearly every night. Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

                                                Since Shot - Arm pain at injection site continues through today.  Most intense issues were Tuesday 24 hours post shot when I had more intense headaches and body aches.  SOB remained the same.  Tuesday evening, 35 hours post shot, I had chills and low grade fever 99.3.  Slept for 10 hours and fever was gone and hasn&#39;t returned.  Intensity of arm pain is diminished but still quite sore at actual injection site.  Headaches are not as intense as Tuesday but continue to fluctuate in intensity as they have for the past 3 months.

I had the expected side effects Chills, aches, headache but was not expecting the tinnitus and thought initially it would resolve with the other symptoms but it has not.  It is a constant high pitched tone.  I was not exposed to anything else that day.  No loud noises and have no symptoms other illness.  This is the first time I have experienced this. It doesn&#39;t seem to be in one ear or the other, It is just there , constantly.  I did not go to a doctor because I am one and know nothing can be done.

                                                I began to experience lightheadedness, generalized weakness and confusion. My handwriting changed. These faded over the afternoon only to recur at the same time next morning, resolving in the afternoon once again. I was afraid i was having a heart attack and called 911 and was taken to Hospital where I ruled out for an MI. In the ambulance i received four baby aspirin. I was discharged that night. The next morning, i  developed poor balance and fell twice while walking. Weakness also recurred with confusion. I could not stand myself up. I went to another Hospital and spent the night in Observation. The next morning no symptoms occurred but I refrained from walking as much as possible that day. At hospital I received IV fluid and my usual medications. Neurology consultation revealed possibly abnormal reflexes and poor balance. I received a cane from physical therapy. Since then symptoms have mostly not resolved but weakness and falls have recurred. Evaluation for fall and poor balance continues to date. I received the second dose of the Moderna immunization as scheduled without incident.
