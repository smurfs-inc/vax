Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

We treated it like a stomach ache and he went through the rest of the day, even at work, in gut wrenching pain. This morning when I woke up, I noticed he was out on the couch. When I went to check on him, he was as white as a ghost and his lips were greying around the edges. I immediately told him to call into work. I thought he would say no because he has not called in in over 10 years, but to my surprise, he did so. I put him in bed and the abdominal pain is still present and now his fever is over 103!!!  I bought Tylenol and Motrin and will be alternating between the two until the fever breaks and if the pain persists by 8 pm, we will be headed to the emergency room...

                                                Around 12hrs of first injection, I began to feel very cold.  Left arm was very painful to move. Hands and feet felt like ice. I was shivering. Fever of 102. Could not sleep. I was up at 3am feeling like I was going to vomit and I couldn?t get warm. Whole body aches. Couldn?t go in to work the next morning. I had a terrible headache. Slept all day. Went to bed in the evening and woke again at 3am shivering uncontrollably. Hands have continued to stay cold. No appetite as well.

                                                Sore shoulder started after a couple of hours and was moderate by evening. A general unusual feeling started within a couple hours of the shot.  By 7pm I started to experience chills and joint fatigue in legs (knees, toes).  Chills became severe and a low grade fever of 100.6 developed.  Chills lasted about 1.5hrs.  Fever broke overnight. By morning all previous issues were resolved and the only issue was a problem with equilibrium and balance (and sore shoulder)  It was a general feeling similar to drunkenness.  This issue persisted throughout the day and by evening I was experiencing mild vertigo when I closed my eyes. I went to bed feeling somewhat improved relative to all the symptoms but woke having experienced a cold sweat. My shirt was completely soaked. I noted several less significant sweating issues throughout this day with no other side effects. This was the final day with notable symptoms. At the time of this report I have minor shoulder pain as the only symptom that persisted throughout. The equilibrium symptoms were severe enough that I missed a day of work.

Then around 8am I started to have chills which then I checked my temp and it was 101.0 degrees F. Then I started to get a headache and severe body aches. Around 3pm I tried to eat something which I then threw it up. I tried to drink water and flavored water which I also threw up the water. I also went into the bathtub 7 times that day to stop the chills. Which it did but right when I got out they started again which then I felt worse. Around 11pm 1/23/2021 I ended up going into the ER which then they gave me IV fluids and then Benadryl and Toradol by IV. After those were administered I started feeling better which then I was discharged and went home.

                                                Normally sore following the vaccine starting around 9:00 PM last night.  Had shivers, nothing terrible.  By 6:00 AM the chills were intense, weakness, having less coordination and depth perception issue.  Closer to 9:00-10:00 AM felt like he had the flu 10 times worse than he should have.  Had COVID in April/May but these symptoms worse.  Got home at 11:15 AM was so cold, hands were ice cold, and took 2 hours of sleeping and all layers of clothing to feel warm.  Took a few layers off and still shaking, feverish and feeling of worse flu to man. Pain all over the body, temperature at 3:30 is 99.5-100.4, above 98 is fever is fever for him, normal is 96-97.  Sharp shooting muscle pains in extremities, top part of the hands, muscles, tendons, and also his legs and feet, but not fingers or toes.  Pain is quite intense.  All he wants to do is lay down in sleep.   Thought he was going to freeze to death.  Hands were so cold his kids were concerned.  Ice packs on chest, and gloves and 10 layers on hands and arms.  Had tremendous trouble breathing while having the intense chills.    He is a responder for law enforcement.   Symptoms have improved some, but still feeling feverish with shooting pains, depth perception issues, as well as pain.  Headache in back of head, pressure type.  Called off for work for today and tomorrow.

                                                I work at a Hospital sterilizing surgical equipment.  After I received the vaccine, the hospital staff observed me for 15 minutes to see if a reaction occurred.  I felt fine, and they told me I could go.  I was working that day (2-10:30pm) and had gotten vaccinated at the beginning of my shift.  The rest of my shift went fine.  Near the end, though, my arm began to feel sore.  Driving home, I began to feel tired.  By the time I got home, it felt like a cold was setting in.  I ate a large bowl of chicken soup to try to feel better.  I stayed up a little bit, but was feeling woozy by this point and went to bed.  Bad chills set in and I began to shake I felt so cold.  I used a heating pad to help with this.  I tried to sleep, but my head was throbbing.  The next morning, I tried to sit up in bed but my first attempt proved too difficult.  I took it slower.  I was able to sit up eventually.  Standing was also difficult.  I spent the day mostly lounging on the couch.  I slept a little better that night, but my head was still throbbing somewhat.  No chills this time.  Getting up the next morning went a little better.  I was able to sit up in bed without issue and walking around did not prove as much of a chore.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:50 am. First my arm started hurting and felt warm to the touch shortly after the injection. My arm started hurting more and more until I could barely lift it to the side more than like 20 degrees from my side.  Then I got the worst headache of my life. I tried taking ibuprofen, but it barely seemed to make any difference. I also tried taking Bayer aspirin and it seemed to help a little bit. Plus the whole time I was feeling nauseas, and it was all I could do to eat a few crackers so the medicine wouldn&#39;t upset my stomach as much. By this time the muscle/body aches, and fatigue started setting in so I just tried to go to sleep around 8pm or so. I was able to sleep, but it wasn&#39;t a restful sleep. I was tossing and turning for a few hours. Then the chills set in around 10pm and I didn&#39;t want to get out from under the covers because I was shaking so bad. But I managed to pile enough blankets on to get warm, and I was able to get some sleep. Then next day, all of the previous symptoms seemed to get worse except for the chills seemed come and go. But my arm was hurting more in a larger area and up my shoulder. The muscle/body aches were more intense and the fatigue increased. Taking Ibuprofen every few hours only marginally seemed to help. My head was hurting so bad it hurt to open my eyes. And I felt like I was going to throw up all day. Plus I started taking my temp sometime in the morning of over 101. Sorry about to run out of time

Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

                                                Around 11:30 pm that evening I started feeling extremely warm in my face and thighs. Figuring it was due to the shot, I decide to try and lay down to sleep it off. A short time later, I awoke freezing with chills and uncontrollable shivering. My whole body hurt especially my lower back and pressure in my head. This continued throughout the night until the early morning. As the shivering and chills subsided, extreme fatigue, body aches and head pressure continued and it was difficult to get up at points. I had no appetite and forced myself to drink to stay hydrated.  About 1:00 pm, I started to feel better, but that was short lived. Approximately 4:30 ? 5pm, the chills and shivering returned and I had 101 fever. I had some tea and toast and then went to bed for the night. When I awoke this morning, I felt a million times better. As of writing this email, I still have some slight fatigue, aches, and head pressure, but night and day difference from yesterday.

                                                I was administered my first dose of the Moderna Covid Vaccine on 1/29/2021 at 12:20 P.M.  I woke up today, 1/30/2021, at 5:30 A.M. and had chills,  significant fatigue, headache, and a fever that was 100.8 degrees when I measured with an oral thermometer.  I believe my fever may have been higher, but I did not measure when I felt worse. I&#39;m reporting this at 3:15 P.M. and believe I may be starting to feel better.  I was surprised to get these side effects after the first dose.

Went to bed and woke up with night sweats, aches, chills, fever (persistently over 100F, topped at 101.3F) and one of the worst headaches I?ve ever had (not hyperbole, truly a monster headache). Slept for small stretches of time, maybe 45-60 mins, before waking. Condition worsened until about 6-7am. Chills persisted but worst symptom was the headache, it was inescapable pain. At 9am, took 400mg ibuprofen and was able to fall asleep.  Woke again around 10:30, soaking wet in sweat, but felt much better. Headache about 95% resolved, fever subsided (temp returned to steady 98.2).  Felt generally tired the rest of the day, but overall much better than the overnight period.

When I woke up at 5 Am I suffered from severe headache. Remainder of the day I had extreme digestive issues that continued over the next several days. At the conclusion of the second day I developed a fever of 101. Pinpointed severe pain developed at the base of my neck between my shoulder blades. That pain remained for approximately 24 to 48 hours that lead to extreme pain and stiff neck on my right side. Chills and periodic fever developed for two days past shot. By day three I had extreme right side neck pain that continued down into my right shoulder blade. By day four and five I suffered from extreme neck pain and severe headache that was focused from my right eye through my head down the right side of my neck to my right shoulder blade. By day 4 this continued with dizziness and blurred vision. I had inability to eat and strong feelings to vomit but only didn&#39;t because I hadn&#39;t consumed any food that day. I continued to suffer from extreme headaches and complete physical exhaustion with inability to stay away. In addition, I continued to have periodic chills but with no fever.  As I submit this in day 5 I still suffer from lack of energy and the stiff neck remains down through my right shoulder blade.

Symptoms started around 5pm when he was on a conference call and reports he got bad news so was stressed out. Denies any recent trauma.    Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

He received the second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 18MAR21 at clinic and within 14 hours developed chills and myalgias. He denies any immediate onset of symptoms after receiving the vaccine. The following day he reports experiencing chest pain 24 hours after the vaccine was administered that progressively worsened over the subsequent 36 hours that finally prompted him to seek care. He describes the pain as a central non-radiating squeezing pain that worsened with movement and breathing. He waited to seek care because he reports several of the soldiers in his unit have experienced similar chest pain that eventually resolved.   He reports being at his baseline health prior to receiving the vaccine and denies any fever, cough, rhinorrhea, congestion, malaise, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash.   Upon initial presentation to care at clinic he was noted to have a Tropnon I of 0.9, WBC of 14, elevated CRP (7.3), and temp to 101.4. Patient was given ASA, Plavix, Lovenox, Tylenol, and Ceftriaxone.    Since arriving to clinic and EKG was obtained showing ST elevation in lead 1 and avF concerning for ischemia and underwent a left heart catheterization which was clear of obstruction. Serial high sensitivity Tropnonin levels have been trended to peak of 465. Respiratory viral panel to include SARS COV-2 was negative. Cardiac MRI was consistent with myopericarditis, and show mildly reduced EF for 46%. Blood cultures have not grown any organism. His chest pain has resolved since starting Aspirin and Colchicine.

The chest tightness resolved within a few hours. He then had severe fatigue x36 hours-sleeping most of that time?followed by fever, chills, myalgias x2d. Those resolved but the arthralgias have persisted since then. Within 1 week he developed worsened joint hypermobility and has had multiple subluxations (fingers, ankles, knee, elbow) that has persisted. Within 1 week he developed joint swelling. He had diffuse pain and hyperalgesia with pain to minimal pressure. At 2 weeks he developed a pruritic popular rash on LE. Due to joint swelling and rash he was placed on a 5d prednisone burst that decreased the pain, swelling, and rash, but recurred when prednisone d/c?d. He was restarted on a 2 week taper which helped partially with pain and swelling but did not resolve them and the rash continued to spread. He still has the rash present now diffuse on legs and torso but it seems to have stopped spreading as of this week. The joint swelling has also seemed to plateau but has not resolved. The joint pain and worsened hypermobility is slowly improving but not resolved. 2 weeks ago (4 weeks after vaccine) he developed new neuropathic symptoms?tingling in his extremities with intermittent shock-like pain, followed by itching and burning along S2-S3 dermatomes (into groin) and back pain. The sacral sxs resolved w/in 1 week but the tingling in extremities has persisted.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Hyperthyroidism. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE (FLOVENT) for an unknown indication.   On 22-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out to sleep at 745 pm) (seriousness criterion medically significant).

                                                3-5 hrs s/p vaccine- soreness at injection site. About 12h s/p vaccine administered (around 9p) began to experience chills, headache, fatigue.  This persists/worsens accompanied by chills. Temp taken at 10p (99.1, my normal is 97.6) By 0150, temp up to 100.4 along with continuing alternating sweats/chills and persisting headache. 1000mg Tylenol used at 0150.  At 0240, symptoms settle a bit and got a little sleep. 0445, woke up- headache persists. Mild chills/sweats. Afebrile at 98.6. Still fatigued. At 0800 on 1/5/21, another 1000mg Tylenol used as aforementioned symptoms worsening.  Now at 1035 (time of this report), chills/sweats have settled - left with fatigue, headache, and nasal congestion.    Of note, I tested positive for COVID and was sick for about 2-3 weeks in Sep 2020.

The day after vaccination I had a sore throat and congestion that felt similar to a cold. Symptoms began to weaken three days after vaccination and by day 5 I had recovered almost completely.

I hurt for 4 days and spread down my arm and into my ribs.

Followed by immediate warm feeling, light headedness (similar to feeling of passing out).  Every 10-15 min after that for the next 90 minutes a similar but less intense increase in heart rate would occur.  During this next 90 minutes my hands were very tingly and clammy, my adrenaline seemed high, and my throat was suddenly very dry requiring several cups of water.  Overall intensity of the heart pounding sensation decreased with each episode and overall my heart felt normal about 2 hrs past vaccination.  A headache then developed along with fogginess and persisted the rest of the day.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I had pain in the neck at my thyroid gland and what seems to be the lymph glands behind it on the right hand side.  It was tender.  I took tylenol to deal with it.  That pain persisted all the next day on Friday and again took tylenol and ibuprofen to deal with it.  Then Saturday AM I was awaked early with severe throbbing pain in same thyroid/lymph area, it hurt to swallow, turn my head, and the pain was radiating up to my right ear.  I was also having cold sweats.  I managed to get the pain down again with tylenol and ibuprofen.  On Sunday I spiked a temp of 100.8 and was having flu like symptoms, like body aches and more chills.  I got the temp down but my heart rate remained elevated and I found it difficult to catch my breath.  This went on for hours. I eventually had to go to the ER, where my pulse eventually came down.  Nothing like this has ever happened before.  The ER staff could not explain what had happened to me.  At the time of writing this on Tuesday, 5 days after vaccine, I again had a lot of cold sweats this morning and there is still some tenderness in the lymph gland area near above the right side of my thyroid gland, but I am feeling better overall.

As of today 1/12/21 I am still experiencing symptoms even while using Benadryl allergy tablets by mouth and anti-itch cream applied to the injection site.

The symptoms sided over the last 12 hours of the 36 hours mentioned. A very light state of feeling tired persisted another 24 hrs as well as a slightly elevated temperature (1-1.5 degrees). I was positive for  Covid in March of 2019 for a total of 6 weeks. The first two weeks were the most intense. This felt like a scaled down version of those two weeks. I never required hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in March.

Symptoms after 2nd shot01/19/2021 - slight fatigue recovered after 24 hours.  4 days after 2nd shot - Developed cold sore on lower lip area. To my recollection, I have never had a cold sore before which is a bit concerning. I understand that I may contracted HSV-1 and not have know it as child. I am curious if somehow the COVID vaccine somehow compromised immune system to a degree that the HSV-1 is now active? May very well not classify as an &#34;adverse event,&#34; but since I haven&#39;t heard of any such issues I thought I should report.

BP first reading in left arm was 235/130 with a HR around 130. Second reading was 205/120 with HR in 120&#39;s about 4 min later.  I requested an ambulance due to the feeling of being very unwell and dizzy.  Trouble concentrating.    Ambulance ride was 190/112 ish EKG and BP monitoring at hospital.   No anaphalaxis diagnosed but unknown cause.   ER discharge after benadryl.    BP and HR would continue to cycle up and down for the next  18 hours.   Red spot formed about 2 inches away from where I was injected.      PCP and allergist thin it was an intravascular injection.

Around 1am I woke  up with SOB which continued thru the night, with off and on sleep. I woke back up at 5:45am, went to work with the SOB which lasted until 12N and resolved on its own.  Around 3-330pm I began to feel feverish and had chills and was told I was disoriented.  My temp was 100.5, HR 122 R 34 BP 170/100 O2-93%. I notified the DON of my feelings who advised me those were possible side effects of the vaccine and made me continue to work until I just couldnt take the feelings anymore and went to the ER.  I was there for about 2 hrs and my body began to calm down.  I took taken 100mg of Tylenol on my own just to help with the fever which did break shortly and I have been fine every since. I was positive for COVID 12/14.

                                                Basic headache and lethargy was expected and did occur. However I&#39;ve had Lichen Planus for maybe 10 years. At date of vaccination I hadn&#39;t had a flare up or irritation in at least 2 years. Day after vaccination, and now day 3 after I&#39;ve had a large flare up of my lichen planus. My Leg (calf) and penis (glans) very itchy and obviously broken out. I can&#39;t be only assume it&#39;s vaccine related.

                                                Day after the vaccine I awoke with a very sore left arm which was to be expected.  Upon moving I experienced vertigo, dizziness, headache, and extreme pressure in the left side of my face to include sinus cavities and deep inner ear pressure.  I had some episodes of loose stools, not diarrhea, but not formed stools.  These symptoms still persist to today, 1/15/2021, except for loose stool, that has returned to normal.  I had a Dr. appointment today and the doctor would not rule out post vaccine side effects. I was tested for COVID on 1/11/2021 as a precautionary measure as I was displaying symptoms, but the test result was COVID not detected.

                                                The first day I was fatigued and achey for a few hours and wanted to go to sleep very early.  The following two days my arm was sore at the injection site but that went away in a couple days.  3 days post vaccination, my right axilla and median and ulnar nerves were extremely sensitive for 3 days but that subsided.  6 days post vaccine I started to get extreme fatigued, low energy and feel like my nerves were hot.  I got a covid test which was negative because I was not feeling well.  Then 9 days post vaccine I started to feel very fatigued, achey, and I couldn?t sleep well and like my nerves were burning up all over my body.  I had to call out of work due to brain fog, fatigue, nerve heat, difficulty concentrating.  I took my temperature during all this and it was 97.7.  My hands felt very hot and I could wash them under warm water because the water felt way too hot.

Slept on a heated throw  pad and that soothed the muscle aches. took Ibuprofen.

As time went on the are immediately at injection site got red and inflamed. By Thursday the redness transversed the width of my arm. Friday a large red ring began to go around injection site and the center began to be less red and then appeared blanched.  The Ring was maybe 4&#34; x 8&#34; which got more inflamed through Saturday. By Sunday the ring was still there, but less inflamed.  I did not take any medication except Tylenol starting on Thursday at 10:00 AM as I developed 102.8 fever until Friday morning.  I did experience Headache and chills, but I considered that minor compared to my arm and the local reaction that occurred. I did not go  to Doctor, but rather waited to inform medical staff at my employer, as I am a healthcare worker.

                                                On the day of the vaccination, I only had a little sore arm. But when I woke up the next day, around 4:30 am, I had a fever. I felt very cold and tried to sleep, but I could not fall asleep because of body aches and fever. So, I tried to get up and sit, but I could not and had to go back to bed with the pains and lethargy. I lied on the bed until around 8 am and realized that my fever was high. I took the temperature with my digital thermometer. It showed 108.7F. I could not believe it and retook it on my ears; it still showed 108.6F. My headache was really bad. So, I took 500mg Tylenol. The fever did not go away completely, and I had to keep sleeping the whole day. In the evening, before I went to bed, I took another 500 mg Tylenol and slept. I could not sleep well with the body aches. The next morning I still had 103F temp that slowly waned by the evening that day. Now I am feeling okay but have been struggling with a sleep problem.

The big change from dose 1 to 2 is muscle twitching.  The twitches coincide with the more extreme joint aches.  Sore arm  All started about 9 hours after vaccine. Sore arm was mitigated with movement and stretching (as compared to the first dose). Other symptoms have lessened since 7am (19 hours after shot), but linger.  Ibuprofen seems to lessen, but not end eymptoms.

Waves of dizziness come and go. Had a low grade fever the day after which subsided but the dizziness in my brain will not go away.  I haven&#39;t been checkout out yet bc I keep thinking it will go away but it won&#39;t.

                                                My brother has epilepsy. His seizures can be triggered by low grade fever and exhaustion. He had covid in early October. His seizures are generally well controlled but he had several after the vaccine. I understand that the vaccine did not cause the seizures. The fever caused the seizure. I just think it?s important to neurologists to have this info to see how we can go about mitigating the seizures and if the 2nd dose is necessary. Keeping him hydrated may have helped and also giving him something immediately for the low grade fever. Just knowing these things may help others.

                                                Around 60 seconds after injection my left arm became heavy and tingly/numb, this then occurred in my right thumb as well.  I had a heavy sensation on my chest and my heart rate increased rapidly to over 120.  This would then resolve slowly and then the tachycardia would recur with the odd sensation over my whole body every ten-15 minutes.  EMS was called to take vitals and monitor me.  Very odd feeling.  I was monitored over the course of 2 hours and when I finally stood up my legs felt heavy and weak as well.  After going home and resting things seemed to resolve and I was even able to go out to dinner that evening.  The following week I didn&#39;t notice much of anything but new symptoms arose around 6 days later on Friday.  I would feel strange feeling in my legs and a heaviness.  I had a strange dizziness but not vertigo.  I felt like I was in slow motion at times.  This worsened and I had weakness/fatigue that reached its peak on 1/20/21 and 1/21/21.  I was unable to operate on Wednesday as an orthopedic surgeon and had to cancel cases due to this weakness.  I saw my doctor that day and had a battery of tests run.  CMP, TSH, T4, T3, COVID, COVID IgG, Epstein Barr, Brain MRI, Neruo Consult, ANA, CK, Flu A/B, Vit B12 level, ESR, CRP, Vit D level, EKG, CXR.  The following day when I awoke in the morning I felt extremely lethargic and had to cancel clinic.  Over the following weeks things have gradually improved but I occasionally get some dizzy/lightheaded moments.

He didn&#39;t sleep well, and this morning his sleep app indicated his heart rate during the night was between 100-110.  After noticing his heart rate was between 130-140, he called the clinic and was told to go to the ER.  Hospital ER administered several tests and did blood work. The MD&#39;s determined his heart was fine and it is likely vaccine related.  He is home again and is feeling better (no chills, etc.) and his resting heart rate is now in the low-90&#39;s.

Monday my tongue and half of head was sensitive and weird, it kind of hurt to rub through my hair and tongue felt like pins and needles this lasted through Thursday, and that morning woke up wit a lump behind my ear, I went to clinic, the doctor or PA diagnosed me with shingles, but I don&#39;t have any sores, he gave me a prescription but the next morning I woke up and notice i lost facial control on left side, could blink or close mouth on left side. I went to clinic and they diagnosed me with  Bells Palsy and gave me a prescription for steroids and that was last Friday and its been a week that I&#39;ve been on these meds. The main problem is the Bells Palsy has made my left side not work, dizziness,  pain down my neck, the lump behind my ear finally went away after a week but the paralysis on the left side of my face is still there and the dizziness. I was having headaches but stayed on top of it with Advil and today I go back to clinic for a follow up appointment.

                                                At 2 am on 1/1/21, sudden onset severe left calf muscular cramping which resolved in about a minute.  Soreness persisted for 4 days. No preceding activity peformed to have caused this. Same evening, insomnia, uncomfortable abdominal bloating, vivid dreams, and ?light? night sweats primarily affecting lower extremities. This also lasted for about 4-5 days. On 1/6/21, 7 days post injection, woke up in morning completely drenched from a night sweat. Things improved in days to come although a certain subtle feeling of hyperalertness has persisted.    On Tuesday 1/12, began with a mild to moderate bifrontal headache. Fortunately, I do not typically get headaches. Tylenol and sleep relieved but headache returned on Wednesday evening and persisted through late afternoon Friday 1/15 possibly lateralizing slightly to the right. Saturday morning 1/16, no headache, but sudden onset of focal right lower neck tenderness situated around the thyroid/sternocleidomastoid region. No throat pain, sneezing, coughing. This progressively got worse throughout the day and particularly at night(8-9/10 pain scale) with discomfort on swallowing and with radiation to right subdmandibular region and right ear. Some temperature imbalance overnight and last few nights with slight night sweats. Not feeling feverish.   Neck pain has persisted since then to today 1/20/21 and steadily improved. 2 separate Ibuprofen doses have appeared to help.   ENT to be seen today.

                                                Severe Headache within 1 hour of vaccination (01/20/21 @1330hours), followed by a slight fever within 6 hours and fatigue. Overnight, I experienced severe chills and body aches, and severe fatigue, which followed the rest of the morning (01/21/21) with general discomfort. By that early afternoon the chills subsided, and I continued to feel body aches with minimal joint pain. By 4 pm, I began to develop an itchy rash on my left wrist under my wristwatch, left hand and on my right forearm. I experience fatigue throughout the rest of the day. I used over the counter Benadryl Extra Strength Itch Stopping Cream to alleviate the itch.  On the Morning of 01/22/23, I woke up to a itchy rash over my torso and my hands. I continued to apply the cream and I took an OTC Benadryl allergy pill, which seems to subside the rash.  On 01/23/21, I woke up the the same  rash over my feet and overall, the rash over my torso and hands had substantially subsided.

                                                10 minutes after vaccination, I was waiting in my car per instructions and began to feel extremely light headed and dizzy/faint.  I began to sweat a little and have minor tachycardia.  I never went back into the clinic but instead leaned the seat of my car back and those symptoms went away after about 30 minutes.  I never experienced any symptoms after that.

                                                After the first day there was the typical site injection pain. Three Tylenol on the next day seem to take care of that but the pain quickly moved to the Front and top of the right pelvic bone. No amount of Tylenol has seem to do anything with that pain. After a week it seem to start to migrate to the left front top pelvic bone. These symptoms were mild and I was still able to carry out my daily activities in law-enforcement.  Friday night January 22 is when I started to have pulsating pressure in the back of my head, chills, dizziness, excessive urination, diarrhea, and extreme fatigue. The symptoms have persisted through today but are starting to ease. I took a COVID-19 test on Sunday, January 24 the results came back today as Covid negative.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided.  Concomitant medication included escitalopram.  On 04 Feb 2021, on the same day as the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 030L20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 04 Feb 2021, a couple of hours after the vaccination, the patient couldn&#39;t feel his arm and he had no range in motion.  He also had pain in his upper shoulder area by his neck.  The reporter thought the administration was done incorrectly but she &#34;wasn&#39;t there to conform 100%.&#34;  At night on 04 Feb 2021 and 05 Feb 2021, the patient had aching in his legs &#34;as if he was getting sick.&#34;  Treatment for the events included ibuprofen which helped, and the patient was feeling better at the time of this report.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, couldn&#39;t feel arm and had no range in motion, pain in upper shoulder area by the neck, and aching in legs as if was getting sick, were considered recovering/resolving at the time of this report.  The event, thinks administration was done incorrectly, was considered recovered/resolved on 04 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 44-year-old male who experienced NS unexpected events of hypoaesthesia, joint range of motion decreased, arthralgia, neck pain, product administration error, malaise, and NS expected arthralgia.  The events occurred 1 day after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Events resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-012275: US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-012263:

During this time, I also became nauseated and puked several times. after these events, I had a severe headache for most of the following day and a very sore arm.

Fell asleep and woke up soaking wet. Next day I still had a fever. Had chills and my body got warm. This went off and on throughout the day. I was exhausted. At night I had a bloody nose. Went to bed and woke up wet again but not as bad as the first night. Morning time I felt fine. Went to the gym and the sauna. Started to exercise and felt lighted headed and cloudy. Went home laid down. I still feel weird on and off.  Went to the bathroom and had black stool. My right arm is still sore.

The patient&#39;s medical history included type 1 diabetes. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30 Dec 2020, the evening after vaccine administration, the patient experienced chills and tiredness.  On 31 Dec 2020 the patient woke up with his face numb and a little paralyzed. At the time of reporting, the patient mentioned that the numbness and paralysis on his face had been like that for various days and was still ongoing. Treatment for the event was not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, chills and tiredness, was unknown. The outcome of the events, part of face numb and part of face a little paralyzed, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 45 year old male patient with medical history of type I diabetes, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Facial paralysis, a NS unexpected event of Hypoaesthesia, and NS expected events of Chills and Fatigue. The events of Chills and Fatigue occurred on the same day when the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273. The events of Facial paralysis and Hypoaesthesia occurred the next day of administration of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                At 12:30  i was lying in bed and started getting more and more restless.  I could feel something happening with my body on the inside like a storm.  I got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode about halfway to bathroom. Fell and i came to immediately when my name was called.  I got back into bed.  My lips were white.  I still felt lightheaded but could breathe freely and easily.  There was no noticeable swelling impairing my breathing.  Initially i could not get a reading on my pulse oximeter.  After a few minutes it worked and by then i was at 95%. I suspect the oxygen was quite low prior to that.  For the next day i had a fever and farigue.  The day after that I had some lingering fatigue but no fever.  Right now I am not planning to get the second shot in the series.

                                                I didn&#39;t have any adverse affects until 5 days after I received the vaccination. Early in the afternoon on Wednesday 1/20 I noticed that my lymph nodes in the armpit of my left arm and on the left side of my neck were swollen and sore. This worsened as the day went on. I also noticed a pimple had formed and came to a head in the exact spot of where the needle stick had been. It &#34;popped&#34; that day and a small amount material came out. My lymph nodes have remained sore and swollen since 1/20. On the 7th day after (1/22) I noticed a couple of smaller, dime sized red blotches/rash on my left shoulder and left side of my neck. I also noticed that the injection site on my left shoulder was sore, swollen and hot to touch. On the 8th day (1/23) I noticed that there were more of these dime sized red blotches/rash across both shoulders, my back and a small area in the center of my chest.  It continues to be like that as of today (1/25). On the 9th day, (1/24) starting just after noon, I began to feel poorly. Achy and just generally not very good. I had a few bouts of diarrhea throughout the afternoon. I also had a pretty strong headache when I awoke on the morning of the 24th. Today, (1/25) I awoke again with a headache although it was not as sore as yesterday. I don&#39;t feel great today, but I do feel better than I did yesterday. The rash looks the same and my lymph nodes seem to be slightly less swollen and less sore.

Then severe rash over torso, arms, buttocks, thighs, and back consistent with what I experienced during Lyme Disease this past summer.  Raised itchy rash in large red blotches over most of body.  I didn&#39;t realize it at the time but the same (but less severe) reaction took place after the first Moderna Vaccine shot as well.  I was prescribed Doxycycline by my local Urgent Care and stayed on it for 14 days following the first dose of Moderna.  I didn&#39;t put the two things together immediately because I has gone hunting in the woods and assumed that I was bitten by another tick.  Full body rash is what caused me to go seek attention at the Urgent Care.  The symptoms following the second dose were much more severe and uncomfortable.  The rash subsided in 4-5 days without medication.

I then began feeling a severe pain in my left arm at the exact site of the injection that came and went depending on movement of my arm. It felt like a torn muscle. Now, 3 weeks after my final shot, the arm pain is still present and at times feels like it&#39;s worsening. It&#39;s at its most severe when reaching for something.

                                                Took vaccine in left arm late afternoon on Friday 2/12/21. The initial symptoms were only very painful muscle pain on the injected arm, and some mild body ache and mild chills for 2-3 days but nothing major. On Monday 2/15/21 was feeling very well and had nice workout in the morning , feeling energetic .  However, in the morning on Tuesday 2/16/21, I started having very strong abdominal cramps, feeling bloated, nausea, that was lasting for several hours and increasing in pain . After 5 hours of pain, I asked my wife to take me to Hospital. There I was diagnosed with Appendicitis after a Cat Scan. My appendix was inflamed and I had to go thru surgery that same day .

                                                Headache, nausea, dizziness when sleeping or laying down, or sudden movement.  Feels like everything is spinning around me. This happens few time while I was sleeping , it woke me from sleep. I used to get out the bed as I soon as eyes open but not anymore. Now when I wake up in the I spend few minutes inn the bed because if I put my feet on the floor quickly I feel like I am going to fall.  I am afraid to pickup my 2 year old daughter anymore I feel like I can drop her if I get dizzy.

                                                I developed tinnitus in my ears about 3 to 4 hours after vaccine. I normally don&#39;t get this. Rarely after a concert or game but short lived. This has stuck around and I kept waiting for it to disappear. Unfortunately it has not. My right ear is worse than my left but the tinnitus remains so I thought I should report it. I have been looking on-line for any other reports and see none. This may be coincidence but due to lack of resolution of tinnitus, I thought I should report it. My flu-like symptoms (headache, shaking chills, sore arm) disappeared within 36 hours.

                                                I began to have a fever 18 hours after receiving the vaccine. Then when I woke up approximately 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt severe sinus pressure, headache, light sensitivity, body aches, slight nausea, continued fever cycling, and lethargy. These symptoms began to resolve 24 hours after they started. These were the exact same symptoms that I experienced when I had Covid-19.

                                                Note:  I had a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in March, 2020.  Approximately 12 hours after the second vaccine dose, I experienced intense soreness at the vaccination site (significantly greater than the first dose).  In the middle of the night I awoke with flu-like symptoms.  At 9am I took acetominophen  for fever, rigors, muscle aches.  This brought mild relief from approx. 9:45am to 11:15 am.  My condition continued to worsen through the early afternoon with rigors and significant generalized muscle aches.  I experienced tachycardia (90-105 bpm vs normal of ~70bpm),  SOB,  and starting measuring pulse oximetry which read from 89%-94% (my usual does not go below 97%).  This persisted until approximately 8pm with no improvement.  I took 40 mg prednisone, 600 mg ibuprofen and within 3 hours was starting to have symptom resolution. I am a physician and up to date on all my vaccinations.  I have never had anything approaching this type of response.  I don&#39;t know if prior SARS-CoV-2 infection  creates a situation were the very potent mRNA vaccine triggers a large immunologic recall response.  I wanted to get this noted as there may be some reason to alter the vaccine schedule for prior SARS-CoV-2 infections

                                                After 5 mins of getting the 1st shot I felt an allergic reaction little bit hard to breathe and hot flash.  I told the pharmacist and was advised to stay an extra 10 minutes.  I left the Pharmacy and proceeded to the store and then home.  Over the next 1.5 days I felt a sort of brain fog, my arm puffed up red about the size of a half dollar.  The brain fog went away and then for the next 2-3 days  my body felt like I was coming down with a cold.  I seemed to feel better after that initial period until 3/24 when while driving a hot flash came over me and the next day I was again in a type of brain fog.  For the next two days I tried to just deal with the brain fog but started to notice on the right side of my neck a feeling of constriction, with abnormally high blood pressure.  I went to the hospital ER and the completed a CAT scan of my brain and neck, blood work and urine work up with no evidence of why my neck was feeling constricted and high blood pressure.  The symptoms continued and on 4/1 my blood pressure  spike to 168/93 and I again went back to the hospital ER and spent the night.  I was having heart palpitations, anxiety and very high blood pressure.  The hospital this time completed more bloodwork, MRI of my brain and neck and an Eco-cardiogram.  I am now on 3 blood pressure and heart medications and have no diagnoses of why my blood pressure and heart rate are so abnormal.  I am very healthy and exercise daily and have never encountered this and my BP has always been extremely good.

Then within 20-30 seconds I realized that my chest was heavy/pressure on my sternum, arms and torso went warm and sweaty, a bit light headed and had fast heart rate. I asked medical team for assistance. They took blood pressure/O2 levels and listen to my heart and lungs. Had epi pen ready, but never administered. Watched me like this for about hour and a half until my bp came back down to normal levels.

                                                I received the first Moderna shot at approximately 4:30pm on 12/23/2020. Around 9:30pm that evening, I began to feel fatigued and had a slight headache. I went to bed around10:15-10:30pm. Shortly after going to bed, my headache  worsened and I began having chills. I was a bit restless that night and just did not feel well. These symptoms lasted until about 8am the following morning, 12/24/2020. I was still fatigued and still had a headache, which had lessened in intensity. I no longer had chills. The fatigue wore off throughout the day, but I still had a slight headache. Later in the evening I again became fatigued and still had a slight headache. The following day, my headache subsided, and I was only tired once evening came around. My symptoms had completely dissipated by 12/26/2020.

About 30 minutes after the vaccine I developed ipsilateral facial numbness which lasted about 24 hours.  I would like guidance on whether to proceed with the second dose.

These feelings lasted until 10pm on 1/16/21, and then I went to bed and felt better in the morning.  I was barely able to get out of bed that day (1/16) because of how sick I felt.  Besides the sick feeling,  I had bad pain at the injection site, and had a 3cm x 3cm raised red lump at the injection site.  This stayed painful for 48-60 hours, then the swelling subsided and was left with a bruise.

                                                Good morning, I received my 2nd shot yesterday at approximately 9:15a.  I had no issues during the observation period.  Last night at approximately 9:45p I started to feel as if I was catching a fever due to my joints aching and bland taste in my mouth.  At approximately 10:15p I started to shiver, had a headache and had tightness in the lower left side of my back.  So I took my temperature and I had a low grade fever 99.7.  At the point I went and had a hot shower.  After that I laid on the heating pad for 30 minutes and my back tightness subsided.  I stopped shivering at roughly 11:15p but continued to have a headache and aching joints.  My temperature right now is 100.3, joints are still aching but not as bad as last night, headache and chills.  Is there anything that I can take, Advil etc?  Also, I forgot to mention the arm soreness as well but I had that on the 1st shot as well.

                                                Flu like symptoms- started with fatigue, then chills slightly elevated. Temp, nausea, joint pain, aches, not much of an appetite but still ate.  Tylenol and Benadryl took care of it fairly well.  Had arm pain at site of injection, like I was hit in arm with a baseball bat.  Had some gerd too but not sure if related. Tiredness started around 9 hours after the shot, but symptoms really kicked in about 12 hours after administration.  Lasted till about 46 hours after administration, at which time I woke up from overnight sleep feeling great.  Arm still sore and there might be some lingering joint pain but nothing to keep me from doing anything.

                                                Since receiving Moderna shot #1 vaccine I have experienced three gout attacks. It is unusual for me to have this many gout attacks in such a short time period. Additionally, physical activity has been very challenging since receiving the shot.  I fatigue and become short of breath very quickly. During the first workout that I did, on 02/01/2021, after receiving the shot I became extremely dizzy, my eyes became light sensitive and my hands trembled; symptoms lasted for approximately 45 minutes.

Since that time I have had a slight &#34;pressure&#34; headache almost continuously.  Today is 2/24/21, more than 6 weeks after the first shot and the symptoms have only slightly subsided. I have decided to forego the second shot until the symptoms completely disappear. I have not sought any medical care because the symptoms are not severe enough and I am hoping they will subside by themselves. If they continue for a long period I will seek medical care but my guess is there will not be a lot that can be done.

                                                About 3-5 minutes after getting the vaccine began experiencing a light headedness feeling. Took my blood pressure and it was a little high (140/95), I attributed this to anxiety but got home and my BP at home was down to about 120/76 about 1 hr. after. I laid down to sleep it off but could not sleep as about 1 hr. after trying to go to sleep I started to get a headache. After about 2 hours of battling it I decided to take a Extra Strength Tylenol which helped with the headache about 2 hrs later is was almost gone but the feeling of lightheadedness/dizziness was still there a bit worse than at the beginning. I slept it off and the next morning it was about 50 % better and by about noon it seemed to be 99% better. Today is Thursday ( on my 3rd day) and still feel a slight dizziness but I also have seasonal allergies which sometimes give me the same symptoms. I expect to be better soon.

                                                On 2/23/21, about 12 days after the vaccine was received, I felt chest pains in the late afternoon.  At midnight, I woke up with uncontrollable chills and shakes, with a low-grade fever that hovered in the 99.5 -100  range.    I attempted to get up and struggled to breathe,; it was as if my abdominal and lower back muscles were seizing.  I had to crawl to a kneeling position to urinate.  I took several Tylenol then went back to lie down; after a few hours, the fever subsided, and I was able to briefly fall back asleep.  At 4:00 a.m. the fever and major chills subsided, with no fevers reported since then, and only occasional chills.  However, the muscle fatigue, pain and stiffness have become frighteningly debilitating.  On Wednesday - Friday, the three days after I first experienced symptoms, each day it took me between 1.5 - 2 hours  to get out of bed and finally get to a standing position.    During the day on each day following my first symptoms, I have been able to gradually walk around, go up and down stairs, use the bathroom, and perform basic tasks.    However, when the evening comes, it is a different story.  12 midnight - 10 a.m. are the worst hours, as any extended period lying down results in my muscles seizing, freezing and stiffening up.  After falling asleep for an hour, it takes 10-20 minutes to mobilize enough (using a crutch and assistance) to get to the bathroom.  After falling asleep for 2-3 hours, it takes 30-40 minutes to do the same.  And, if I fall asleep for 3&#43; hours (which is about as long as I&#39;ve been able to sleep since the adverse reactions began), it will take 1.5 - 2 hours to get completely mobile.  This is when I finally wake for the day, and it takes about 10 minutes to raise my head and turn my torso, then another 10-15 minutes to get my legs off the bed and assume a crouching position, then 30-60 minutes to stand on my own.

                                                Night of 2nd vaccine woke up with a high fever, and severe headache. Fever lasted 36 hours and peaked at 104.8 (with Tylenol).  Fever was over 103 degrees for majority of 24 hour period. Fever went away after 36 hours.  However, headaches have continued constantly (17 days and counting).    Went to the Dr. on 2/19/21.  They wanted an CT Scan of head and sinuses.  Dr. Prescribed cefuroxime 250 MG tablet in case of sinus infection and ibuprofen 800 MG tablets.  Insurance did not approve a STAT CT Scan, so Dr. told me to go to the ER if headache persisted.  Went to the ER on  2/23/21.  Dr&#39;s indicated Blood pressure was very high (180/120).  I do not have a history of high blood pressure.  They did a CT scan (normal) EKG (normal), and blood work.  They inserted an IV with migraine cocktail to alleviate headache.  Unfortunately no change.  While in the ER they gave me:  - Sodium Chloride - Tylenol - Metoclopramide (injection) - DiphenhydrAMINE (Benedryl) (injection) - Dexamethsone  - Ketorolac (Toradol)  They prescribed methylprednisolone (steroid).  Went back to primary doctor on 2/25.  Blood pressure remains high (average 158/112 throughout the day), headaches continue (constant).  They did more blood work, urine sample, and another EKG.   They also ordered a STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM.  The prescribed lisinopril 10 MG tablet for blood pressure.

Concerned, sweating,  Bp was very high at that point. Don&#39;t have the exact number. Called for ambulance, paramedics ruled out WPW and gave me iv drug that brought rate down to 120 fairly quickly, Over the next hours resting rate slowly normalized to around 80 (normal for me is 72).  For 2-3 days afterwards had some high resting pulses up to 118 but never as bad and normalized in a few days.

I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

                                                Initially, I felt fatigued and my left deltoid was sore. On day three after vaccination, I had one episode of hematuria. On day 4, I developed a fever and chills. On day 5, I developed dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency and hesitancy. I have also had some low back pain and purulent urine. I have never had any urinary or prostate issues in the past and have regular annual physical exams. I am an emergency physician and had to work, so I started myself on Bactrim DS (I am avoiding floroquinolones due to numerous black box warnings). I have had several other episodes of hematuria during my treatment. I am on day 13 of Bactrim and my symptoms are improving. I am not sure if this is a coincidence, but I have never had any similar issues and thought this should be reported.

However, suddenly 7 days after the injection, there was significant swelling ( 8cm) and pain at the injection site associated with a little feverish feeling. Lasted about a couple of days and subsided. Bringing it to agency&#39;s attention as there was none immediately after the injection, but something a week later on.

Nest day woke up with severe pain in left arm from below the site of injection (upper triceps) region down to the elbow , got severe enough to not be able straighten my arm fully without major discomfort.  Took Advil 800 mg , that made it better but not completely. By evening time felt like i was tired and like what i feel like when i am about to get a cold.   Next day was not tired , feeling of getting sick was no longer there and pain got slightly better by midday.   Next day after that woke up with slight swelling in the site and the arm was red and was warm to touch.  That continued for 2 days and gradually got less red and swollen and started to itch.  Took almost a week for the itch to completely subside.

                                                Within 6-8 h after receiving the vaccine, I noticed progressive pain on my left shoulder and upper arm.  I could not sleep on my left side. At 22 h after the vaccine I could not abduct my arm due to the local pain, became prostrated (had to lay down all day), lost appetite (only ate 2 cookies all day) and became very fatigued (went to sleep at night at 7 pm instead of my 10 pm regular sleeping time). I measured my temperature twice and it was 37.5 C. I didn&#39;t take antiinflammatory nor analgesic medicine.  At 48 h after the vaccine, I was already 80% better, and at 72 h  has back to normal. I had short-lived (2-3 days) COVID-19 symptoms in March 2020 (anosmia, diarrhea, anorexia) and high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG in May and October (I did the latter was part of an experiment to evaluate the duration of antibody persistence. I am fully vaccinated and this was by far my most severe vaccinal reaction.

The headaches have been intermittent continuing on till the date of this report (02/04/21).  The patient has been taking acetaminophen with relieve.  On approximately 02/01, it was noted by coworkers that the patient&#39;s right side of the face would not move when he would talk.  Around the same time, the patients right eye became watery and the patient&#39;s wife stated she noted some gurgling.  Due to the onset of these new symptoms, the patient went to see the doctor on 02/04/21.  Per the patient&#39;s wife, the doctor diagnosed the patient with a very mild form of Bell&#39;s Palsy and prescribed steroids to the patient.  The name of the steroid was not disclosed.

                                                Starting the next day, I had an increased sensitivity to motion sickness.  This is unusual as I am a paramedic and work in an ambulance for a living.  I also suffered 2 nights of insomnia.  On the evening of the third day, I developed joint aches, fatigue, and a series of normal bowel movements (five in 2 hours). The next morning I added a lost of balance and a slight right side facial droop around my eye (no numbness). Later that day I developed nausea and vomiting, a single period of cold chills followed by a period of a hot flash.  However, I never developed a fever.  By day five, all of my symptoms resolved with the balance issue being the last.  Also of note, early on, my blood sugar was elevated, blood pressure was elevated, and pulse elevated.

Later in the day, body and joint aches started. 12 hours after dose, started to get very cold and this turned into violent and uncontrollable shaking from chills. Then headache started 13 hours after dose (the headache lasted for 2 days and was the last symptom to go). Fever fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1. Later felt very nauseous, felt like I had to vomit but didn?t. Went to the bathroom and there I got dizzy and almost passed out but didn?t.  Fever up and down all day the next day. Could only eat a little Campbell?s chicken noodle soup and a small can of coke. By the next evening (day 2) I started to feel better just exhausted and a headache. Went to sleep early, next day (day 3) still had the headache and was exhausted. By Day 4 I was about 80 % back to normal and feeling much better.  I didn?t take any fever reducers or other medications during this time.  It was all worth it to be vaccinated,

At first he said he felt uneasy and he then later described feeling &#34;like he was tripping&#34;.   He later started feeling confused.  He went to bed around 11p.m. and woke up feeling very tired and achy but was also having a lot of trouble concentrating.  Later in the evening he was acting very confused and he didn&#39;t look well at all.  He was having difficulty verbalizing and conveying his thoughts, he couldn&#39;t remember words and at one point he actually called me &#34;mom&#34;.  I am concerned.  He said he would contact the hotline for adverse reactions on 2/26 if he still felt the same, but I felt it was important to report it either way.  He has never behaved this way before and has no medical history of any sort of memory or mental issues.

While I do report my daily progress on V-SAFE it does not allow for detailed reporting and it does not have a radio button for hot flashes that WILL NOT GO AWAY.    Approx 30-60 min after the vaccine I did get a headache which has continued (still have it).  I did get dizziness and fatigue which has somewhat subsisted and has gotten better (comes and goes) but the headache remains and now I have hot flashes that came out of nowhere last night.  It continues with the headache.    Nothing has changed from my routine nor have I been around anyone new or traveled recently.

                                                Patient got his Covid vaccine this past Thursday, 2 days ago.  He experienced typical side effects of a sore left shoulder and some fatigue but was feeling well until this afternoon around 1:55 PM when he noticed throbbing of his left hand.  He looked down and noticed that there was a purple discoloration to his middle finger and distal palmar aspect of his hand.  He felt like there was maybe some swelling as well and that he might have been having an allergic reaction so called the emergency department for further advice and came in for evaluation.  By the time I arrived to the emergency department the patient&#39;s left hand was no longer swollen and there was only a small purple discoloration to the palmar proximal middle finger.  I was concerned that the patient developed a small blood clot that was resolved upon evaluation.

The morning of January 12, 2021 I woke with severe muscle and joint pain, headache, extreme fatigue.  As the day progressed I developed chills to the point I could not get warm.  I also developed a low grade fever.  After taking two ibuprofen around 3p the pain subsided to an ache about my entire body by 9p, headache had subsided and I had no more chills or fever.  On the morning of January 13, 2021 I woke with a red rash going up the inside of both arms and around the outside of my upper arms and down my entire back.  As the day has progressed that rash has spread down the back of legs as well.  I did take one Benadryl with minimal effect.

                                                On Tuesday, January 12, 2021 the day after I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine I woke with severa muscle and joint pain, headache, pain at injection site unable to lift arm above head.  As day progress I was extremely fatigued and began to get chills to the point I could not get warm.  I left work and went home and had to put on three layers of clothes and a blanket to try and stay warm.  The pain was extreme, still had a headache and a low grade fever.  I took two ibuprofen and by 9p that evening the headache had subsided as did the fever and chills.  Pain was more aches than pain at this point.  This morning, January 13, 2021 the aches remain with some fatigue but also a red rash up the inside of both arms, wrapping around the outside of the upper arms down my entire back, buttocks and the back of my legs below my calves on the lower legs.

Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia without fever was made, patient started azithromycin on 1/5 and albuterol treatments every 4-6 hrs. Initially he improved, but then worsened.  chest xray on 1/6 was negative for pneumonia, PCR covid test was negative, albuterol treatment did not bring much relief. He started respiratory distress on 1/10 and was taken by car to the local ER where another covid test was negative and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. The leg US revealed blood clots in both of his legs. He had an emergency catheter-delivered thrombolysis and was discharged home from the ICU on 1/12 on oral anticoagulants. He is gradually improving, but very weak. He tires easily and gets a drop in oxygen to 90- 93%, as well as an increase in the heart rate to 120  when walking less than half a mile. He runs out of breath with exertion.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after the shot, I began to feel flu-like symptoms beginning with intestinal discomfort and incontinence. Shortly after, fever developed over 100 degrees F.  By &#43;9 hours, fever reached 102, and I became disoriented badly, to include loss of balance and some speech issues.  Went to bed, waking every 1-2 hours to drink 20-30 ounces of water.  Frequent urination throughout the next 48 hours.  Fever peaked at 103.7 at about 36 hours after shot. After 48 hours from shot time, fever was gone with fatigue remaining. Low-grade fever returned at 60 hours, and fluctated continuously ever since between 98.4 and 99.6.

The next day I was COVID tested it was negative. My symptoms continued  for several more days, I was thinking that this was a reaction because my arm still hurt and I was having fevers with a cough.

                                                Received Vaccine on Friday January 15th 2021 at approximately 0715am after my Isolation and having had no symptoms for over a week.  Received injection, was observed by our Physician staff for approximately 35 minutes with no adverse reactions noted at that time.  Approximately 30 hours later on Saturday my left arm began to hurt and a very very strong fatigue came over me and I took a 2 and a half hour nap on the couch.  I was still extremely fatigued upon waking, but my arm continued to hurt more and more up to the point it wasn&#39;t usable for anything heavy and/or strenuous at all, hurting just to use it for getting up from the couch.  I was assisted to get me things like water, food and stuff.  The arm pain began to radiate towards my left shoulder and eventually throughout the day the pain was spreading from my shoulder to include my left upper thorax and left rib cage.  By Sunday, what had begun as left arm pain had now become stronger an approximate 5/10 pain.  It started to present as atypical chest pain having the pain now fully encapsulated within my left upper chest.  Felt what appeared to feel like intercostal pain and a general ache all throughout.  By Monday the pain was still all throughout and assessed the situation from a cardiac standpoint and found that the pain was mostly positional and I wasn&#39;t exhibiting any cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath, no sub-sternal pain, no jaw pain, no back pain.  It hurt more as I would take a deep breath and began to move my left arm around and bringing it up from my side and did a stretch with my crooked elbow of my left arm I raised it to the ceiling and moved my thorax to my right side and found that this would make it hurt more, so I did some twisting of my thorax and abdomen and found that the pain would increase from movement, it was then that I began to think that it might be Pleuritic pain.  Tuesday the 19th and Wednesday the 20th I had to call in Sick because I developed a severe muscle ache below my left calf between my calf and left ankle, as if it was in constant spasm and it affected my walking, like a Charley Horse feeling and wondered if it were the same kind of feeling that I had in my chest and I found it quite odd that all my symptoms were on the left side which is the same side I received the vaccine because my right side didn&#39;t have any muscle aches.  The overall chest pain began to subside over the next couple of days, but the pleuritic pain that I described never decreased in intensity or pain level.  I saw my Personal Dr yesterday January 21st 2021 at approximately 5:15pm as he was walking out of his office and we discussed my symptoms and believing that my symptoms seemed to indicate some kind of tentative diagnosis of a pleurisy issue as he had agreed that there didn&#39;t seem to be any cardiac involvement and am scheduled to see him again tomorrow Saturday January 23rd at 4pm  As I write this the pain continues as before with no seeming end point and is not diminishing.  I had phoned and talked yesterday afternoon and felt it best to check with my primary physician because he hadn&#39;t had any reports such as mine.

                                                Sore area around injection site, irregular temperature, severe fatigue - fatigue lasted the equivalent of two days with the next full day after injection being the worst.  The day after the injection fatigue was debilitating requiring sleeping or resting for most of the day and night. Half way through the second day after the injection fatigue is still present though significantly improved. The Item 21 box for Doctor visit has been checked as I will meet with my primary care provider as soon as possible and have already discussed it with my employer&#39;s health department.

Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

The patient developed headache, lack of taste, fatigue as well as the aforementioned rash on 1/14/2021(6 days after receiving first dose of covid vaccine.  A rapid covid test was positive on 1/14/2021 also.  The patient was prescribed claritin, methylprednisolone for the rash after seeing his family physician virtually and the family physician recommended he contact where he was vaccinated to report these symptoms.  I have reached out to the patient for additional information and he has declined, so I do not have any access to details on his positive covid test or records from that virtual encounter.

                                                About 12 hours after vaccination, I started to have severe chills, fever, intense headache, body aches, inability to sleep and sweating.  This last 24 hours and then began to dissipate.  The headache left first.  These symptoms mirrored the symptoms I had with COVID minus the sinus drainage and sore throat I had with COVID.  Yet, the symptoms were more intense.  The reaction to the vaccine was the sickest I recall being in the last 20 years.  It was a long 24 hours. I went to the ER and obtained a liter of fluids via IV and motrin type medicine.  I was advised it should last about 24-36 hours and discharged.

                                                2/6/2021    The day after my second Moderna vaccine shot. Woke up at 0300 feeling like I got hit by a Mack truck. Total body aches, especially the injection site on the right shoulder, the left shoulder at the old injection site (mirror pain?, Psychosomatic?, Real?), headache, jaw ache, sensitivity to light, stiffness and soreness in all muscles and joints, lethargy, no stuffy nose or congestion, but surprisingly no nausea/vomiting, instead I was super hungry.  All day this persisted. I was hungry but could only eat half portions at most. Finally, after dinner, the body aches and headache had subsided. Still super tired, still painful at the injection site. I spent most of the day wearing sweatpants and sweatshirt with the hood up either on the couch or in bed with the covers up, and no sweating. Had some chills and a mild fever that came and went. At night, while wearing only my underwear, after being asleep for only an hour or two, I woke up to extreme sweating. The sheets were soaked and we had to change them. My wife said I was dripping sweat like I had just finished running for an hour. Took a shower and went back to bed in just my underwear. Had a couple more episodes when I thought I might start the extreme sweating so I flipped the covers off for a few minutes each time so I wouldn?t overheat. It did not feel like I was overheating under the covers ? just felt like I was about to start sweating again. Weird.  2/7/2021    The second day after the vaccine shot. Feeling much better, but still lethargic. Woke up late around 1030. Had brunch. Took a shower, got dressed and had to go back to bed because of the tiredness. No more chills or fever. By the late afternoon and evening I was feeling mostly back to normal. Had a full sized, normal dinner. Slept well, in my underwear, no sweating, and no chills. 2/8/2021    The third day after the vaccine shot. Woke up feeling totally normal. Got in a good 18 mile bike ride and felt fine.

                                                Given second shot on Wed 2/24 at 12pm -- Had flu like symptoms for one day.  Woke up on Sat 2/27 with sudden hearing loss in left ear. Hearing loss was accompanied by a loud static sound and pressure. Saw ENT specialist on Tue 3/2 -- no evidence of any wax buildup. She immediately sent me for hearing test; showed 70% loss. Both doctors feel this is a Viral infection and that it may have occurred due to my strong  immune response I had to the COVID vaccine. Was prescribed 60mg of Prednisone for two weeks; am on day 3 as of writing this. Am going to see another specialist tomorrow, 3/5/21. I am a healthy 50yr old male with no previous hearing problems. The only change in my life was getting the vaccine. I think this important to report, although I have yet to find any link between vaccine and SSHL. I have been tested over the last year a few times (mouth swab) and all test were negative. I have not been tested since my hearing loss, though I don&#39;t feel sick at all. I have read that some people who actually had COVID experienced new or increased tinnitus but did not find anyone who had actual hearing loss -- this was just doing some online reading; not actual study reports.

On second night after receiving the vaccine, I had severe headaches and alternating chills/sweats.   72hrs after the vaccine,  pain continues, although it has subsided to the point where almost full motion is possible.  Periodic severe headaches continue, although these existed before receiving the vaccine and are linked to positive COVID in Nov 2020.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Heart valve operation. Concomitant products included WARFARIN SODIUM (COUMADIN) for an unknown indication.   On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 15-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache). The patient was hospitalized from 10-Apr-2021 to 12-Apr-2021 due to CONFUSIONAL STATE, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT, THROMBOSIS and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. At the time of the report, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall), FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache) had not resolved and CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 10-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 10-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low. On 10-Apr-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 15-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low.         It was reported that the patient still has difficulty with memory recall, brain fog, headache, and still having trouble with low INR. The patient did not have any side effects after the first dose. Treatment for the events included Levonox injections and Coumadin (increased dose).  Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the product known safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Goiter lasted for approximately 8 days and then began to improve on its own.  Consulted with my endocrinologist, who felt that it might be a transient thyroiditis due to having had the immunization

                                                I awoke the next morning with chills, fever, headache, nausea, dizziness, and extreme fatigue. The fever broke after about 5 hours with 800mg of ibuprofen and 1000mg of acetaminophen. The nausea subsided somewhat with 8mg of Zofran sublingual. The headache resolved about 01:00am on 01/10/2021. The dizziness and fatigue resolved significantly by 04:00am on 01/10/2021. Mild fatigue continued for another 24 or so hours, but seemed mostly resolved by 01/11/2021 and may have been exacerbated by my overnight (7p-7a) shifts.

Felt ok until approximately 0900 hours on 01-15-21 when I felt my heart racing and felt hot.  Upon EMS arrival I was advised I was sinus tacky and my sugar was 157.  Was taken to the hospital where I has a 102.5 fever.  Remained in the ER until fever broke and was released at approximately 1800 hours.  Off and on fever and rapid heart rate continued at home on 01-16-21.

                                                Had a continuous headache the entire weekend which would not go away (12/24-12/28) When I came back to work on 12/29 My headache got a little worse (fluorescent lights). When I sat at my computer and started to work my headache got worse and worse like a very bad migraine.  I went outside and the headache subsided.  When I went back to my desk my headache got worse again. I then tried to go to Urgent care but was refused because of possible Covid symptoms. I had to go to Covid Hot zone in our Emergency Room. They released me from work for 2-3 days.  When I came back to work my headache was much more milder and I could handle the slight pain..

Took a 2 hour nap but it did not help.  I do not think it is a hospital trip by any means. advice?

                                                Post shot developed the following within hours:  head congestion, dizziness, nausea, brain fogginess, phlegm in my heart, headache, inability to fully concentrate to typical ability, major soreness in arm receiving shot, soreness developed in arm that didn&#39;t receive the shot with intermittent shooting pain at opposite arm shot sight as if being stabbed with a knife.  Overnight and into the morning:  significant joint soreness across body, diarrhea, brain fogginess worsened, nausea continued, phlegm continued, headache continued, noticeable fatigue (tired walking up stairs or even just standing - I&#39;m in VERY good shape for my age and regularly exercise on my own.) These symptoms have continued over the several days post shot.  I&#39;m day five post shot and I&#39;m having difficulty staying focused, I&#39;m saying things inaccurately like names, I&#39;m still get tired standing and doing any activity for more than a few minutes, my headache persists.  My arm soreness has diminished and my joints pain has lessoned.  I&#39;m an extremely health conscious individual, food and water intake, exercise 6-7 times a week at a relatively intense level, rarely take over the counter medications and don&#39;t get sick often.  These events are a major abnormal in my life and in how I typically feel on a daily basis. I was required to receive this vaccination even thought I did not want it at this time, (due to lack of full FDA approval, it&#39;s EUA status, and little long term data).  I respectfully request any help as &#34;I don&#39;t feel right or like I normally do.&#34;  Thank you.

I checked my temperature and it was 101 and went up to 104. I took Tylenol every 4 hours but it would not come down, I took cold shower and it didn&#39;t come down Friday and Friday night all night. It would get down to 102 or 101 but it would come right back. Saturday all day fever, nausea, and headache.  No matter the medicine I took or when I took a cold shower it would not come down.  Everything continued until Sunday all day until Sunday night, I still took medicine but i couldn&#39;t control the fever. I did not want to go to hospital. Early morning hours of Sunday I started to perspire and the fever started to come down to 101 then 99.something.

Was monitored for another 30 minutes and my wife picked me up. Took tylenol when I got home. Checked blood sugar at home and blood sugar was down to 40. I hadn&#39;t eaten before the vaccine. I ate oatmeal and went to bed. After 2 hours, I no longer had symptoms. Returned to work 1/29/2021 without any further issues.

I forced myself to go to work.  I am a Registered Nurse.  The joint pain and aches increased throughout the day along with altered periods of chills and hot flashes.  Around 6 PM on the 29th is started feeling worse.   I felt like I was tachycardic.  I had my wife take my blood pressure.  My normal vitals are Pulse-50, BP 110/60.  When I took my vitals at 6:00 pm my pulse was 91 and my BP was 85/53.  Clearly an allergic reaction.  I had no difficulty breathing.  Finally, around 1:00 am on 1/30, my fever broke and my heart rate and BP returned to normal ranges.  My first vaccination was unremarkable with only a sore arm for three day.

                                                Narrative: Patient is a 49 year old man with past medical history of hypertension and kidney stones who presented with a chief complaint of word finding difficulties and slurred speech. Patient was last seen normal at 1230 pm on 1/21/2021. He got his covid vaccine and shortly after he developed a headache that was on both sides of his head. Felt like 8/10 pain. He then had difficulty with speaking - he didn&#39;t know what word to say so he would make a noise. He was on the phone, and that person recommended that he come to the ED to get evaluated.In the ED, a stroke code was called. BP 169/97. NIHSS 0. A CT non con did not show any acute bleed or any signs of a stroke. After the stoke code was ended, the patient has a headache severity 1/10 and did not have any word finding difficulties. Patient was non focal by the time that the stroke code was ended. In the setting of hypertension, a blood pressure of 169/97 on admission and fluctuating symptoms, most concerning on the differential is a TIA. Given his risk factors and episodic presentation, he will need to be worked up for a stroke. The differential also includes post-vaccination reaction vs complex migraine.

I felt a little off, but I thought I was ok.  I entered my shower, and then I was found unconscious on the floor of my shower by my wife about 5 minutes later.  I passed out 2 more times while attempting to stand and exit the shower.  I was extremely fatigued at this point.  I went back to bed and slept until 10 pm that night.  I woke for about 2 hours , ate  some food and drank some water and soda pop.  I then went back to sleep until 7:30 am  the next morning.   I was awake for 3 hours, and then I slept for 3 more hours.  I have been awake for about 2 hours, and I am now typing this adverse event document.   The entire time I have had temperature regulation issues, severe headache, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 31 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unspecified date, the patient experienced fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, and cellulitis on his left shin and foot. The patient took paracetamol and naproxen for the events, which somewhat helped.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The events, fever, chills, abdominal pain, anorexia/lack of appetite, diarrhea, fatigue/frequently had to lay in bed, were considered resolved on an unknown date. The outcome for the event, cellulitis on his left shin and foot, was reported as not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Cellulitis of shin and foot is unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

The triage of head and neck was negative for any illness.  He was told to continue the Inhaler and Mucinex.  On 2/5/2021 he went to his PCP and was told there was nothing they could do for him.  Told him to wait about 10 days to see if his symptoms subsided, if not he was going to refer him to a Pulmonologist.  From 2/5 to 2/19  the shortness of breath and choking sensation continued but the fatigue had subsided.  On 2/19 pt woke up w/ severe SOB and choking sensation so pt went back to the ER.  They performed another EKG, CT of neck and lungs, Covid Test, blood work, O2 level was 99 with wheezing symptoms. All test were negative but pt still had SOB.  Pt was released and referred to ENT Doctor once again on 2/25 w/ Dr. which they will do another scope where they will go further down.  Pt thinks his next option maybe a referral to a Pulmonologist.

                                                7pm on date of injection I got very sleepy and fell asleep.  I woke up at 12:45am sweating but chilled to the bone.  I felt feverish but was too cold to get out of bed.  When I actually got out of bed I had a very intense headache, and body aches.  I took my temp and it registered 104.  at 8am I took my dogs out but felt very old, chilled to the bone &amp;  lightheaded.  It was chilly outside.  I got back inside and got back into bed as fast as I could. The second I laid down, the sweat just poured out of my body, drenching my shirt, sheets, and blanket.  The fever lasted all day but was slowly improving throughout the day.  My arm was also incredibly sore at the injection site.  It was very sore for shot one too but the pain lasted nearly 2 weeks the first time and is already just about gone now.  Yesterday, or 2 days after dose 2 injection, the fever was gone.  I still had a headache, and body aches but also developed nausea.  I did not vomit but I did have diarrhea.  I also noticed extreme shortness of breath over very minor exertion.  I?m not sure if this was due to extreme dehydration , due to loss of fluids or if it?s associated with the vaccine.  My lungs feel clear and I deny ever suffering from a bronchial spasms..  Day 3 I?m feeling more myself but am still suffering from gastric upset.  Nausea has dissipated.

Since last seen he initiated AIT in December 2020 and reports he had tolerated his AIT injections without large local or systemic reactions until yesterday, 16 Mar, when he received his first maintenance dose. Within minutes of receiving his dose he developed shortness of breath, dizziness/altered level of consciousness resulting in collapse, and was noted to be hypoxic. He was treated with IM epinephrine with initial improvement but subsequently again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness. He received his second dose of IM epinephrine and a dose of IM Benadryl with transient improvement, but again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness followed by nausea and vomiting. He was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic despite these interventions so a third dose of IM epinephrine and IV fluids were administered. He was transferred by ambulance to ER where he was given IV solumedrol, monitored, and admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. He reports fever (Tmax 101 F) last night in the ICU. He endorses he took his Allegra prior to his AIT dose and did not exercise. Of note, on 15 Mar he received his second mRNA COVID19 vaccine.

                                                Numbness in right side of head and right arm (where he received injection). Starting getting confused. Legs started to give out. Continued working. Symptoms got worse. On and off paralysis of legs. Eyes flickered and darted. When he sat down at 1am, he took two nitroglycerin for chest pain. He asked a nurse to take his blood pressure. It was low. He felt he was losing control. He was struggling for breath. Eyes were tearing up real bad and tremors started. He stated he fought to stay conscious. Was started on oxygen. Was assisted in a wheelchair and taken to ER. Waited there for 4 hours. Was delusional. I left without being seen by a doctor after blood work and EKG. Went to sleep and woke up in river of sweat. Went to urgent care at that time. Was given a COVID test and it was negative. Was prescribed zinc and vitamins. He had the same symptoms like he did when he originally got COVID. Today at 9:36am, have fever off and on. Continues to feel pretty bad. Still dizzy.

                                                Right after the vaccine I just had a slight head ache. I had pretty typical symptoms. Around 8pm my arm got to 8/10 pain. I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                I began with chills on Weds. morning around 10am that only got worse not matter what I did. My arm continued to hurt but I thought it was just the injection pain. I then began to exhibit a temperature (100.3) and to feel fatigued and had a bad headache by late Weds. afternoon and evening.(These symptoms were similar to those I suffered when I had Covid back at the beginning of August, minus the throat pain and breathing issues I suffered.  By that night my arm was throbbing and I had fevers that ran as high as 102.7 and suffered multiple night sweats. My wife noticed swelling in my upper left arm and on Thurs. I contacted my Dr. who directed me to take tylenol and apply ice to the swelling. Which I did all day Thursday. The fatigue, fever and headache persisted all day Thursday and my arm began hurting more. I began to notice discomfort in my underarm (left) and my wife (a nurse) noticed it was swollen (softball size), warm to the touch and extending into my left pectoral muscle. I began applying ice to this area also but it had no impact. Contacting my Dr. on Friday about the new swelling, she examined me on Fri. afternoon and prescribed me Cephalexin, Medrol Dose Pack steroid, and over-the-counter Clariton allergy medicine, which I began Friday night. My fever began to subside and by Sat. morning my arm pain began to lessen and some of the swelling went down. Now Sunday morning, the fatigue, fevers and headache have gone, and most of my arm pain in gone (still tender to the touch), I still have some swelling in both upper left arm and Underarm pit. Dr. feels this was and allergic reaction and recommends I do not get the second injection.

                                                I received my shot at about 7:30PM Friday Jan 22, about 8 hours after that my shoulder had pain where I received the shot and had started to get a headache.   4 hours later awoke with extreme headache with pain in my joints,  also this is when diarrhea started.  Took Aleve and tried going back to bed an hour or so later chills started and couldn&#39;t sleep with the pain and diarrhea.  Kept trying to sleep but was difficult with these problems a couple hours later tried stretching and doing a little stretch and flex to see if this would help but it did not.  So approximately 18 hours after the shot the diarrhea was done (nothing left in me) I was dehydrated and consumed water constantly.  A couple hours after this I did not have anymore chills but my head felt like a balloon that was being over inflated and was going to pop.  By this time my sister was at my house keeping an eye on me, I had called her earlier.  I couldn&#39;t really feel the pain where I received my shop because of the pain in all my joints (shoulders, knees, hands etc.) but the worst was my neck and head.  Slept rough during the night drinking large quantities of water all night.  Started feeling a bit better mid morning the next day, got appetite back but was extremely fatigued and pretty much napped in bed until 6pm Sunday the 24th.  That&#39;s when I started feeling normal again eating like a pig and still couldn&#39;t get enough water in me.   Now I&#39;m scared about getting the 2nd dose of Moderna in a month. Thank you t

                                                Shortness of breath:  First noted about 18 hours after the dose, along with body aches, headaches and fatigue.  The latter symptoms resolved after 48 hours, however, the shortness of breath has not resolved as of today (77 hours after the dose).  No crackles or wheezes but inhalation and exhalation feels restricted.  I had Covid-19 with symptoms beginning on 11/16/2020 and had shortness of breath along with crackles and chest tightness  during the second week of illness.  The oxygen level declined to 92-93%.  I was treated with steroids and azithromycin at that time and the tightness of the chest resolved by about day 17 of illness.    I am reporting this adverse effect (chest tightness and shortness of breath) because it may be an autoimmune reaction triggered by the response to the vaccine.

                                                Drank fluids around 8pm followed by unusually early fatigue and somnolence 2 hours early, awoke before midnight cold, shivering, aching in larger muscles and joints from neck to ankle including shoulders, back, hips, and thighs, could not get warm wearing many layers and blankets, then headache after 3am with hot dry sore throat and awoke more short of breath than usual, eyes crusted, slightly dizzy on rising, am finding myself with poor attention this morning filling out this form incorrectly needing more corrections than usual.  The first dose was much milder but lasted 6 days.  This second dose seems much worse and am expecting it to last several days more.

                                                51 y.o. male from Facility.  The patient was seen at his primary care physician&#39;s office for some left facial swelling.  Apparently, he started getting more short of breath while he was there.  He was sent in by EMS.  His sats were initially in the upper 80s at his primary care physician&#39;s office.  He denies any symptoms of URI, but does state he has a long history of COPD.  The patient was given some DuoNebs and supplemental oxygen in the emergency room and shortness of breath basically resolved.  However, he did have very significant left facial swelling.  His CT did show facial cellulitis with possible abscess, but no fluid collection.  His white blood cell count was almost 25.  He had been having fevers at home.  Because of all this the decision was made to admit for IV antibiotics.   When I saw the patient, he was willing to stay for IV antibiotics for a few days.  3/11/21 remains hospitalized

On 1/23/21, I went to a local ER and a bleed was found in the brain stem by CT scan.  Then I was sent to medical center. I took several tests and a cavernous malformations was found in pons in the brain.  I was discharged on 1/27/21 and still have a numbness since it occured.

                                                SYMPTOM 1 - Pronounced persistent vertigo 7 days after Moderna Shot #1.  Very healthy.  Never before experienced vertigo of any significance.  Degree of vertigo strong for entire first day undeniably present/persistent and varies (slightly improved, then worsens again) since day 8. Able to get through day but disturbing. Extremely healthy otherwise,  extremely athletically capable.  Nothing unusual in diet or sleep or activity or stress in recent days.  SYMPTOM 2 - Ringing ears on day 11, and increasing on day 12.  This too - never before of any significance in entire life.  Could it be related to the vertigo symptoms?  Feels like it is.  *** Please take note! *** Hard to dismiss as unrelated.  I&#39;m just one.  You have the sample data.  Seems as though auditory/balance nerves are getting a beating somehow.  This is NOT an exasperated pre-existing condition.  The shoulder soreness / tiredness - was a 1 day matter quickly resolved.  This is more insidious and persistent and debilitating.

This spread to involve pain throughout the posterior upper arm for about 6 days before resolving. Did get moderate relief with use of ibuprofen 600 mg PO Q 8 hrs PRN. Received vaccine on 12/23/20 at 6pm.  Woke up at 5am to go to work on 12/24/20 and felt flu-like symptoms with subjective fever (did not measure), joint pain, and diffuse myalgias.  Symptoms progressed over the next three hours and culminated in about half an hour of significant rigors with uncontrolled shivering.  Ibuprofen dose of 600mg orally did help symptoms enough to allow me to finish my shift but I needed two more doses every 8 hours before symptoms resolved in 24 hrs.

                                                Very mild but noticeable numbness in tongue towards back of tongue (not front) on either side.  Seemed to dissipate after six hours.  Was not immediately noticeable and seemed to be more pronounced about 1/2 hour after injection.  I had the other expected soreness at injection site and general malaise approximately 24 hours after  - 96 hours after vaccine and I am only reporting this as I was not expecting the numbness in the tongue and was not sure if it was an adverse effect or just stress related.

                                                The evening of 1/11/21 - pain at the injection site and feeling of fatigue - went to bed very early.  Arm pain a bit less next day - felt a little tired all day. Back to &#34;normal&#34; on the 13th.   I am not sure if the following symptoms are related to the vaccine but I feel like I should report them if there may be a link.  1/17/21 -Awoke in the morning with severe neck pain - muscles &#34;locked up.&#34;  Called the doctor - he prescribed Tramadol and Cyclobenzaprine - I took these for two days before my neck calmed back down and I could function &#34;normally&#34; again.  1/28/21 - Started feeling &#34;under the weather&#34; and tired late in the day while still at work.  Went home and went to bed early.  1/29/21 - Felt same as last PM upon waking up.  Felt much better by mid-morning.  Started feeling bad again later in the day.  Felt cold - but no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  1/30/21 - Felt bad all day.  Felt cold - no fever.  Skin sensitive all over my body.  AM - felt anxious, worried, confused.  Built a fire in the fireplace and heat made me feel better. Felt hot-cold-hot-cold- all day.  My neck ached all day.  Sensitive to sounds. Took a single cyclobenzaprine late in the day - seemed to help. Went to bed early.  1/31/21 - Woke up with very sore deltoid muscle at the site of COVID-19 injection. Very hard to lift arm above head.  Hips, back, and neck muscles ache.  Calf muscles feel almost like they are about to cramp.  Mental state better than yesterday. Still sound sensitive. Not as cold feeling as in days prior.  Yoga seems to help.

                                                The patient had a very severe side effect profile from the second dose of vaccine:  &#34;worst I&#39;ve ever felt&#34; with myalgia, headache, fever and fatigue.  This subsided and then on day 3 he developed severe substernal chest pain and came to ER where his hs-cTnI was &gt; 2000 ng/L and peaked at 6700 ng/L.  His ECG, echo and cardiac cath were normal but MRI showed evidence of myocarditis with mild left ventricular dysfunction. He is doing well clinically and we are managing expectantly.   This appears to be immune mediated myocarditis from the Moderna vaccine

I went to work the next day, however I was feeling weird, my sense of smell and taste were off, as the day continued I started having a headache, body aches, and general malaise.  I went home early, again from work.  But when I arrived to my residence I was having severe chills despite my efforts to try to keep myself warm.  The chills lasted for more than 24hrs, preventing me from sleeping, my body aches were getting worse, my eyes were extremely red, and I did not feel like eating.  Near the end of the day, the chills became sweats, and I was trying to balance between being hot and clammy, to chills.  The next day I paid a visit to my primary care doctor.  I was tested for covid - which was negative, I was tested for the flu - which was negative, and my lungs were clear so there was no reason for my doctor to believe I have a pneumonia.

                                                approximately 12 hours after vaccine administration, I became cold with bone rattling and teeth chattering chills with severe shivering.  I had no fever when I checked my temperature orally.  I developed 3 small urticaria with one on my abdomen and one on each thigh.    I treated with 50mg of benadryl and 800 mg of Motrin.  It appeared to be a euthermic cytokine storm to me ( I am an ICU physician).   The symptoms resolved without issue.

Fatigue, minor headache, and severe malaise lasting for circa 15 hours after initial onset of the symptoms.

                                                22 hours after receiving the vaccine, I had  fever and the chills.  This was followed by a headache.  This was not unexpected.  I fell into a deep sleep that lasted 2 hours.  I awoke suddenly with a very bad headache.  I drank about 3 ounces of orange juice and then took 30 ml of pharmacy brand liquid Tylenol.  This is the bad symptom that I want to report.  As soon as the liquid Tylenol hit the back of my throat it felt as if my throat constricted tightly.  I immediately stopped drinking it and was able to spit out some of what was in my mouth.  I was unable to get air in or out.  I stood up  and eventually was able to get a big gulp of air into my lungs before everything closed up again.  Eventually I was able to get another gulp of air in and I began to cough a little.  Once I drank some water, I could feel the liquid Tylenol on the back of my throat get washed down  and I was able to breath normally in about 2 minutes.   The cup of liquid Tylenol still had about 20 ml of fluid in it and I spit out perhaps half of what entered my mouth; I&#39;m estimating that 5 ml of liquid Tylenol went down  my throat.  Note that this is not a case of the liquid Tylenol going down my windpipe by mistake.  I know what that feels like and it is different.  It was all very traumatic.

Day 2: Next morning was difficult getting out of bed. Skin was very sensitive to warm/hot shower water. Achy joints all over. Even my left injection site was sore even though I was injected on the right side. Fatigue at work. I was very wide eyed as described by co-worker. I was a little loopy as I was very giggly and things made me laugh way more than usual. I may have been a little delirious but I was able to work. This lasted until I went to bed. Day 3: When I awoke I felt like a fever had broke, Cooling sweat, but my temp was never over 98.5 degrees. My normal morning temp is usually 97.3 every day, but that one degree made a difference. I feel normal today and realize I was not well the day before.

At approximately 2am on Friday, fever of 103.5 unresponsive to APAP or Ibuprofen for approximately 18 hours, severe body aches especially in both shoulders and hips, extreme fatigue, and headache.  After 18 hours, fever was responsive to Ibuprofen but headache, aches, and fatigue still present with general malaise. Then, fever of 101.5 returned about 1am on Sunday and resolved in the morning following another dose of Ibuprofen. Headache and general malaise finally resolved on Monday.  The post COVID second vaccination reactions appear to be under-reported and occurring at a greater percent than currently being relayed to the public.

                                                About 4 hours following the 1st part of the vaccination (i.e. around 8:30 pm), I felt the skin of both my cheeckbones swelling and flaring up. By the following morning, I felt that skin area, as well as the area around both of my eyes to feel as if I had sustained second degree burns. Additionally, the skin around my eyes particularly, presented with extreme dryness and geriatric symptoms, such as wrinkling and streched thinned skin, as if I were an elderly person (over 75 years old, and not 52).  The flaring/burning subsided after 4-5 days. However, the skin dryness around the eyes has persisted to this day (i.e. 5 weeks past the 1st vaccination). A day after the 2nd part of the vaccination, I felt moderate dizziness and headache, which lasted for about 24 hours. Also, light soreness and skin stiffening were experienced at the arm location where the shot was adminmistered.

He was advised to stay home, was offered Covid testing but refused. On 3/22/21 the RN received an email from patient&#39;s supervisor that he still felt unwell and reported vomiting and diarrhea. Was offered a Covid test but refused.  -Per patient&#39;s friend (a nurse who informed us of the case) various friends spoke with patient up until the morning of 3/25 and he reportedly had no respiratory or cardiac complaints. They were unable to reach him the evening of 3/25, nor the morning of 3/26 so sent the police for a well check and patient was found dead. He lived alone. -Per OSME. Patient did not receive an autopsy but did have an &#34;inspection&#34; which includes an external exam, toxicology and other testing including Covid testing which was positive. The specimen has been sent for sequencing. -Of note, Patient worked in a group  home that had an outbreak of Covid in Jan/early Feb. His last exposure to a &#43; person was likely 2/8/21 but possibly 2/10/21. He had a Covid test 2/15/21 that was &#34;inconclusive&#34;. The test was re-run (same assay) and was also &#34;inconclusive&#34;

                                                I had moderate to severe covid in August 2020.  I recovered.  I had antibodies test completed on 12/22/2020 at hospital, my results were positive for antibodies with score of 205.  Dec 31, 2020:  Severe Chilling and shaking, teeth rattling shaking, unable to get warm,  Extreme fatigue, unable to stay awake, watch registered 4k steps despite me being in recliner for the day due to the shaking of body.   Jan 1, 2021:  Intense head ache, muscle aches and red and swelling welt at immunization site.  Recurrent fever, excessive sweating, soaked through tshirt, polo shirt twice, extreme fatigue. Same symptoms continue until Jan 5, 2021.  Symptoms were definitely more intense than just a casual body ache or fever. It felt like my body had covid again even though i know it is not possible to catch covid again from vaccine.

I mostly felt ill throughout the day with low-grade fever, fatigue, body aches.  This continued on Sunday, January 31, 2021 and Sunday evening, I noticed a small droop in the upper lip on the right side of my mouth.  When I awakened, Monday, February 1, 2021, I had full right-side paralysis of the face, severe right eye, right jaw and right ear pain, severe fatigue, continued body aches.  After going to the ER where tests were performed to rule out stroke and sepsis, I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy.

                                                pt stated that the night after the vax the left side of his face started drooping, he had severe headache behind left ear and some slurred speech.  The next day his symptoms got worse so he took Benadryl since he thought he was having an allergic reaction but he continued to get worse.  The third day his speech was getting worse, his face continued to swell and droop and he still had severe headache on the left side.  Pt ended up going to the ER where they did a CT, EKG, Chest X-Ray, blood work, gave him IV fluids and steroids. The ER Dr. consulted a Neurologist which told him he had the symptoms of Bell Palsy so they did the stroke protocol but ended up telling him his symptoms were from taking the Covid Vaccine.   He was told to finish his medicine that they prescribed which is steroid and antibiotic and if he did not get any better to come back for FU.

I am med compliant with all my meds and I take care of my Type II diabetes,    I am also a volunteer firefighter - advanced EMT, so I know when there is a problem.

                                                I am a front line physician. I had moderate Covid in March 2020.  After my vaccination at 2:15pm on 1/6/2021 I had very slight chills at 11:30 pm as I went to bed. I awoke at 5:30am 1/7/2021 with severe chills and very slight fever of 98.8 (oral). I took 800mg Advil then. I remained in bed with chills until 4pm. I had a fever of 100.0 at 11:45am. Took 800mg Advil.  Chills subsided to mild around 4pm. Was able to walk around house. Ate dinner. No GI symptoms. 11:30pm had fever 100.0  and moderate to sever chills. Took 800 mg Advil.  Felt better and went to sleep at around 1am. Woke up 6am 1/8/2021 and was able to go to work. When I got to work I was able to sign up for this reporting service but could nit document my first day of symptoms. I took that opportunity now. I believe it is important that I had these reactions after having the covid illness 3/2020. I had small amount remaining antibodies at time of Vaccination, which surely contributed to my response.

The next day (DEC 30th) I continued with a mild headache and the injection site pain had increased. By 1800 hrs on the 30th while at work I began not to feel well. Body aches all over along with headache. When I arrived home that night around 2300 hrs I was feeling flushed and the body aches had increased. I took my temperature several times that night with different thermometers to make sure I was getting accurate temp readings. My average temps consisted of 99.8. I did take iburofen that night. The following morning my temp was normal and the body aches had subsided. I continued to have a headache that day being DEC 31st. To note: I never had any prior symptoms, nor ever being covid positive to my knowledge. I had two prior surgeries, first procedure on NOV 4 and another procedure on DEC 9 of 2020. I was tested for Covid prior to both procedures which were negative results.

I was incredibly fatigued for about three days after. Also, the entire right forearm felt sore for about a week, as well. The day after vaccine shot, my right testes was achey and sore (and still is uncomfortable) Also, the top side of my right foot was very tender. During the course of the week, that part of my foot became lightly swollen as did the front of my right leg, up to the top of the shin bone. Today?s date: 1/22/21 5:19 pm and leg and foot still tender and slightly swollen.

He stated that he had a history of hypoglycemia as well but had not had issues with it in a while.  Patient reported that his BG had been 80 that morning and that he had eaten Chick Fil a prior to coming for the vaccine.  We offered a snack or glucose tablet but patient refused.

After monitoring and water the patient felt better and purchased glucose tablets when he left.

                                                After the vaccination  on 1/18/2021 , I had just pain at the site of injection in my left arm for the next 2   to 3 days  and headache.  Took Advil and it went away. After 3 or 4 days i started feeling very mild pain inside my arm muscles between  the injection site and my elbow  which continued till 1/25/2021.   Later this  very mild internal pain shifted  to my elbow  and   feel a mild numbing sensation in my pinky finger.  It also feels little heavy when I move my arm.  This  continues till  today as I am reporting on 1/30/2021 3:30pm.  Since it has not bothered much , I did not seek medical care, hoping this will  go away in few weeks.

It hurt on the back right and above the right ear. It hurt to touch. My tongue is not functjioning now.  I had to get a MRI because they thought it could of been a mini stroke. MRI came back negative the doctors told me Bell Palsy.  They advise me not to get my second dose on 2/3/21.

On 09-JAN-2021, the patient received their first two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11-JAN-2021, the patient experienced headache the worse he ever had on left side, nausea and fever.

                                                Patient is a 55 year old male with no past medical history who presents with complaint of sudden onset of left-sided nonradiating chest discomfort of sudden onset approximately 1 hour prior to presentation while doing administrative work at rest.    He describes the pain as a dull heaviness sensation and approximate 3/10 pain severity.  Chest discomfort was associated with a feeling of flushing that was quite transient but chest discomfort was persistent.  Patient immediately presented to the ED for further evaluation.  He denies experiencing any chest pain upon waking up this morning.  Does note that he did have a transient episode of epistaxis on his way to work for which he had to pull over and apply pressure to his nose but this subsequently subsided and he attributed this to dry air as he has experienced epistaxis in the past but with less severity previously.   In the ER, vital signs noted for BP 133/76, pulse ranging 91-114, respiratory rate 16-20, 96% on room air.  Initial laboratory parameters were completely normal including normal CBC, CMP, LFT, lipase, UA, and normal D-dimer.  Initial troponin was negative x1.  EKG with sinus tachycardia, heart rate of 115.  Noted Q waves inferiorly.  No acute ST or T wave changes appreciated.  Chest x-ray with mild increased density in the left lower lobe.  Given this, patient was tested for rapid Covid which was negative but PCR was positive for COVID.  CT of the chest noted for focal subsegmental groundglass infiltrate at the superior segment of the LLL, likely infectious versus inflammatory.  Also noted small nonspecific groundglass attenuation with focal septal thickening at the right upper lobe which could be infectious or inflammatory, bibasilar atelectasis.  Patient was treated with aspirin 324 mg in the ED.  Of note, patient actually just received the COVID-19 vaccination on 12/24/20.  He denies any shortness of breath, no cough, denies any nausea or vomiting, denies any change in taste or smell nor change in appetite.  Does note 1 single episode of loose stool but otherwise denies any diarrhea.  Does report that he had approximate 48 to 72-hour period of fatigue and soreness at the site of the left deltoid injection following the vaccination but otherwise no further symptoms.  It is also noted that he does have a positive family history of coronary artery disease as his dad had an MI at the age of 49.  Patient has never undergone a cardiac catheterization in the past but does report having a negative stress test at the age of 42.  He is being admitted under the hospitalist service for further management  Patient was initially admitted under observation for chest pain obs.  However patient&#39;s Covid test came back positive and patient also had dynamic EKG changes concerning for possible unstable angina.  Patient was treated with aspirin Plavix full-strength Lovenox along with beta-blocker and a cardiology consult.  Serial troponins were negative.  Echocardiogram revealed normal EF of 55 to 60% with no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  Cardiology felt that patient likely has underlying coronary artery disease have recommended discharge home with aspirin and Plavix with outpatient stress testing given his positive Covid testing.  At the time of discharge patient denied any chest pain or shortness of breath.  Patient was borderline diabetic with a hemoglobin A1c of 6.1.  Patient was discharged home with Metformin along with glucometer, glucose strip, lancets.  Given patient&#39;s tachycardia patient&#39;s Metformin 25 mg twice daily was changed to Toprol 25 mg daily. (Please note clarification in comparison to discharge home med list.  Toprol XL 25 mg daily was called to pharmacy in place of the metoprolol.)

Noticed that when my arm is to the side of my body, it started going numb- right arm. I also had to get up around 4 times to urinate a lot. I was getting night sweats. When I would get up, I had a slight head ache and dizziness. I still have it right now, the headache and dizziness. Even when I walk, I have to extend my pinky finger out so my arm will not go numb. As we are speaking right now, my pinky finger is going numb. Once I extend it out, it goes away, but when I put it down by my side, it goes numb. My whole body is sore as well.

                                                Patient received 0.5mL Moderna Covid19 vaccine at mass vaccine clinic on 12/30. This patient was a walk thru and not a patient of HP at this time.    Daughter reported to ARNP,RN Director Clinical Support on 01/03 the following outcomes:    Patient first exhibited the first signs of reaction started about 60 hours after vaccine: hives only (no difficulty breathing, dizziness, lightheadedness); applied hydrocortisone cream, took diphenhydramine. Patient slept for a few hours then woke up for lunch. Around 12:30-1:00 the patient exhibited three episodes of syncope. Emergency services was called after the first. Firefighters couldn&#39;t find BP, was in 70s by doppler only. Patient taken to hospital for care.    Discharged from ED around 5, suspecting hypotension 2/2 to diphenhydramine use. Monitored vitals at home; became severely hypotensive (BP 70s/40s both with automatic monitor and manual read) and lethargic again about an hour or so after, but normotensive again right before about to call ambulance. Pt claimed to be okay and had some dinner. Fourth episode of syncope, ambulance was called.         Patient remains at hospital ED since, still in observation unit. BP&#39;s normalized but itching returns periodically. IV steroids and diphenhydramine. Took head CT yesterday; no word on the results. Stable and alert enough since yesterday to communicate with us with his phone. Patient is scheduled for an echo to be done today.    No hx of severe allergic reaction. Treated for active TB 30 years ago, shingles x2 in the past few years; otherwise healthy 55 y/o male.     Pt discharged 01/04 to home with fatigue and malaise. Not additional symptoms reported since then. Provider doing full cardiac and neurologic work up.

On the morning of the 6th day, 1/21/21, I had very intense deep muscle pain in my lower back, left arm, hands and headache. About two hours after this started I started to have the very intense chills, my headache got worse and for the first time a low fever of 99 degrees. I felt like this for 2 days, couldn&#39;t sleep for 2 days because of the pain. On the third day 1/24/21, it was much better and almost all gone by the fourth day, 1/25/21. Thank you

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Company assessed the events to be unlikely related to company product.

The numbness that has since spread throughout my body (from my head to my feet), body joint and muscle pain and burning sensation, muscle cramps and twitching, and continued fatigue.  Additionally, I have had a few of episodes of pressure in my eyes and head resulting in vision issues and issues with my hearing&#34;

Unlike during the disease, my hips strongly ached 24 hours after recieving the injection.  COVID cough returned though not as bad as when I had the disease, as well as fealing weak and out of breath.  All of this lasted for about 36 hours.  Feeling a bit better now, but still winded and weak.   Still plan to get 2nd shot.

                                                Presented to ED for evaluation of generalized lower extremity weakness, falls. The patient states that he carries a diagnosis of MS and typically is fully functioning without assistance of a cane or walker. The patient states that yesterday morning around 0900 he received the second dose of his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and was otherwise feeling fine but by last night (12 hours after the vaccine) the patient states he tried to get out of bed and was transferring when he felt his bilateral legs give out, causing him to slide to the ground. His wife then came to help and states that the patient was completely weak in the legs, and was unable to even lift his legs up to get back into bed. They then tried to walk him again a short time later and he again stumbled with weakness in his legs. Since that time, the patient states he has been minimally ambulatory and has been using a cane, but still needs large assistance to get around his home. The patient states he has baseline foot drop but feels this is worse in his legs today. He went to clinic this morning for his symptoms where he was noted to have an elevated temperature and was diffusely weak in his lower extremities. Given this, the patient was referred to the ED for further evaluation. The patient denies any weakness in his upper extremities or facial asymmetry. He denies sensation change in his extremities nor any recent illness such as cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or leg pain. He has no history of stroke. He denies any injuries or head injury, syncope from his falls. He was admitted to the hospital where he will receive further symptomatic treatment as necessary. No treatment provided in emergency department for weakness.

                                                Mild case of pneumonia; Tested positive for COVID; Shortness of breath; A spontaneous was received from a healthcare facility staff member concerning 55 years of old, male patient who developed shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID. The patient&#39;s medical history included back issue. The patient had an epidural for bulging disk in back in an unknown date in December. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 29-JAN-2021, eight days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) on left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20-JAN-2021, the patient had COVID symptoms including congestion and cough but tested negative on rapid testing. Since tested negative, the patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled on 29-JAN-2021 at Hospital.  On 06-FEB-2021 after experiencing shortness of breath, the patient was retested by rapid test, which was also negative. However, the patient tested positive for COVID on Polymerase Chain reaction test at Urgent Care. The patient had a mild case of pneumonia  The reporter believes that the patient probably was positive before, as patient had been home since 19-DEC-2020 due to a back issue. Thinks that the patient&#39;s son may have been asymptomatic and all eight members in the household tested positive except the reporter. Treatment for the events included antibiotic azithromycin 5 days z-pack.  The events shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID were considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and high probability of corona infection from the close contacts where all eight members in the household were tested positive except the patient immediately before the vaccination, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

                                                Rash on legs, arms and torso on second day after vaccine. I noticed the rash in the evening around 6:00pm. I took a benedryl at 5:00pm on Wednesday 3/03/2021. Called my family doctor on Thursday morning and he told me to take 1 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 at night to help clear the rash. My Doctor said it was not anaphylaxis as it did not happen immediately after the vaccine but 24 hours later. I have no trouble breathing as I check myself with oximeter and my oxygen level is 97%.  I did have Covid on January 3, 2021 and after the vaccine on 03/02/2021 I experienced nausea, chills and a dull headache and then the rash. I have experienced this type of rash before after a stomach virus and it lasts for 3 or 4 days and clears up.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included dolutegravir sodium;lamivudine, pregabalin, and modafinil for unknown indication.  On 19 Feb 2021, approximately two days prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 011M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Feb 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt unusually tired for midafternoon that day. The patient had suffered from chronic fatigue issues but never felt more tired than usual at that point in the day. The patient then experienced a black out and woke up face down with a bloody nose and head. The patient felt very dizzy, was not able to walk and crawled to their mattress and fell asleep. The patient managed to get himself to the Emergency room, a CT scan of the head was performed, and it was revealed that the patient had a fracture that had occurred before the vaccine and was not related to the vaccine. The doctor thought the vaccine however maybe related to the blackout or have exaggerated a concussion and have caused these delayed symptoms. No treatment information was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the event experienced a black out was resolved at the time of this report and the outcome of the events, felt unusually tired for midafternoon, woke up face down with a bloody nose and head, was very dizzy and couldn&#39;t walk was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and patient&#39;s skull fracture that had occurred before the vaccine the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-057947:Second Dose Case

The following day I had chest pain every few hours or so. the waves of chest pain only lasted about 5 minutes a piece.

By 9 30pm I was nauseous and full blow stomach pain.  My stomach was &#39;roiling or churning.&#39;   Then between 9 30pm and 2 30am the next day I was nauseous, had stomach pain, I felt hot and cold and my head became more congested and I got a headache.  Note: the head congestion was there prior to getting the vaccine, but it got worse.   I sipped water throughout and it felt like I had to vomit (but I did not vomit).   I took my temperature a few times it ranged from 98 to 98.8.   My normal temperature is 97 to 97.5.   By morning, or about 4am the worse symptoms were gone.  My stomach felt more or less ok and at 7am  I ate a light breakfast without incident.   My temperature seemed to be elevated through the day.  I felt somewhat weak during the day.  Worst effects seem gone by Jan 8 evening.   The only effect left is pain in my left upper arm.  I consider these to be significant and worrying side effects and I may not take the second dose.

                                                Significant flu like symptoms that lasted for 36 hours from onset.  Included a fever of over 101, sweats, chills and uncontrollable shivering.  Had some numbness in fingers and toes.  These symptoms were actually more severe that when I had Covid 19. Taking Tylenol would help ease the symptoms, I did rotate in a dose of Ibuprofen on a 2 hour interval one time during the worst of the symptoms. After the 36 hour mark the symptoms faded and I returned to a normal state, although very drained and fatigued. The severity of the symptoms seem like they would be dangerous for someone who is not in good health.

                                                12 hours after began to have a scratch throat.  at 13 hours post dose, had a headache start and an unusual erythematous spot on the posterior palate above Uvula with almost a white scratch appearance inside the erythema.  16 hours post dose began to have fevers and chills.  At 17 hours had severe sweats that soaked the bed with rigorous chills including teeth chattering shaking chills.  Took 800mg ibuprofen and went back to sleep.  Poor sleep with many awakenings.  Woke 22 hours post dose with no fevers or chills any longer but had headache that is different than my usual migraines or tension headaches.  Took 2 Fioricet with minimal change in headache.  Felt off for most of the day, and felt warm and achy.  Next night of sleep was again restless with some sweating beyond usual and awakened with swelling feeling in throat during the night.  Woke 46 hours post dose with headache again, as well as substantial uvula and soft palate edema with mild erythematous appearance.  The swelling gave me a fullness felling that made it hard to swallow and felt like my voice was changed.  I have had this same uvula edema in the past with rare allergic reactions to food, and flower that I once smelled.  The Uvula looks like a water filled ballon.  NO nodes in the neck.  The injection site has had mild induration, and swelling and has been itchy.  Headaches have persisted to a moderate extent.  Uvula Swelling has persisted to the point that I took a dose of prednisone 52 hours post vaccine.    It is now 54 hours post dose and I just feel a bit off, swollen uvula, headache and itchy vaccine site.

                                                4 days after receiving my vaccine I experienced a painful sore throat.    Examination of my oropharynx reveals a solitary 1mm pustule  with surrounding erythema on the posteriolateral edge of the hard palate.  I have not experienced any fever or URI symptoms.  It is on the same side as my vaccine.  I am not sure if it is relevant but I reached out to my Infectious Disease colleague and he recommended I report this to you ( I am a Dermatologist). The lesion is still present today 36 hours later without any new lesions or progression.  I do not have any history of herpes or aphthous ulcers and have never had a lesion on this part of my hard palate before.

I wonder if people who have had the virus should be being told to get the vaccine since I suspect intense reaction is due to pre existing immunity.

My heart began racing to about one and one half the normal to a rate of 100, at about 30 hours after the injection.  It then slowed to 50 bpm for about 15 minutes before racing back to 100 and becoming somewhat irregular, slow pace followed by several quick beats then a beat or two slow again and then several quick beats.  This lasted for a few hours and then I fell asleep.  When I woke up about 7 hours later, it was back to normal.  Some slight body ache and headache.

He ate a little bit of food, took some food, went home and rested and his symptoms calmed down. The next day (Saturday) he just felt fatigued. He did say that he had not ate breakfast before receiving his vaccine. He also spoke with a family member who is a doctor but did not actually go to a doctor&#39;s office/clinic.

Two days later, on 01/28/2021, the patient went to local urgent care for worsening shortness of breath and was referred to Hospital for worsening dyspnea and hypoxia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital   We was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and treated for pneumonia with Rocephin and azithromycin.  He was tested for COVID-19 multiple times, but each of the results were negative.  Despite the negative results, there was high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and the patient was started on Remdesivir and Decadron.  The  patient&#39;s oxygen requirements continued to worsen and the patient was transferred to another facility for higher level of care.  There  his hypoxia worsened and he required mechanical ventilation.  Patient then developed hypotension and required vasopressors for blood pressure support.  Furthermore, patient developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  Despite mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100%, and for vasopressors, patient clinically deteriorated and family decided to palliatively extubate on 02/05/2021.

                                                On the morning of the 17th, a week after the immune reaction from the second shot, started off with a painful rash on the right foot and unable to bear weight. Advised Benadryl and Claritin by physician after sending him a photo. Along with that developed a sore throat and painful swelling at the right base of tongue, almost as if it had been bitten, on and off sweats, temperature on and off to 99 degrees, myalgias and arthralgias.  The sore throat got a little better by 2/20, but then started with severe headaches, worse at night, along with intense pain and burning with the neuropathy in my feet flaring up. Dizziness along with the headaches and sharp stabbing pains from the neck on each side up to the back of the years and marked sensitivity of the skull. Almost went to the ER in the middle of the night on 2/21, but increased Tylenol to every 4 hours. the symptoms of the rash and body aches and fever have subsided, but chills come and go. Today, 2/23, the headaches are continuing to get better, but marked sensitivity of skull and head, particularly on the left side, and overall feeling of being tired. I expect over the next few days the headaches will be gone. Didn&#39;t expect this delayed reaction after over a week after the second shot, but I guess anything can happen.  Have discussed with other coworkers in the medical field that have heard of similar issues, so we are guessing this is a delayed reaction. At least there was no shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Continued to &#34;not feel well&#34;. 3/15/21, presented to ED with chest pains and dx with pericarditis again.  Treated with IV Vanco x1 and IV Zosyn x2 until blood work came back and cultures were negative. Due to no infection and negative for an MI, Dr. determined pericarditis was a rxn to the vaccine.   Other tests results include: Elevated BNP, BUN, and CRP.  CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis is clear. 5 covid tests since admission, all negative. IgG antibodies for COVID negative.   PT currently is stable and bloodwork somewhat improved. On O2, fluids and Morphine for chest pain. An acute Hepatitis panel is currently pending.

Those symptoms lasted approx 3 days.  Two days after the vaccination I also became extremely nauseous.  I was anticipating all of these symptoms.  On the 3rd and 4th days after the vaccine most of the symptoms disappeared but I received some new ones that I was not expecting.  I suddenly felt a large amount of despair and hopelessness.  I had suicidal thoughts.  I had panic attacks and anxiety.  I had paranoia.  I did not feel like I had long to live, or anything to live for.  By 20 Apr all of these emotional and mental side effects were completely gone.

I have experienced all these side effects every day for the last 10 days. Additional side effects are: Sweating profusely every night. Not being able to sleep very well nearly every night. Stomach upset if I eat or if I do not eat. I am only able to eat very bland food since anything else upsets my stomach. I can not drink carbonated beverages since they upset my stomach. As of yesterday I started getting little red sores on my back. This morning it moved to my chest in addition to my back.

                                                Since Shot - Arm pain at injection site continues through today.  Most intense issues were Tuesday 24 hours post shot when I had more intense headaches and body aches.  SOB remained the same.  Tuesday evening, 35 hours post shot, I had chills and low grade fever 99.3.  Slept for 10 hours and fever was gone and hasn&#39;t returned.  Intensity of arm pain is diminished but still quite sore at actual injection site.  Headaches are not as intense as Tuesday but continue to fluctuate in intensity as they have for the past 3 months.

I had the expected side effects Chills, aches, headache but was not expecting the tinnitus and thought initially it would resolve with the other symptoms but it has not.  It is a constant high pitched tone.  I was not exposed to anything else that day.  No loud noises and have no symptoms other illness.  This is the first time I have experienced this. It doesn&#39;t seem to be in one ear or the other, It is just there , constantly.  I did not go to a doctor because I am one and know nothing can be done.

Around 6 PM that day, I started feeling fatigued and my body felt achy.  I felt like my breath and body were warm, as though I had a fever, but my temperature was normal.  Drinking a lot of water did not help the feeling go away.  On the second morning following the vaccination (about 42 hours after the injection), I felt fine, but around 6 PM (52 hours after the injection), I felt tired again but not achy.  On the third morning, the only symptom that I felt was very mild tenderness near the injection site.

There were no other changes in my routine that could have accounted for it.

After 36 hours, a very obvious and bad rash on hands that doctor diagnosed as dyshidrotic eczema.  Simultaneously legs were badly marked with dark red dots, especially lower legs, and much overall light red skin over upper legs and torso below neck.  The hands resolved over a few days with steroid cream.  The rest of the body continues, a month later, to feel like a sunburn.  The worst of the look of dark red dots on lower leg diminished over the first couple of weeks.  But even now, it feels like my skin is mildly burned.  I can even press it and release and see white where I pressed, surrounded by red, just like a sunburn.  Overall the skin looks mildly red, but nothing outrageous.
