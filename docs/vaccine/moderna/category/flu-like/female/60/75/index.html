Got up a 2am to go to bathroom and had teeth-chattering chills.  30 minutes later vomited several times.  Fever was 99.6  last night, 99.8 this morning, and 100.2 this afternoon.  Significant pain in joints, moderate in muscles.  Feel by far worse than when I had covid.  Though these side affects typically resolved in 24 hours? Mine are no better, other than I&#39;m only nauseated, not throwing up.

                                                Approximately 8 mins after injection, I began to experience lightheadedness and trouble focusing.  Began to feel dizzy, weak, was sweating, and had a flushed appearance in face.  On attempt to stand, felt like I could not take a step.  In ER vitals were normal except for blood pressure was high.  Was discharged after receiving IV fluids, lab tests, EKG.  About 5 hours later, I developed a low grade fever of 99.7, blood pressure 142/92, chills,  general malaise and body aches.  Symptoms started dissipating later in the evening.  Started feeling better as the day progressed the next day.

When I woke up a few hours later, I noticed that I had a very bad headache and all-over body aches, and I felt like I had the flu.  Weak, nauseous and extremely tired.  I went to bed and slept through the night, when my alarm woke me at 7:00 am on Tuesday, January 5, I got up to use the bathroom and felt all the same symptoms from the night before, only worse.  I noticed that I had a rash on my left arm below the injection site.  I called in sick and went back to bed.  I slept from approximately 7:30 to 2:00 pm on January 5.  I felt a little better upon awakening, but had a very bad headache and no appetite.  The other body aches seemed better.

Red, raised area was about 2&#34; x 3&#34;.  No pain, no other symptoms.  I massaged area in  a hot shower.  Also, had a headache in the middle of the night same date that was 5/10 pain and required 2 extra strength Tylenol-not normal for me.  I called my PCP.  She offered to see me, but did not require it. I chose not to be seen; I just wanted to make sure I wasn&#39;t overlooking something.

                                                First, let me say that I had a diagnosed case of Coronavirus in April of 2020 last year.  I woke up about 12 hours - at about 3 or 3:30am - after receiving the vaccine to my teeth chattering and feeling like I was freezing.  It felt about the same as it did when I have Coronavirus before.  My head was hurting like a tension headache, I had a slight buzz in my ears, my neck, shoulders, back all hurt (body aches).  I felt pressure in my chest but unlike when I had the virus, I could still breathe.  Eventually instead of freezing, I got hot and my temperature went to 101.9.  I checked it several times with 3 different thermometers.  I became dehydrated quickly which I realized because I kept going to the bathroom.  My niece brought me Gatorade which helped.  I also took Naprxin 500mg.  On Thursday morning I felt better.  Now what remains to oday, Friday, 1/8 is a sore arm that feels HOT to the touch at the injection site.  I admit I am not looking forward to Moderna shot #2.  It gave me flashbacks of the Virus I suffered through for a month before being able to get a test and another month afterward from March 6 when I think I contracted it through May 15 when I tested negative.   I wish I understood why this happened to me and if it will happen again. I am reporting this because my Test was arraigned via my job and my CIO said I should.  A friend who I happened to see at the test site who tested a few patients after me has zero negative effects.

                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at her place of employment as a phase 1A essential frontline healthcare worker in a skilled nursing LTC facility on January 6 2021. The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

EMT administered 50ml benedryl and pushed 125ml saline.  No response.  Throat felt tight, not closed but tight.  Offered EpiPen .3 agreed.  Body reaction - shaking.  Went to Hospital ER via ambulance (~11am).  ER administered 50mg steroid and had 2 puffs of albuterol inhaler twice.  Became very tired but felt heart raced - assumed reaction to steroid/albuterol.  2:30pm started to finally feel relief.  Discharged 4pm with rx for prednisone 50mg 1/day-10 days and benedryl 25mg for that night and am/pm next day.  O2 dropped to 94 that evening.  Administered 3 rounds of 2 liters/minute before saturation held at 97. 1-9-2021:  9am took benedryl and prednisone doses.  10am both nostrils still feel &#34;swollen,&#34; legs are weak and very tired (benedryl?).  Oxygen saturation is good - 97.  Starting to feel slight sensitivity at injection site.  4pm able to shower and move around.  Breathing is better.  Elected not to take benedryl as I&#39;m not getting an positive response from it, only fatigue.  Nostrils still feel swollen - tried lubricated nasal spray, not much help. 1-10-2021:  8:30 prednisone dose  Oxygen saturation good - 98% pulse 72.  Nostrils still feel swollen.  Injected site sore,  Started around 4pm (similar to shingles vaccine - expected).

Now at day 12 I still have a faint rash with itching.  I also had a fever (100.1) and body aches for the first 2 days. Then later began coughing and still have the cough. I am not sure if the cough is related to the vaccine or if it may be a virus that I may have picked up. I have been treating the symptoms using OTC cough syrup, Tesslon Pearls and albuterol inhaler if I get wheezy.

The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                I filed the V-Safe for one week. Originally my arm was firm and red, and swollen...that went away in 2 days, and I felt fine. Oddly yesterday, my arm started another identical reaction from the vaccine, where it was a small white area, then became red and inflamed in an hours time. It was warm to touch. Very itchy this time. I used a no touch thermometer on it and it read 100.4. My forehead temp was 97. It is feeling better and going away again, but I thought it was odd and that you should know. Thanks.

                                                I had the vaccine on January 5 and I was fine the whole day.  For the next two days my arm was sore from my elbow to my shoulder.  the third day my whole upper right side was crippled were as my shoulder neck and arm was almost paralyzed and I couldn&#39;t really move without severe pain.  A few hours later, my legs felt like noodles like I would fall over; I ended up leaving work early that day incase I couldn&#39;t get home.  The next morning I went to work.  the pain moved to my left side, same areas and creeped around my left rib cage.  This has been going on since.  I had off January 11 and 12 for my weekend.  I haven&#39;t been back to work since January 13.  I have had severe pain in my left neck, shoulder, rib cage, elbow, and now my left wrist and at times, my left hand feels numb.  Also, the within the last 24-48 hours my breasts have been tender.  I&#39;ve been lethargic since yesterday and now my vision is blurry.  My nurse keeps telling me to rotate between ibuprofen and tylenol, it&#39;s not helping at all, I am extremely uncomfortable and in pain.  In fact, when I take the ibuprofen, it causes more pain.  I&#39;ve been trying to reach the on call doctor for pain medication and no one is calling me back.   The only relief I have is when i hold my arm above my head.  I am groggy and I am feeling emotional.   I&#39;ve missed a week of work and I&#39;m nervous about getting my second vaccine, but I will get it. Oh, and I&#39;m not sleeping well.

Overnight I experienced body aches and chills.  Those flu like symptoms lasted just under 24 hours.  The arm was still swollen and red and hot for the next two days.  All those symptoms decreased.  The swelling and hotness disappeared completely.  The arm is still red in some areas and it is itchy sometimes.  Today one week after the delayed reaction, my arm still has red areas and its very itchy today.

                                                I had  a sore arm immediately and then headache after an hour or so (I don&#39;t get headaches normally). this lasted for 3 days. Then i was ok for 2 days then my arm started to hurt and i got a runny nose and a mild headache and fatigue. My nose ran so much i did not work the next day. I received a negative covid PCR test. then 1 day later my left arm started to itch, turn red and swell. It has continued through today (the swelling is about 4 inches by 3 inches, over my left deltoid). i just took Benadryl. i am now on day 9 post vaccination.

                                                Starting on Day 9 post injection I awoke with severe flu like symptoms:  severe headache, body aches, joint aches, fatigue, inability to get out of bed. Once I did get up I noted a severe red rash covering chest and extending up anterior neck (looked like a radiation burn). Symptoms lasted all day and made work or ADLs impossible. Felt about 75% better next day then symptoms returned the following day. Rash began peeling and appeared to look like a 2nd degree burn. Symptoms resolved by Day 4.

I felt dizzy and out of it. This lasted for 2-3 hours. The next day it was much better but I still feel that problem a little bit. Secondly, I felt tingling in my head, arms and legs since then, slowly waning.

                                                After sitting  for about 10 minutes, I noticed my tongue was swelling up in the back of my throat. I noticed my airway was narrowed and tongue felt very tight, but I was still able to breath. I told the man at the doorway assigned to help people find a seat after their shots. He said, &#34;We all have different reactions,&#34; brought me water, and I drank it.  After another 10 minutes, the symptoms were the same, not better not worse. After 10 more minutes the symptoms were better. And after another 10 minutes, I left.  When I made it back to my car, I noticed tightening across my forehead. This developed into a frontal lobe headache which continued off and on for the next 3 days. Also noted for the next 2 days was waking with swollen lips, face and extremities, and occasional ringing in the ears lasting 1-2 hours.

Episode lasted several hours, next 24 hours was dizzy, weak, and soreness of arm. Had another slight episode of dizziness, sinus congestion, tiredness, and chills on day 11 after the vaccine.

Continued, along with itching, for 2-3 days, then was mostly gone except a warmth and slight discoloration (pink, not red). Began to feel fatigue within the next week. Then, around 1/17 or 18, the heat, pain, itching, and redness returned, along with a painful swelling on the left side  bottom of my mouth, and on the left side bottom of my tongue.  I&#39;d been told someone I knew had pain as well, and was prescribed Benadryl, so I took the over-the-counter type as directed, and within the second dose (after 4 hours), the pain and swelling receded in my mouth and on my arm. Within a day, I had no more mouth pain, and the arm feels better, although it&#39;s still pink, itchy, and warm.

The swelling is very localized.

Next day itching was almost gone. By Wednesday January 27 I thought everything was gone. Getting dressed that night I noticed a red rash developed around or near injection site. About 1 inch by 2 inch oval, slightly raised, slightly warm, slightly itchy. This morning January 29, it is still there less itchy and less red, but still visible outline. I was being followed by vsafe up to wednesday afternoon the 27th. I thought I shouldn&#39;t wait til next week for the vsafe check in.

                                                While patient was waiting her 15 minutes after receiving the Moderna vaccine (1/21/2021), she complained of a bad pain in the left side of her neck &amp; that it was hard for her to breathe.  She was assisted by EMS (who was on site).  Her blood pressure was 249/149 per the patient.  She also experienced some lightheadedness.  It was strongly suggested by EMS &amp; nursing staff that she be transported to the ER but she refused stating she had to work the next day.  She continued to be monitored by EMS until her blood pressure stabilized &amp; she felt better.  She continued to refuse ER.  She was driven home by her companion.   On 1/28/2021 she sent an email to the health department showing a picture of her left arm showing redness from the injection site down to above the bend in her left arm.  She reported that on 1/26/2021 her physician  recommended that she not receive the second dose of Moderna.  She continues to complain of high blood pressure.  It is unkown if she takes medication for high blood pressure.

                                                About 3 PM she received her second vaccination for Covid.  She states that she has a history of adverse reactions to flu vaccines that are anaphylactic like in the past.  She usually premedicates with Benadryl and steroids.  Today she did take 100 mg of Benadryl prior to her vaccination.  Shortly after receiving the vaccine, she did feel like her throat was getting a little bit tight but she did not feel like it was true anaphylaxis.  However she then felt very off.  After this vaccine her throat started to feel tight, and she stated she did not feel well overall.  She did have some tunnel vision and was shaky. At about 1730 her heart rate drops to the 30s, she started feeling itchy, and then she went into a coughing fit and started to feel her throat close. She received 0.3 mg IM epinephrine, 20 mg IV famotidine, 125 mg IV methylprednisone, 0.5 mL of nebulized racepinephrine, and 500 mL NS bolus. She has since recovered and is stable on room air.

Saturday evening began feeling itchy and painful nerve pain throughout my body.  Finally went to ER on Sunday evening and kept as inpatient until Tuesday 2/16.  I was also on an antibiotic for an infection and Dr.  feels that this was the primary source of my reaction, but not sure if it was compounded by the vaccination.  It?s been a rough couple of days, but feeling better now.

                                                30 min after the injection I developed arm pain and a headache. Over the next 36 hours I developed a migraine, extreme body aches and severe arm pain. This was distinctly different arm and body pain compared to the first dose. I now understand the intractable headache after the first dose was a migraine. It was a horrible experience!!!!!!!. I laid down with ice on my body and finally took Tylenol after 24 hours. I was not able to get out of bed without pain; my life ceased for the duration. It was as it an alarm was set because ~ 6:00 a.m. Monday the 15th I woke up afraid to move only to learn that my body has reset and the pain was gone. I had returned to myself with only residual right arm pain.

                                                I received my second Moderna vaccine on 2/05/2021. Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I got a real bad headache, was very dizzy and felt very hot all inside my body. I reported  it to the nurse and she told me it was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to wait a little longer than the 15 minutes to see if it would go away. She gave me water and I did fell better and we left medical center. At around 5:30 pm that same day I started to get cold chills and body aches especially on my right side. my lower back and my right hip were hurting a lot and I was having trouble walking.at around 8:00 pm  my husband notice my right foot was very swollen and I notice by breast, my arm and hand, my underarm and leg were extremely swollen and painful. I did take a Tylenol because that is what they told me to take. I was freezing cold by the time I went to bed during the night I was sweating a lot. As of that day my symptoms were:      Swelling on my right side      Body aches, Headaches      Fever      Difficulty breathing/Shortness of Breath      Rapid heart rate ranging from 100-125 w/o doing anything      My neck and throat were very swollen around my thyroid area      Blurring vision      Chills and hot flashes       Fatigue/Malaise      Big round red welt around my injection site about 4 inches wide and hot to the touch I finally called medical center on 2/18/21 because I still had right leg, hip pain and swelling. I had a tele-med appointment with one of their doctors and she told me I had to first get a Covid-19 test to see if I didn&#39;t have Covid. Which the test did come out negative. She also told me that maybe the vaccine triggered something in my body that was causing all the swelling. I do have an appointment for chest, hip spine x-ray and lab work for 3/22/21. I still have the hip pain but not as bad. The person who gave me my Covid test results said I should report my symptoms.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

I took my temperature and headed to bed to rest, feel asleep and work up for another call and felt like my fever had broken with a sweat feeling. I felt much better and finished my night on call and home on holiday at 1 pm.

HAD A VERY MINOR HEADACHE THE TWO DAYS FOLLOWING THE VACCINE, JUST MILD DISCOMFORT.  FULLY RESOLVED ON ITS OWN AFTER TWO DAYS.  2.  MONDAY, JANUARY 4 WHEN I WOKE UP I FELT &#34;PUFFY&#34; - FEET AND HANDS WERE MILDLY SWOLLEN.  NOTICED MY SHOES FELT TIGHTER THAN USUAL AND HANDS FELT A BIT DIFFICULT TO FULLY CLOSE.  THIS IS FLUID RETENTION, AS IF YOU HAD TOO MUCH SALTY FOOD THE DAY BEFORE, AND I THOUGHT PERHAPS I HAD INGESTED MORE SALT THAN I REALIZED ON SUNDAY.  BUT IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE THAT OCCURRED FOR ME AND MY DIET DOES NOT INCLUDE MUCH SALT OR PROCESSED FOODS.  THEN TODAY MY FEET AND HANDS STILL FEEL PUFFY, SHOES STILL A BIT TIGHT AND HANDS A BIT HARD TO CLOSE SO THERE IS STILL SOME FLUID RETENTION GOING ON.  THIS IS QUITE UNUSUAL FOR ME, I AM QUITE HEALTHY AND HAVE A GOOD DIET AND DON&#39;T RECALL THIS HAPPENING BEFORE.    AGAIN, NOT AT ALL SURE THIS IS RELATED TO THE VACCINE, IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE HEAD COLD, BUT AS I AM NOT SURE AND THIS IS UNUSUAL AND HAS OCCURRED AFTER RECEIVING THE VACCINE, I FELT I SHOULD REPORT IT.  THIS EFFECT IS VERY MILD AND I AM NOT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AND IT.

It is hard to lift my left arm up and put it across my chest because that hurts. It hurts in my lymph nodes and my joints. I had to go the the ER on 12/31/20 because of this. they gave me a shot of Prednisoneand Hydroxyzihe that helped for a coupled of days and then I had to go back to the ER on 1/6/21 because of the same symptoms. They gave me Benadryl,prednisone and pepcid. I am still itching.

They gave me water and crackers and said try to eat something for second shot. After 30 mins I felt OK to leave. During the rest of the day I had a headache which worsen and next day (1/6/) the same and had that weird out of body sensation off and on. I also had mild achy feeling, fatigue and both hips and shoulders mild pain. I did take this day off from work. These symptoms resolved towards the end of that night. Doing much better today (1/8/21). I aslo had mild swelling and sore at the injection site which I expected like a flu shot. I have not had any reaction to any vaccination prior years.

All of these progressed within minutes starting at 8:20 AM. Treated by drinking water, relaxation breathing, sitting for a half hour. Left the facility at approx 9:15 AM, but stayed close as requested and was told not to drive as still not feeling right, but better. As the day progressed, developed chills, fatigue, nausea, some shortness of breath, mild exacerbation of asthma- cough, then mild fever, runny nose, severe pain left arm. Symptoms finally moderated to just fatigue and body aches by the evening.  Took 2 puff sof albuterol inhaler and 2 advil in the afternoon. Woke the next day with left arm pain, fatigue and continued to treat with advil through the day.  Woke today, Jan 9 feeling normal. I did decline suggestion of going to the ER or my PCP when BP remained elevated at 11:30 AM on date of vaccination, chose to go home to self monitor.

Was still kind of out of it but was able to communicate with nurses. Face is still black and blue. Last night got up at 4:00 a.m. something was wrong with her throat. Felt like a walnut was in her throat. Went to doctor this morning. They said it was a reaction from the shot. Got an EpiPen, prednisone. Call them in 2 days to let them know how she&#39;s doing and also wear a heart monitor because they do not know how to take care of her, Has had vision blurriness in both eyes. Has not felt well at all.

                                                Waited at the vaccine location 30 minutes and felt fine, driving home started to feel tingling and numbness on lips, face, face was puffy, mouth was dry, hard to swallow. Went to Medical Center as it was closest to home. This was about 1 hour after the shot was received. My chest was feeling tight when I arrived at the hospital and started with a slight headache.They checked my vitals BP was 146/91, pulse was 107, SPO2 was 98, temperature was 97.9. They gave me 2 Benadryl pills and had me stay in a room. After a few hours my vitals returned to normal and I was feeling better. They kept me a few more hours to make sure the symptoms did not return. I was discharged with a prescription for benadryl and zyrtec to take as needed. Only took the Benadryl that evening and the next morning with Tylenol. My arm was sore the next day but felt fine.

It was difficult to take deep breath?s. It felt like I had pulled a muscle there. Moving positions from sitting to standing or raising my right arm to scratch or reach for something caused the muscle pain to occur. After taking ibuprofen, water and rest the pain subsided a lot, but still continues. There was no increase in my temperature.

However, on day 8, there was a marked increase in redness, swelling, and itching similar to hives on the left deltoid.  After applying 2.5% cortisone cream (prescription I had on hand) and taking Ibuprofen and Tylenol for swelling and discomfort, the symptoms subsided over the next 3 to 5 days. On day 13 there is still occasional itching.

Chest pain, left sided stomach pain, and headache persisted through the night.  I was able to get some relief by takin a 325 mg Aspirin and an Advil every 2-3 hours through the night.  The chest pain was pretty bad, considered going to the ER, but persisted to fight it through to the morning.  In the morning, around 6:30 am I was exhausted, but the worst of the pain was over.  I did take another Aspirin and Advil around 8:00 am and stopped after that.  I did run a low grade fever off and on of 99.7 to 100.4.   I felt better on Saturday, but by noon I was feeling generally run down and again started to run a low grade fever off an on the rest of the day.  Sunday - what a joy to feel totally well!!

Took off work.  Fever spiked at about noon the day following the vaccine to 100.1  Tylenol then Ibuprofen was taken. By 6:30 am the next morning (today )all symptoms seem to be gone.  I think it may be important to know that I was sick with covid 19 in April/May of 2020 for almost 3 weeks

I stayed in bed and slept most of the day. It lasted 24 hours and then I felt back to normal.   I spoke with primacy care provider and she told me take Vitamin D since my annual labs the Vitamin D levels were and low. But she said just let it run it&#39;s course since it meant my immune system was working the way it was supposed to.

Very tired and did not feel well.  Low grade fever was sporadic.   Could not go to work. Called Dr. about symptoms and prescribe antiobiotic of Ceftin for the sore throat..  Sore throat went away after 24 to 48 hours of being on medicine. By day 10 all the skin reactions had calmed down and by day 12 was feeling good.  Dr. wanted me to report to you guys.  He was unsure if I should take the 2nd dose of vaccine.  He seemed confident throughout that this was an immune response to the vaccine.

Was noticeable for 2 days. Felt a little lethargic that day but not ill. No fever or pain. Did not see rash listed as a reportable event on VAERS site but was advised to report rash anyway.

On January 15 developed an itchy, red, hot rash about 1/2 inch below injection site.  The area was approximately 3 in by2.5 in with swelling.  Also had 5 hives break out on my body.  I took 1/2 a Benedryl and used clobetasol propionate ointment on the area until the rash went away (7 days).  The swelling took another 5 days to subside.

                                                I got the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine late last Wednesday afternoon (1/20).  Before the 2nd dose, I premedicated (as instructed by my PMD office) with Benadryl 50mg and Pepcid 20mg (for the histamine blocking effect) since I had terrible itching for about 36 hrs after the 1st dose; but the itching didn&#39;t begin-after the 1st dose-until about 8hrs after the shot &amp; became intense 2 more hrs later.  I had itching the night of the 2nd dose that kept me awake part of the night but was FAR less intense than after the 1st dose.  I came to work Thurs not feeling ill--just cold and tired all day (I attributed to the cold weather and not sleeping well).  Thurs about noon I began feeling ill--like I was coming down with the flu; I went home after my shift and found my temp to be 100.4.  Shortly thereafter it was 100.9.  I thought it would pass by morning so I just showered, drank fluids, took Tylenol and slept.  By 0200ish Fri 1/22 I still had a fever of 100.9 (even with Tylenol on board), a bad headache, sinus congestion, and significant neck and back pain so I called out for work.  I continued to treat the fever and by noon Fri the fever finally had resolved-along with the head, neck and back pain. I&#39;ve been fine since.

On Jan. 25:  Went to bathroom around 3:15 p.m. with diarrhea and became woozy so decided to get off of the toilet and sit down on the floor.  Husband found me semi conscious on the floor with drool at about 4:10 p.m.  He tried to awaken me and found me not lucid, speech was garbled, fragmented responsiveness and could not keep upright position, could not give details to the situation.  Husband called 911.  Ambulance transported to hospital ER   during hospital exams and tests patient was not lucid and this continued for the next 32  hours.  EKG, EEG, CT scan, MRI, Blood/Lab work;  all tests were negative indicating no seizure , healthy heart, clear brain scan, no stroke, white blood count normal, dehydrated. All tests negative with all doctors unable to find a reason for this situation other than the Moderna vaccine considered highly for the situation.  Advised patient not to take the second dose of Moderna.

                                                Awakened by very painful left arm (7 on 1-10 scale), headache (3-4), general discomfort and restlessness.  Within one hour, progressed to bone-rattling, teeth-chattering chills and inability to get warm for several hours, neck and low back pain (7-8), general intense fatigue but inability to sleep because of other discomforts.  Over-the-counter Tylenol and a warm magnesium bath temporarily diminished symptoms, but relief was short-lived.  Symptoms progressed in early afternoon to diarrhea for about 2 hours and increased fatigue, temperature up to 100.2 (my normal 97.6), headache pain progressed to 4-5, neck and low back remained 7-8.  Tylenol seemed to have no effect.  Evening (5pm) brought nausea and increased overall discomfort, fatigue, and pain.  Aspirin - no effect.  At 11:30 p.m. I took Motrin 600 mg and was then able to doze off and on.  Throughout I remained very thirsty and consumed many glasses of water and herbal tea. Awoke at 3:45 a.m. 2/22 with only very slight headache, no nausea.  Slept soundly until 6:30 a.m.  Some fatigue persists, with left-sided pain (5-6) in neck and low back.  Left arm remains sore (3-4).  No great appetite, but no nausea

Increasing fatigue which maxed around 11am accompanied by  cold shivers and increased body temp . Fever picked at 5pm to 101.3F.  By 10pm fever and fatigue were gone! Day 2 after the vaccination: a red rash size 2 inch x 3 inch on the arm around the place of the injection, pain in the arm was nearly gone, no fever, no fatigue. Day 3 after the vaccination: red rash is gone. Back to normal.

Then on Thursday, every joint in her body hurt and this continued until Saturday.  On Saturday she had a big red whelt on the arm that progressively got larger.  She still has some aches in her joints, but not as severe.  The rash is deep red today, swollen with hard ridges, very itchy and very hot to touch.  She has not taken anything for it.  She has been having a harder time than usual breathing, but not sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.  She has less than 20% of her lungs.

Contacted via phone and e-mail, Occupational Health Services on 1/1/2021. I also saw  an ED physician at on 1/1/2021 who said a local inflammation reaction was unlikely, probably cellulitis, and prescribed doxycycline. The affected area of my arm was marked to follow progression of red, warm area.  Began doxycycline 1/1/2021. Next morning red, warm area of arm is now outside of marked area and down to below my elbow.  I have an appointment with Occupational Health on Monday, January 4,2021.

Some heart fluttering and some slight shortness of breath beginning a couple of days after.  More a nuisance.  No other symptoms I&#39;m aware of although every little thing I feel now I think may or may not be a symptom like slight head throb but not consistent pain.  Not sure because of vaccine.

I went to bed but awoke hot, then alternated with cold frequently. I began having twitching in my hands which kept me awake.  These symptoms continued until morning. Toward the AM, about 0500, I had fluttering sensations in my body.

                                                Within 30 seconds to 1 minute, I had a strange taste in my mouth. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, just different. Following this I began to feel bad. It felt as if my blood pressure dropped. I became dizzy and had to hold my head up with my hands. Thank God, I was in my car when I got this injection, or I would have fainted. I felt my temp increase, and my breathing and heart rate became rapid. I used meditation to get my breathing under control, and within a few minutes, I broke out in a cold sweat all over. Then these symptoms subsided and I felt much better. This entire reaction was under 5 minutes.  15 minutes after the injection, a nurse returned to my car and I told her that the vaccine triggered a hot flash or something. My arm became very sore, and that night I felt a goose-egg lump, very warm at the injection site. Also, the left side of my throat felt tight, and it hurt. This morning my arm is still very sore, but no lump, and my throat feels better.

I took Tylenol and Ibuprofen all night and all day and could not get relief.  I missed a day of work because of this. I am still with fever as of 5:55 pm and the body aches and migraine.

I thought that someone was supposed to call and check on us each day....

The soreness lasted only one day and then no other symptoms until day 8.  On day 8, the injection site was red, itchy and raised.  Then yesterday, day 9 my are was tender to touch, VERY RED and HOT and expanding all over my arm, now in the back of my arm.  All the time remaining afebrile.  V-safe will only check in with me once a week from day 7, for 5 weeks, I am told so I wanted to report this.  I am waiting for a call from my PCP.  She is considering cellulitis, that is how red and hot it is but it is only tender, not hurting or requiring any pain medication.  I have good range of motion, too.

                                                24 hours after the vaccine I had a 102 fever overnight.  The next day, my feet were hurting, like burning.  They continued like this but with fluctuating severity.  My calves and shin muscles began to be sore.  I sought out acupuncture and myofascia release work to help.  It did help temporarily.  I started to have left ankle pain, not like a sprain, like tendonitis or inflammation.  It continued to hurt to walk and the muscles more painful.  I started having darker urine about 4 days after the vaccine.  I drank cranberry juice and took a kidney/bladder supplement, increased fluids, but it continued dark.  I went to the Urgent Care on January 7th c/o muscle pain and dark urine.  My blood pressure was elevated, 179/100..unusual for me, and my urine was neg so it was sent for culture and blood was drawn for CBC and metabollic panel and Creatine Kinase

                                                Upon awakening the morning after the vaccination, I experienced swelling in my ankles, feet and fingers I also experienced swelling in my face where I had received filler injections six months ago. I also experienced feeling very spacey and foggy in addition to ringing in my ears, pins and needles all over my skin as well as a burning sensation on my upper back, buttocks and thighs.  Finally,  I felt extremely fatigued and lethargic.  I had no fever or headache but had soreness at the injection site.  I dosed with  600 mg of ibuprofen b.i.d. the first day as well as 50 mg of Benadryl at bedtime.  While I got some relief from these medications,  I still remain symptomatic on day two after receiving the vaccination.

                                                Hi,  I was vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine (1st administration) on 1/13/21. I have had persistent and very significant swelling since that day and it has not abated as of today, 1/20/21. The reason for this report is that I believe the swelling is not typical axillary swelling which I believe would be right under the arm where the lymph nodes are; rather it is located lower down and much farther away from where the lymph nodes are under my arm. It is a large swelling that is located to the side of my chest on the same side of the body as my vaccinated arm (which was my left arm).   I have not checked fever but do not think I have any. I do have headache as of today. Can you advise on whether this swelling is a typical reaction and whether there are any steps I should take at this time ?  Thanks very much,

                                                Had headache, fatigue, brain fog for 3 days also very sore arm. On day 8 after the vaccine my arm became red with an area the size of a silver dollar , below the injection site. My lymph nodes under my arm were swollen and sore and also lymph nodes above my clavicle on the right. I still feel fatigued and I have a full feeling around the area of my right upper abdomen ( liver), I dont have a gallbladder. Otherwise, I am OK. Just wondering about the 2nd dose. Lymph node still slightly swollen above clavicle.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a 62-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylactic reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as reported, included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome.  On 24 Jan 2021, about 15 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24 Jan 2021, 30 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient took prednisone (dose unknown), per instructions from her doctor due to her history of anaphylactic reactions. She did notify the vaccinators of her history and there was an ambulance present. About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient started coughing, had heavy chest pain, trouble breathing, and felt like her throat was constricting more than usual. No rash developed. She approached the ambulance and asked if she could take diphenhydramine. She took one dose, followed by 3 other doses, and felt a bit better. Consent given for Safety to follow up with patient.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event, anaphylactic reaction was resolving at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62 year old female patient with medical history of included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome. She experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction that needed treatment diphenhydramine. The event occurred approximately 15 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration even thought the patient took prednisone prior to receiving the vaccine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                My right arm was painful at the injection site for 3 days after the vaccination.  Then on Wednesday, February 3, 2021 about 3:45pm I experienced shortness of breath and some chest discomfort.  At approximately 6:00pm, I felt a strong pulsating at my left temple which continued through the night.  I took my blood pressure and it was 150/90 and pulse was 103 which is the highest reading I have ever had because I am on blood pressure medication.  I took 2 aspirin, my Proventil Inhaler, and another Losartan 50 mg even though I had already taken my daily dose in the morning.  I rested and continued to monitor my vitals.  At about 11:30pm, I took my blood pressure and it was 160/110 and pulse was 109.  I then took 2 more aspirin and my Clonazapem and fell asleep.  In the morning on February 4, 2021, I tried to get in to see my doctor, but she advised to go to the emergency room.  I went to an Urgent Care facility and the checked me and did an EKG and that was normal.  But they also advised me to go to the emergency room.  So I did go and they did another EKG, chest x-ray, and several blood tests.  They came back normal but they wanted me to stay overnight for observation.  On February 5, 2021 they did an echocardiogram and a stress test, which were normal.  I was released from the hospital that afternoon.  I have a follow up appointment with my Primary Care Physician on February 12, 2021.  My blood pressure and pulse continue to be a little higher than normal.  At this point, the pulsating, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort have improved.  On Saturday, February 6, 2021, I noticed felt itchiness, redness and swelling at the injection site on my right arm.  It is still itchy, red and swollen as of February 8, 2021.  I am putting hydrocortisone cream on it.

Then 7 days after the vaccine my injection site became very swollen, red, very hard in the injection area and itchy.  I also felt slightly achy and had a headache for 3 days before that. Now 2 days later the reddened area is larger and circular like a target. Skin is warm to the touch and itchy.  I?m no longer achy and no more headaches.  The swelling in the left arm has decreased slightly but the redness is bigger.

                                                I developed chills/shivering in the evening of the vaccination (2/19/21) but was not alarmed, just tried to stay warm.  I ate normally.   I awakened in the night with extreme chills and was shaking most of the night, unable to get warm.  I felt feverish and had body aches as well as nausea.  I threw up what I could to alleviate the feeling of nausea, about 2 a.m.   I slept restlessly until 9:00 am, then tried to take a hot shower.  Though the chills were gone, I felt weak and listless and went back to bed shortly after showering.  I slept for about 4 hours.  I had little/no appetite for most of the day after the vaccine.  By the second day I still had a headache but felt better, albeit weak.   I took Ibuprofen for the body/headaches with minimal success.

It began on February 13, 2021, which was 2 days after injection.  Redness subsided some, but on day 8 after injection, area became more red, hard, feverish and sore.  Also, I have  soreness under arm near lymph nodes.  I visited my Primary Care Physician today and was prescribed a steroid pack.

Tylenol did little to decrease this fever, motrin seemed to bring it down for about and hour then would go back up again. Temp stayed between 102 to 103 through Sunday 2/21/21. Temp 99-101 on Monday 2/22/21. Today as I report, temp is 99 and continue to feel very fatigued with no energy and poor appetite.

                                                Approximately 6 hours after receiving the injection I started running a temperature of 102.7 and feeling absolutely terrible all over.  Shortly there after I was having such sharp pains in my joints (pretty much all over) that I couldn&#39;t get out of a chair without much assistance.  Then I couldn&#39;t walk only barely shuffle y feet with my husband holding onto me.  I was very short of breath at this point with a pulse ox reading starting at 76 and finally reaching 88, but would not climb any higher.  I was very nauseous and unable to eat or drink.  The following day my temperature was still running 101, but not continuously.  I still felt bad, but could shuffle walking without assistance and was still nauseous.  I pretty much stayed in a recliner chair all that day, except to try to take a shower, which I really had a feeling I wasn&#39;t going to survive.  I went to bed without dressing, because felt so bad.  The next day I felt better, but was so short of breath I had to have a rolling chair to sit in to try to do something in the kitchen.  By afternoon February 15, 2021 I was feeling better, Only shortness of breath when walking and my pulse ox was 92.  Should I take the second Moderna vaccine?

Had to sit down for a long time, couldn&#39;t really open my eyes. Bad head feeling. Eyes hurt, but were not swollen. No swelling, just that constant metallic overwhelming. Dizzy. Stayed at pharmacy for about 40 minutes. On drive home, hot face, metallic infusion, very warm. Fever at home,  achy all over, 99.8, very dizzy, brain fog, very weak, arm sore. Next morning, no better. Took a Nexium and immediately big hive popped up on my chest. Disappeared about an hour later. Took 3 days to feel like myself. Still concerned about allergic reaction. I&#39;m a little itchy, tingly. I&#39;m now terrified of getting that second shot.

I&#39;m pretty stubborn, and have continued to work despite sxs.  I missed last Friday 2/19 because the pain was so severe.

                                                A 63-year-old female with a medical history of Hashimoto?s Disease, on Levothyroxine 88 micrograms (4 days per week) and 100 micrograms (3 days per week), presented to the emergency department with a 7-day history of acute onset of severe, debilitating, fatigue, weakness, anorexia and malaise. She had no clear precipitating events, stated that she was in her usual states of health, active, working as an optometrist at a University hospital. Stated that 1 week before symptom oncer she had her first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Stated that 24hrs later her symptoms started associated with low grade subjective fever, however her fever disappeared, and she persisted with severe fatigue. She was unable to do her regular activities of daily living and was hoping her symptoms would resolve but upon persistence and given the severity of her complains she presented to evaluation. She denied recently starting any new medications/supplements, or recent change in her levothyroxine dose. There were no headaches, cough, diarrhea, sore throat, rhinorrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, weakness, recent infectious illness or sick contacts. She was diagnosed with Hashimoto?s Disease over 10 years prior and had been on the same dose for more than 2 years.   VS were stable and within normal limits, physical exam was only remarkable for weakness on 4 extremities 4/5, lethargy, bradylalia, bilateral ptosis, no focal neurologic deficits, sensation intact. Laboratory workup revealed normal Hb 14.8, normal renal and kidney function, normal cortisol level, TSH normal 3.7, normal FT4: 1.2, normal CPK, negative tox screen. ESR and CRP were performed, and both were found to be elevated ESR 74, CRP 28, at that moment we decided to do immunologic workup showing high titers of ANA &gt;1:320 with a nuclear speckled pattern, and a positive rheumatoid factor 60. At this point a full rheumatologic panel was performed which was negative for anti-Ach receptor Abs, negative anti-CCP, anti- dsDNA, anti-smith, negative anti-Jo1, anti-RNP, negative anti-TPO, negative anti-SCL70, normal C4 and C3 however elevated total CH50 &gt; 60, positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Her symptoms of severe fatigue persisted throughout her admission and it was decided to give her a course of prednisone 40mg for 5 days and follow up as outpatient with a Rheumatologist. Repeat workup 2 weeks after discharge showed still elevated ESR at 72, high CRP 17, rheum factor elevated again at 67.  At this point no clear cause was identified as she did not have any symptoms of Sjogren or anything else other than severe persisting fatigue.  Another course of steroids was given and 1 month later she stated that she was much improved and was able to go back to work. Stated that she would not take her second covid MODERNA vaccine dose due to fear of recurrence of symptoms. It appeared that this vaccine triggered a severe inflammatory and autoimmune reaction in this patient with history of Hashimoto?s disease. The association between MODERNA vaccine and development of autoimmunity and inflammatory reaction needs to be assessed.

On 03/27/2021, her nausea continued and she complained of shortness of breath while walking. On 03/28/2021, she was short of breath before vomiting a small amount. She then became unresponsive. Death was pronounced a short time later.  Per her treating physician who signed the death certificate, the cause of death is felt to be probable myocardial infarction due to electrolyte abnormalities due to complications of her diabetes mellitus.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

Same symptoms continued for about 48 hrs then felt better but still with some arthralgias and fatigue.  I had covid-19 virus in MArch 2020.  Felt pretty much the same way post vaccine as I felt then. Wondering if this reaction could be due to fact that I had virus previously and also wondering about second dose? Have there been reports of worse S/E in people who have had virus previously?

Observation of swelling then 2 Benadryl were given.  BP monitored. After about 15 minutes or longer swallowing slowed down  some.   BP did start coming down.  A friend came to get me and I took 2 more Benadryl  about 4 hours later due to swallowing issues again.  After about 6 hours after that took more Benadryl and the the next 2 days just as needed about every 8 to 10 hours   Started  chills with highest temperature was  99.4.  K Legs felt heavy the morning after the vaccine and  I felt very tired with some short bursts of Nausea

I couldn&#39;t figure out why as I got proper sleep the night before so powered through until leaving work at 4 pm. When I got home I ate a small amount, I wasn&#39;t hungry and went to bed at 5 pm and slept through until 6 am. during the night I noticed my arm bothering me, itchy but didn&#39;t get up to check on it. When I woke this a.m. my arm had a big red bump, warm to the touch and itchy so now I&#39;m convinced the fatigue was related to the COVID vaccine. I feel fine, I am not tired today but I am aware of my arm and it is itchy. I am surprised this happen a week later.

                                                Day following vaccine, had extreme fatigue, headache, low grade fever, injection site redness  and swelling. All symptoms subsided after the first 48 hours with the exception of the injection site redness that lasted for 5 days along with itching at the site. The redness is now gone but itching at the site still remains at the injection site as of today-day 10. I consider the itching to be a minor side effect, and not severe enough to prevent me from getting the 2nd vaccination.

I woke up on Saturday and my arm soreness had increased.  Later that evening I went to bed and was awoken with extreme pain in my back and neck.  It felt as if it may be serve nerve pain.  It lasted all day Sunday, with light headiness.  On Monday, I continued to have muscle tightness and soreness throughout my back; later in the evening my stomach started to hurt and I was extremely nausea.  Today Tuesday, I continue to feel out of sorts, with upset stomach and muscle fatigue.  No treatment as I do not know who to speak to.

                                                Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021 I felt a little strange.  Just not myself. A little dizzy.  Went to work overnight.  Got up at 5 am Friday, Jan 8, 2021.  Still felt odd.  Dizzy. Had to think before I did anything. I stood up from the bed and sat back down again as if I was dizzy and confused.  Drove myself home from work, fed the cats and went right to bed.  I felt very fatigued, had developed a monster headache.  Was dizzy, had chills, body aches, nausea.  I brought  water bottle over to the bed with me but after laying down just could not get myself up to get a drink.  Felt very fatigued.   Slept until 2 pm.  Took my temperature.  It was 101.5.  Had no energy, ate no food, took no meds, just went back to sleep.  Still nauseous, had headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Woke up at 5:00 pm to feed cats.  That?s all I did, and go to the bathroom.  Took my temperature again.  It was 100.9.  Still felt awful:  nauseous, headache, dizziness, fatigue, body aches, chills.  Seemed like I could  not get warm.  Stayed in bed and slept.  Saturday, Jan.  9, 2021 I woke up around 7:30 to go to the bathroom.  I fed the cats also.  Still dizzy, moving slow.  My headache was gone, but still felt unsteady.  After feeding the cats,  I went back to bed.  Slept until 12:30 that afternoon.

Within 2 hours, I could not continue to work and went home. Took motrin at home and rested.  The following morning  the headache was mild but the injection site was very painful. No reddness or swelling, not firm but extremely tender to touch. Pain at injection site was present for 2 days then resolved slowly..

                                                Approx. 12:30am I awoke to a leg cramp. I arose from bed and stood up till the cramping muscle relaxed.  Then I walked to the restroom and during the short distance,I felt a sudden &#34;flush&#34;.  Upon entering restroom, I felt I was getting faint.  Feeling that I was about ready to faint, I tried to easily lower myself to the floor without striking my head or body.  Feeling very dizzy and faint, my stomach instantly felt nauseous and then vomited.  After vomiting, I  suddenly started to &#34;shake very violently&#34; (chills?).  The shaking was uncontrollable and went on for approx. 10 -15 min.  I tried to relieve the violent shaking by covering up with bath towels, that I was able to reach from the floor, where I was still sitting; but that did not seem to help.  After I did not feel so faint, I called for help to have my husband help me back into bed to try to warm up.  By that time the shaking (chills) were no longer so severe, and I was gradually able to fall back to sleep with no further problems the remainder of the night.  The following morning, and ever since that night, I have had no other adverse reactions.   For many years, I have received the yearly flu vaccine and have never had any kind of reaction, accept some minor soreness at the injection site (muscle).

She stated that she was dizzy but that she does suffer from vertigo already. She said these symptoms lasted about a week. On the 1/14/21 she was tachycardic, dizzy, weak and she had a raised red rash distal to the site of injection. She went to urgent care and was diagnosed with cellulitis and prescribed an antibiotic. On 1/17/21 she went back to urgent care since the rash had migrated and appeared patchier than cellulitis. Her doctor said that he did not believe it to be cellulitis at this time and prescribed her a steroid cream.

                                                About 14 hours after vaccination, I had a (really bad) pulsating headache in a band around my head, body aches (hip flexors, shoulders, back, neck), chills, fever/sweats, and nausea/vomiting (threw up twice, total, about an hour or two apart after not eating for 10 hours - small amount of liquid came up). The nausea/vomiting went away about 4 hours after onset while the other symptoms remained for an additional 42 hours. I also had sinus/eye pressure that began about 22 hours after vaccination and ended with the other symptoms. Could not sleep for the duration because of headache. Very tired/sleepy about 62 hours after injection and was able to nap since headache went away. I still have soreness at injection site about 72 hours after injection.  I would say the worst part of this was the headache because it was so bad, I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything while I had it - I had read that NSAIDs might reduce the uptake of the vaccine so didn&#39;t want to take any. Therefore, there was no way to get rid of the headache and it was very unpleasant for almost 3 days. The next worst was the nausea/vomiting, because, well, nausea/vomiting, and especially because there was nothing to bring up. And, unlike vomiting from bad food or something, you don&#39;t really feel better afterward, just still nauseated. The other symptoms were more bearable. Did not call or see doctor because I had read about these possible side effects and didn&#39;t think there was anything the doctor could do to alleviate them.

There had been a local injection site reaction as well as fatigue and headache starting 24  hours after vaccine administration, which had resolved entirely within 72 hours.  New onset of injection site reaction began with pruritis only, starting in the morning 7 days after the vaccination, which progressed to include fatigue, erythema and induration during that day and into the next (today, the day of reporting). Oral certrizine was taken the evening that symptom recrudescence began, with some relief of pruritis but not erythema or induration.

However 13th day after receiving injection  I developed severe fatigue, fevers as high as 101.9, shaking, nausea, severe itching.  overall feeling of sick.  3 days later it passed. Due to my preexisting conditions I have isolated myself for almost 1 year, followed all protocols, and very rarely out in public. I also recieved flu vaccine.  So doubt the symptoms I had could be contributed to flu bug. So since it seemed very odd I am reporting this to CDC. Note: I had 2nd dose 02/19/21. So far only reaction is sore injection site. Should I develop symptoms after several days like the ones I reported after 1st dose, I will report these to this site.

On 2/20/21 still a slight headache, took 2 Tylenol then went out and walked about a mile, visited family, then walked back home.  By the time I got home I was barely able to walk up the stairs.  Felt exhausted and nauseous.  Slept for a few hours and got up and just sat on the couch for another few hours and then felt that same nausea and exhaustion and went to bed. Took 2 more Tylenol. Started drinking more water.  On 2/21/21 felt pretty good -- stayed in all day -- ate a little -- but saw the site on my arm just under the injection site was very large, red, and hot to the touch.  The red welt area went from just below the injection in the left arm to just above the elbow.   On 2/22/21 (today) feel pretty good.  Drinking a lot of water and tool 1 Tylenol.

At about 10pm when I went to bed, I had issues falling asleep because my heart felt like it was pounding through my chest.   That pounding came off and on during the next day.  I woke up twice and my feet were ice cold and my body was very hot.  The second time I woke I thought I would take some tylenol and was extremely dizzy walking to the bathroom.  I was so weak I couldn&#39;t open the bottle.  I slept nine hours, very unusual.  I felt very under the weather all day until around 5pm.  I woke up the next morning feeling pretty normal.  The arm pain was completely gone by the 18th.

I slowly went into the post office and was offered a chair.  It was over as fast as it hit me and everything was fine after that. No other adverse effects since then

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

I sat down to tie my shoe and noted Pitting &#43; 3 or 4 edema to BIL Calves.  Redness , warmth in a few areas.  R leg 1&#34; larger than L.  Then  I mentioned it to another nurse and  she said it could be side affect of Norvasc.  I spoke with my PA about it on 2/12 she D&#39;C&#39;d Norvasc and perscribed  Nefidepine 30 mg ER. I have not taken it yet I am monitoring my BP and it is WNL.   The edema less in calves however continues in ankles.  I have gotten MULTIPLE broken capillaries all over my legs.          Long short it has to be a reaction to vaccine.  And it continues almost 2 months after injection.   I can&#39;t wear most of my socks.  It is BAD.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

Hip to below knew, dull and numbish; from below knee thru toes, same tingling as fingers. Biggest concern was side of face and jaw; dull and numbish. All these reactions occurred on right side of body. Thursday late afternoon, the tingling and the dull and numbish diminishes but the arm aching along with inability to completely raise remains. Friday; arm remains the same Saturday; arm below injection site now feels only bruised NOTE: while I enjoy a strong immune system, by body is very sensitive to new medicines/tweaking medicines. Also applies to food.  APPROX 25 years ago, I believe I contracted Gullian Barre, where the immune system attacks nervous system. There was./is no test to confirm although I continue to endure some side effects. QUESTION- with all said is it advisable to receive the 2nd vaccine shot?   Please advise ASAP

                                                The person who gave me the shot placed the injection too low on my arm. It should have been up near the shoulder, but instead the person gave it to me down toward the middle of my arm. I knew something was wrong immediately because it felt so warm and disruptive. The doctor on the scene said it was nothing. Nine days later I went to Urgent Care with swelling, hot-to-the-touch, itchy and a huge knot. The Urgent Care Dr. gave me a five-day prescription for Prednisone and also gave me a prescription for hydroXYzine pamoate, which is an antihistimine.

                                                Reported to me by onsite staff:  Patient seemed to tolerate the vaccine fine at time of administration.  Following day (appx 24 hours) following administration, patient was having fever and unresponsive.  Patient also had local, large, hard hematoma at injection site.  It is worth noting that the patient had recently completed CDC recommended isolation protocol, and was symptom free at time of administration - determining they were qualified to get vaccine.  The facility is also aware that the patient&#39;s present condition could be related to an active COVID 19 infection / relapse.

I didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath or chest pain. My pulse ox was 98-99.My symptoms started within 20  mins of  vaccination and lasted for almost 2 hours on and off before they were resolved. I didn&#39;t need any medical intervention like O2 or IV administration of fluids or any medications. I was under observation and dranks about 30 oz of water to keep myself hydrated . Once I felt better I drove home and rested for whole day and didn&#39;t go out. I didnt have any recurrence of these symptoms later that day or next day.

I was taken to a room and had vitals and was hypertensive and tachycardic with a worsening headache, I was given 50 mg Benadryl and put ice on my face and neck for about 20 minutes as I felt I was burning up. I remained at the clinic for an hour for monitoring. I never had difficulty breathing , and it was mostly resolved in about 45 minutes except for the mild headache and my face was still red and my eyes were swollen for at least an hour.

I spoke to the nurse who hooked me up to bp machine. O2 sat was fine at 98. BP was 158/110, pulse rate was 157. Normal values for me are bp 120/70, pulse 80. BP started to go down and several minutes later another flush happened and bp and pulse rate went back up. Dropped again then third flush with increased bp and pulse happened. After this vitals went back to normal and didn&#39;t happen again. I subsequently developed a pounding headache which lasted until the next morning. Arm was sore as expected. BP that night was normal and the next morning normal. No further adverse effects noted other than fatigue.

A week later, increased soreness at injection site, entire upper third portion of my  arm was red, warm to the touch, sometimes itchy.  Arm felt tight and firm.  Slight headache which advil seemed to manage throughout the day.   1/12/21 woke with jaw pain, neck pain in back of neck on both sides, headache, temp of 99.2.  Took advil.  Two hours later all those symptoms were gone and did not return.  I have felt fine ever since. Arm is no longer sore, but redness still present, though seems to be lessening.

Light adverse side effects right after the vaccine was administered. Remained under supervision for 45 minutes longer instead of 15 min. Within 5 mins, heat rose up to my head causing dizziness &amp; head spin. Then loss of smell lasting for 10 min or a bit longer, then tongue tied hard / swollen for 3 hrs and lasting mildly 1 day after. Severe dehydration. Did not monitor heart beat due to severe fatigue. Took blood pressure rising and falling like roller coaster 2x. I stop and learned to relax and sleep throughout the day to calm the nervous system and the slight fever. Other normal aching pains as pre-described side effects. No nausea, vomiting, no rash as of 1 day after and no difficult breathing. Occasional and short loss of smell carried after 1st day.

                                                Same as my previous experience with COVID in March 2020. Severe headache, body aches, chills, fever, exhaustion and diarrhea, Slight chills and arm soreness at bedtime the evening of vaccine. Woke up the next morning after vaccine in complete body pain. Diarrhea began later in day. Exactly like my COVID experience! Slept all day except to take Tylenol and Imodium.  Woke second day after vaccine feeling improvement but still tired and weak. On couch most of day. Today, 3rd day after vaccine,  much improved but still not 100%.  Will never get the 2nd dose! Have heard it is usually worse and I would probably not be able to handle it

                                                On Saturday on the 16th I started itching all over my body and my head, dry mouth and my ears were itching as well. On Sunday I noticed the itching  increased after taking my  levothyroxine. The 18th I noticed the same pattern of itching increasing after taking the levothyroxine the dry mouth as continued. Have not been sleeping well. The 19th same pattern occurred. I also developed a slight headache. I have been using lots of lotion. The itching appears to worsens after taking the Levothyroxine and after showering. The 20th same thing, but the headache was worse so I took two aspirins. The 21st was a big change, my heart was racing the normal pattern but at 1pm in the afternoon while walking home I noticed a burning sensation on my rear-end. When I made it home I noticed an elongated redden area it was very red and I put some cream triple antibiotic cream on there. It was burning very badly. The evening I went back to work  my body started itching again, I noticed the area where I received the vaccine was red and hard under the skin about 3inch diameter area. Took a shower and put antibiotic cream. Today after taking my pill in the morning itching came back, and the redden area at the injection site looks like hives now . The redden area on my bottom has improved. My heart was also racing again.   I did called the hospital last night  and was supposed to receive a return call which I have not received yet.

The feeling in chest and back would last about 10 seconds, subside for a little while and then start again. This happened off and on for about an hour. The tingling in legs continued for about 2 hours. About 1 hour after I received vaccine I started having vision problems, blurriness, strange spots /lights , had trouble focusingnmyneyes. Then a terrible headache set in. I have had similar vision problems with a migraine headache in the past. Felt like it triggered a migraine. Vitals were normal. Checked out by EMS and went to local ER.

Approximately 12:30-1:00 AM on 01/09/2021 woke up, turned my head and experienced room spinning dizziness for about 2 minutes. Had to remain completely still to stop the room spinning.  For the next 2 days (until the morning of Monday 01/11/2021)  I experienced on and off room spinning dizziness at unpredictable intervals.  Usually didn&#39;t last longer than 2 minutes but had to remain completely still to stop the spinning.   Starting on Monday 01/11/2021 had &#34;normal&#34; dizziness along with some flu like symptoms,  headache, tiredness,  soreness/achiness and extreme soreness and pain in my left upper arm where I received the vaccine shot. I stayed out of work because of the on-going dizziness. These symptoms continued until Saturday 01/16/2021.  I took an antihistamine on Saturday night and finally woke up Sunday 01/17/2021 with no dizziness.

                                                About 6 minutes after the vaccination I begin to experience throbbing pain in the base of the right side of my neck.  I sat back and pushed my head back to see if it would stop but it didnt. 5 minutes after that pain begin radiating up and down my right leg from the thigh to mid calf.  I was checked and monitored for about 15 minutes then my mouth got really dry but even with water it was still very very dry.  After my mouth was still really dry and the pain continued  to radiate I was sent to the urgent care and advised to walk around, so the nurse assisted me in walking around the urgent  care.  I was able to walk but was wobbly and after some time the NP assessed me.  I was given an icepack to put on the base of my neck.  My BP raised and I begin to have a high pitch noise ringing sensation in my ear, sore throat and it felt as if I just needed to keep drinking because my mouth still felt really dry.  I was recline back and my legs were elevated to try to help lower my BP.  And after about 20 minutes my BP lowered and I was continued to be monitored.  I was advised they would not give me any steroids because it would counteract the vaccine but was given a shot of torodol and benedryl to help with the pain.  I had body aches and my arm at the injection site was sore as well. I was monitored for another 30-45 minutes long and was released and was taken off work for the remainder of the day and rested.   The next day the leg pain was gone but the dry mouth, body aches and the fatigue was still there for about another week.

                                                The afternoon after I developed chills and had goose bumps all over.  I didnt have a fever but the chills went on for several hrs so I took 2 500mg tylenol and the chills ended around 5pm.  I developed a headache and still had to continue to drink plenty water because my mouth got that super dry feeling again.  I went home ate and relaxed until I fell asleep.  I had body aches and because my arm was hurting I couldnt lay on that side.  I took benedryl and tylenol before bed. Today I still feel very very tired, fatigued and my body still aches.  My arm is still really red, warm to the touch and has a nice knot at the injection site and the headache comes and goes.

Took tylenol before getting vaccine, and the next day around 4 in the morning started having malaise, pain, fever, chills. (fever around 102), and went 104 around midafternoon, and 106 around 10. Chills, pain, weakness. Next day I was feeling well. I started noticing small dots on knee and shoulder. And then I started noticing bruising on my hands and legs. Felt fine on Sunday. I started noticing the bruises were becoming more pronounced. On Monday when I woke up the bruises were worse, and I went to the ER. The doctor checked CBC and platelets count was low around 28 thousand and was admitted into the hospital and they treated me with solumedrol 100 mg. Platelets count went back up.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 039K20A) on 31 Dec 2020.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 209K20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an undisclosed date the patient experienced injection site soreness, generalized body pain all over, chills, low grade fever and weakness.  She also went to the hospital because she had a platelet count of 28,000.   Treatment of these events was not provided.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events, platelet count of 28,000, generalized body pain all over, weakness, on and off chills, low grade fever, and vaccination site soreness, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Part of the vaccine ran out at time of injection.  The night of the injection my arm started itching.  I was awakened at 4;00 a.m. the next morning with a very stiff, sore, cramping arm.  I had the normal reactions: slight headache, low temp, itchy, swollen, hot red arm, but very stiff and sore. This lasted 3-4 days with the most noticeable reaction being the sore arm from shoulder to elbow.  On Feb 10, one week later, my arm started itching again in the afternoon and by evening was swollen, red, hot, and hurting  just like the first 3-4 days or slightly worse.  It gradually got better after 4-5 days, returning to normal by 2/20.  The only other symptom the second time were blisters on my left hand above my pointer finger and ring finger.  I&#39;m not sure if they were related or not since I walk outside or if I may have been exposed to poison ivy since the blisters looked similar.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA adverse event.   Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.  Patient then transferred to another hospital that could provide neurosurgical intervention.

It is my sense that I was improperly inoculated outside the deltoid muscle, hitting the axillary nerve. The symptoms came on almost immediately, though (since it&#39;s a while ago) I cannot be reliably sure of the time. The pharmacist injecting me was very scattered, in my opinion, and perhaps tired from a long day of immunization. My sense is that she failed to properly landmark my arm. I am a short-stature woman with good muscle tone, if that helps. I am seeking medical evaluation on 4/9 and, likely, will start physical therapy to regain range of motion, which is disabling.

                                                Injection was at 12:00 Pm on 12/29/2020. At 12:20 PM i started to feel faint, slightly nauseous . I layed down on my office floor, , my heart rate went up to 140 BPM and BP was around 140/76. My MA checked it . One of my physician colleague&#39;s that was nearby checked on me as well as the nurse that gave me the injections. it took about 30-40 minutes for the symptoms to subside. I was sent to our Urgent care dept in the same clinic by wheelchair at around 12:30-12:40 pm. I was evaluated and my symptoms subsided in 30-40 minutes. I was out of Urgent care at 1:25 pm, able to walk upstairs back to my office and felt okay and was seeing patients again at 1:30 PM.  This reaction was similar to getting a shot of Novocaine w/ epinephrine for a dental procedure I received a few years ago, so if I were to sum it up it was like getting a shot of epinephrine. it was not a vasovagal reaction as my BP was high. I have felt fine since. I plan to get the second vaccine. Any suggestions to avoid these symptoms w/ the second one would be appreciated.

Went directly to ED. Sats  were good, no wheeze, throat swelling was noted. BP initially 150/93, peaked at 189/93,. Was 148/67 at discharge. Received oral Benadryl and Zyrtec, IV dexamethasone and Pepcid. ECG was done, no other labs. Observed for approx 90 minutes with improvement of all symptoms. Did need to take additional Benadryl dose approx 5 hours after first dose for return of mild throat fullness and rising BP. Both resolved within 30 minutes of dose. No further throat symptoms, BP fluctuations for over 24 hours now

When I woke to get a shower around 5:30 am on 1/6/2021, I was extremely lightheaded and laid down on the bathroom floor to keep from passing out and falling. The lightheadedness did not improve and my husband was able to help me back to bed. I was unable to overcome the chills and lightheadedness even with lying down, until about 10 am. I am able to sit up but still some what lightheaded and chills are beginning to fade. I do not feel I would be able to walk more than a few feet or drive at this time due to ongoing symptoms.

When I got home I started feeling my heart beating and started feeling like my body was raising. After 10 mins I checked my BP 140/90 which is high for me.  I took a BP pill.  It took a couple of hours for it to come down to normal. Went to sleep and woke up BP normal and a slight headache.  My arm was sore lasting about 3 days.

                                                48 hours after the injection I began to notice a sore throat before bedtime on Dec 30, but slept well. The next morning, Dec 31, I had acute allergic symptoms that never start so suddenly.  I was having constant Post-nasal Drip, nasal congestion and beginning of cough due to PND.  That night I had a severe sore throat similar to my typical allergic pattern.  I coughed all night and awoke on the morning of Jan 1st with clear severe onset allergies and could not talk without coughing.  That persisted for 4 days, then my allergist prescribed inhaled steroids BID which reduced the nighttime cough, but I persisted with symptoms for 10 days when they slowly resolved and my sense of well-being returned.  I missed 7 days of work, which is atypical for my allergies when I catch them early.  This was an acute flare of typical allergic symptoms that seems to have been triggered by the timing of the immune change from the vaccine at day #2-3 after the vaccine #1 was given.  I  am worried about getting vaccine #2 in 2 weeks and don&#39;t want to go through another flare up of dialing allergies again.

Please see below for more details:  After I got a first dose of Moderna vaccine around 9:30am on Jan 09, 2021, my heartbeat rate quickly went up to over 140/minute, my blood pressure was above 140/90&#43;; I felt hard to breath but my oxygen level was 100%. These were happened within 15 minutes after the vaccine shot. The Healthcare team/rescue team helped me and let me practice deep-breathing. After practiced deep-breathing about 5 - 15 minutes, my heartbeats reduced to around 80 - 90/minutes and my blood pressure went back to normal about 120/75. I left the clinic around 10:25am.

                                                Arm soreness noted on Jan. 5. On Jan. 11 I was sneezing a lot with a runny nose. This last for 24 hrs. On the 12th I noticed a raised area in the injection site. I took an Advil .  On the 13th my arm started getting hard near the injection site with some redness. On that day I took a Benadryl once and Advil BID. Today the arm is very hard, red and is warm to the touch. My temp is 100.2. I took 80 mg ASA and a hour later took an Advil.  I reported all my Sx w/ Moderna. They recommended that I call my PMD for Tx. I contacted my PMD and the health department for treatment and they referred me to CDC. No treatment was suggested or given

The redness went down my arm to my inner elbow down my forearm to my wrist. The redness going down my arm was not as bad after I took the Allegra.  It was all extremely painful. I had to go see Dr. because the itching was so bad. Dr. prescribed medicine for the swelling/itching.  At times my throat was sore and my face was flushed and I had a tightness in my chest. But that did not last long.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the shot I noticed a progression of symptoms that increased and got worse. I got very hot. I was sweating. I was very light headed. I got a headache. I was nauseous. I believed I was going to faint. My blood pressure spiked.   I noticed getting hotter and hotter  within 5 or 10 minutes of the shot. I removed some outer clothing, but I still kept getting hotter.  Then I noticed I was very light headed. Then I noticed I was sweating. I was very clammy and later on, a woman attendant said she could see the sweat on my. The headache began in the back of my neck. I thought I was going to faint. I because nauseous. My thinking became unclear.  After about 15 minutes of this continuing to get worse, I called over the paramedics. They took my blood pressure and said it was very high. They checked my heart beat, oxygen level, lungs, and blood pressure. They checked my blood pressure again, and then again maybe 15 or so minutes after the second time and they reported to me that it was going down. I continued to not feel well and the worst of it lasted for about an hour and now, 2 full days later I still do not feel well.   Yesterday, 1 day after the shot, I barely got off the couch.   Today, my vision is blurry, I am still light headed, and still feel dizzy. My headache has diminished. My thinking is still foggy.  I do not feel safe to drive.  As far as treatment, I just sat still. I had eaten breakfast and lunch (ate lunch within an hour of the shot, but was given a ginger all and 2 cookies, which I ate. After I felt well enough to get up, I walked around the facility for a few minutes, then I went outside in the cold fresh air and continued to walk for a bit. I then drove home and stayed on the couch.   I do want to state (and no where on here does it ask about this) so I am putting it here: I have only ever gotten a small pox and polio vaccination as a child, a Hep B shot four decades ago, and tetanus/whooping cough shots. I also take no medications and throughout my lifetime I have only taken a few.  So, when the early pre-vaccine assessments ask about allergic reactions to injections of vaccines, I answered no because I barely ever had any. No pre-vaccination assessments also said that no adverse reactions to oral medications were a problem. And there was no where in the early assessments to give u that info. I did say, yes, about having immune system issues on the online assessment, and I told the attendant at the time of check in. It is unidentified as far as it having a name, but I have seen a Rheumatologist last spring and she ruled out Lupis. I get sick easily with colds, so I believe I have a weak immune system.

Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

                                                Subject: Adverse reaction I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:30PM Friday, Jan. 22. Other than a sore arm, I was fine until the next night. About 8:00PM Saturday, Jan. 23 I was overcome with severe chills, hurting all over, nausea and a 101.3 fever. I suffered through the night with the chills ebbing by NOON Sunday, Jan. 24. By 5:00PM I was back to 95% except my arm remains sore and I occasionally feel nauseous.  Feel free to text or phone me.

Down the left side of back to center of back.  8 days later pain is still severe.

My husband had called 911 when my blood pressure dropped so low.  By the time they arrived it was back up to normal.   I have never had any problems with blood pressure,  low or high. Or with dizziness,  fainting etc. I am very sure it was from the vaccine

On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

                                                This was second shot.  No reaction after first shot that I recall except sore arm for a couple days. This time had low grade fever (100.1), body aches, sore neck, joint aches in hands, minor headache, chills from fever.  Also injection site redness, which extended out for a few inches around the injection site itself.  This lasted about 3 or 4 days and was warm to the touch.  The fever etc. only lasted the one day (day after injection) and by day three I was fine.  Was not servere enough to keep me from working etc., but I did go to bed early that night.

Like needles being stuck on my arm, the next day Saturday, i had most severe headache and chills, Mild fever and couldn&#39;t get out of the bed.  Just subsided on Sunday evening.

                                                About 6 PM the day I received the vaccine, the arm started to become extremely sore. It was achy feeling and it radiated down to my wrist. This lasted until Sunday and it started to fade. Today it is just some soreness left at the injection site. I was taking OTC Acetaminophen 500MG between 100 MG for pain. It was difficult to sleep due to the pain. I was also putting cool compresses on it.  The pain worse when I was trying to clean my car and shovel the snow. However the cold compress and stretching did help with some of the pain. I also felt agitated for different periods times after vaccination, I felt like my hormones were out of whack and I wanted to &#34;bite someone&#39;s head off&#34; this lasted for about an 1 hour or so. I also had mild headaches.

Were severe for about an hour and then started subsiding.  Gradually felt better over the course of a couple of hours. After about 6 hours, symptoms completely gone and I felt fine.

                                                Sharp, painful muscle cramps in both left and right feet and ankles, relieved by self-administered massage.   Cramping began when first lying down in bed, relieved by massage, then recurred about 20 minutes after falling asleep, and again relieved by self-administered massage.    Not persistent.   Did not recur after being relieved by self-administered massage the second time.   I was physically exhausted due to only 3 hours sleep the night before, so this may have been the result of exhaustion and not the vaccine, but has never happened before and seemed severe enough to file a report about it.  My arm was not particularly sore where vaccine administered and no other SE.

I was still freezing.  Got up to go to the bathroom as I normally do.  While sitting on the toilet, I started shaking violently - not just regular shivers.  This was scary.  Violent jerking from the waist up - head, arms, torso.  I could not control it.  Eventually it stopped.  I put on warmer clothes and climbed back into bed.  Eventually I warmed up and went to sleep.  Other minor side effects were same as the first vaccine - sore and tender around the injection sight and slight headache.

The patient presented to the ER just a few days after being discharged from Hospital.  The patient was treated as an inpatient at Hospital little under a week ago for a COPD exacerbation.  She showed dramatic improvement during this time, but over the last few days has started showing increasing signs of shortness of breath and severe fatigue.  She has no known coronavirus (COVID-19) contact, but states that anything is possible.  Her rapid coronavirus (COVID-19) test in the ER was negative.  However, her chest CT seem to suggest a severe viral pneumonia.  Because of this, the patient is going to be admitted to the hospital as she has failed outpatient therapy and is significantly hypoxic.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

She came back to the pharmacy area and she was seated and had her blood pressure checked. It was high (194/84) but she reported that she does have high blood pressure and takes her med at night.  She was given a bottle of water, monitored and her blood pressure was checked twice again over the next 20 minutes. It read lower each time she was checked and when it read 156/84 she said she felt fine and was ready to leave with her husband. She also said she was diabetic and had eaten a small breakfast compared to normally. She will be contacted today to make sure she is still feeling ok.

                                                When I first got the vaccine I was fine but as the day went on I felt soreness in my left arm with some stiffness in my neck. Later on in the afternoon, I started getting a headache, neck was getting stiffer and my back started to hurt. When I got home around 5 I fixed some dinner, within 30 minutes or less it felt like my stomach exploded, I was throwing up continuously, it was so intense, I tried sips of water to throwing it up as well. I could feel my esophagus burning up to my throat, and starting to feel like it was closing up. All during this time my eyes hurting and light really bothered me.  I was to afraid to lay down, I  got myself to calm down, and doing deep breathing. That seemed to help me. I was scared. I stayed home through the  night and woke up the next day feeling better.  I still have headaches to this day.

                                                Within 45 minutes of receiving the the Moderna injection I started with a headache and the beginning of hives. I took a Benadryl to stop the hives progression. I had to take antihistimes for several days.  The hives never popped up so the meds helped.  My head felt bruised and heated as if the blood was pumping around my skull.  The headaches are still intermittent 6 days later. I did not seek medical care.

Over next 36 hours fever was between 100-102. Nausea began 48 hours after injection.  It is now Tuesday, almost 4 days since injection and am still dizzy and weak.  Fever stopped yesterday and only light headache today.   My husband also had all my symptoms except a much lower fever.  We are wondering if we could have got a bad batch???  They said to expect 1-2 days of mild discomfort.  This was like the worst flu I&#39;ve ever had.

                                                5 minutes after injection, my feet and palms itched and I was lightheaded but I tried to shake it off and it faded over the next 10 minutes. I did report it and stayed longer and was ok. Then i went straight home and layed down because i did not sleep well night before (was on call ) i awoke 1 hour post injection dry heaving, very nauseated, mild headache, achy, itchy over different parts of my body and weak. Sat up and my face was getting itchier, lips started to swell, tongue started to swell and itch, throat felt like someone was strangling me, had trouble swallowing and trouble breathing. took 2 benadryls immediately and went out into cold air, thought about calling 911 but got better in 10-15 minutes. never have had a reaction like this in my life. have had hives  though in the past. If I would have had an epi pen I would have used it (never have had an epi pen) I was frightened but the benadryl worked and I slept due to the benadryl  for 5 hours, when I woke up the benadryl wore off and it started again. took more benadryl, and it improved. before bedtime, the benadryl wore off and I had a hard time swallowing my night time meds like my throat was swollen. Took 2 more benadryls, today I am weak and nauseated and ate very little and feel like my face is still red and itchy. I told my sister and she said she is allergic to PEG which i later noted was in the vaccine. i am very disappointed that I had this reaction- I have desparately wanted this vaccine as a medical worker with a lot of covid patients- I onlu hopr this one shot will protect me enough because it is clear to me that i cannot take this vaccine again.

It hurt to roll over in bed.  I lost my taste and smell. It lasted approximately 24 hours.  I had Covid in June, 2020 and had all of the exact symptoms, 100 times worse than when I had Covid.  9 days later, I had fever above 102 again, chills, shaking for approximately 6 hours again.  Is this a normal reaction?

I took Ibuprofen, rested, had lots of liquids, and was fine the day after (01/01/2021) No other symptoms until exactly one week later (01/06/2021). I noticed the injection site on my left arm was itching and a bit sore. A 5&#34;x3&#34; red rash appeared at injection site. I took one Acetaminophen PM that night. The red rash is still there. These appear to be minor reactions but the red rash is never one I have had before with any vaccinations. It seems strange it didn&#39;t appear until a week later. No difference in skin lotion I have used. I wanted to report effects for data collection purposes since it is a new/emergency vaccine.

                                                Patient appeared nervous upon receiving vaccine. Patient reported trouble swallowing ( has a history of radiation therapy on throat). When asked if breathing was restricted, patient was able to take long breaths with minimal additional effort. Shortly after, patient appeared to be close to passing out (not completely awake and alert), eyes dilated. The pharmacist who administered the vaccine then administered one dose of the epinephrine (Epi-pen LOT:0FM353/eEXP:NOC 21) while the staff member kept the patient stable in her chair. The facility was instructed to call 911. At 11:49 AM (7 minutes later), symptoms began to improve and the patient became more alert. EMS arrived around 12:00PM to take patient to hospital--patient refused and was back walking around the facility 5 minutes later. No further issues were reported with this patient (pharmacist administering the vaccine left the facility around 1:15PM)

                                                Got slightly dizzy as I stood up. Went to sit in observation room.  My heart was beating very fast for about 8 minutes.  Felt a tightness in my chest and had a slight bit of difficulty breathing.  Did not want to tell the monitors.  Afraid to go to a hospital with COVID.  My left hand turned blue and got cold and tingly.  That lasted for about 2-3 minutes.  So did the trouble breathing.  All subsided in 15 minutes.  Went home and took an antihistamine.  Had a light rash on my body.  Consulted with PCP and cardiologist.  They seem clueless.  We all agreed that i need the second dose but what is the antidote.  Cardiologist gave me a beta-blocker to take before the dose but these symptoms all appeared on the severe allergic reaction list.  The heart pounding was the most pronounced symptom.  What do I do?

The source of the itch is a 1.5&#34; rash just below the vaccination site on my left arm.  The rash appears over a hard or swollen bump that is the same size as the rash.   I may also have a rash on my left neck because it itches, but I can&#39;t see or feel it.

Throughput the evening, the tingling sensation progressed up the left side of my neck and my ear.  My ear felt similar s to Novacaine wearing off after a dental visit. During the night my throat got a similar sensation and created the need to try coughing it out. By 24 hours after the injection I was tired, with sore joints and muscle aches. By 36 hours I was still sleeping it off and at 48 hours I feel pretty well back to normal.

                                                Mild cellulitis; Headache; Sore arm; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced a sore arm, headache, and mild cellulitis.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included calcium and memantine hydrochloride.   On 28 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) intramuscularly in the left deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 28 Dec 2020, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had a sore arm for 2-3 days. She was worried that she would get a headache so she took ibuprofen.   On 03 Jan 2021, the patient had a low-grade headache but it was not a migraine. She took acetaminophen and ibuprofen but it did not help.   On 04 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s arm was a bit sore.   On 05 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s headache went away but she felt she had mild cellulitis. Her arm felt a little bit warm at the injection site, it was also swollen and red. These symptoms persisted for about 2 days and then began to get better. Treatment for the events included ibuprofen, acetaminophen and icing.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The event, mild cellulitis, was considered resolving. The event, headache, was resolved on 05 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, sore arm, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67year old, female patient who experienced a serious unexpected event of cellulitis, and non-serious expected event of pain in extremity and headache. The event of pain in extremity occurred same day after first dose mRNA-1273 (Lot# 026L20A) administration. The event of headache occurred after 7 days and cellulitis occurred 9 days after mRNA-1273 (Lot# 026L20A) administration. The subject&#39;s concomitant medication included calcium and Biomentin. The treatment medications were included Tylenol, Advil and icing. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient was discovered to have a large saddle pulmonary embolism, went into cardiac arrest and expired. Of note, the patient received her second Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/23, which would place her first one approximately 12/25 if she received them at the appropriate interval. This information is from the patient&#39;s daughter and the ED record, the information is not available in CAIR. Per the daughter, the patient started feeling ill on 1/21, improved on 1/25, and then acutely worsened on 1/27, resulting in the ED visit.

On Jan 27th (7 days following vaccination) a large (2.5&#34; X 4&#34;) red area formed around the injection site on my arm and it began to ache and itch. I also had diarrhea which began in the middle of the night (2 am on Jan 28), with a total of 3 episodes over 3 hours. That day I was very tired, experienced intestinal upset  (w/ very small episodes of diarrhea) and my arm began to really ache and the swollen area became rather firm and hot. The intestinal episode is over but the hot red welt continues as of this report. Diarrhea is not a common condition for me.

It might be possible that my reaction to the 1st dose is due to the presence of antibodies in my system, i.e. it&#39;s very similar to what many people experience after the 2nd dose.

                                                I received the 1st shot of the Moderna&#39;s Covid-19 vaccine on 1/23/21 at the Pharmacy. Three days later I started experiencing sharp abdominal cramps with gas that I couldn&#39;t expel and abdominal bloating. I am still experiencing this 6 days later from when it started. I feel better when laying down but when I stand up I have this really heavy feeling in my lower abdomen. I also experience abdominal cramps not long after eating. I am not constipated. In fact, I&#39;ve been having a lot more bowel movements which is not normal for me. Also, on Sunday, 1/31, eight days after injection, I developed a red patch that was very warm on my left arm where I received the injection and a headache. The red patch is still there. I&#39;m concerned about this and wonder if this may be related to one of the ingredients in the vaccine, i.e., polyethylene glycol.  I have reported this to my M.D. this morning and they are asking me to come in.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Pentasa, metformin, insulin, Zoloft and atorvastatin.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 028L20A) on 20 Jan 2021 in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient developed a fever on 25 Jan 2021, and it got up to 101 degrees Fahrenheit on 26 Jan 2021.  On 26 Jan 2021 she felt must worse, couldn&#39;t take food, and couldn&#39;t get up from bed. On 27 Jan 2021, she was taken to the emergency room where her oxygen saturation was low, but the fever was gone.  She was placed on oxygen, and blood work had elevated troponin. The patient was diagnosed with pericarditis and she was kept overnight. On 28 Jan 2021 she had atrial fibrillation and the medical team couldn&#39;t convert her chemically.  She was stabilized on 30 Jan 2021 and she was feeling much better.   Treatments of these events included oxygen and ibuprofen.

                                                I felt queasy at 5:15am.  Had severe vomiting and diarrhea throughout the day, with a fever of 100 degrees. Tried taking a Pepcid, but got dry heaves. Had nine episodes of diarrhea. Called the doctor at 1:40pm who recommended tablespoons of water every 10 minutes.  The nausea and dry heaves  would not stop so my husband called the doctor again at 7:00pm who recommended the emergency room for an IV.  But at 7:30pm, the nausea lifted, and I was able to sleep.

Saw a dermatologist, who said it is a typical &#34;viral allergic rash.&#34; Told me he could not give me steroids, but gave me sample of cream to reduce itch and recommended OTC antihistamine seasonal allergy pills. He said I should not take the 2nd dose, but to follow the advice of Moderna and CDC re: that decision.

                                                I received my Covid-19 Moderna vaccine on February 12. Soon afterward, the pharmacy called and told me that they had accidently given me a double dose. They reported it to my primary care physician and both the pharmacy and my doctor stayed in close contact with me to monitor my health. I had the usual sore arm, a headache, and a little achy that evening, but nothing major. I noticed the next day that I had a hard lump about 3.5 inches below where my shot was given (not directly below, more toward the inside of my arm.) A small rash begin to develop, but after a few days the rash was gone, but the lump remained. Twelve days after my shot, the lump became very red and hot. The rash appeared again and basically moved up my arm. I kept putting a cortisone itch cream on it, but it was very uncomfortable. Two days after the rash appeared I became quite sick with what it felt like side effects ? chills that included violent shaking and temperature that reached 100.5. I had that for about 24 hours. Now the lump on my arm is gone, I no longer have rash, and my temperature is back to normal. I feel tired today, but probably because of the previous day?s temps and chills. I find it interesting that 2 weeks after my shot I would have those kind of reactions (unless this had nothing to do with the shot?)  I thought you might want to have this data, as it is an interesting side effect. My doctor wasn?t sure how to explain it either. I would be interested to see if others that might have gotten an overdose of the shot experienced anything similar.

About 12 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt nauseated but finally managed to sleep.  The next afternoon on February 23 I became very ill with vomiting and diarrhea all at the same time.  I nearly passed out several times.  First responders arrived and found my blood pressure to be about 70/30.  Got in ambulance and given fluids.  Arrived at hospital around 5:15 pm.  Got more fluids and numerous blood tests, none of which were very remarkable.  My WBC was 17 but nothing else was wrong.  Left hospital at 9:00.  Physician assumes Covid vaccine cause these side effects.

Just then I felt strong pain in my lower back.  This pain has been with me ever since.   I spoke to my doctor.  She recommended Advil and Tylenol around the clock for a few days.  Also Flexaril, muscle relaxer at night. I did this for three days.  Also she recommended some gentle stretches and the application of heat.  I am following these directives.  The pain persists.

I was laid down, cold compress. It came in waves over a period of 20 minutes. I was given a few sips of water. When it did not resolve I was taken to the ER and given IV fluids.  The doctor said I had an adverse reaction to something in the vaccine. The chief of Infectious disease thought I had a vaso vagel response.  While I am nervous to get the second vaccine , I will go forward and get it..

The arm was also distinctly warm to the touch and tender.  During the first evening, I experienced chills and presumed fever that responded to 400 mg of Ibuprofen.  I experienced some nausea, loss of appetite, and malaise over the next three to four days after injection.

I went over and rolled patient over having her lay face up and then proceeded to ask her questions. We had a staff member called 911 while I was helping her.  I asked her how she felt and she responded and said she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; Her pulse was low (~40 bpm). 911 informed us to lie her down on the floor until EMS arrived which we already had been doing at the time. After getting off the phone with 911, she started feeling better and her pulse returned to a normal rate (~80 bpm). EMS still took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

She was still awake and responsive when I proceeded to ask her questions and she informed me she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; 911 informed us to keep her lying down on the floor as comfortable for her as possible until EMS arrives on scene. While waiting for EMS to arrive her pulse was low (~40 bpm), but shortly before EMS arrived on scene her pulse rose to a normal heart rate (~80 bpm). EMS then took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                Fainted; Did not feel well; Hit head; A little pain in arm; A spontaneous report was received from a 68-year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced the events, fainted, hit head, did not feel well, and a little pain in arm.    The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Relevant concomitant medications reported included ezetimibe, atorvastatin, and atenolol.   On 04 Jan 2021 at 9:00 am, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient reported that she took the vaccine on 04 Jan 2021 and she did not feel anything after but a little pain in her arm.   On 05 Jan 2021 around 7:00 pm, the patient went to her fridge for a drink and told her husband she did not feel very well, and then fainted. The patient reported that she hit her head and has never fainted before. No treatment information was reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome for the events, fainted, hit head, did not feel well, and a little pain in arm, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 68-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Syncope, the non-serious listed event of Pain in extremity, and the non-serious unlisted events of Head injury and Malaise.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events on the day after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                When I woke up the morning after I received the shot my arm was extremely sore and could hardly raise it without pain. As the day progressed I started having body aches, headache, and some chills. It only lasted for that day and I was fine on 1/22/2021. I have never had a reaction to a shot before so it was worrisome. I am fine now.

                                                16 hours after the injection, I was awakened with needing to vomit.  I had only clear liquid which I coughed out.  I was having difficulty catching my breath and unable to burp or clear the liquid.  After three tries, I was able to clear the airway and was able to breathe well.  I also checked my blood pressure which was 163/83.  I had phlegm in my throat and could clear it with drinking water.  After approximately 40 minutes of checking and rechecking my blood pressure and drinking water, I was able to sleep until 9:00 am.  It is now 24 hours from the injection and I feel much better.

After I got this vaccine on 01/20/21, I had got almost all of the symptoms of Covid again that I had:  chills, 100-101 fever,  bad body aches, nausea, vomiting, very tired for 3 days, severe migraine headaches, and very sore left arm.  I had all these symptoms in January and July too. The only thing that I didn?t have was a deep cough and trouble breathing that I also had in January and July.

                                                One week after taking the vaccine I developed significant swelling of the upper left arm at the vaccination site that gradually got worse as the day progressed. I also experienced a headache and a severe spike in blood pressure in the afternoon, which led me to think that my reaction might be severe. As a result I went to the local ER where they decided to keep me overnight for observation. The symtoms did not get worse, but I was given steroids and peptid intravenously, as well as Benadryl to counteract the swelling. Today, Jan. 28, I continue to have some swelling in the left arm, as well as redness.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                After receiving the shot at 9:00 a.m., at 6:00 p.m. I started to feel very tired and as if I was getting a fever.  By 9:00 p.m. I was shaking from chills (despite being bundled up under a blanket), so I took my temperature -- it was 100.5 degrees orally.  My normal temperature on that thermometer is 97.6 degrees.   That night, I kept waking up every two hours or so and was very uncomfortable.  THe next day I felt very lethargic -- unable to do anything other than make myself something to eat.  I took two naps, one in the morning, and the other in the afternoon (that was about two hours).  I felt slightly better by around 8 p.m.  That night I slept somewhat better and felt myself break into a sweat during the night -- so I guess that is when the fever broke.  The next day (today) my temperature was back to normal and I feel okay.  Throughout the now three days, the arm where I got the shot was painful, but gets less so each day.

                                                I had no symptoms for the first 48 hours. On days 3-6 I was fatigued but not enough to effect daily living activities.  Day 6 ( Feb 18, 2021) I started to have a lot of muscular aches and the injection site started to get red and swollen.  I had fever and chills from the 18th through the 20th  as well as a swollen arm and a lot of redness in the arm and minor itching. The red area on my arm was a patch about 4 inches wide and 6 inches long. The swelling was confined to the injection site and was raised up in a circle about 2 inches in diameter. My fever during this time was at 99 degrees.  Today is Feb 22 and most of my symptoms are gone, just minor redness and itching at injection site. I was just surprised that my symptoms didn?t show up until about 6 days after the vaccination.. Everything I have read suggested they could appear within 48 hours of the injection.

So hard, I still felt cold, but this wasn?t shivering,  I wanted to go to get in warm water.  I was shaking so bad I couldn?t take my clothes off.   I got in with clothes on, I was getting delirious.   My whole body was contracting so hard I couldn?t sit in the tub flat, my but cheeks contracting with all muscles.   I found myself in the night with a sticking hat soaked in water to cover my face.  I could not have called for help when the muscle contractions  were going on.  That lasted I think 30-45 minutes.  I was groggy on the 20th all day but getting much better.   I was very excited for vaccine and would do it again, but wanted to report what I consider pretty rough side effect, so you could make note of it. And I still thank you for the vaccine,  but dang I truly thought I was dying.

                                                I had the virus in August of 2020 for 30 days until symptom free.  ON 2/6/2021 received first vaccine injection.  within 3 minutes a light headache started.  That evening, rash and itching on right fore-arm and under chin. took benedryl. Woke at 3:30 am on 2/7 not feeling well and left arm very sore and could not touch.  6:30 am - chills with severe body shaking and 101 temp.  7:30 am 102.2  took tylenot 8 hr 650 mg. Oxygen at 96, heart rate at 76 and BP 117/68. 8:00 am 101.9 temp. 10 am 100.6 temp. 1:30 pm 102.9 temp. 2:00 pm 103.3  Took Tylenol, extra strength 2 tabs. 8:30 pm used inhaler due to chest pains  101.3 temp. took benedryl.  Oxygennn @98  HR-82 BP 145/77.  11.00 pm 103.3 temp. took 2 tylenol.  Mon 8:00 Monday am continued/ 100.2 temp  oxygen 97  HR-70; 99.2 temp  BP 110/71.  7 pm. took Benedryl for congestion.   Quit taking stats.  Fatigue and rest took play at this point.  Since then have had intermittent low grade fever in 99.2 to 99.9.  Same with headache and extreme fatigue.  Have high risk husband that I take care of .  He had his first vaccine at same time.  No side effect at all.  I am scheduled for 2nd vaccine on March 6th.  I am very apprehensive about taking it with this reaction.  Please advise/recommend if I should proceed.  My PCP stated that these reactions were evidence the vaccine is working.  Is this because I had the virus???  Both the virus and vaccine have been really hard on me.  I am usually a very active person and since August, I have been struggling with fatigue.  First time in life.   Thank you.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

Provider prescribed some bentyl Sunday to ease my cramping. At early onset I had some nausea too. I&#39;m wondering if I don&#39;t need some blood work, whatever you think and maybe recheck my TSH too. Dr. already ordered a UA with culture which were both negative. That was done because of back pain over left kidney a couple of weeks ago. Diagnosis: Theo. My intestines have never been right since my surgery, but this gassiness and hyperactivity is much more extreme. I tried Metamucil and it blew my guts up even worse. I know I&#39;m due for a CT scan. I see Dr. March 22. I&#39;m trying to hold off until then because I want to discuss with him why I prefer to have all scans at specific facility. I just wanted to get your advice since it&#39;s been a week now. I did get my second Moderna vaccine on February 15 and  Fulvestrant injections on Feb. 22. My issues started on Feb. 25. Oddly, right now as I&#39;m typing this, my gut is much calmer. Yesterday was my worst day with diarrhea.  3/13/21 ER for back pain - transferred to second hospital - remains admitted there as of 3/16/21 History of Present Illness:  Patient is a 68-year-old female with known metastatic ovarian cancer under active treatment since 2004, currently on fulvestrant after a massive debulking surgery by Dr. last July (2020).

Treated with tylenol, motrin, and heat and pain eventually dissipated. Then Tuesday and Wednesday pt did a lot of yard work and lifting. Thursday patient woke up with excruciating right flank pain.  Nothing has made it better.  Patient has tried ice, heat, tramadol Tylenol, Motrin, steroids and pain persists.  Additionally patient having nausea and vomiting.  She has started to have burning with urination.  Pain is excruciating stabbing.  Radiates to the groin.  Patient has also started running fevers today.  She feels pretty miserable.

Patient does note little to no notice when her bowels decide to move.  Severe significant gas.  Other times patient feels quite constipated.   UA suggests possible infection with positive nitrites, 1&#43; leukocyte esterase and 3&#43; blood.

                                                MODERNA COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Patient presented to ED on 3/14/21 with new onset of inability to walk. Recalls not feeling well on 3/4/21 after receiving her COVID-19 vaccine (1st dose) on 2/21/21.  She began to experience aching over the anterior thigh on the following day that progressed to involve the posterior lower extremity and forearms by Saturday, 3/6/21.  She also began to experience numbness and tingling in the feet and fingers at that time.  The sensory symptoms persisted over the following days in association with lower extremity weakness that culminated in a fall at home on Thursday, 3/11/21.  She was unable to walk without assistance at the time of her presentation.  Initial examination in the ED revealed borderline antigravity lower extremity strength and absent lower extremity reflexes.  A lumbar puncture performed on 3/14/21 revealed protein  218.1, glucose  76, WBC  8, and RBC 1. She was admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and received her initial dose of IVIG that evening. She has noted some interval improvement in lower extremity muscle strength since her admission to the hospital.  The pain that she had been experiencing is less intense, though she is still prone to experience discomfort if she remains in the same position too long.  She is continuing to experience tingling in the feet and fingers.  She is not experiencing any shortness of breath or difficulty with chewing/swallowing.  She is not experiencing any urinary bladder dysfunction.  She is experiencing constipation.

Took Tylenol for fever which helped control that symptom.  It was like hospitalized COVIC all over again. Reluctant to receive 2nd dose if I have this same adverse reaction.  I had donated my COVID convalescent plasma that morning for the 4th occasion but I was told it would not interfere with the vaccine.

                                                About 9 hours after the shot my left arm suddenly hurt a great deal.  I noticed it when I went to raise up my arm a little bit.  I also became exhausted.  I realized I had been tired much of the first day but once my arm became so painful, I was completely exhausted.  I felt out of sorts for about  36 hours and then began to feel normal again.  It probably took a few more days to regain my energy completely.

She is feeling little bit better but still just a little bit dizzy.  She was completely and entirely asymptomatic prior to getting the vaccine shot.  She has not been ill lately.

                                                On 1/7/2021 had severe headache all over head and neck.  Aspirin did not do anything. I don&#39;t get headaches. After a few hours it went away on its own. On 1/13/2021  started out in the morning with itching on area where shot was given. Then a rash in that same area. Then by the afternoon my arm swelled up covering a large area around where shot was given. It was hard like a knot. Today, 1/14/2021 it is still itching, red around swollen area. Swollen area is not as large as yesterday.

Symptons did not get worse and started to ease as Paramedics on site took blood pressure&amp; cardiogram. Cardio was good and blood pressure was 178/81.  Flushing disappeared, lump in throat 98% better. Refused further treatment and drove home,  Was OK thereafter.

When I got home from work  on 1.19.2021 I noticed a large red  patch which was hot to the touch.  During the day my arm where I received the injection became very itchy.  During the day I also was extremely tired and had developed a headache and felt like I may be getting a cold.  I also had a neckache.  I still have those symptoms.   I received my vaccine on 1.06.2021.

She tells me she has &#34;a heart condition&#34; and is followed by a cardiologist. She tells me she was in her usual state of health and took her COVID-19 first vaccine today.  Approximately 30 seconds later she noted chest tightness/burning that has been constant.  It is rated 9/10 at maximum and improved to 5/10 after about 10 to 15 minutes.  She also states, &#34;my eyes feel funny.  I feel cold.  I am dizzy.&#34; She endorses palpitations and dyspnea. She denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, diaphoresis, headache, cough, rash, or syncope. She does have a history of seafood allergies and had similar reactions after eating seafood. She tells me 3 years ago after a flu shot she fainted.  She tells me the past 2 years after her flu shot she had nausea or vomiting. She tells me she fell yesterday and hurt her hip but she did not hit her head.  No LOC. She tells me she takes baby aspirin nightly. Family history: Mom and dad both died at age 82 from lung cancer.  They both had heart disease.   She was sent back from the vaccination area to urgent care to be evaluated after her reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                I received the injection around 2:30 I felt fine. It did not hurt going in. I stopped by a restaurant to get some take out and must of started feeling disorientated and completely forgot I had this folder with the VSAFE information. I started feeling chills all over my body, I kept taking my temperature it was 95.7, I started having a headache top of my head, the temporal, the back of my neck. They were all over the place. I went to bed and I couldn&#39;t sleep. It was like my brain was going crazy, it wasn&#39;t like an anxious feeling. I finally feel asleep around 4am and kept waking up remembering fragments of valid dreams. The dreams were fragment with such dread and anxiety in them.  It was like a huge wave of depression and anxiety. By about 9am I was fully awake, but my body hurt, my muscles ached I felt fatigued. The chills and headaches were through. I was still having weird racing thoughts. About 10pm it all went away and I slept fine and woke up the next morning and I was fine. My arm is still sore at the injection site but all the other symptoms went away.    Saturday morning I was talking with a friend on the phone, and she reminded me of the folder I received the folder. I completely forgot about this folder. I found this folder later that day and then I tried to access VSAFE. It made me realize how disorientated I was.

Started with severe chills, body shaking, achy all over, head felt like it was going to implode, started to sweat and felt flushed.  Woke up my spouse to get me something to take for headache, etc.  Later that morning could hard lift the Arm, felt a golf ball size lump at injection site and warm to the touch. Was in bed 2 days bcuz it exacerbated my MS.  After that the injection site started itching, with redness.  Lump finally getting smaller.  I took a photo of the injection site which has a red circle the size of my hand.

                                                I had a possible reaction on my Left arm and chest. My Right arm received the injection. I never have any sticks in my left arm since I have  developed Lymphedema post breast cancer mastectomies and treatment in  April 2006. When I arose  my effected arm was red in color, with a rash on top of that. It was hot to the touch and swollen and stiff.  My husband took me to the emergency room of the hospital named in Item 21 and later that day I was admitted to the hospital. They diagnosed it as a severe infection, resulting in cellulitis and started me on round the clock IV antibiotics.

                                                A few hours after my vaccination, my arm became extremely sore and was extremely sore all night, and remained so the next day. I have a high pain tolerance, but my arm felt as if it had received a powerful injury, and was hard to lift without using my other arm.  I also had a slight fever the next day, chills and muscle aches and fatigue. I am normally very active, but spent the day in bed. The next day I felt much better although my arm was very sore for another day or two. Then, the evening of the 21st of Feb., my arm, at the vaccination site became very itchy and was painful to touch in that area. I slept well but woke with the same itchiness, and soreness, and now tonight, Feb. 22nd, that area is still itchy and a bit sore. But I have not had the swelling and redness that I am reading about with Covid arm.

                                                At 3:30 pm (2 hours after the injection) my arm at the injection site started to hurt and I felt light-headed and had chills,  These symptoms continued, plus I became exhausted and my joints hurt.  My stomach was queasy.  By the next morning, my joints hurt so much it was difficult to roll over in bed, and all the other symptoms were still there and worse.  I did not have a fever.  I developed a headache.  All I could do was lie in bed; sitting up felt exhausting.  By evening of that day, my joint pain was lessening and my stomach felt somewhat better.  By the following morning, I felt normal, basically.  So in total, about a day and a half of bad reaction.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Lyme disease. Concomitant products included FAMOTIDINE (PEPCID AC) for Acid reflux (esophageal), PANTOPRAZOLE SODIUM SESQUIHYDRATE (PANTOPRAZOLE 40) for Acid reflux (oesophageal), CYCLOBENZAPRINE for Antiinflammatory therapy, ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM (LIPITOR) for High cholesterol, TRAZODONE for Insomnia, HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE, CLARITHROMYCIN, AMOXICILLIN and DOXYCYCLINE for Lyme disease, PREGABALIN (LYRICA), DIAZEPAM (VALIUM) and CLONAZEPAM (KLONOPIN) for Nerve pain, OXYCODONE and ZOLPIDEM TARTRATE (AMBIEN) for an unknown indication.   On 15-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In January 2021, the patient experienced TREMOR (Tremor/hand was shaking was dropping things/whole body just shakes) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DYSSTASIA (had trouble standing) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and MALAISE (feeling sick) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced APHASIA (couldn&#39;t talk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (memory started to go/ memory was getting worse/ couldn&#39;t remember what day it was) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), FALL (tried to get out of bed and fell) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ANXIETY (getting anxiety ridden) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, TREMOR (Tremor/hand was shaking was dropping things/whole body just shakes) had not resolved and DYSSTASIA (had trouble standing), MALAISE (feeling sick), APHASIA (couldn&#39;t talk), MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (memory started to go/ memory was getting worse/ couldn&#39;t remember what day it was), FALL (tried to get out of bed and fell) and ANXIETY (getting anxiety ridden) outcome was unknown.            The patient thought that the tremors might have been due to the Hydroxychloroquine and because she was also feeling sick, she stopped taking the Hydroxychloroquine, but continued taking the Clarithromycin. The tremors continued. Her doctor advised her to resume taking the Hydroxychloroquine, starting with ĵ pill, then ½ pill working her way up in dosing. The patient reported that her hand tremors never stopped.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not Applicable.

                                                I felt fine until the morning of Jan. 10 (except for very painful arm).  I was awakened early in the morning by severe vertigo (my eyes were blinking rapidly and the room was spinning violently); I was nauseous and couldn&#39;t lie down without the violent spinning re-occurring.  I was very dizzy and exhausted the whole day, unable to function.  The next day I continued to be very dizzy and off-balance, couldn&#39;t work but better than prior day.  Each day, same symptoms have continued but milder.  I called my PCP on Monday, Jan 11.  He told me it sounded like an inner ear problem, probably unrelated to the vaccine and to call him the next day and report my symptoms.  I did (Tues. Jan 12) and reported dizziness was milder but still there.  He suggested I see an ENT doctor.

My big concern is that I also  suddenly developed dark, stringy images and blurry vision in my left eye. The eye symptoms are still present.

During the next week I had occasional fever and chills , fatigue and muscle aches.   On January 14, my  upper left arm began itching and swelling.  This has continued including the entire upper arm becoming very hot to the touch.  It has subsided somewhat by January 17.  Should I get the second dose scheduled for Feb 4?

When I get migraines, it&#39;s usually 1-2 times a month.  Once I treat it, it doesn&#39;t come back.  This headache returned about 7 hours later on January 21.  I treated it again.  I got another headache today, January 22 at 11 AM.  I treated it again with my medication.

                                                After injection on 01/16/2021, within 2 days all soreness had dissapted along with swelling and redness.  On 01/24/2021 roughly at 04:45 A.M., I began to chill/shiver.  The injection site on my right arm had become hot to the touch, peppered with red blotches, swollen and began to hurt again.  I did take 1000mg of Tylenol for discomfort.  I felt flushed, but no fever to speak of, rather lethargic.  Today, 01/25/2021, the injection site is one large reddened, hot, swollen area about a size 3x4 inches.  At this time, I have not visited my physician or any Urgent Care.

                                                Rash below shot sight .  Only noticed because of itching.  Red rash that was warm to touch and dissipated in a bulls eye manner.  Used Benadryl to stop itching so not to scratch.  Lasted about 4-5 days but did not think much about it until I read where several people had the same symptoms, but only happened in primarily women 30-40 years of age.  Thought you may be interested as I am 70.

                                                Red rash that started out about a 2 inch square (about 10 days from when I got the vaccine) that kept growing to wrap around half of my upper arm.  It itched some, and was warm to the touch.  On day  14, after discussion with Dr., he thought it was a skin infection, so prescribed antibiotics (Cephalexin 500 MG Capsules taken 3 times a day), which I started taking on day 14.  By Day 18 the rash has calmed down, not as red or visible,  but still there.  This was for the Moderna vaccine.

I went back to the pharmacist to let them look at it and they referred me to contact VAERS. It is not bothering or anything like that.

After one hour I was fine.  Second vaccine was administered on Feb. 8th at noon. By 3:30 AM Feb 9th I could barely get out of bed because of severe joint pain and aching. I was nauseated, had a mild fever, mild headache and very tired. This lasted until  February the 10th at which time I felt better. By Feb. 11th I had return of deep aching pain in my hips and pelvic bones. ( I have arthritis and know what joint pain is). This was much worse. I felt ill from about one week after receiving my 2nd dose of Moderna. I started feeling much better with the occasional return of mild symptoms.  I go to physical therapy for arthritis pain and had taken a week off. I returned to physical therapy on Thursday. February 18th. I was unable to complete my usual workout due to weakness in my legs and joint pain. I returned on Feb. 22nd and the same thing happened I felt weak, diaphoretic, nauseated,  after exercising a short time. This has never happened before.

                                                On Wednesday, February  17, 2021 around 7:00 pm I had a pounding headache that I never experienced before.  The next morning headache began again and started vomiting at 7:45 a.m. thru out the morning until 11:30 a.m.  I could not eat anything , tried eating a piece of toast &amp; after one bite the vomiting began again.  I vomited again at 3:15 p.m.  Tried again to eat white rice and immediately began vomiting again.  On Thursday morning had a slight headache with no vomiting.  Friday I felt OK, just weak from all the vomiting.  Saturday morning I felt Okay, then suddenly I felt dizzy and though I was going to faint.  My daughter immediately told me that she was driving me to the ER because I was pretty dehydrated.  Was diagnosed with dehydration at the ER.

My hands were sort of a splotchy red (more red than not...) and itched, especially the wrist of my left hand.   My fingers were a bit puffy, but not swollen.  I ran my hands under cold water and used a hand cream.  They still itched a bit, but were better.  I waited a bit and reapplied hand cream.  I was tired and fell back asleep about 1:30 a.m.  When I woke up about 7 a.m., my hands were fine and there was no itching.  I have been fine since (altho I experienced the tiredness others have mentioned).

As day progressed felt discomfort, site began to get itchy. In evening checked and blotches became one mass, swollen, very warm to touch. Called pharmacy, they never heard of delayed reaction said take benedryl and call primary dr in morning. Went to pharmacy, the pharmacist looked at it and felt it, also never saw delayed reaction, gave same instructions. Sent picture to primary, did video call today, 99.7 temp, elevated BP and pulse. She saw picture, close up on screen, concerned one spot darker might be cellulitis, need to watch, take benedryl, call if changes, report to CDC

I went to bed early and when I woke up I had a fever of 101.5 accompanied by chills, body aches, nausea, fatigue, brain fog, and headache.  Over the course of two days, my temperature ranged from 101.5 to 103.  After two days my fever broke during the night.   I did not want to take fever reducing medication in case it interfered with the immune response, but I did take 1 dose each of Tylenol and Motrin over the course of the 2 days.  Still felt a bit sluggish on the 3rd day and continue to have brain fog 6 days later.

                                                symptoms since her dose of Covid Moderna vaccine on Jan the 25th.  In the first 1-2 days she had the usual soreness at the injection site but nothing else. Then, about a week after it, her arm in the area of the injection site gradually became red and warm and indurated slightly without pain About the same time she noted a sense of fatigue and feverishness. Her temp was 100.4 or thereabouts. This persisted for a couple of days with no fever in the morning or midday but feverishness in the late afternoon /early evening and the temp always between 100.2 100.4. The redness of the upper arm increased to an area of about 2x3 inches. On Feb 2nd or 3rd she began a ten day course of penicillin 500mg qid x 24 hr then 250 mg qid x 9 days. The redness, induration and warmth improved and returned to normal gradually over the next 5 days or so. She stopped the penicillin on Feb 12th. Her temperatures in the late afternoons during the time of taking the penicillin were mostly between 100 and 100.4 and in the final couple of days of taking the penicillin it seemed to be resolving. The day after the penicillin it was 99. However, on the 15th it was 101. and since then it has been about 100.4 Her arm still appears normal  .  Other symptoms she is complaining of bilateral lateral hip pain. She feels quite achy. She believes this started since the vaccine dose I believe she may have had some complaints prior to it. No joint complaints, no upper extremity symptoms other than as above. No HA, ST. She has had what she describes as &#34;spasms in her chest&#34;) which has improved but presented about the same time as the arm and temperature did. No Gi symptoms. Her activity has not been curtailed. Neck pain bilat was noted starting the end of December without other symptoms and wo any hx of trauma and did not feel like a typical wry neck.    No travel other than for the vaccine, to the grocery store and rarely to another shop. No exposures to anyone other than our grandchildren, son and dau-in-law who are in our &#34;bubble&#34; (the granddaughter attends an out door preschool where they all wear masks and have had no covid cases.Patient walks weekly out doors with a friend. She sees her mother who at 96 resides at home and sees no one.  She had a NP swab for Covid PCR test yesterday (the 17th) which is reported this am as &#34;undetected&#34;.  An evaluation with Doctor led to blood work showing wbc 9.2, hgb 11, plt 546k, ESR 74, CRP 67 a diagnosis of PMR was tentatively made and she was started on prednisone 15 mg /d.  Improvement was seen at 24 hours and persisted. Neck pain is 80% better as well.  Questions: Did the vaccine play a role in exacerbating a preceeding condition of PMR? If the neck pain is a red herring, did the vaccine cause PMR?

A little muscle soreness, a little tired feeling but not enough to keep me from my morning routine of going to church at 7:00 a.m.   I got home around 8:00 am, muscles ache now, and tired feeling more pronounced.  I took two Advil around 8:30 a.m..  but by 10:00 a.m. I had a low grade fever of 100.2.  which subsided for a few hours, then returned late afternoon  around 4:00 pm at 100.4 degrees.  Tired and achy feeling continued the rest of 2/22/2021.  Morning of 2/23/2021, did not get up at regular time nor go to church...general &#34;washed out&#34; feeling, muscle aches improved.  Long nap in the afternoon and woke feeling better.  Today, 2/24/2021  I am back to normal. Went to church, grocery store and plan on doing my 3 mile walk later today if it warms up enough!

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

                                                During introduction of myself to patient and her husband who both wanted to receive vaccine, patient verbalized anxiousness related to inability to bring mother in with her to receive a vaccine as well. I educated on how they could get the mom an appointment or come to a clinic that we host and patient was then calmed down and relieved that the was more opportunity in future for vaccination. Discussed all registration paper work, V safe paper importance, and EUA form for the Covid 19 vaccination. I then proceeded to vaccinate patient after she verified and verbalized authorization to administer. I then did the same process with husband.  After receiving vaccination, patient was escorted to the observation room for 15 minute waiting period to be monitored for any reactions. After patient sat down with husband who was also vaccination I verified they felt fine and reiterated the importance of notification of any side effects to monitor for, pointed them to the medics in the room and both patient and husband verbalized understanding. A conversation of signing up mom and other family  members to receive vaccine through our notification system online was also talked about for an additional 2-3 minutes and then I said my goodbye, thanked them, and left the observation room.  After leaving the observation room to accept my next vaccine  appointment patients husband notified the EMS medics that his wife, the patient, didn&#39;t feel well.   The EMS medics took over and called for an ambulance.

Towards evening and during the night I felt cold and hot at the same time - an intense burning/freezing sensation, but no sweating. On the first day after the injection (1/15/201) the arm was still sore and I still felt tired - burning/freezing sensation had ceased. On the second day after the injection (1/16/2021) the left arm was not sore and I felt better, but at 11:00 a.m. the vein in the left temple burst and bled until about 6:00 p.m. Continuous throbbing pain across the forehead the entire day. The  middle of the forehead is covered with red dots; the area near the left eye has a number of open, bloody lesions; the area below the temple (left cheek) is black and blue. There are also two bright red spots on my left knee - but no bleeding. Nausea was slight, but present during the entire day on Saturday and Sunday. Since the hospitals have Covid 19 patients and I do not have a car, I stayed home and rested in bed.  Today on Sunday (1/17/2021) I can sit up and walk around somewhat; the throbbing pain in the head has ceased. The lesions are still vivid red , but slowly forming a crust.  Will make contact with my doctor  on Monday, when the office is open.

The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

                                                On day 6 he woke up feeling very weak. Needed help getting out of bed. He has a degenerative muscle disease (Inclusion Body Myositis) so is already very weak, wheelchair bound. House is set up with all lift chairs or elevated (Bed, Toilet) so he can get out of them with very weak legs. By mid morning he was not able to use legs or arms at all to get up and had difficulty holding head up (usually no problem). By afternoon temperature went to 103.6. and he ached all over. After 2 - 3 hours with dose of 2 extra strength Tylenol temperature came down to 100.6 and then another hour later he became very sweaty all over body and temp returned to normal. Continued very weak for a few days. Gradually regained strength and back to normal strength for him over 6 days.

                                                I work at  medical center where patient is being treated for a new diagnosis of Acute monocytic leukemia.  I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

Family subsequently arrived including son and daughter and all family members were in the ER room are in agreement that patient would not want further aggressive cares given her extremely poor prognosis in light of chronic debilitation with numerous medical issues and now a very long period of CPR.   Hospital Course After updating family they stated patient would not want further aggressive cares given her grim prognosis and chronic severe and debilitating medical issues.  She continued to have myoclonic jerking.  She was extubated to comfort cares in the ER and did not pass immediately therefore brought to a room.

                                                4 days after the vaccine, I had EXCRUCIATING nerve pain, starting at the upper vertabrae and  shooting down both arms to fingertips. Sometimes all the way down my back and the back of my legs.  I vomited all day, had a low fever which  lasted for 24 hours, then the pain and fever subsided. Still have nausea but no more vomiting .  I went to a doctor  after that, he also thinks it was a reaction..  On the 7th day, a purple splotchy rash showed on my skin and my hands started swelling up at night, so painful I couldn&#39;t even pull up the sheet.  The hand swelling goes down during the day and comes back at night.  I plan to get an antibody test  on  Feb. 26.  I am 98% certain that I had COVID in July, it was precisely the same symptoms and I had with the vaccine.  No treatment, just resting tilll it&#39;s over.  I am almost 80% better now, but not completely. I worry that I will never get back to 100%, it&#39;s been  11 days now.

She no sooner said to wait 30 mins, I turned to look at clock and bam! everything hit at once.   I was told to go to ambulance on site. They put me in ambulance, covered me, gave me oxygen,  and fluids via iv. Blood pressure was 189/115, heart rate was 40.  Dr said I was very flushed. I was having difficult time breathing.   Oh, they gave me benadryl and I believe? steroids.  Had to wait for another ambulance as the one there had to stay onsite. I was taken to emergency room at hospital where I stayed on oxygen and new iv of steroids. Was at hospital for 4 hrs till bp was considered safe enough to release me.   I still have head ache and neck pain, back of neck.  Also sleeping much more than usual.6  Before getting shot I had asked the person giving shot if my allergies to penicillin and morphine would prevent my getting shot.  I had listed these on the paperwork necessary to getting shot.  She said they were looking for reactions to like the flu shot.

                                                3 hours after receiving injection, I had severe diarrhea.  Into the night I began vomiting (which lasted all night)  I became feverish, had chills with body shaking, extreme nausea. (temp 102) This persisted to the next day and I went to the ER.  There I was given  multiple liters of IV fluids,  IV Zofran and IV Tylenol.   I felt better after treatment but still had the intense headache and ringing in the ears.  The next day, I&#39;m now gradually beginning to feel better, just weak.  I can eat today, two days after the injection and slowly beginning to feel better.   This reaction was terrible for me.

We both took part in an phase 2 antibody trial.  Since this is a double blind trial, we don&#39;t know who received the antibodies, but my wife&#39;s condition did not improve where mine improved almost immediately after the infusion

By 10:00 AM, I had a moderate headache that lasted the rest of the day even though I did take some Ibuprofen.  5 days after, I was extremely fatigued but able to go to work and do my daily activities but went to sleep soon after dinner.  6 days after was a repeat of the extreme fatigue but I did get through my day and went to sleep early.  Day 7, I woke up feeling great and have not had any other symptoms.

Soreness went away and injection site could not be found. 5 days after the shot was administered,, my arm started getting sore and I felt achy.  The 6th day, symptoms got worse, achy and chills, but no fever that I am aware of.  7th day, symptoms persisted but not as bad, except that my arm had swollen up and turned red all the way to my elbow and felt  like a large hard knot.  Today, I am not as achy or chilled, but my arm is still hot, red, and swollen .  The redness is below the injection site, although the injections site looks like a little red pimple, whereas earlier, I couldn&#39;t even find it.

No pain.  Initially felt a little fatigue after shot, but this side effect was delayed.  Since I am unble to get second dose in right arm due to Lymphedema from Breast Cancer surgery (2004), I want to be sure I can get second dose in  that arm.

                                                First vaccine digestive symptoms and minor aches; very sore left arm lasted 7 days; 2nd vaccine: 102 degree fever on next day; aches and pains all over; could barely get out of bed; inability to eat at all for 24 hours; digestive symptoms: gas, acid refulx, nausea; giant burps. By next day, very painful electric transitory pains (seconds) in core of my vascular formation in my upper left leg. This is a congenital defect that responds to estrogen, but also some medicines like synthroid, which I do not take after getting reaction with just 3 pills. Successfully moderated Hashimoto&#39;s with strict gluten-free and dairy-free diet. I have never experience such severe leg pain and massive swelling, still happening today. Th The only other time that I have experienced these short intermitent &#34;electric&#34; pains was during infertility treatment at age 40, more than 30 years ago. I suspect something in the adjuvant. I hope that this will exit my body because the sudden swelling and severe pain is not something I can endure. It barely beats dying from Covid-19. My quality of life is wrecked for the time being. I suspect that this vaccine has caused an autoimmune attack on my vascular malformation; that my T cells have gone beserk. I&#39;d be willing to have my antibodies against Covid checked and I&#39;ll bet I have more than average! The havoc for people with autoimmunity and Moderna vaccine is serious. I despair and hope that it won&#39;t have a lasting impact on my health. I will volunteer to be studied, but no more Moderna vaccine for me! I trusted the medical establishment and government and this has not worked out well!

                                                Received #1 dose as stated.  Next day, 1/27/21, 9:00am , had mild joint pain to both legs, &amp; arms, &amp; slightly tired.  Shortly after that , while driving, had nausea, &amp; muscle aches to legs &amp; arms.  Reaching family members home, could barely carry bags with each arm, due to pain in joints, and to muscles, getting worse.  Through the next 6 hrs. had moderate to severe pain to joints, &amp; muscles &amp; gradually severe fatigue. Took 1 Tylenol 650 mg for pain.   Also, checked temperature thru out this time, with only mild 99.5 temp.  Vaccine site gradually became swollen, with increased pain.  Was doing work on computer, but could not continue, so left for my home, &amp; went to bed, to sleep.  Lt.  Arm started becoming red, with severe soreness &amp; swelling by 1/28/21, 2 days after vaccine.  Vaccine was given very high on my arm, almost shoulder area.  All Symptoms continued for about 10 days, including  to vaccine arm, which continued with redness &amp; soreness for 2 weeks.   My physician was notified.   She advised NSAID before #2 dose, but I already take NSAID daily (Meloxicam), so don&#39;t think I can take another NSAID.  I have been taking Tylenol 650mg at least twice a day, for increased joint &amp; muscle pain, since vaccine.  My 2nd dose, originally scheduled for 2/23/21 has been rescheduled to 2/27/21 due to no vaccines available.

I was also so fatigued that I could do nothing all day except lay on the couch or in bed. I felt better that night around 8 PM. The injection site was also swollen, red and painful for about 5-6 days.  Today, it was itchy.

                                                On 01/11/2021, within a few hours of my grandmother getting the shot her injection area became red, swollen and hot to the touch. At around midnight the day her shot she started to experience tingling on both sides of my tounge. She an unusually restless night and on 1/12/2021 woke up feeling very tired and over all worn down.  Around 10:45a my I called to check on her she said she had just checked her temp and it was 99.6.  She was complaining of being very cold and had the shivers.  While on the phone she started to develop a stutter. At first it was one word every 14-20 word but it quickly got worse to the point where she couldn&#39;t get a full  word out and just sounds. I immediately left work and went to her house. On my way we contacted 911.  It took me about 10 mins to get to her house and when I got there she was semi- unresponsive on the couch making moaning noises and shaking. She was having severe muscle spasms throughout her body. You could see her muscles tighten and release. EMS got there within a few minutes after me. They checked her temp and it had increased to 101.00 she was a bit responsive and they were able to take her vitals however, it was difficult due to her shaking and convulsing. They transported her to the hospital and by they time they arrived (within 15 mins) her temp was then 102.6. She was still shaking, not lucid and stuttering her words. They hospital ran several tests to rule out stroke and other possible reasons for her symptoms- they said she had to be having a delayed reaction to the shot. She was extremely dehydrated, they hooked her up to an IV, she had an extremely elevated white blood count and was overall &#34;out of it&#34;. She was given IV antibiotics and observed.

Applied 2% Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride which helped.  Fever and headache gone and did not return.  Body aches less each day.  1/17?2021 Body aches, arm soreness gone. Itchy rash lighter in color, but remains today as I file this. Not concerned about it. Am sure it will go away soon.

It did not get to a point of an anaphylactic shock just a mild reaction. I consulted my PCP afterwards regarding the second dose and he said since it was not severe and I was able to take care of it myself, I could get the second one.

It took me about 1 hour before I felt able to drive myself home. Nurses gave me 2 bottles of water and took my blood pressure. It was 150/84 higher than normal for me.

Saw my primary and she said it could be they gave it too high and irritated the shoulder joint.  She is concerned about &#34;frozen shoulder&#34;.  It wakes me in the night and no position lasts without pain after 30-45 seconds.  Take one extra strength Tylenol before bed and administer Sagely 250 mg. BD cream on upper arm and part of neck where pain exits.  Last night I drank 3 glasses of red wine so I could sleep a few hours and today I have had no pain!   little weakness and I&#39;m trying not to aggravate it, but hopefully the site pain is resolving.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                #1. I received the Moderna vaccine on 1/18/2021 in my right upper arm. On that Monday I experienced a small ache and redness at the injection site. On Tuesday 1/19 I had flu like symptoms, more pain at the injection site and a larger and firmer area at the injection site. Wed. 1/20 flu like symptoms were gone, but my upper arm was very sore in movement and by touch, was very red and swelling occurred. Thurs. 1/21 my upper arm was still painful to touch and swollen. Friday 1/22 a little less sore, still very red and itchy. Saturday 1/23 only slight discomfort, but very itchy. 1/24 Through 1/27 still very dark pink, still some swelling and intensely itchy. There was something hard protruding from the injection site, On 1/25 we tried to pull it out but it broke off and we dropped it before we could examine it. There is still a small amount of whatever it was protruding from the injection site. My next dose is supposed to be given on 2/15/2021, but I am very anxious about receiving it. I have reached out in an email dated 1/25/2021 but no response so far. My husband has an appointment with a dermatologist today 1/27/2021 and I am going to ask the Dr. to look at my arm.

I called my primary care physician but no one returned my call.   Awoke around 2:21 am, I am moist, my fever had broken.  Feeling much better.  During this period I experienced intense anger which was troubling.  I though I had been given the virus rather than the vaccine.  I am experiencing a much better mood this morning.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included rosuvastatin and eye drop.  On 16 Jan 2021, approximately 0 days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number 041L20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced chills, nausea and headache, all of which resolved within 36 hours on 18 Jan 2021. She took 3 Tylenol, and a Zomig to help with the symptoms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient began to experience neuropathy in her finger and right arm, which she reported as it was getting worse.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The events, chills, nausea and headache, were considered resolved on 18 Jan 2021. The outcomes of the events, neuropathy in the finger / neuropathy in the right arm  were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report concerns a 73-year-old female patient who experienced a serious event of neuropathy in the right finger and non-serious events of chills, nausea and headache. The events of chills, nausea and headache occurred on the same day after the administration of the first dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (Lot #: Unknown, expiration date-Unknown). Neuropathy occurred 8 days after the administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine. Treatment administered included Tylenol and Zomig for chills, nausea and headache with resolution.  The events of chills, nausea and headache are consistent with the safety profile for mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Based on the information provided, including temporal association and in the absence of any other etiology, a causal association cannot be excluded for all reported events. Causality for the event of neuropathy is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Main field defaults to possibly related&#39;

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included breast cancer.  No concomitant medications were reported.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 029L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Jan 2021, the patient experienced chills, dizzy, temperature, hands were shaking, passed out and sweating profusely. The treatment for the events included paracetamol.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced, nausea, heart rate at 107 heartbeats per minute and stomach discomfort.   The treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome for the events, chills, dizzy, temperature, hands were shaking, passed out, sweating profusely, nausea, heart rate at 107 and stomach discomfort was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old female patient, who experienced serious event of loss of consciousness and non-serious events of chills, dizziness, temperature abnormal, tremors, hyperhidrosis, nausea, heart rate increased, and abdominal discomfort. The reported events occurred on the same day after first dose of mRNA-1273, (lot # 029L20A) with the exception of nausea, heart rate increased, and abdominal discomfort which occurred at unknown date. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen. The patient was seen by physician and then sent to emergency room where it was determined that the patient had DVT in the left leg. A computerized tomogram (CT) scan found clots in the left lung, or saddle PE.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital.  Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking.

(A trip from my bed to the bathroom was difficult.)  This proceeded to severe nausea (I retched into the. toilet bowl a couple of times and came close to vomiting).  I dosed in bed and the severity of the symptoms eased, but I really haven&#39;t felt completely over it until today (2-22-2021).

This continued throughout the night (I could not get warm) until I fully awoke at 7:00 a.m. when  took my temperature.  That was 100.6.  After speaking to my doctors office, I took Tylenol and my temperature reduced to 99.8 for the rest of the day.  By 9:00 p.m., it had gone down to normal without medication.  I still suffered from exhaustion and seem to have ongoing digestive issues.

                                                On Sat morning upon arising and taking a shower I noticed a red line almost welt on my arm by afternoon there were 2 lines and they were getting longer and wider. By Monday morning the area covered with puffiness and redness was about  at least 4 inches wide and going  almost entirely around the arm. It hurt and was very warm to touch along with starting to itch. It was not hard at the\at time. Placed a call to my doctor and was advised to see him or urgent care. I choose the later to do. In checking it out they mentioned that they have been seeing the quite often in the last couple weeks. Take an aspirin, tylenol or ibuprophn  and put cold conpresses on for 20 minutes as often as I can. This morning (Tuesday 23rd of February) it has enlarged again some redness is gone but it apprears to be black and blue now. Still itching, I have not itched it as of yet.

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the first COVID vaccine she developed shortness of breath that was much more significant than she had previously. This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don&#39;t think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I&#39;m sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.

The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 Jan 2021, approximately five days prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Jan 2021, the patient developed a cough. The patient&#39;s temperature was recorded at 101 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient went to doctor. She was fatigued and coughing blood and was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment included azithromycin, and the patient seemed to improve.  On 05 Feb 2021, the patient developed a temperature of 101°F, coughed up blood and was very fatigued. She was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment for the event included levofloxacin.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, pneumonia, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of pneumonia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s elderly age and medical history of COPD are considered a risk factors.

The patient&#39;s medication history was not reported. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Mar 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 044A21A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   Since an unspecified day in 2021, after receiving vaccine, the patient experienced each day her temperature is going up and she had a temperature of 106 (medically significant). Treatment included acetaminophen every 4 hours and her doctor told her to take ibuprofen as well.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The outcome of the event was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

My arm was very swollen, fatigue and bad headache with loud ringing in the head. My blood pressure accelerated  to nearly 200/88 and had to be admitted to the ER three days after shot. I was in the hospital for two days and had a series of CAT scans and ultrasounds.  Loud ringing in my head has not stopped. Never had a history of high blood pressure, but now they put me on high blood pressure medication along with the baby aspirin. I was a relatively healthy woman until I had these vaccinations.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

Day 8, arm itchy and red around the injection site.  Warm to the touch. Day 9, more redness and larger area. Size of a silver dollar.  Talked to the nurse at a local gym. Suggested a clinic. I Saw a Nurse Practioner at a clinic. She thought perhaps it was an insect bite as the red area was about 4 inches below where a &#39;normal shot&#39; would be given. Prescribed cream and antibiotic. I didn&#39;t take it.  Took Benadryl (pill). Improving after 1 hr of taking Benadryl.

Started feeling sick during the night, knew something was wrong.  Could barely get out of bed, was hot, possibly low grade fever, had chills, was achy, bad headache like you feel when having the flu, weakness.   Took Tylenol and her regular medicines.  Today, 1/29/21 when she woke up still has extreme soreness, hot to touch.  She looked at her left arm and it&#39;s all swollen, red and itchy.  She&#39;s now afraid to go back for the 2nd vaccine.   Caller her pharmacy due to her arm and she was instructed to take Benadryl and Ibuprofen, which she only takes Tylenol.

                                                On Jan 26th when I woke up in the morning I saw that a large portion of my upper left arm was very bright red and over the subsequent 3 days including today the area of redness expanded, got larger. So now the red rash is covering almost my entire upper left arm down to the elbow. And day of onset I had a low grade fever but temp was normal after that. In the center of the rash, there is a darker area that was slightly swollen and the whole area, but especially the darker, area is warm to the touch. I did see the Dr. on Wednesday January 27th and he prescribed Keflex antibiotic which I am still taking.

She has longstanding difficult-to-control seizure disorder, on valproate, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam. She had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in November 2020, probably discovered in the course of surveillance testing of residents/staff, perhaps in relation to an outbreak in the residence.  Sometime during the night following her vaccination earlier that morning, she developed a fever, and then was found to be having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Estimates of duration in the records range from 20 to 40 minutes. She was brought by ambulance to Hospital ED, and then admitted. Her temperature was said to be 103 F.  She received midazolam, and at least one dose of IV antibiotics. By the evening of admission on 5 February 2021, she was still unresponsive.  On arrival, her COVID-19 PCR was again/still positive. She had no prodromal symptoms suggesting COVID-19 reinfection, nor did anyone in the group home, staff or residents.  Her initial WBC was normal but with a slight left shift. UA was normal. Head CT showed her known cerebral atrophy and chronic microvascular disease.  Admitting valproate serum level was subtherapeutic; levatiracetam and lamotrigine levels were therapeutic.  Blood cultures are no growth at 2 days. Urine culture negative.  By hospital day 2, her transaminases had bumped to over 1000.

Vaccine 2 awakened at 2:00 AM in extraordinary pain in my whole body,, dry heaved for 4 hours, sweats and chills, temp only 99 (I usually run 97) Felt sick to stomach rest of  day. Never felt this sick.  By evening it left as quickly as it came.  Was tired for several days but nothing else. On Feb 16th awakened with an very sharp pain in the injection site when I moved my arm up to stretch. This has gotten worse every day. When I move my arm in a certain direction it feels like it is ripping inside. It is not bruised and not painful to the touch. It is inside and in the same location as the injection. Heat and ice make no difference. It seems to be getting more painful and feel it more often. It is painful enough that I let out a yelp when I forget and lift my arm a certain way. As of yesterday I feel it all day, not the sharp pain but more a inside burning, not enough to stop me, but I know it os there.

Red area on sot arm by that evening - next day (2nd day after shot) developed red rashes by  outside of each breast, larger spot by left side (where shot was given), spot on left side of my neck also.  Not a raised or bumpy rash at all, not sore or itchy.    Called advise nurse to determine taking a benedryl was ok and took one last night.  This morning rash less noticeable but still there - also new little mark on inner left elbow.  Feeling fine this whole time, just concerned because I haven?t read of this reaction much for second Moderna.

She said she had an epi pen with her. I asked her if she thought it was time to administer and call 911 she said yes. We proceeded. She said her throat was feeling a little better but chest was tight and she was having a dry cough. Ambulance took her to hospital. I called her around Noon the next day to check in on her and she said she was in hospital still being monitored. Was advised not to get second dose of vaccine from hospital.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had my first dose of the Moderna Vaccine 1/14 with minor discomfort. On 1/21 area around the site felt itchy. On 1/22 morning I saw large red circle that was slightly sore and hot to the touch. On 1/22 afternoon I called for appointment.  Since none was available I went to urgent care where I was prescribed Doxycycline.  Have been taking it as prescribed and circle has been slowly fading away but is still visible.  I  thought it might have been a reaction to an insect bite, but now a friend who got the vaccine the same day I did is experiencing the same reaction.   I  would like to know if you think this is connected to the vaccine and if so could it affect the efficacy of the vaccine? I am also concerned about taking the second dose.

On Monday,  1/25/21, I contacted my primary care doctor.

It itches, is red, but other than the itch it has not bothered me at this point.  I went to a walk-in clinic and was told it could be cellulitis. (bacteria) at the injection site.  He has placed me on an antibiotic starting today.  The rash, swelling on my arm, is hot to the touch and I prefer non-one touch it.  The physician at the walk in said to add heat to the site.  I have also gotten a cough.   He prescribed something for this also.  My Covid case was very mild.

Headache continued for three days during which no medical attention was sought. Confirmed that patient never took any NSAIDs to treat headache during this time. On day 4, patient had a subdural hematoma accompanied by two seizures upon which she was flown to a hospital to receive treatment.  Husband did state that patient is on warfarin due to factor V deficiency and that treating physician thought that this was most likely caused by the warfarin, however that the vaccine could not be ruled out completely. Husband also said INR has always been within normal limits.

More sore every day up to the shoulder bone, down to the elbow in the muscle.  The bone at the top of her shoulder hurts as well.  Thought it was going to go away and after 3 weeks is still having these symptoms.  Takes an aspirin once a day, and Ibuprofen on occasion for the pain, but nothing more.  The pain is not so bad that she can&#39;t stand it, but it&#39;s uncomfortable and feels like it is in the bone itself.

                                                Woke up about 1:00 am in delirium and feverish. No control over thought process or able to get up. Managed to get out of bed at 9:00 am but was so weak could barely make it up a flight of stairs. And when I did ended up in bathroom vomiting. Laid on floor to get some strength back. Went back to bed and slept restlessly until 4:00 pm.  Still feverish and weak but not as bad as earlier. Ate some cold grapes and went back to bed until the following morning. Tried to stay hydrated and took ibuprofen several times. My upper arm was red and blotchy for 3 days. Overall I?d say the severest part of the event lasted 48 hrs and another 24 hrs of tiredness and nausea but not vomiting.

                                                Yesterday 2/21/21 started having itching on her arm, round area when she looked in the mirror at the time of her vaccine.  Area is warm, very itchy and 1 1/2&#34; x 1 1/2&#34; in size.  The area is also red today, intensely itchy.  Did put cortisone cream on it yesterday, which didn&#39;t make it go away, possibly reduced the itching some, but not much.  She does also have a headache today.  She takes a lot of vitamins, and has not taken anything else for the reactions.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine she felt a tingling/little something going down into her hand, but she did not think about it being the shot and did not report it.  Then went home, took a Tylenol and that afternoon her arm was sore like the normal reaction.  She went to bed, woke up at 1:00 AM and her arm was killing her/hurting.  She got up and went to the bathroom and noticed that her hand was swollen and the veins on the top of her hand were protruding.  She looked in the mirror and noticed that the left side of her neck was swollen.  Then she took her temperature and it was elevated, her normal is 97 and it was 99.  Later on that day on Saturday the inflammation got better.  She did not take anything for it.   The symptoms have progressively gotten better and now her hand is normal, her neck this morning looked normal and her temperature is back to her baseline.

                                                As her husband, and caregiver since 2017, when she was diagnosed with dementia (I believe she had symptoms long before that) I noticed a very observable increase in the severity of her symptoms of confusion, memory loss, not being able to stay focused, disorientation, anxiety, agitation, anger, depression as a direct result of the second dose of the covid vaccine  The change was very noticeable and has not gotten any better. This appears to be a permanent escalation in the severity of her symptoms. I would say she has advanced  a stage to stage 5. We are now considering adding a new drug for her to take to try and level things out.   She also appeared to have a slight fever for 48 hours after.
