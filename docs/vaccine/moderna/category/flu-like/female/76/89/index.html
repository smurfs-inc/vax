Within the next 2-3 hours felt tingling in my left upper lip. It grew worse and headache worsened. Lip felt like it was swelling but no change was seen. Then left side of face began to ache. Took 2 more Tylenol. Texted my primary care physician who recommended Benadryl in case it was an allergic reaction. Took Benadryl about 4:30 or 5:00.  Left work and went home. Had severe headache. Took my blood pressure. It was 185/68. Had some old Propanolol 10 mg from 2 years earlier and took one and a Prednisone 10mg. By 9:00 pm still felt bad with facial pain and tingling. BP decreased to 148/89. Took another Benadryl and went to bed. Face ant lip better in the morning. Arm sore for 2 days. Developed body and joint aches for the past 2-3 days. Slowly resolving.

The symptoms I&#39;ve had from the shot are pretty much the same as when I was sick.  I was fortunate not to have any respiratory symptoms either time as confirmed by my oximeter.  I had two Antibody tests.  One on Nov. 23rd, which was positive for both  IgG and IgM.  I had my second anti-body test on 1/17/2021, the day of my injection which was positive for IgG and negative for IgM.  I have not contacted my doctor concerning this and I am taking Advil for the fever and ached and pains.  Today i feel better than yesterday.

Critical care was necessary to treat or prevent imminent or life-threatening deterioration of the following conditions: cardiac failure, circulatory failure, CNS failure or compromise, dehydration, hepatic failure, endocrine crisis, metabolic crisis, renal failure, sepsis, respiratory failure, shock, toxidrome and trauma.  I provided critical care services requiring my management in the following manner: chart data review, documentation time, medication orders and management, re-evaluations, vital signs assessments and reviewing monitor data, and ordering and reviewing lab tests.  Aggregate Critical care time was 30 minutes.  My time did not include minutes spent treating any other patient simultaneously or on activities that did not directly contribute to the patient&#39;s treatment.  It did not include time spent performing other reported procedures.  Medical Decision Making:  This is a 76-year-old female who presented ER today for evaluation of syncope.  Patient was reportedly mildly hypotensive which improved with IV fluids.  I suspect that patient had dehydration given 4 episodes of large watery stools.  Patient had no recent antibiotic use and has no C. difficile risk factors, suspect this may be related to her Covid vaccine, she had no evidence to suggest anaphylactic shock, patient felt better after IV fluid bolus was able to ambulate around the emergency department without lightheadedness or near syncope.  She had troponins x2 which were negative, her EKG was nonischemic and there was no evidence of ectopy or arrhythmia.  Patient did have syncope and fell onto her side, she denies discrete head injury although patient is anticoagulated, CT head was obtained to rule out intracranial hemorrhage given the syncopal event.  Patient CT abd/pelvix was negative for obvious cause of patient&#39;s abdominal tenderness may be related to her diarrheal illness patient will be prescribed Bentyl.  She will call her primary care doctor in the morning to arrange close follow-up.  She understands need for aggressive oral hydration at home.  She will have low threshold to return should she develop lightheadedness syncope chest pain shortness of breath palpitations worsening abdominal pain bloody or dark stools any new or concerning symptoms.  The patient presented to the emergency department with potentially life or limb-threatening symptoms.      After my history, examination, and workup have decided that the patient is stable.    My impression is that they are safe to go home at this time.  I have reviewed ED return precautions with the patient. They understand to return if they are concerned for any reason.   They will follow-up with their PCP in 1-2 days.        Impression:  Syncope, hypotensionimproved, dehydration  Plan:   Discharge   Follow Up    Within: 1-2 days    Comments: Please call your doctor in the morning to arrange follow-up with your primary care doctor in the next 24 hours.  Please stay well-hydrated and eat regular meals.  Please take Bentyl as needed for abdominal cramping with diarrhea.  Please return to the ER if you develop worsening abdominal pain, feelings of lightheadedness passing out any new or concerning symptoms.

                                                COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Ten days after the injection of Covid 19 injection my arm swelled up, and became very red and itchy at the site of the injection.  It just came up out of nowhere it seems as I had no reaction at all to the vaccine during the prior 10 days since the vaccination. This continued for two days.  The first day after it happened I felt tired and weak in the morning.  I got into work here at the house and the weakness went away.  I treated the itchy situation with Clobetasol Propionate Cream which I had here and was prescribed by my dermatologist for poison ivy.  That took away the itchy situation that was very annoying.  Two days into it the swelling began to go down.  Today is the 4th day since the problem occurred and there is no swelling and only a slight redness.  I am assuming that I can take injection #2 on February 9 as scheduled.

                                                VACCINE received on Friday 1/15/2021 afternoon; Monday evening 1/18/2021 felt slight chills; early to bed. Tuesday AM awoke with severe &#39;bed-rocking&#39; chills, nausea and fever 100-101 degrees. recommended I go to Hospital ER.  At ER, temperature increased to 102 degrees.  Covid test was negative, but cost X-ray showed reasons to suspect pneumonia. No one suggested I was just suffering acute reaction to vaccine.  Returned home w/ prescription for doxycycline hyclate and request that I return to the ER the next day if I continued to feel ill.  The next morning, 1/19/21, I again awoke with intense, somewhat frightening chills, vomiting and a mild fever.  As instructed I returned to the ER.  Assuming the COVID Test may have been a false negative, a second one was given; it too turned out to be negative, but I remained at the ER and then admitted to Hospital to remain under observation.  Im the hospital the chills, nausea and fever came to an end, but acute headache and utter fatigue lasted until I was released on Jan 22.  My discharge papers indicated no further signs of pneumonia or any other infection; my attending doctor, concluded that my experience was an unusually strong (and delayed) reaction to the 1st dose of the Moderna Vaccine.

I took a baby aspirin because I was afraid I was having a stroke. This lasted about 5 hours. Then I developed a head ache just behind my nose. The headache subsided in the mid afternoon, but I was wiped out and slept most of the day. Today (the next morning) I feel fine, just a little tired.

Pt was feeling much better and talking within ten minutes.  We stayed with the patient and monitored her continuously until her observation time was complete and when she left with family she was alert, oriented, and said she felt much better.  Instructed patient and her family to give us a call if they had any further questions or concerns and to go to the ER if any serious reaction symptoms occurred.

                                                Began to have slight wheezing and coughing on Wed afternoon, the day after getting the shot.  Thursday wheezing and coughing increased and woke me up during the night several times.  Cough was productive with clear sputum.  Friday felt very tired all day and coughing and wheezing increased substantially, producing shortness of breath upon any exertion, like going up and down the stairs.  Very tired.  Began to think I&#39;d have to go to see the Dr. because wheezing was significant with every breath.  Cough was racking, increasing through the day into the evening.  At 10 p.m. I began to wonder if I&#39;d make it through the night without calling the rescue squad.  Couldn&#39;t take a deep breath or speak a whole sentence with out a coughing jag.  Then, suddenly about 11:30, it just ceased.  The tightness in my chest went away, the coughing with every inhalation stopped and I could take a deep breath.  It was a bit stunning.  Because I had pulmonary embollisms about ten years ago, my lungs have been a weak spot in my body with bronchitis occurring frequently.  I hadn&#39;t seen reports of this side effect of the vaccine, so I thought I&#39;d report it.  This morning, Saturday four days after the shot, I am breathing much better, not coughing, and do not have any wheezing.

                                                My arm wasn&#39;t sore right away but I think I laid on it and the next morning it was sore. It felt like a bee sting I took some medicine and it went away.  On the 27th I had bad gas. I did try a new cereal and thought it was cereal. On the 28th I still gas and upset stomach like flu like symptoms  and felt light headed but not bad. On the 29th still an upset stomach and had diarrhea, I was still light headed and really shaky. I was really weak. I was shaking a lot at arms (hands) and legs were both shaking  and made it hard to walk. On the 30th I still really light headed and my legs and hands were still shaky, still having difficulty walking, still had an upset stomach and still felt weak. On the 31st my stomach was a lot better, I was still shaky and light headed, and I had a weak feeling. My head felt like when you feel like you have a head cold (pressure in my head). Today my stomach is better, I am still lightheaded and still shaky but not as bad. I still feel pressure in my head, but no runny nose or any other cold symptoms.   These were symptoms I had in March when I was sick for 3 weeks. I was negative for COVID but didn&#39;t get back to my normal self until the June.   Doctor was a private practice and recently closed so I do not see my new doctor till the 24th.

When I looked, it was swollen around the injection area...previously no irritation at all.  At the same time, I felt like I was catching a head cold:  lots of postnasal drip and some coughing and general tiredness.  Injection site symptoms lasted about 24 hours.  Cold like symptoms lasted 3 days.

About 12n my daughter took the temp of my arm and it was 102 so we made ice packs to help with the pain and swelling.  Later she went an bought Cortisone and used the ice packs and Cortisone for about 3 or 4 days when the arm finally begin to get better.  My arm was so painful it was almost unbareable to touch.

She went to bed around 8:00 PM and then she couldn&#39;t sleep all night.  She kept trying to drink liquid, running fever, hot and opened a window with temp being 30 outside.  She could hardly walk to the bathroom due to the muscle weakness and fear of falling.  She tossed and turned all night long.  She got up and her temp was 99.8, and she was told not to go to PT this morning.  She is being treated for a frozen shoulder.   She feels dehydrated and is drinking water, and going to drink Ginger ale and crackers due to the nausea.

                                                On the evening of the first vaccination, my sister experienced chills and fever. The next morning she experienced a kind of paralysis, could not sit up or stand up, was falling out of bed and out of her chair, had to be carried to the bathroom, although she usually can walk by herself. This lasted about a day. I took her to the ER where they excluded other possible causes of her condition and simiply attributed it to the vaccine. No treatment was prescribed.

                                                Almost exactly 24 hours after 2nd shot, my mom was getting her hair done and she started breathing hard.  Hairstylist removed her mask and she then passed out.  Called 911.  They observed my mom sweating, her lips and hands were swollen, she was slack jawed, pale and clammy.   After several minutes she came out of it.  Was given a piece of candy thinking it was a sugar low, but her sugar was high 285 @9:00am.  Her color was still pale and she was still incoherent.  While still on with 911, she became more lucid and said she was feeling better, so ambulance was canceled.   I drove her home and checked her sugar @11:00 - 295 and BP 125/55 pulse 75.  She stayed with me for the rest of Saturday.  Her sugar was still high Saturday evening and Sunday morning.  Upon checking her blood sugar log, her sugar had gone up for a week following the first shot.

                                                Periodic pressure  and tightness across chest and diaphragm especially on day of vaccination and following 2 days. Rapid heart beat followed by afib that was not terminated with normal medications. Dizziness and shortness of breath. Hospitalized with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. It resolved after getting two injections of a medication called diltiazem in the emergency department, after which I was monitored overnight in the hospital. Underwent stress test and echocardiogram - results  normal. On the day I write this (March 1) continue to have  shorter periods of rise in blood pressure and heart rate,  diaphragm tightness, insomnia and lethargy.

The next morning I woke up and the rash was there, and spread over the different areas of body. I was sweating bad, muscle pain, joint pain, and nauseated for about 3 days. I had knots in my arms. I went to the doctor last week, and she gave me a shot in the hip, it helped with the swelling.  Then I called her back and she called in a cream for me.  The other symptom remaining is the rash at the injection site, I have been putting the cream on it twice a day, taking Benadryl and Tylenol for pain

Next morning after around 11 am patient started to vomit almost a lot, her fever went up to around 38.5C auxiliary, she reported extreme weakness and shakiness, her blood pressure also increased to 160s/high 90s, she complained of extreme shortness of breath. Elevated BP could be related to the fact that she was vomiting so much, she had hard time taking her scheduled medications, included BP medications.   This lasted for 3 days. Patient was taking Ondasentron and that was only reliving nausea for 2 to 3 hours. She was taking Tylenol to bring her fever down. 650 mg Tylenol was only lowering temp to about 37.8.  For about 72 hours she was complaining of extreme generalized pain and weakness and had very hard time getting up to go the bathroom.  She started to fill a little better on March 27, 2021. Shortness of breath disappeared in the morning. Temperature fell to 37.1C. She stopped vomiting and was able to eat.  Generalized weakness and shakiness persisted till March 2, 2021. At the moment of submitting this report, patient is still reporting that she does not feel that she is &#34;100% back to normal&#34;

I notified her that Dr. recommends she place heat on that area of her arm and to call us if any further symptoms develop. She also said she will notify us if she develops a fever 03/04/2021.

                                                From Dr.  notes from the patient&#39;s visit to the office on 02/08/2021:   &#34;*ACUTE CELLULITIS OF THE RIGHT UPPER ARM--I do believe that this is a result of the injection and not due to the vaccine itself. The fact that he continues to have some slight growth does necessitate that we treat this with an antibiotic. I am what have you TAKE TMP-SMX DS 1 tablet twice per day for 7 days. Elevate this arm and keep moist heat to this area and it should improve quickly. Call me if there is any worsening. I will CHECK COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT TODAY to evaluate this more fully.&#34;  Also from Dr. notes from the patient&#39;s visit to the office on 02/08/2021:   &#34;This fine lady comes in today stating that she received the CoVid 19 Moderna vaccine with the first dose on 2/2/21. The patient previously had a moderately severe case of CoVid 19 in late September and early October. She states that the vaccine did cause her to have severe chills for 2 days and then she started to develop an area of erythema near the injection site and this continued to progress. She called me on Friday in regards to this and then on Saturday it had continued to grow. We did have her husband demarcate the borders of the erythema and today it seems like she has had another further growth of an inch or so in most directions. The patient has a little tingling in this area but really has no significant pains and she denies any fevers since she had fever on Thursday night and Friday with a temperature of 102.&#34;

Gradually faded over a one week period.  I had an allergy injection 2 weeks prior to Covid vaccine.  Contacted allergy doctor and we agreed to postpone next allergy injection until after second Moderna vaccine, in case there was a connection.

Was quite concerning but did not call doctor although I sure thought about it. I was wondering if I was actually infected with Covid- 19. Shot was Tuesday 2: 30 PM, felt a bit better by Thursday but arm still hurt even on Friday arm was red and swollen down to my elbow. Saturday fine. I thought someone should know about this as lost of my friends also had difficult reactions. But this was the first time I saw an opportunity to respond.

They put her into a comma with a respirator. Finally went from emergency room to ICU on Monday. Then on Wednesday they took the respirator out and I spoke to her ? told her we all love her and she could only say hoarsely ?terrible, terrible.? They said she might get moved to regular floor. But then Wednesday night couldn?t breathe again and put the respirator back in. Thursday morning husband had it removed and she died that evening at 10:51 on February 25.

On 2/9/2021 she complains more than usual with fatigue, a lot of fatigue so they make the decision to transfer her to the hospital.  In the hospital she was informed that the pain was from a  gallbladder stone,  also that she has a lung condition and a compromised kidney.  A Dr.  from Hospital  tells POC that the patient was not responding to treatments and was compromised thus prolonging the hospital stay.

She gave me the shot anyway, that night I had chills, fever, and diarrhea. The next day I was ok but the following day I noticed my memory started to decline. It got worse where I develop a speech problem and my blood pressure was high. I also noticed that I had an unexpected limp. I went to urgent care and they performed a CT scan of my brain to see if I had a stroke. The results were negative. I wasn&#39;t getting better so they wanted me to go straight to the hospital to get an MRI. The hospital performed the MRI with contrast dye to get images of my brain (stroke). Results are neg,

The patient&#39;s medical history included breast cancer in the right breast. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included cholesterol medication and once weekly Fosamax with calcium and vitamin D.   On 10-MAR-2021, the patient received a dose of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 026A21A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Mar 2021, immediately following the vaccination, the patient reported she experienced overheating, became beet red and her blood pressure was over 300. An ambulance took her to the emergency room. She had her troponin levels checked which were over 4000 that lead to a hospital admission and required a unspecified catherization. The patient was discharged home on unspecified date. She reported still feeling groggy and having difficulty with her cognition but it was improving throughout the day. The patient also reported her arm was still swollen, but improving.   Treatment for the event included diphenhydramine and other unspecified medications and treatments.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.  The events, blood pressure over 300 and troponin over 4,000, were considered recovering.   The events, flushing beet red, overheating, and grogginess were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Called Dr. and he put me on antibiotic (10 days) thinking I had ear infection. Still couldn&#39;t hear well. On 3/1 at 11:45 am had 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. By midnight I had fever, chills. 3/2 fever, chills am, very tired. 3/2 in the evening I thought I would watch tv.  I turned it on and the mouths were moving but I couldn&#39;t understand anything they were saying. 3/8 Went to ENT and had a hearing test. I still had tinnitus. Test results showed that I have a moderate to severe hearing loss in conversation area in both ears. 3/9 Went to ENT who prescribed prednisone beginning with 60 mg. 3/30 Had another hearing test at ENT. Test results showed no improvement, hearing still as on 3/8. So end results I have tinnitus all the time and a hearing loss that I did not have before taking the vaccine.

                                                About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I was sitting in a well organized waiting area I started feeling flames in my throat. My throat was literally on fire. I raised my hand as I was instructed to do. I asked for water, they brought me a bottle water, I started to drink it. My throat was having a difficult time swallowing. They brought me over to nursing area. I went into this area and the nurses were there. They made me take my mask off, they took my blood pressure was way lower then normal (110/30). Then they gave me 50MG Benadryl. They called EMS and I refused to go. I had to wait at the clinic until the Benadryl took effect. The &#34;flame&#34; feeling began to lessen. When I got home I took another dose of Benadryl.  The &#34;flame&#34; feeling went away but then I was left with a sore throat for the rest of the night and the following morning. It felt like there was an actual fire in my throat that the Benadryl put out but then it felt as if the after effects of a burn in my throat.    I do have a call in to my primary care provider and still waiting for a call back.

                                                I received my injection on 1/25/2021 I had my second COVID shot, everything went well, I just had a little pain and swelling and was fine. About 7 hours later i got up from chair and i was dizzy and my balance was off and i almost fell into table. I didn&#39;t feel right. I went and sat back down and i was very tired and i started getting headache. I called my daughter and a nurse she knows told me to take extra strength Tylenol 500 mg take 2 every 6 hours. I started at 730 and went until 130. I slept on and off and got up Tuesday and my arm was still hurting. I was very tired and had no energy. When i got up later in the afternoon i had extreme chills. It was 83 degrees in Florida nd i turned heat up to 84 and i was still shaking. I got under covers and had a fever it was 100.8. Went to sleep that night and fever broke. Got up Wednesday and felt a little better, still had headache and tired. Decided to take a shower. I noticed my left arm where the injection was was all red. 6-7 inches long and about 5 inches wide which i never saw before. after shower I called my PCP I contacted the nurse said she thought it was normal and if there was no  change to call her back on Friday. my arm is still red and warm i went to sleep but couldn&#39;t sleep. I saw an article about COVID arm rash seen after Modern vaccine and now i know that&#39;s what I had. I feel better after I read it in the magazine today and it said it will only last a week. This should be listed as a side effect so nobody else wonders what it is. I drank so much water because it said to drink plenty of water and i tried to use arm as much as possible.

                                                I had Covid on 25 Nov. 2020.  I had extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, aching, headaches and abdominal pain. I have IBS which flared up during this time.  It took me December and January to finally get over the fatigue part. When I received my vaccination on Feb. 12, 2021 (Moderna) by that evening I began to run a temp. of 102-103. I had chills, headache, abdominal pain (worse than in Nov.), fatigue, some dizziness, and short of breath. I felt like I had Covid all over again!  I was down for 5 days. On Sunday afternoon, Feb 14 I went to the Clinic to see the doctor on call.  I was told they could not test me since I had Covid November 25 and it hadn&#39;t been 90 days and I would still have the antibodies.

Got up in the middle of the night and had dry heaves, went back to bed and was okay.  Her arm got really red, hot and blisters all over it like a sunburn.  It is down to about the size of a half dollar today.  The blisters burst and have made places, is still warm and sore and looks like it is drying up.  Did look like a severe sunburn.  She ran a little fever until Thursday night 2/18/21.  The arm is still sore to touch today, 2/22/21.  She took some Tylenol the night her fever was 103, then it went to 101.   The fatigue is diminishing, she has slept a lot, but wonders if her arm is ever going to be right.

                                                11 hours after the vaccination I felt achy all over, my legs felt limp and lump on my arm was sore.  Temperature measured 98.6.  I took two Tylenol and went to bed.  I got up two times during the night to go to bathroom.  I felt more achy all over and unsteady on my feet. Did not want to get out of bed next day, so slept until noon.  At noon my temperature was 100.4. I took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours.  Had a very achy, miserable day and just rested.  Was somewhat better by bedtime and had a better next night of sleep. Next day am still achy but much better.

                                                The patient had her second Moderna shot on Feb 17, 2021. At 3 am the next morning she reported to the ED c/o being &#34;fluish&#34; and short of breath. She was found to be hypoxic to the upper 80&#39;s on RA, and a CXR was consistent with CHF.  She stated she had some off and on chest pain for the last few weeks, especially with exertion. Ultimately it was found that she had an elevated troponin and was felt to have had an MI. She underwent cardiac cath and a stent was placed in a 95% ostial right coronary stenosis.   Although she was reported as having had a &#34;hyperimmune&#34; response to the vaccine, I can only say for certain she had flash pulmonary edema due to cardiac ischemia that was due to a stenosis in her RCA that had been there for quite some time, but possibly just happened to become critical right after her second COVID vaccine. It would be hard to blame the vaccine, but it is also impossible I guess to absolve it from any role in her MI.

                                                Started out with waking the next day a fullness in her head, but kind of a headache, and very tired.  Then a couple of hours later she got a severe case of the chills.  She laid down and slept on and off for about 5 hours.  When she got up she took her temperature and it was 101.  She also had body aches in her back and her legs felt very heavy.  She then noticed a rash on her body from a line that went underneath her breast, and redness on the left side of her breast to her belly button, all red around the belly button.   When she realized she had a fever she took Tylenol.  The rash by Saturday was fading and she also had diarrhea on Saturday, persistent diarrhea.  She felt almost normal except that she was tired.  Today, 3/1/21 she has the returned diarrhea, doesn&#39;t k now if it was related to the vaccine.  She spoke to a nurse yesterday, and she told that she had a typical side effect from the vaccine.  She was not sure if the diarrhea was from the vaccine.

I feel I am 20% improved 25 hours after my second shot.

                                                I had no reaction to the first shot , except sore arm for one day.  After the 2nd shot, the next day I developed a high fever (103) and chills.  I called urgent care that evening to see how to bring the fever down.  They told me that was my body building antibodies.  The fever &#34;broke&#34; later that night.  I never have gotten rid of the chills.  I did not see a doctor for this reaction. During this time, not exactly sure of the dates, the cardiologist started me on a new medicine - Verapamil.   I thought the chills might be from the medicine.  She reduced the dosage due to low heart rate, and I&#39;m still taking the medicine.   I now have a rash on my side and on my left thigh, which is blotchy, red, and itchy.  I do not know if these reactions are from the medicine or from the vaccine, but I suspect it is the Moderna vaccine.  The chills are mostly centered in my legs.  They are not letting up.  I have not seen my doctor about the rash yet.  I have had the rash for a couple of weeks, trying to get rid of it myself.

Upon awakening early on the morning of the second, I had moderate aching in all joints, headache, weakness and fatigue. I stayed quiet for day. Upon getting ready to shower on the morning of the 3rd I found I was covered with an angry bright red rash from my neck down to my knees both front and back. Because I did not shower on the 2nd of March I have no idea when it began. On Thursday my head still felt pressure but felt a little stronger and that evening I again showered and the rash looked less angry and bright. Waking this morning on Friday the 5th the rash is gone and I am feeling much better except for soreness in the armpit of the right arm that received the injection.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported by the reporter.    On 02 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012M20A ) in the left shoulder for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 02 Feb 2021, patient believed the vaccine was given too high on her shoulder, and had nausea, fatigue and pain at the injection site (shoulder and arm) which increased with movements, radiating to the upper limb and had trouble sleeping, treated with Tylenol.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The outcome of events were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                I had quite an adverse reaction to the second MODERNA vaccine.  That afternoon and evening I developed symptoms.  I was experiencing chills, fever, body aches, headache, sore throat, shaking and nausea.   As the week went on, my reaction became worse. I was sweating profusely and had shortness of breath accompanied with burning pain on the top of my hands and feet and a rash.  On Friday morning, 5 days after the vaccine, I collapsed and had a stroke.  I was rushed to hospital and was admitted.  It was confirmed that I had a stroke. through a Cat Scan and MRI.  On Saturday, I had another stroke.  This time I was transferred  to hospital.  I had a huge blood clot on the left side of my brain which has effected my speech and walking.   My entire life has been effected and changed.  I had  a plethora of tests done, MRI, CAT SCAN,  EKG, BLOOD WORK etc.  I also have to have speech therapy, physical therapy and occupation therapy.    I spent about  weeks in the hospital.  The doctors think it is a possibility that the 2 Moderna vaccine caused my two strokes.  What can be done about this?  I will  have problems for the rest of my life.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, stated she was sneezing and coughing few days before receiving her first dose vaccine. Concomitant medications reported included iron, metolazone, nicardipine, simvastatin, torsemide, levothyroxine, glimepiride, apixaban, potassium chloride, acetyl salicylic acid, and donepezil 5mg.  On 22 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 032L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The route of administration was not provided.  On an unspecified date in Jan 2021 after receiving the first dose vaccine, the patient experienced not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, and didn&#39;t want to get up.  On 25 Jan 2021, the patient was losing her balance and confused. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with renal failure, as well as, severe urinary tract infection that was septic.  On an unknown date post hospitalization, the patient tested positive for Covid-19.  Treatment drug administered included Tylenol, Azithromycin, Promethazine, 325mg aspirin, and Vitamin D.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of events, like not feeling well, urinary incontinence, tiredness, confusion, loss of balance, renal failure, severe urinary tract infection that was septic, and Covid-19 positive test were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded except for the event of COVID-19.  The event of COVID-19 is unlikely related to mRNA-1273 since the vaccine does not contain virus capable of causing infection.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-033912:

                                                Mom became agitated. Would not sleep. Stayed continuously awake for approximately 40 hours.  Could not be redirected. So tired she was swaying on her feet, but could not be convinced to lay down.  After 2 days we were able to get 50 mg Trazadone from our doctor.  After sleeping for 6-8 hours she then did another 24 hours awake. We upped the dose to 100 mg.  By this point the event had started to pass.    During this time we also noticed mom was running a low fever in the morning. 99.5 - 100.5. It would go away in the afternoon.  During this time mom was hallucinating - having conversations with people who were not there.  Mom&#39;s hearing declined during the event as well.   As of 2 days ago mom&#39;s temperature seems to be back to normal in the morning.  This &#34;event&#34; has impacted mom&#39;s mental and physical decline.  She seemingly overnight now needs help showering and toileting, and sometimes dressing.  (This kind of decline is common for dementia.  Each time over the past 5 years that mom has had some physically stressful even such as hurting her foot or getting a bad stomach virus,  she has come out the other side degraded)  The reason I&#39;m reporting this is that the behavior changes were sudden, seemed to peak, and then subside.  There is a correlation with the second moderna shot, and so I though it was important to report.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported. Additional suspected products included Prolia.  On Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  Patient received Prolia injection 2 weeks after 2nd dose of Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccination. Patient side effects reported since Prolia injection are itch all over body, extremely high blood pressure, feels terrible, can&#39;t eat anything but ice chips, and entire body filled with heat during high blood pressure episodes. Patient has been hospitalized twice over the past 2 weeks. Treatment for the events included steroids and amlodipine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcomes of the events were considered not recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The events are probably related to the Prolia injection received by the patient, which is known to cause these side effects.

When I got of bed the following morning I felt so weak, woozy and light headed that I was afraid I would fall.  I slept all day but by that evening I began feeling better and by the following day (day 2 after the shot) I felt normal except that my arm was still sore. It is now day 3 and my arm is still slightly sore but not limiting my use and is steadily getting better.

Then I didn&#39;t worry about till the 01/18/2021 in the evening and it felt warm and it was a big patch of red (looked like a rash) about 3 inches long and 2 inches wide like a oval shape. On Tuesday 01/19/2021 I called my doctor,  spoke with nurse what was going on. Doctor told her to put cold compresses on the site 15 minutes on and then 15 minutes off and take Tylenol as needed. The area is still warm and the redness area is still there.    Did go to local grocery store and spoke with pharmacist who advised her to contact VAERS.

Felt then headache, aching in all joints and muscles with achiness.  Felt it in her heart, short of breath.  The following day felt worse, just wanted to sleep, freezing cold and her temp was low, she could not get warm, and went back to bed and stayed there.  She could not eat much, drank water.  The following day after that felt a little bit better.  She feels about the same she did yesterday, heaviness of her legs especially her knees, weakness and fatigue.  Had a pressure like headache in the top of her head and back of her head, right side of her face.  The 2nd day the pain was up her neck on the right side, it hurt bad.   All her joints are hurting, she does have arthritis.  Also having back pain.  The 2nd day took Tylenol a couple of days, and took 1/2 pill of Hydrocodone, which causes liver/stomach pain.  Not in the pain in the muscles now just a heaviness in her legs and shaky.  Called her doctor who did not have much information and informed to call us.

I could not even turn over in bed without my  whole body hurting. I don?t know if I had a fever or not.  I was so tired, but shaking with chills and body hurting I couldn?t go to sleep.  Put more blankets on and took 2 Tylenol.  I was able to eventually go to sleep.  I felt better in the morning but was very tired during the day.   It felt like I had covid again.  I had the same symptoms then.  I tested positive for covid November 27 at a rehab/nursing home where I was sent  after foot surgery.

Then about the  7th day I started experiencing an itchy arm and a 6 inch circle of intense red at the injection site, with a wide band of white surrounding it, that itched unbelievably, was hot and swollen.  That lasted for several days, then began to subside and now is only slightly red, itches some and is no longer swollen or hot.   My question is:  Is it safe for me to get the 2nd dose, after experiencing this kind of reaction?

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included non specified medication for blood pressure, calming down, dementia and thyroid.   On 04 Jan 2021, approximately 2.5 hours prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 04 Jan 2021, the patient developed acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body that lasted ten days. The patient also experienced neck pain. On an unknown date, she was treated in the emergency room for pneumonia in her left lung and given antibiotics. She later followed up with her primary care doctor and additional x-rays were taken and she was treated with prednisone.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, acute pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body, was considered resolved on 14 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, pain neck was resolved on 19 Jan 2021. The outcome of the event, pneumonia in left lung, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Company Comment: This case concerns a 78-year-old female patient who experienced unexpected serious event of pneumonia and non-serious event of acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body and neck pain.  The event developed on the same day after the first dose and only dose of the vaccine mRNA-1273 vaccine (lot # unknown, expiration date-unknown).

The events of acute serious pain under her ribs, all the way around her upper body and neck pain are also temporarily associated with vaccine administration and a causal association cannot be excluded. Main field defaults to possibly related&#39; for all events.

The red circle is large.  I have a picture to send you.  Fever of 102 the first night, no fever now.  Not sure if it&#39;s infection or from the vaccine itself but today is the 4th  at 4:45 pm and she got the vaccine on the 1st at 1:30 pm.  I have  yet to taken her to the doctors for the increased swelling because I caused the covid vaccine number and a vaccine specialist said this could be normal and to watch it.  I have a picture it looks BIG!

The patient&#39;s medical history included Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included levothyroxine sodium.   On 08 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20-2A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 12 Jan 2021, the reporter states the patient went into a sharp decline, diarrhea, nausea, headache and sleeping 24 hours a day.   A few days later, the patient was not eating much and did not recognize her husband or family.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol, emergency room visits, and nursing care center placement.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, developed diarrhea, nausea, headache, sleeping 24 hours a day, not eating, and didn&#39;t recognize husband or family, were considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 78-year-old, female patient with a medical history of Alzheimer&#39;s disease, who experienced unexpected events of diarrhea, hypersomnia, decreased appetite, confusional state and expected events of nausea and headache. The events of diarrhea, nausea, headache and hypersomnia occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot 025J20-2A) and, the events of decreased appetite and confusional state occurred unspecified number of days later. Treatment for the event included paracetamol, emergency room visits, and nursing care center placement. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Alzheimer&#39;s disease is a confounding factor too. Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Additional information has been requested.

At 10:00 pm I started to get extremely cold and could not get warm. At 10:45 my upper body started shaking very, very bad. I couldn&#39;t control the shaking and my teeth were chattering.  I had to lay down and put my arms under my body to keep them from shaking and I was so cold even though I was wearing warm things and under a comforter.  The shaking lasted an hour and a half. I took my temperature  during the night and it was 102. I am very week this morning, temp. is 99.9.  I was expecting the temperature and pain in the injection site but I can&#39;t find out anywhere on line whether the uncontrollable shaking was normal for the second shot.  .

By 7pm I was dizzy and nauseated, and it got worse, I got chills and shook and shook and shook, I had a fever and the next day I tried to get out of bed, and I fell to the floor and couldn?t stand up, I had no energy or appetite. I had covid in August 2020 and the wasn?t made aware of the possible side effects if you had covid. They didn?t ask if I had covid in the past and the pharmacist told me later that people who has had covid has reported having bad side effects. I had gone a couple weeks ago to see if I had the covid antibodies and I was positive for antibodies and the injection works against the antibiotics. This part of the procedure was overlooked. I have no one else to help me and going through this alone, it would have been better to have been made aware of this ahead of time.

Then was fine for 7 days.  On 2/5/2021, I went to get my B12 shot and asked the doctor to check left arm where Moderna shot was given as it was itching and a bit sore at the same time.  He told me I was having reaction.  By evening, a third of my arm around injected area was swollen an had red rash.  Then same symptoms of fatigue, etc. came back and I was in and out of bed for the next three days....then at end had a bout of diarrhea.

Dizziness was just for 24 hours. January 14th - at 6:00 pm - my temperature 100.9 and it started going down after that. It fluctuated to 99.5 to normal up and down - evening when temperature would come back up. I took 1 acetaminophen (phone call to dr told me to take it) to get temperature down when it was 101 but all the rest of the time I just counted on the aspirin that I take at night to help. Have to call the doctor to get the Lot numbers for the dose. Feb2 - was when I was took second dose and I was recovered from 1st dose.

                                                Admitted to hospital for acute on chronic respiratory failure following covid vaccination.  (patient significantly fatigued, slept most of the day after vaccine, not on BIPAP as needed)  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  patient is a 78 y.o. female with a history of oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and persistent atrial fibrillation who presents today with general malaise.  She received her 2nd COVID-19 vaccination yesterday and complained of fatigue, body aches, and general malaise all day.  Later in the evening she noticed that her blood oxygen level was low.  She denies having any more shortness of breath abnormal.  She has had no vomiting, headache, or chest pain.  On arrival she was noted to be febrile and required 6 L supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula.  She usually uses 2 L nasal cannula at baseline, occasionally increasing it to 3 or 4 with exertion.  She also had elevated troponin levels and noted leukocytosis.  There was radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure.  On exam, she is tired and wants to go to sleep.  She is still requiring 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula.  Her daughter is at bedside.  Plans are discussed for admission and she is agreeable.   ASSESSMENT / PLAN: * Acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Admit to medicine- hypoxic requiring 6 L nasal cannula, utilizes 2 L nasal cannula baseline Hypoxia appears to be secondary to robust immune response to COVID-19 vaccination Increased hypoxia, fever, leukocytosis, elevated troponin, radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure Will repeat troponin level in the morning, daily chemistry and blood count, will treat congestive heart failure as below     CHF (congestive heart failure) (HCC) Assessment &amp; Plan Transesophageal echocardiogram from October 2020 noted preserved left ejection fraction, and had no evidence for diastolic dysfunction Radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure, normal BNP, elevated troponin with an increase of 18 at the 2 hour mark, will recheck in the morning As this is her 2nd hospitalization since that echo with hypoxia and concern for CHF, will obtain repeat echocardiogram Received 80 mg IV Lasix in the emergency department, will continue 40 mg IV Lasix 2 times a day Daily weights, 2 L fluid restriction Patient was admitted with acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure. I think this is due to acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure that was brought on after she was sleeping most of the day without her BiPAP. She says she got her COVID-19 booster shot and felt so tired she slept all day. She did not think she needed her BiPAP during the day even if she was sleeping. She has not had a recent sleep study. Patient is diuresing and will likely be able to discharge tomorrow.

                                                Upper arm became somewhat sore by later afternoon, became excruciatingly painful by later evening. Did not feel well by bedtime, and a bit fuzzy-headed. Next day, I was fuzzy-headed, body stiff and achy, very tired, upper arm excruciatingly  painful. All symptoms began to clear significantly by evening, and back to normal by the following morning (2/10).

I have felt chills and sweats, lethargic, achy, today sore throat.  Below site of shot had large bright pink 3inch circle very hot for first few days.  I&#39;m hoping the temperature stabilizes soon.  It took 8 days to stabilize after first shot.  My second shot&#39;s effects are the same as the first short.  By the way, I suffered through Covid for 3-4 weeks from last midMarch through early April and I do still have antibodies and presume that is why I had the reaction to the first shot but I wasn&#39;t expecting the same for the second.  I had also read in a magazine that people with antibodies didn&#39;t need the 2nd shot, however, my Dr. recommended that I get it. Treatment: I took Tylenol for the fever and aches.  I was finally better after first shot in 8 days.  I am not completely recovered yet from the second but I am confident I will have recovered completely in  a few days.

                                                After the second shot, I expected mild side effects and experienced some: mild headache, sore left arm around injection site, fatigue, brain fog. I was walking to my garage with a small package of papers when suddenly my lower back spasmed sharply. The pain was intense. I thought it would subside so I managed, with difficulty, to make it into my car. When I was seated in the car, the spasms subsided. I considered not driving to my two errands but decided that I felt well enough seated in the car to drive and deliver the papers to my tax preparer  and the carful of donations to Goodwill. At the tax office, I called an assistant to come to the parking lot to pick up the papers, which she did. At Goodwill, one of the attendants emptied my car. When I got home at about 10:50, I had to call my husband to help me into the house. I spent the next several hours in agony (11 on a scale of 1-10) with spasms, punctuated by absolutly not moving. The spasms were so bad I could not breathe. My doc prescribed a muscle relaxer, then the next day prednisone, which has helped. Today I will have an mri to determine if the spasms herniated a disc.

She took 2 Tylenol, and went back and laid down.  She then awoke the next day starting to have some chills but not as bad as the night before.  She covered up with an electric  blanket in a chair and finally passed over.  She noticed  Saturday that she had nausea and dizziness.  She then had  tenderness in her mouth, used warm salty water which seems to be helping.  She cannot eat any hard food on it due to the discomfort.  She has continued nausea in the evenings.  No problems with the arm where she got the vaccine.  She feels it it getting some better, but the dizziness and nausea is the worst issue.  She did call her doctor and they told her that they could not give her anything for the rash in her mouth, and the chills. They told her that it had to run it&#39;s course.

She went to the ER with no treatment. About 5-6 hours after discharged she returned with her leg turning purple and uncontrollable pain. She was diagnosed with venous thromboembolis and transferred to a larger facility where she underwent lytic therapy and venous angioplasty. She is having to go for venous stenting in the next two weeks. She continues to have pain in her leg, chronic fatigue and weakness, as well as being lightheaded with a stable BP (no orthostasis). She has been diagnosed with anemia since vaccination and is being worked up for that.

                                                Day of injection arm a little sore. Next day (Friday) felt perfectly fine and spent the day at home doing usual house cleaning and laundry. Felt fine in the evening and Saturday morning was extremely fatigued, loss of equilibrium, and elevated blood pressure. This condition remained for a few days and on Tuesday my pressure was somewhat down and I saw my doctor. He suggested that since I was doing a little better had NO other symptoms such as fever or chills or muscle aches I would be better in time. It was a rough week feeling so unlike my self but I pushed through. I see the doctor again on Tuesday the 26th. I have never had any reaction to any other vaccine such as flu or shingles vaccine at any time. I am an active woman who exercises and walks to the beach near my home frequently every week. I am anxious about the second dose of the vaccine. I have an appointment on Thursday, February 4th. Hopefully all my strength will have returned by then. I feel like I&#39;m still only 80% back to normal. I have spoken to a young woman who called me back. I would like very much to speak with a medical person who can give me some feedback on my response to the vaccine. That would be reassuring that I am not alone with these side effects. Thank you.

On 05 Jan 2021, the patient woke up real sweaty at 3 am. She got up and went to the bathroom and passed out. The patient reported that she fell on the commode then got to the floor because she felt weak and could not walk. Once she regained her strength, she returned to bed.   On 07 Jan 2021, the patient reported that her arm was still sore at the injection site and continued to feel weak. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The events, passed out, sweaty, and couldn&#39;t walk were considered resolved on 06 Jan 2021. The outcome of the events, felt weak and arm still sore at the left arm injection site, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 80-year-old female patient  with unknown medical history, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Loss of consciousness, the non-serious listed event of Injection site pain, and the non-serious unlisted events of Asthenia, Hyperhidrosis, and Gait disturbance.

                                                Had reaction in November to tetanus vaccine.  Had flu vaccine with no reaction.  Then had this vaccine, no reaction initially, came home, feeling fine but an hour later had flushing in her left ear, just creeping over to her eye and the side of her face.  This lasted for about 15 minutes and left the feeling of something not quite right around her eye.  Nothing compared to her reaction in November from a tetanus booster.  Still has the feeling but not an adverse reaction.  Then at 10:00 PM all of a sudden her face went really hot, and presumed she had a fever, started feeling badly.  Started walking around the house, took Tylenol.  That feeling lasted for about 30 minutes and resolved.  Went to bed and did not feel anything but a funny feeling.  All symptoms have subsided except for a weird feeling around her eye.

Felt pretty much over it by Feb 21 but still some weakness and fatigue.  Also a very sore arm that turned pink and feb 22 is still sore and pink and itchy but not as bad as the previous days.  I have always gotten a sore arm with flu shots but not as bad as this time so I didn&#39;t consider that a bad reaction.

She waited and as she was leaving she fell to the floor and hit her head.  The other patients around her said it looked like she slipped, but when speaking to her it seemed that she had become dizzy and fell.  I spoke with her after she fell, she did not loose conscienceness, but was disoriented.  She did know what day it was, who she was and where she was.  She said her head hurt and she could move all her limbs.  I asked the store director, to call for an ambulance.  I sit with her for a few minutes and talked to her, then asked store director to stay with her until the ambulance arrived.  They arrived and spoke with her and decided to transport her to the hospital.  Later that day, her sister in law came by and said she was doing fine and had been released.  The doctors indicated they thought she because dizzy due to dehydration

Her cheeks were swollen, she felt that maybe her tongue was as well.  She got the liquid Benadryl and let it stay there and it helps that feeling.  She had taken the Zyrtec and Singulair the night before.  She did the inhaler puff in the morning, the feeling did not go away.  She then took the Ventolin and it seemed to calm down.   The symptoms then went away and didn&#39;t come back, and thought that she was ok.   She felt bad for about a week and a half like she wanted to sleep all the time, but did what she had to do.  She is fine now.

                                                My concern is I had no side effects  except a runny nose for 2 days  but then after 7 days, on 19th, I started with severe chills and fever and went to ER for 5 hours; lots of blood work and urine specimens and influenza tests and covid test showed all negative with a few smaller flags like leukocytes and ph in urine greater than 8.9, had urinalysis and negative.  But still today 6 days after being in ER I still have severe chills and fever, last eve was oup to 100.4, most of the time during day hours it is 99.9 to 100 but has gone at night higher.   MY QUESTION IS IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS KIND OF REACTION TO OCCUR 7 DAYS AFTER VACCINE AND THEN LAST ALL OF THIS TIME AND NOT SURE WHEN IT WILL END.  The chills are so bad my teeth chatter, I have to curl up in a ball until the tylenol takes effect.

                                                Really tired on Monday the 22nd and I felt fatigued. I began to get nauseated and then I began to vomit. I vomited 5-6 times even though I had not eaten anything. I also had diarrhea. I had chills. Some point during the night I spiked a fever, I woke up and drenched. Yesterday  the 23rd I  had a fever, my stomach still does not feel settled. I have not ate much since Sunday but have been trying to stay hydrated with lots of water.  I also developed a cough yesterday. Tuesday night my temperature 100.6 and I think it got higher because I woke up once again drenched in sweat. This morning my temperature was 99.  I am achy today with muscle and joint pain,  my stomach feels better but I still leery of  eating. I did eat some Ginger ale and eat some saltine crackers.  I also feel horse.  I called my doctor yesterday and still have not heard back. I will call again today.  It feels like I feel better in the morning but as the day goes on I get worse and start feeling worse. I have been resting a lot in bed.

                                                I had very little reaction to the first fax on Feb. 11 other than a slight fever and extreme fatigue through the 3rd day.  However, on the 9th day after the vax, I got &#34;COVID Arm&#34; which included upper arm swelling, red, itchy and achey at the vax site and another few days of extreme fatigue.  Today (18 days after vax) I am no longer fatigued, felt good when I woke up and I am finally getting some energy back.  The redness, swelling and itching is subsiding but is not gone totally and there is only a slight discomfort in my arm.  Moderna Vaccination #2 is on March 11 and it will be in my other arm.  Only took Aleve twice for pain.

The site expanded on the next day (Friday, the 22nd), and by Sat. it was swollen. Sunday the swelling subsided and the redness expanded around my arm.

It was my only reaction with no fever but a little tiredness. (not adverse event, but just reporting my reaction to vaccine...)

This lasted about 5 minutes and then subsequently resolved.  She then got up to leave and again began feeling the left chest pain, diaphoresis, and again lasting about 5 to 6 minutes and then subsequently resolving.  She does state a history of anxiety but did take Xanax this morning preventatively.  However, she states she has had similar pains in her chest over the past month.  She states these are not necessarily associated with any exertion and seemed to be somewhat better after antacids.  She notes she has not had anything to eat or drink this morning which is not unusual for her and her blood sugar was 117 this morning.

                                                I had the vaccine at 1:00 PM, and that same night I attended the wake of a family member, and I wasn&#39;t feeling well and I was feeling itchy and burning. That night I didn&#39;t sleep at all. So that night I called the doctor and I went to the doctor Friday morning, and was diagnosed with the worst case of Shingles she had ever seen. She prescribed prednisone on a taper, Valtrex (generic) 1 gram tablet 3x daily for one week, and topical ointment (flutisone propionate) .005 strength twice daily, and 500 mg tylenol every six hours.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided/unknown by the reporter.    On 01-FEB-2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 007M20A)  intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 01-MAR-2021, the patient received her 2nd dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Batch number: 023M20A) in her left (dominant) arm.   On 02-MAR-2021, she experienced a side effect which was not listed in the sheet she was given. She wanted to call and report the side effect. She said that she was at the stove cooking and suddenly felt very weak and felt that her vision started to flip. She called for her husband to come over who seated her on a chair. After that she says she doesn&#39;t remember what happened, but her husband told her that her whole body was shaking, her head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds. When she came back, she could hear a rushing sound coming out of her left ear. She was also drenched in perspiration. She felt very nauseated and cold the whole afternoon.  On 03-MAR-2021 she felt better. She had a low grade fever of 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment for the event included paracetamol.   The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events, suddenly felt weak (asthenia), vision started to flip (visual impairment), whole body started shaking (tremor), rushing noise in left ear, drenched in perspiration, nauseated (nausea), cold (chills), low grade fever (pyrexia) was considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.   The out come of the event, head fell forward and she was out for 20-30 seconds (loss of consciousness), was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided by the reporter. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 61016308) in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Mar 2021, the patient experienced pneumonia with collapsed lung and was hospitalized.  She was scheduled to take second dose of vaccine on 26 Mar 2021.  Treatment for the event included hospitalization for pneumonia with collapsed lung.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the event, pneumonia with collapsed lung was unknown.  The outcome of the event, inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered was considered to be resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 80-year-old who had second dose scheduled 6 weeks after first dose (inappropriate schedule of product administration) and also experienced collapsed lung/pneumonia. Although a temporal association exist, based on the information provided, the event of collapsed lung/pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related.  Pneumonia is due to an infective etiology.  The event of inappropriate schedule of product administration is assessed as not applicable.

She was an older women in a wheel chair and the temperature in the stadium was extremely cold and most of the people were shivering even if they had no other problems. The patient  complained of headache after 12-15 minutes. She was alert and oriented X3 in NAD. Vital signs: BP-118/82 HR-86 O2 Sat-98%. She did not have any visual problems, nausea, vomiting ,chest pain ,stridor,  SOB , or rash. I listened to her with the stethoscope.  Her lungs were clear . No rales or wheezing and heart rate was normal.  She was watched for almost 40-45 minutes .She had headache but it improved somewhat. I informed her to drink enough fluids, take pain killer either Tylenol or Advil whatever her MD recommends- to take when she has pain. I also informed her daughter to keep a close watch on her for 2 days  and if any problems call her MD and  take her to ER. I watched her very closely in the post vaccination area before she left.

                                                I got shot on Friday and the next morning at 2 am i got a really bad head ache that last about half hr. It started getting better after i took a 650 mg Tylenol. Worse when i lay down.  Saturday it happened again at 2:30 am it was not a bad pain more like an ache to a pain but nothing like the 1st night. Sunday i had no pain.  Then Monday at 3 Am it was a really bad pain again. Today i was sleeping and at 7:30 Am I woke up with headache that was very uncomfortable. Got out of bed and took my Tylenol about 30 mins later the pain went away.  Today it went away much quicker then the 1st couple of nights.

Went home and took Benadryl (50 mg) 2 tablets at 9:30 am,1:30 pm and 5:15 pm, mistakenly believing they were 25mg tabs because of packaging change and miniscule text on bottle and difficult to find directions.

I thought I should report this because my husband who had the same injection had no symptoms at all...not even redness at the site.

                                                I had my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Feb. 10, 2021. I had about three days of chills, aches, headache, very sore arm. etc. On Feb. 22,2021 a red area  about 3 or 4 inches around the site of the injection was noticed. It was itchy and uncomfortable. I spoke to my internist and allergist. There is some disagreement about whether I should take the second dose.  I have taken benadryl and tylenol. Both doctors said it was unusual for such a reaction 2 days after receiving the vaccine. What information do you have about rashes occurring so long after the vaccination? What is the recommendation about the second vaccine? Thank you.

Dr there glanced at my arm and said it was an infection  and gave me antibiotic, Cephalexin 500mg, 10 days.  Feel really bad but maybe better today and that  is after tramadol and tylenol. Headaches. Tylenol helps.. now afraid to take 2nd shot.

                                                Called at 8 am this morning to inform me of a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She received the vaccine on Tuesday, 1/19/21. The next day she noted the back of her tongue on the R side was swollen. On Thurs, 1/21/21, she reports she woke up with the back of her tongue swollen on both sides such that she had some trouble speaking and needed to be very careful with chewing so she would not bite her tongue. She stated she also had drippy sinuses and an earache which then woke her up several times during the night last night. Today she reports the tongue swelling is only to the back R side of her tongue. She continues to have ear pain. She states she had not reported the symptoms to anyone before her call because she had not felt the symptoms were life-threatening. I asked her if she had taken any benedryl, and she stated the only medication she had taken was her analgesic herbal supplement. She states she has never had a vaccination reaction in the past. I advised her to call her PCP and be seen, which she was able to do. After she was seen, she called and stated while the clinician was looking at her tongue, it started to have shooting pains when she moved it to the right. The clinician stated her tongue and throat were not visibly swollen, noted no swollen lymph nodes, and noted no ear abnormalities.

                                                I video chatted with her Thursday after receiving the vaccine. My mom was in poor health but she was talking in complete sentences and responded appropriately. She was upright in bed and made eye contact. She smiled and denied pain. By Sunday, she was extremely weak and unable to sip water with a straw. Her health had changed dramatically and rapidly. She moaned in pain and was very fatigued. Her condition continued to deteriorate over the week and she stopped talking and was constantly sleeping. They started antibiotics for the oozing cancer lesion and then morphine for pain and end of life care. She passed away on January 22nd which was 15 days post vaccination.

                                                Patient reported feeling weak, fatigue, fever (102), and loss of appetite. Patient subsequently went to the ER 2/6/2021 and tested positive for COVID-19 on 2/7/21 (collection date).   See following discharge summary from ED:  82 y.o. female who initially presented to the ED with complaint of generalized weakness, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite x at least 4 days since receiving Covid 19 vaccine. Her workup in the emergency room was significant for hypoxia with 02 saturation 88% on 2LPM (home nocturnal 02 requirement) with improvement to mid-90s on 4LPM. Blood sugar was 47, Cr 1.61. CXR showed extensive R lung and moderate left lung opacities. She was started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin and admitted to the hospitalist service for further workup and mgmt.   During her stay in the hospital, pt did test positive for Covid 19. She developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure, felt to be secondary to ARDS. There was also question of contributing pulmonary edema, however this was refractory to lasix and thus ARDS was felt to be the most significant factor. She had requested DNR/DNI status, thus as her 02 requirement escalated she was transitioned to 15LPM NRB and then to BiPAP support. Unfortunately, she continued to suffer greatly with the BiPAP in place, and therefore made the decision to transition herself to comfort measures only after visitation from her family.   Her other medical issues were supported as appropriate during her stay, with dextrose infusion for hypoglycemia and AKI, also hyponatremia felt to be due to IVVF.   Unfortunately, am unable to find any documentation regarding how pt was feeling when she received the vaccine compared to her baseline state of health. thus am unable to say whether the severity of her illness represents vaccine­ enhanced disease or the much more common cytokine release syndrome leading to ARDS. Regardless, she developed ARDS as result of her Covid 19 illness.    Time of death: 1408 on 2/9/21. Cause of death: ARDS due to Covid 19 pneumonia.

Headache continued for  four days and fever would come and go but usually at night. I did not receive treatment but I did let my cardiologist office know what was going on. When I continued with the headache, I contacted the internist?s office and I only had a TelMed visit with them. My nostrils had something like cold sores but then I started sneezing and realize there was infection also. Had a second TelMed visit with the PA who started me on an anabiotic Amoxicillian. The infection is clearing up in my sinuses but I am coughing a lot. Overall continue to feel very tired and weary

                                                She got the vaccine and did not get an immediate reaction, and on Thursday morning she was tired and couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  So her husband kept her in bed all day and by Friday morning things didn&#39;t get any better, and he helped her to get to the end of the bed and went into the kitchen to get breakfast and he heard her fall, and she fell off the bed and was semi-consciousness, and was able to get her back into the bed and called the ambulance.   She was taken to the hospital Friday morning and she&#39;s still in there.  She has been diagnosed with hydronephrosis, and they keep going back and forth on her diagnoses.  At first they said that she had a UTI, and then they said she didn&#39;t, and then said that she did.  The son feels that all three of the doctors feel that it was some sort of reaction to the vaccine.  They did give her steroids at one time, and she developed severe tremors when she moved which have subsided.  She also has had fever, in a weakened state due to this condition.  She is still being treated for this still and said that she will be having to go to rehabilitation before going home.

                                                The injection did sting, but didn&#39;t think anything about it. For the first 30 minutes I did seem to be fine, so I was released, but my shoulder was not looked at. It was itching some. About an hour later I started getting a headache, some nasal congestion and a sore throat. I took a couple of Tylenol  and went to bed early. Day 2 I felt sluggish and achy and my stomach was bothering me some. Day three my chilling was worse, but after Tylenol I began feeling better around 6:00 pm. The rest of the week I felt sleepy and achy. My shoulder was feeling sore. I am the type of person that tries to push through  when I feel bad because I live a very busy life. On day 5 I finally looked at my left. It had a large red area beginning at the injection site. I got a tape measure and found it was 10 inches long and 3 inches wide. Today is day 6. I have finally admitted I feel bad and will rest a few days. I am wondering if I should skip taking the 2nd vaccination? . I am also taking some 60mgjAllegra on ce a day.

Trouble sleeping,   2nd day after shot, still  lower back pain, feel bloated, no desire to eat.  Very little side pain.   Had slight headache   This third night after shot I could finally  sleep.  This fourth day I felt back to normal.  During all this time, the arm that had the shot never really bothered me

When asked what her sx were, she stated fatigue.  She was well the night of the shot, Thur. and Fri. but became tired on Sat. and Sun.  I went through other sx with her such as h/a, fever, n/v, muscle aches, weakness and she said she experienced none of those.  I questioned her about eating and drinking and she said she ate and drank water.  She seemed fine so I told her to call her doctor if she was worse or the fatigue persisted or call 911.  She agreed.  Two staff from clinic called her Mon. and Tues, (1/18 and 1/19).  On Tues. she may have had sl slurred speech.  She was found deceased on

Could hear her heart pounding and racing really fast.  Laid down and after 45 minutes to an hour was still racing, so laid back down and when got up the 2nd time her heart was still beating fast but not as bad as when it first happened.  Gradually the symptoms subsided.  Not having problems now.  Did not feel very good Saturday or Sunday, but today is feeling fine.  The first day was the worst.

Temples hurt, lymph glands were swollen, sore throat. Mostly in upper part of anatomy above collar bone. It made me very weak, I had trouble getting out of rocking chair to answer phone. So I took another Tylenol. I usually only take 1-2 Tylenol a day and that was my second one by the middle of the day. I had to lay down and I live alone so I was nervous and had phone beside me and debated calling 911 which I have never done. I dozed and when I woke up about a couple of hours later it was much better. Still had headache and a little stuffiness but anybody can handle that. Also, I was very nauseated and couldn&#39;t eat but I did drink water.

She had water and cold compress. I sat with her and her caretaker for another 15 minutes or so.  The caretaker left to bring car around and we used wheelchair to help her to car.  She never did pass out, and was feeling a little better.  The caretaker was going to stay with her to keep a watch over her.  Patient called a couple of hours later to let us know she was doing ok and had been lying down.  She wasn&#39;t having the chest tightness anymore and her head felt better, but she had developed a rash across the chest.

                                                Five days ago, patient received her 2nd COVID vaccination.  Following that she had myalgias and some sedation/confusion.  She apparently stumbled and struck her head.  She did not lose consciousness.  She did recover from her symptoms by the next day.  She has some soreness on her scalp in the scratch but no significant hematoma.  However, she then developed some swelling and redness beneath her eyes.  She is here to evaluate that.  She she is back to her normal self.  Comments: Patient has ecchymosis in swelling beneath both eyes and the bridge of her nose.  It is nontender.  Scalp-minor area of tenderness in the right vertex.  There is a slight abrasion on the skin.  No signs of hematoma.   Assessment / Plan: 1. Contusion of scalp, initial encounter   Contusion right scalp-I suspect patient&#39;s lungs are delicate skin informed a small hematoma.  The swelling and bruising and 5th settle down into her eye sockets.  I reassured patient that this will resolve the next 1-2 weeks.  I believe patient had some severe myalgias and fatigue after a COVID shot.  I do not think this is a longstanding problem.  Expect her to get back to her normal self.  Patient did have COVID-19 approximately 3 and half months ago.  I told her that people have more significant reaction to the COVID vaccine after having had the illness.  At this point, I do not agree need further workup.

Once recovered from pneumonia and fever gone, on January 10, 2021,  she was transferred to Rehabilitation Center for continued treatment.  She spent 16 days there.  She developed UTI and CDIF infections and was on/off oxygen.  She started physical therapy.  She was scheduled to  be released to go home on January 27, 2021.  On January 26, 2021, the day before going home, Rehabilitation Center gave her the Moderna vaccine.  On January 27, the day she went home, she started feeling very weak and couldn&#39;t walk. My dad tried lifting her and they both fell to the ground. My dad called 911 and she was taken to Medical Center, with high fever and possible stroke symptoms (which later was negative).  Two days later,  she had difficulty breathing and was put on a ventilator. She was on a ventilator for about three days. They took it off and she slowly started recovering. The doctors did all kinds of tests (blood clot in lung, heart, etc.) and all was negative.  The only thing they could trace it to was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. After spending  11 days at hospital and treating her for various infections, her heart stopped and she passed away suddenly.

Went to bed at 4:00 PM and stayed asleep until 11:00 AM the next morning.  Her arm swelled very high, there was a bruise at the site of the injection and itching all around it with a rash.  Arm is still swollen and tender to touch, but the rash is not bothering her to the point of scratching.  She did take Tylenol for the fever several times.

The following day she woke up with a headache, some nausea but nothing came up.  She also had diarrhea and her arm was sore.  She felt weak, and since she had COVID she has had shortness of breath.   She stayed in the bed all day unless she had to as her arm felt like it was made of metal and was extremely tired.  She was moving around upstairs and somewhere around 8:00 PM she went to the bathroom, was sweating profusely and wiping herself with tissue, and apparently turned out the light and apparently passed out as she woke up on the floor in the hallway and could not get up right away.   She could not use the left arm, was able to get herself up with the help of the door to stand on her feet.  She walked into her room and sat on the bed, and did not lay back down and greatful that she did not fall down the steps.  She went back to bed, but in the morning she was terrified and her family heard her talking to the doctor on call who told her to go to the ER.  In the ER they told her that she had syncope, seen by Dr. at Health Care.  She was admitted at 11:11 AM on 2/27/21.  She was given IV, had a CAT scan of her head, told her that it did not reveal any blood.  After several hours they discharged her.  She called her doctor and she has an appointment tomorrow morning.   She is feeling tired, not sleeping well.

After getting up from bed and eating her usual breakfast, she was returning to her bedroom when she became dizzy and fainted, falling to the floor, hitting her head and suffering other effects, including rhabdomyolysis from being on the floor for a long time after the fall as she was unable to get up. She was transported to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 3 days. She was treated with IV fluids, Tylenol and a short course of antibiotics. While hospitalized, she had a repeat of a rash/swelling at injection site that began about 48 hours after vaccination.  The hospital treated the rash with some barrier cream and within 48, the redness, rash and swelling abated.

I very suddenly became light-headed and felt like I could pass out .  I sat down on a chest and put my head down on the foot of the bed and hoped it would pass.  About a minute later I became very nauseated and thought I would vomit.  I  waited about 15 min and did not do so.   I went back to bed and stayed quiet for the rest of the night.  The 24th I was extremely tired and slept most of the day.  When I did get up briefly I ached all over.  This gradually ceased by the next day.   These symptoms did not return. I am very active and know no other reasons for the reaction.

By January 13, 2021, extreme fatigue set in; lack of appetite; and extreme feelings of hopelessness, depression, etc.  On January 14, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital ER and she received a positive COVID diagnosis.  She was released to return home with instructions to use a pulse  oximeter; move about  every 2 hours and not sleep throughout the day; and to do breathing exercises. All were done. Symptoms did not abate. On January 17, 2021, I took my Aunt to Hospital to receive an infusion of antibodies.  Unfortunately,  her pulse ox readings dropped into the 80 percentile and she was admitted for care.  Although she  experienced pneumonia, she improved her pulse ox  and was released on January 22, 2021 to (rehabilitation center) for outpatient care.

                                                Within a few days, my mother started reporting profound fatigue and shortness of breath while conducting routine household activities. She no longer had to energy for her daily exercise walks and became increasingly lethargic. She died in her sleep while taking an afternoon nap on Thursday, February 4th. I am highly concerned this could be a vaccine related.

I talked with the husband briefly about why his wife was hospitalized. He reported she got sick 2 days after getting her first COVID-19 vaccine. He states she had pneumonia, had a urinary tract infection and had to have a heart catherization with stent placement. We moved her second vaccine appointment to February 17th. The spouse came in on February 8th for his 2nd dose. He told me the doctors did not believe his wife&#39;s hospitalization was related to the first COVID vaccine and he said the doctor&#39;s told him that she needed her 2nd dose.

I have a history of tremors, but since the vaccine, there has been a marked increase in the tremors. I did not report this right away because I thought it would go away, but now on the eve of my second shot I am very nervous that it will get even worst.  My physician encourages me to continue and get through the side effects than to get COVID with my underlying lung condition. I want to take the vaccine but am nervous that I am experience so much shakiness even a month after the first shot. Would you advise me to take the second shot? My shot is scheduled for tomorrow, February 17.

                                                Patient presented to the ED 2/15/2021 for shortness of breath and lightheadedness with near syncopal event. The pt reported 2 episodes of SOB and lightheadedness, with the second one as the more severe. On her second episode, she felt severe shortness of breath, tried to walk quickly to her bed with her walker, and fell into her bed. CT angio demonstrated acute saddle PE, mild right heart strain, RUL pulmonary infarct, and mild multifocal pneumonia with suspicion of COVID; IR was consulted and suggested thrombectomy due to the severity of the embolism. In the ED, she was started on heparin drip and put on low-flow NC oxygen without distress. Upon arrival to the emergency department her vital signs were significant for T 36.4, SBP 120/81, HR 95 bpm, NSR, RR 18, FiO2 94% on room air.  Her oxygen increased to 98% on 2 L nasal cannula.  Her laboratory values revealed WBCs 15.1, Hb 14.4, HCT 43.4, PLT 321, neutrophils 68.8%, D-dimer 4642, NA 134, K3.4, anion gap 9, BUN 17, creatinine 1.00, glucose 163, troponin elevated 0.12, 0.25, and 0.41, urinalysis is unremarkable, COVID-19 swab is positive. A thrombectomy was performed 2/16/2021.  She tested COVID positive on 2/16/2021 and her SpO2 remains in the high 90s with dips to mid 80s while talking, but she does not currently experience any SOB.

It was almost as if she had dementia - she repeatedly called myself and my daughter claiming that her phone didn&#39;t work and she needed help. She was trying to tell me a phone number but kept giving me random words instead.  She doesn&#39;t remember talking to any one of us who spoke to her Saturday and Sunday. She was repeatedly asking what a specific button did on her TV remote, and would then ask again a few minutes later the exact same question. This went on for 2 days.

I then used the toilet and started walking back to bed (less than 20 feet away). About halfway there, I I realized something was wrong. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground right next to my bed. On the way down I think I heard crashing into wood furniture. I don?t know how long I was blacked out; it might have been 10 minutes. I managed to get up onto the bed and felt something wet on my pillow case. It was blood coming from a deep laceration on my chin. My doctor told me to go to urgent care. They sent me to the emergency room. I was kept overnight for observation and give three stitches in my chin. I have felt woozy ever since, but all the tests administered in the hospital showed no damage.

She had a hard time sitting up, trying to lift her arms, had a hard time articulating how she felt and what was wrong, her speech seemed a little slurred, and she felt nauseated. Her daughter denied facial droop and localizing weakness. She continued to be &#34;out of it&#34; and weak until her daughter put her in bed about 7 hours later. She slept well and got up twice during the night to use the bathroom and seemed ok. She is feeling better today. Pt reports she kept hearing the telephone ringing all night and thought she heard someone yelling about the phone.

Given history of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday and concerned about an inflammatory response to the vaccine especially given she had COVID-19 infection back in October.  Other residents at the nursing home are demonstrating similar symptoms after receiving the vaccine.  IV was placed and labs were drawn and sent.  The patient was given normal saline bolus as well as a dose of acetaminophen.  Lab work is reassuring for a CBC without leukocytosis, stable anemia which is chronic for the patient, no thrombocytopenia.  Electrolytes are only significant for borderline low sodium.  Kidney function normal, BUN normal

                                                Huge red mark on right arm below the vaccination. Began small the next day, has been getting worse every day since.  Now, a WEEK later it is even larger, painful and have even begun to get better. (I have pics from Monday and again today.) She had a fever that did go away the next day. She totally lost her appetite for 5 days and would barely drink anything at all.

About 5:00 PM her mouth started watering and she got the drive heaves, and then about 15 minutes and then started having them bad.  She laid down and after 15 minutes she could not breath, couldn&#39;t get any air.  When she was able to get some air, her throat was sore and she was really hoarse.  Later in the evening she laid down again and the breathing difficulty happened again and it was worse.  She was scared to the point that she was afraid to lie down.   She is fatigued.  She finally fell asleep during the night and didn&#39;t sleep much and today is very tired.  She called her doctor this morning, and talked to the nurse.   They told her if it got worse to go to the ER.  Told her to call the CDC.

                                                Friday I started having diarrhea, Friday night I was throwing up many times. It wasn&#39;t like I was sick from the the wrong type of food, it was all water. I had a fever and a headache. This lasted all day and night Saturday. I found some  Phenergan from 2009 and I took and it helped. I do not have much of appetite and still feel really tired as of today. I did call and speak to the nurse at my doctor&#39;s office.

She is still having periods of weakness at this time.

She reports that approximately 1.5hrs after receiving her COVID vaccine, she began having pain in the top of her head, neck, between her shoulder blades, down both arms to her fingertips, and down her spine.  Reports also began having swelling in her feet. Reports having nausea and pain in her chest with walking. She reports she already had trouble with ambulation prior to vaccine, but it has been worse since receiving the vaccine. She reports as of 3/3/21, the pain is still occurring and not getting better.  She has not seen her primary doctor since being vaccinated. I encouraged her to speak with her doctor or schedule a visit with them as her pain is not improving.

Temperatures for 3 days was less than normal.  95.6 to 96.1.  FridayI I started vomiting and had incidents of a pain in my stomach area and by that night became sicker and dehydrated.  Was so sick I couldn&#39;t get out of bed to get water (I live alone).  By midnight Friday (12:00) Feb. 13 I was so sick I called daughter to take me to hospital.  Went to ER and then did blood work.  Blood work showed  liver enzymes were over 500 and eventually reached over 600, when normal is under 100.  Was admitted to hospital.  My electrolytes were out of &#34;whack&#34; too.  My doctor told me in 11 years practice she had never seen a liver enzymes reading over 600.  I am scared to take another vaccine shot at this point.  Note:  I had blood work done Friday, March 5, 2021 and my liver enzymes was 26 -- normal but I am not interested in getting that sick again and I have concerns about my liver.

                                                Though patient was experiencing pain due to her arthritis, soon after the vaccination (1-2 hours) she experienced increased knee pain in both legs. Since the vaccination, she has also had bad diarrhea. Lastly, the worst symptom she experienced was light headedness and fatigue. At around 8:30pm on the day of the vaccination, she got up from dinner to go to bed a bit early. She was feeling tired and started to fade. She fell backwards against the wall, hit her head and landed on her bottom. Thankfully, I was there to help her up and was able to stay up with her to ensure she didn&#39;t have a concussion. Admittedly, she did not drink much water that day so it&#39;s possible this exacerbated the side effects of the vaccine. Maybe the clinics can offer people water bottles or other hydrating beverages to ensure things like this don&#39;t happen?

After an undetermined period of time (likely less than 5 minutes), she was able to call me (her daughter).  She could hardly move her mouth but she was able to tell me that she needed help. I arrived about 20 minutes later.  She had full movement at that time and was able to speak.  Her BP was 140/73, HR 60. She was tired but scared to go to sleep around 5pm so we went to the local ER.  Her labs, EKG, and MRI were all normal for her age. Today (1/15/21) at 10:30am, she experience the same thing but only in her face.  She was able to move her arms but not able to talk.  I was with her and could tell that she was fully conscious and aware, just couldn&#39;t move.  It happened again but not as severely after she ate lunch around 12pm.

The first few days took Tylenol and did not take anymore as her daughter said it contained aspirin for the pain.  Still having the headache, feeling like she is not thinking real good.  About a month ago had blood work and everything was perfect, no problems.  Due to the fact that she is still having these reactions 2 weeks from the injections wanted to report it.

On Saturday, January 23rd, she was exhausted and unable to get up. We learned this from a friend of hers who had called us back after both my brother and I were unable to reach her by phone.  This was about 3:15 pm and we drove to her apartment and found her semi conscious in her bed. We awoke her but she was unable to talk or get up. We then called 911 and emergency paramedics came and took her to hospital.

Please see PA&#39;s note for details.  All relevant procedures supervised. Patient arrived to the emergency department due to respiratory symptoms, hypoxic, reported that Wednesday he received his 2nd dose of COVID vaccine.  His initial workup was concern for NSTEMI with elevated troponin and peaked T-waves,  his chest x-ray concerning for COVID/pneumonia.  Patient initially tolerated oxygen by nasal cannula and sepsis protocol was started including IV fluid resuscitation that was done cautiously due to the concern of COVID with respiratory failure.  The biotics were given.  PA-C readdressed code status with patient who confirmed that his DNR DNI, she so contacted his daughter.   Patient had multiorgan failure including acute kidney injury, and pneumonia with respiratory failure &#43;/- respiratory failure.  Due to the concern of NSTEMI patient was initially going to be transfer to was hospital and transfer was started.  Patient respiratory status started deteriorating and his blood pressure dropped slightly but improved after 500 cubic centimeters of IV fluid and he was also placed on a NIPPV. Around 6:00 p.m. patient has significantly desaturation and he discontinued himself NIPPV.   Due to inability to intubate patient, he was ventilated with BVM, patient is slowly improved saturation levels and was opening his eyes, he was placed on a non-rebreather.  At this point there is high concern of ARDS and due to inability to intubate or give for the respiratory support His daughter was at bedside and updated of current medical status and poor prognosis.  Patient continued deteriorating and at this point he had agonal breathing.   His daughter was at bedside and she was made aware of the futile prognosis of patient due to his respiratory failure.   Patient rapidly became bradycardic and went into cardiac arrest.   No CPR was done due to the DNI DNR status of the patient.    Critical Care Procedure Note Authorized and Performed by: MD  Total critical care time: Approximately 30 minutes Due to a high probability of clinically significant, life threatening deterioration, the patient required my highest level of preparedness to intervene emergently and I personally spent this critical care time directly and personally managing the patient. This critical care time included obtaining a history; examining the patient; pulse oximetry; ordering and review of studies; arranging urgent treatment with development of a management plan; evaluation of patient&#39;s response to treatment; frequent reassessment; and, discussions with other providers. This critical care time was performed to assess and manage the high probability of imminent, life-threatening deterioration that could result in multi-organ failure. It was exclusive of separately billable procedures and treating other patients and teaching time.
