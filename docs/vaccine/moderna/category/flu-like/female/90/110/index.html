The patient has prior history of irregular heart beat . Her relevant concomitant medications were cholesterol medication, Crestor and medication for irregular heartbeat. No information on allergies.   On 28-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received her first of two planned doses of COVID-19 vaccine intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30-JAN-2021, 2 days after her vaccination, she developed arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, some visual problems (light bothered her for some days) and mild chills. After one week she felt like no more symptoms ongoing and felt good again. She visited her physician for arrhythmias, and he said, she should keep an eye on it, but no medication yet. She is concerned about her second shot.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.  The outcome of the events, arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, visual problems and chills were resolved at the time of report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of irregular heart beat are considered risk factors for arrhythmias.

On 8:10am Sunday, heart beat ranged from 50 to 125 bpm, blood pressure dropped to 90/64. Doctor took me off all meds except Xarelto, said stay in bed, drink lots of fluids. I did not connect the symtoms to the vaccine at the time because problems happened after the 1st few hours, and I was too sick to think clearly. It was only when I read the side effects after 1-3 days, that I realized it could be from the vaccine. I worry about being deathly sick after the second vaccine shot, so I&#39;m reporting this.

Front in the ribs and around the breast - chest pains.  Exhausted - energy is gone. Can&#39;t do normal activities that she was able to do prior to vaccine.  Sharp pains. When I breath or cough/sneeze or laugh it hurts. Had some relief from heat and cold packs.  Left knee has hurt a lot since this happened, too.

                                                The patient came to the Emergency Room at approx 3:30 am on 02/03/2021 with pain in right arm (same arm the COVID vaccine had been administered in approx 12 hours earlier) and feeling generally unwell. Patient was concerned about possibility of gout flare or that something was wrong with her arm. Elevated blood pressure was noted; this was attributed to anxiety. She was evaluated, given 500 mg Tylenol, and discharged since the pain was decreasing and blood pressure was stabilized. Patient instructed to follow-up with physician.  The next day,  on 02/04/2021, the patient arrived at the Emergency Room by ambulance; cardiac arrest was the chief complaint. The patient&#39;s daughter stated the patient had been &#34;feeling generally poor and then suddenly collapsed.&#34; Daughter described &#34;gurgling respirations&#34; and being unresponsive. 911 was called, police arrived within 5 minutes and initiated CPR. Epinephrine, atropine, lidocaine and bicarb administered after arrival to Emergency Room.  Shockable rhythm never demonstrated. Patient never recovered spontaneous respiration or movement.   The death was called at 23:04. Coronary artery disease with cardiac arrest is the cause from the ER records; the coroner is putting COVID-19 vaccination in Part 1 of the death certificate.

                                                after first dose of the Moderna vaccine she became very ill and was hospitalized on 3/13 - 3/23.  After 2nd dose of the vaccine she seemed to be doing ok but gradually declining and less and less to be able to do for herself, it slowed down greatly after the vaccine. There was a gradual decline, but on May 2 she woke up and was semi conscious and said she thought she was dyeing and was in pain and discomfort and was taken into the ER and she was DC&#39;d and started hospice and two days before she passed she got the hospice care. My mother was in a semi coma and could not communicate properly.  Many test were done at the hospital during her stay even though they never identified what the cause was. At the last ER visit they diagnosed her with pneumonia

She felt a little funny, and possibly a week later she started getting reaction in her body, burning sensation in her chest, possibly thought related to acid reflux.  She then had sensation down her leg nerve pains.  Sometimes she also gets some hot flashes but they go away.  She woke up early in the morning yesterday and had a pressure like sensation in her head, she still has that today.  She still has burning sensation in her chest, and her legs and ankles are hurting still.   She has taken some Tylenol for the aches and pains.   Also has itchiness of her arm from the vaccine, as well as soreness.

                                                Does not have lot number. About an hour after getting the vaccine started with fast heart beat, felt like my heart was like &#34;boom boom boom&#34; and was really loud, sweating, weakness, runny nose.  Symptoms since then  have been on and off and steady for 5 hours today. Today it feels like my heart is in down in my lungs.

                                                Mom has mild cognitive impairment.  She is well above average for a 93 year old. I live with her and she is highly functioning.    The day of her vaccine, she seemed very tired. The next day, she was exhausted. She had a hard time doing her normal activities. No fever. It was much more challenging for her to walk. She just couldn&#39;t get moving. It seemed to stay the same. I noticed she was having a harder time doing everything. Suddenly, her comprehension seemed to change. Within a week, she went from mild cognitive deficits to full blown cognitive impairment: not knowing how to take her pills, how to wash hands, how to use her watch/fitness tracker, to not removing her bottle cap to drink water, to having a hard time communicating. I called the Pharmacist where she had the vaccine, and they told me that this was not uncommon after the vaccine. They had been getting lots of similar calls. They haven&#39;t given out any second shots yet, and were not looking forward to it after everything they&#39;ve been hearing.  This is very frightening.!!!! Our Mom cannot be left alone now.  How long will this last????!!!!

On 03/12/2021 when health dept nurse learned of the error, the patient was called to assess for any problems and to determine if the doses were given too early.  RN  said the patient was hard to understand and a poor historian.  Pt could not give names of caregivers.  RN  had EMS go by to provide a welfare check. EMS reported pt was at baseline health status.  EMS staff spoke with nephew who reported pt has only had one vaccine.  On 03/15/2021, RN  received calls from step daughter-in-law and Nephew, both advising pt did get both vaccines. Per family, the patient?s vaccine appointments were not communicated well between the family caregivers.  One caretaker thought the 2/24/2021 trip to health dept was just to register and the second trip on 03/05/2021 was when the actual vaccine was to be given.  Registration forms were completed at each visit, with both showing no previous vaccine administered.  Pt and family report no side effects after the 1st vaccine, the nephew did report noticing that the patient was lethargic and weak 3 d after the 2nd vaccine. Family was advised the patient does not need another dose of COVID vaccine at this time, 2 dose series complete.

                                                Hallucinating; Occasional rapid heart beat; Hadache; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning reporter&#39;s mother a 97-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced hallucinating/ hallucination, occasional rapid heartbeat/ heart rate irregular and headache.   The patient&#39;s current conditions included chronic urinary tract infection. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included antibiotics for chronic urinary tract infection.   On 26-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their unspecified dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) via an unknown route and site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 27-Feb-2021 the patient had headache for 2 days, was hallucinating and had occasional rapid heartbeat.  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The Outcome of the events, hallucinating,  occasional Rapid Heartbeat, and headache was unknown.  Company Comment: The reported events, hallucinations, heart rate irregular, and headache,  were considered possibly related to mRNA-1273.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the reported event and excluding any other etiology, a causal relationship with the event cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the vaccine profile

Nearly everyone in the retirement home was extremely ill after the second dose; most of the administrative staff went home sick; skeleton crew pulled double shifts caring for residents with extreme &#34;blow-out&#34; diarrhea and debilitating nausea. One patient reported temporary paralysis. Men complained of sore arms but women couldn&#39;t get out of bed. We were prepared with prophylactic anti-emetic meds and avoided diarrhea. However, patient had headaches and nausea for a week; refusal to eat/drink put patient at risk for dehydration and kidney issues; fasting  exacerbated confusion and put patient at risk of harm (wandering, falling, etc.) Patient is still lethargic and confused, has started eating again but only minimally, a few bites. Strongly regret vaccinating.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history was provided by the reporter.     On 28-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form.  On 28-Feb-2021, the patient experienced FATIGUE (&#34;getting very tired&#34;/more progressively tired&#34;/&#34;not wanting to do anything.&#34;) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 16-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (just wants to sleep all the time). On an unknown date, the patient experienced COVID-19 (Possible Covid Spots) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, COVID-19 (Possible Covid Spots), FATIGUE (&#34;getting very tired&#34;/more progressively tired&#34;/&#34;not wanting to do anything.&#34;) and SOMNOLENCE (just wants to sleep all the time) outcome was unknown.        mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient was hospitalized and prescribed antibiotics. Multiple test were done including head CT and chest x-rays done that showed &#34;possible COVID spots.&#34;  Patient was discharged to hospice.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, based on the natural history of COVID-19, and the established information about the mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association between the fatal event of Covid-19 and the product use is assessed as unlikely. Fatigue and somnolence are also assess as symptoms of Covid-19.  However, based on temporality, causality with the product use cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient became lethargic, extremely tired, unable to care well for self.  Patient had no appetite, refused most food and spent many hours simply sitting in her chair.  She felt that she was having a heart attack and called 911 using her emergency response button on 2/21/2021.  Doctors indicated that the patient&#39;s life was in serious danger, but because of age they were hesitant to try to remove the clot pressing on her heart.  She was only allowed to go back home because we utilized Hospice.  When asked about her life expectancy, we were told she could die any minute or might live a few more months, but that she was not expected to live much longer.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION!
