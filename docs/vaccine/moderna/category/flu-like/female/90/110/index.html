The patient has prior history of irregular heart beat . Her relevant concomitant medications were cholesterol medication, Crestor and medication for irregular heartbeat. No information on allergies.   On 28-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received her first of two planned doses of COVID-19 vaccine intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30-JAN-2021, 2 days after her vaccination, she developed arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, some visual problems (light bothered her for some days) and mild chills. After one week she felt like no more symptoms ongoing and felt good again. She visited her physician for arrhythmias, and he said, she should keep an eye on it, but no medication yet. She is concerned about her second shot.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.  The outcome of the events, arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, visual problems and chills were resolved at the time of report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of irregular heart beat are considered risk factors for arrhythmias.

                                                The patient came to the Emergency Room at approx 3:30 am on 02/03/2021 with pain in right arm (same arm the COVID vaccine had been administered in approx 12 hours earlier) and feeling generally unwell. Patient was concerned about possibility of gout flare or that something was wrong with her arm. Elevated blood pressure was noted; this was attributed to anxiety. She was evaluated, given 500 mg Tylenol, and discharged since the pain was decreasing and blood pressure was stabilized. Patient instructed to follow-up with physician.  The next day,  on 02/04/2021, the patient arrived at the Emergency Room by ambulance; cardiac arrest was the chief complaint. The patient&#39;s daughter stated the patient had been &#34;feeling generally poor and then suddenly collapsed.&#34; Daughter described &#34;gurgling respirations&#34; and being unresponsive. 911 was called, police arrived within 5 minutes and initiated CPR. Epinephrine, atropine, lidocaine and bicarb administered after arrival to Emergency Room.  Shockable rhythm never demonstrated. Patient never recovered spontaneous respiration or movement.   The death was called at 23:04. Coronary artery disease with cardiac arrest is the cause from the ER records; the coroner is putting COVID-19 vaccination in Part 1 of the death certificate.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medication history was provided). Concomitant products included ASCORBIC ACID, BETACAROTENE, COPPER, TOCOFERSOLAN, ZINC (OCUVITE [ASCORBIC ACID;BETACAROTENE;COPPER;TOCOFERSOLAN;ZINC]), ASCORBIC ACID, CALCIUM, MINERALS NOS, RETINOL, TOCOPHERYL ACETATE, VITAMIN B NOS, VITAMINS NOS, ZINC (CENTRUM SILVER [ASCORBIC ACID;CALCIUM;MINERALS NOS;RETINOL;TOCOPHERYL ACETATE;VITAMIN B NOS;VITAMINS NOS;ZINC]), METOPROLOL TARTRATE (METOPROLOL TARTRATE ACCORD), CLOPIDOGREL and DULOXETINE for an unknown indication, ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID (ASPIRIN 81).    On 15-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced PNEUMONIA (pneumonia) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), URINARY TRACT INFECTION (urinary tract infection (UTI)) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), COMMUNICATION DISORDER (talking nonsense and not being clear) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and INAPPROPRIATE SCHEDULE OF PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION (The reason the patient did not have the second dose one month from the first dose is because she got ill). At the time of the report, PNEUMONIA (pneumonia), URINARY TRACT INFECTION (urinary tract infection (UTI)), COMMUNICATION DISORDER (talking nonsense and not being clear) and INAPPROPRIATE SCHEDULE OF PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION (The reason the patient did not have the second dose one month from the first dose is because she got ill) outcome was unknown. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown) was unknown.       While hospitalized she was diagnosed and treated for a UTI, with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Patient was discharged from the hospital with Foley&#39;s catheter and rehabilitation was advised. While hospitalized she was due for her second dose but she got pneumonia, so she was not given the second dose. The reporter assumes the pneumonia was bacterial, because the patient was treated with antibiotics.  Very limited information regarding the events has been provided.

Patient had no appetite, refused most food and spent many hours simply sitting in her chair.  She felt that she was having a heart attack and called 911 using her emergency response button on 2/21/2021.  Doctors indicated that the patient&#39;s life was in serious danger, but because of age they were hesitant to try to remove the clot pressing on her heart.  She was only allowed to go back home because we utilized Hospice.  When asked about her life expectancy, we were told she could die any minute or might live a few more months, but that she was not expected to live much longer.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION!
