The patient has prior history of irregular heart beat . Her relevant concomitant medications were cholesterol medication, Crestor and medication for irregular heartbeat. No information on allergies.   On 28-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received her first of two planned doses of COVID-19 vaccine intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 30-JAN-2021, 2 days after her vaccination, she developed arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, some visual problems (light bothered her for some days) and mild chills. After one week she felt like no more symptoms ongoing and felt good again. She visited her physician for arrhythmias, and he said, she should keep an eye on it, but no medication yet. She is concerned about her second shot.  Action taken with 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.  The outcome of the events, arrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, slight nausea, slight headache, visual problems and chills were resolved at the time of report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, patient&#39;s advanced age and prior history of irregular heart beat are considered risk factors for arrhythmias.

                                                The patient came to the Emergency Room at approx 3:30 am on 02/03/2021 with pain in right arm (same arm the COVID vaccine had been administered in approx 12 hours earlier) and feeling generally unwell. Patient was concerned about possibility of gout flare or that something was wrong with her arm. Elevated blood pressure was noted; this was attributed to anxiety. She was evaluated, given 500 mg Tylenol, and discharged since the pain was decreasing and blood pressure was stabilized. Patient instructed to follow-up with physician.  The next day,  on 02/04/2021, the patient arrived at the Emergency Room by ambulance; cardiac arrest was the chief complaint. The patient&#39;s daughter stated the patient had been &#34;feeling generally poor and then suddenly collapsed.&#34; Daughter described &#34;gurgling respirations&#34; and being unresponsive. 911 was called, police arrived within 5 minutes and initiated CPR. Epinephrine, atropine, lidocaine and bicarb administered after arrival to Emergency Room.  Shockable rhythm never demonstrated. Patient never recovered spontaneous respiration or movement.   The death was called at 23:04. Coronary artery disease with cardiac arrest is the cause from the ER records; the coroner is putting COVID-19 vaccination in Part 1 of the death certificate.

She states that any time she takes a step down (not up), she feels very dizzy.  She has started using a cane because of this which she is dissatisfied with.  This started after she got the second dose on the 10th of March, and has been continual for her since then.  She is not our patient and we do not have any real information about her except that she received both of her doses from the Health Department.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the  Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (left-arm), my mother began to have moderate pain in her left arm, particularly in the left shoulder area. The pain continued to increase throughout the afternoon, until it became so severe (10 on a 10-point pain scale) by 8:30 pm on 3/10/21 , that she could no longer lift her arm. She took 500 mg of Tylenol to attempt to relive the pain and went to bed early.   At 2:45 am on 3/11/21, she needed to go to the restroom, and I (daughter) had to assist her to get out of bed, as she had no use of her left arm due to severe pain in that arm. While seated on the toilet, she indicated that her arm was extremely painful and she felt that she was going to pass out and felt nauseated. Within a minute, she lost consciousness and  I called emergency services. EMT arrived within 5 minutes and stated that her blood pressure was extremely low and she needed to be placed on the floor.  They placed her on a gurney and took her to the ambulance, where they started an IV and took her to her local hospital.  I followed shortly thereafter, where she was taken to the ER. She was admitted to the hospital for observation and given Ativan (she refused any opioids) She was ultimately diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the pain in her left arm. Two days later, the pain has subsided.

                                                Does not have lot number. About an hour after getting the vaccine started with fast heart beat, felt like my heart was like &#34;boom boom boom&#34; and was really loud, sweating, weakness, runny nose.  Symptoms since then  have been on and off and steady for 5 hours today. Today it feels like my heart is in down in my lungs.

                                                My mother fainted on the night she was vaccinated, early in the morning. She had gone to the kitchen to get a heating pad and felt faint while standing  She didn&#39;t make it to a chair, but fell and broke her hip.   While this could have been due to another health problem, my mother had never had a fall or a near-fall. it is concerning that very old adults are not warned to have someone with them after receiving the vaccine (for instance, overnight),  I realize that the vaccine has not been studied specifically in geriatric populations, but it is realistic to assume that there are substantial numbers of very old people living on their own, particularly in cities where there is no need to drive, and where food and other necessities can be delivered. There should be a warning to people that they should not be alone after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Hallucinating; Occasional rapid heart beat; Hadache; A spontaneous report was received from a caregiver concerning reporter&#39;s mother a 97-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced hallucinating/ hallucination, occasional rapid heartbeat/ heart rate irregular and headache.   The patient&#39;s current conditions included chronic urinary tract infection. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included antibiotics for chronic urinary tract infection.   On 26-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their unspecified dose of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) via an unknown route and site for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 27-Feb-2021 the patient had headache for 2 days, was hallucinating and had occasional rapid heartbeat.  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The Outcome of the events, hallucinating,  occasional Rapid Heartbeat, and headache was unknown.  Company Comment: The reported events, hallucinations, heart rate irregular, and headache,  were considered possibly related to mRNA-1273.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the reported event and excluding any other etiology, a causal relationship with the event cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the vaccine profile

When she looked in the mirror, there was an area of bright pink surrounding injection site. She reports the site felt swollen and she could not tell if it was warmer than her other shoulder. Early on the morning of 1/15/21, patient reports the area around injection site was bright pink and remained swollen. At this time it is less itchy, but remains lightly itchy intermittently. At 9am on 1/15/21, RN visited patient and was informed of her reaction. RN observed her L upper arm and she has an oval-shaped light pink area with injection site at the center. Oval measures 8.8 cm x 6.1 cm. The site is warm, slightly swollen, and feels indurated from the swelling. Patient is afebrile at 97.4 orally. Patient reports the light pink coloring at this time is less bright than it was earlier in the morning. Report is being made at 10 am 1/15 so outcome of reaction unknown at this time.

Patient had no appetite, refused most food and spent many hours simply sitting in her chair.  She felt that she was having a heart attack and called 911 using her emergency response button on 2/21/2021.  Doctors indicated that the patient&#39;s life was in serious danger, but because of age they were hesitant to try to remove the clot pressing on her heart.  She was only allowed to go back home because we utilized Hospice.  When asked about her life expectancy, we were told she could die any minute or might live a few more months, but that she was not expected to live much longer.  SHE WAS IN GOOD HEALTH PRIOR TO THE IMMUNIZATION!
