Instead of just wasting the doses we called anyone we could think of that could make it in before 1500. 1500 was when the vaccine was no longer within the 6 hour reconstitution period. I was the person who called my sister and she brought my niece with her. I believed her to be 18 but she is only 16 1/2 and the Shot was given already, before this was noticed. She waited the 15 minutes had no issues and went home with her Mother.  The only side effects noted to me was a sore arm and a slight Head Ache.

A few days after that my muscles started twitching and haven&#39;t stopped. I feel like something is crawling under my skin and the vaccine is extremely affecting my nervous system. I did not have this problem before I had the vaccine. It has not gone away and it is now April 23rd I still feel weak, not the same as I used to feel before having the vaccine, and my muscles are twitching all over my body. My face is twitching and my eye and there is nothing I can do to make it stop. I am so young and I thought the vaccine was safe but I am suffering from it. Especially in my feet I feel like they are tingling and vibrating and my calves are convulsing too. Meanwhile, my heart is fluttering and I feel like it is very hard for me to focus and I feel things crawling under my skin in my brain.  The muscle convulsions are happening everywhere.

                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                For my first dose, I had quite mild symptoms. I woke up with a migraine the next morning and some soreness at the injection site. Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

                                                Strong cough about two and a half hours after vaccine. Started to feel lightheaded and short of breath shortly after.  Took 25mg of Benadryl and two puffs of ProAir rescue inhaler. Was given epinephrine, Xyzal, 4 more puffs of ProAir rescue inhaler, and one inhalation of Breo 100mg. Symptoms subsided after treatment and I went back to normal health.

                                                During vaccine monitoring, patient&#39;s mother concerned that her daughter does not feel well. Patient was feeling whoosy and did not have anything to eat that morning. Patient spit in a plastic bag and was given alcohol swabs to smell. Requested water but was told to have nothing by mouth at this time. Patient monitored for an additional 30 minutes and was better.

                                                I had a fever the night of the vaccine. The next morning I still had a fever and also got a headache. I took some 800mg of ibuprofen. Which broke the fever for a few hours but it returned in about 5 hours. I took 2 Tylenol then. Again the fever and headache subsided. They returned around midnight or 1am that night. I didn?t take anymore medicine. It broke by itself by 7am the next morning. That day I had a cough for most of the day. All symptoms were gone by the 4th day.

                                                Approximately 7-8 minutes after receiving the vaccine, started to feel light-headed, thought she was going to pass out, and her heart was racing extremely high. The health care team at the site took her blood pressure, measured heart rate, gave her water, juice and chocolate and tried to get her heart rate to drop. It was fluctuating up and down and she couldn&#39;t stand up without dizziness;  we waited 45 minutes and then drove her home as she was unable to drive her own car.  She was experiencing significant lightheadedness, and consistent heart racing even while lying down on the sofa/bed. This continued for several days and she stayed home from school and sports. We called her primary care doctor on the 10th and they suggested she wait another day to see how she was feeling. She started to feel a bit better by Friday, was still experiencing a bit of the tiredness, nauseous, light-headed and heart spikes, but was able to drive, move around.  On Sunday evening, she started to experience increased heart rate again, lymph nodes were very painful and started experiencing the light headedness all evening.  On Monday we took her to her primary care provider and they then referred her to ER for the heart racing and a EKG. The increased light headedness, feeling like she will pass out even while laying in bed, dizziness has all increased and her lymph nodes continue to be swollen and painful. It has been over a week since the vaccine and there is no clear sign of her reaction getting any better, if not worse.  The EKG results indicated a new abnormality and we are trying to get her to a cardiologist.  She is and had been a very healthy, varsity athlete that runs over 30 hours a week with track, and since receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine is unable to move very far within the house without feeling that she is going to pass out or that her heart rate is shooting up uncontrollably.

                                                My daughter started feeling feverish several hours after vaccine but by 6 hrs. she was running a fever. It has gone to as high as 103.1. She felt like her fingernails were even hurting her. She said her body had pins and needles feeling. She has stayed hydrated. The fatigue is just to severe for her to get out of bed and even do online school is not possible. Vaccine was given Mon. afternoon and now its Wed. afternoon. Her fever has finally broke and hopefully stays away. Her body always responds to ibroprofen with the sweats pretty fast and a reduction in temperature but this time her body has not been receptive. She wouldn&#39;t even get a sweat like usual. She was dosed at 800mg. I have not taken her to the Dr. but will tomorrow if necessary.

                                                I started having the symptoms in the afternoon. I was really fatigued and throwing up multiple times (nothing left in my stomach); had chest pain. My boyfriend rushed me to the hospital. While I was at the hospital (about 3:00 am) I threw up again at the hospital. They monitored me and put an IV on me. When I was able to hold down water and stop throwing up they let me go home - which was about 7. Prescribed Zofran and Pepsin.  And they put me on a clear liquid diet for a day.  They told me to Zofran, Pepsin and Benadryl before the second dose and told me to eat a meal before getting the second dose and I had no symptoms at all with second dose.

                                                Pain and soreness in vaccination arm was immediate for the rest of the day. Started feeling achey and feverish at the end of the day towards nighttime and bedtime. Took a Tylenol before going to bed. Woke up at 6:00a.m. feeling achey and feverish again, more severe this time. Attempted to walk to get another Tylenol and take my temperature, vision blurred and was extremely cold, immediate nausea, felt like I was going to pass out. Shaking and chills. After drinking Gatorade, ginger ale and water and eating peanut butter toast, nausea settled. After a bit, experienced severe stomach cramps. Drank more ginger ale and Gatorade and took a Tylenol to relieve pain. After 30-45 minutes, pain relieved and I was able to go back to bed. Rest of the day experienced pounding headache and feverish and achey body. Experienced fever highest at 99.8 during the day. After 24 hours passed, feel 100% better and all symptoms and side effects relieved. Only thing sustaining is a little bit of pain and soreness in the arm.

                                                When I woke on 3/31/21 at around 8:00am, I had a bad headache (which happens to me sometimes so that wasn?t a big deal). But then, I started to feel very nauseous and feverish. I ended up not being able to go to work that night and had a fever ranging from 100.4-102.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I took Nauzene to help with the nausea. I took 12 of them throughout the night. You can take them every 15 minutes and they are supposed to kick in after 4. I took excedrin to help with the headache and try to keep my fever down. I woke up at 10 am on 4/1/21 feeling better only slightly nauseous.

She stated she had no trouble swallowing but was tingly around mouth and it was difficult to eat. She took tylenol Monday and Tuesday. I counseled her to contact her PCP about incident and concerns of taking 2nd dose, which she stated to not have one.  I showed her benadryl and tylenol and recommended she take them if needed.  There were no apparent mouth ulcers when she showed me on Friday.

                                                Initially she passed out following the vaccine - within 90 seconds- she has a history of passing out with injections and blood draws. Around noon she had a seizure. She describes a feeling of darkness and dread closing in on her and she was unable to speak or move. She was on the stairs at the time. I witnessed her stiffen, then go limp and fall between the electric stair hair and the wall. She hit the hardwood floor face first then she began to shake/twitch. She was unconscious. She awoke screaming, incoherent speech, and flailing limbs. It took about 5 minutes to calm her and be able to understand her speech. She only remembers the darkness and waking up scared and feeling awful. She was put supine on the floor with feet elevated, blood pressure monitored, given juice to drink, and vitals checked routinely. After about an hour supine and conscious, she felt good enough to sit up. She sat up for 15 minutes before she was able to stand with assistance. Family physician was notified immediately and we are still waiting for a response.

                                                I had horrible shaking/trembling in my arms, chest, and legs about six hours after the vaccine, and they continued for about four hours more, uncontrollably. I passed out briefly around 12 hours after the vaccine, and I&#39;m not sure how long I remained unconscious. Through all of this, my left arm was difficult to move or use, I felt hot suddenly and then cold, and I was tired. The next day, the most serious side effects were gone, but I remained feverish, tired, and largely unable to move my left arm. Those side effects were gone on the third day and now I&#39;m better.

Unusual issues: The day after receiving the vaccine she had several hand tremors,  and feeling as if she had several &#34;mini seizures&#34; throughout the day, a few longer staring spells, some twitches.  She felt &#34;out-of it&#34; all day.   She has petite mal seizures and a history of interictal epileptiforn discharges.  Also history of an intention tremor in her hands. (The mild tremors were primarily in her right hand, to a lesser extent the left).   Today, 2 days afterwards, today, so far, she feels better.   Yesterday was terrible, but we waited it out assuming it was injection related.

Patient also lost control of her bladder and urinated while sitting in the chair. We immediately called 911 who stated not to move her our of the chair. Patient went in and out of consciousness several times (2-3) for short intervals (15-30 seconds). EMS arrived within 10 minutes of symptom onset and took her to the local hospital. While EMS was evaluating the patient in the pharmacy, she stated that she was beginning to have trouble breathing; but those symptoms quickly resolved without the administration of epinephrine. We received a phone call from the patient within 2 hours stating that she was being discharged from the hospital and was feeling much better.

                                                Patient had felt nervous prior to getting her 2nd shot. I asked if she had every had any serious reactions from previous medicines or vaccines, she stated &#34;no&#34;. I then asked how she did after her first shot and she said ok. While waiting her 15 min in the observation area she alerted us that she was feeling extremely hot. We brought her back into the IMZ booth and had her sit in the chair and turned a fan in her direction. I sat down with her an asked her questions and kept her talking to try to calm her down. She stated that she felt as if the chair was swaying a little. We laid out a yoga mat on the floor in the booth, had her lay down and elevate her feet in a chair. She began to get upset and I asked if she had anyone with her, she was able to open her phone and gave me permission to call her family member. Family member came in the store and was able to help calm her down. We gave her some water and had her rest. I monitored her pulse and face/lip color. She became a little flushed. She was able to leave on her own accord, I did walk out with her to ensure she made it safely. I called 2 hours later to check on her and she stated she was feeling better, less dizzy, but just a little tired.

After ~5-10 minutes her dad told me she  wasn&#39;t feeling well. I went straight to the patient who was still sitting, looking pale and being fanned by her mother. I said let&#39;s lay her down but she lost conciousness right then so I just caught her in her chair.  A technician  called 911. An associate took over holding the patient in her chair. We raised her feet on to another chair, her mother continued to fan her face. I sent another associate to meet the responders at the front door and bring them to us. Patient was breathing throughout. She started to regain conciousness before the responders arrived. They checked her out and gave her permission to go home with her parents.

Depending on the thermometer used, she either had no fever or a very low grade fever (less than 100).

We offered to call paramedics, the aunt on behalf of the patient declined, stating she would bring her to the ER.

Immunizer then turned around to give her brother vaccination. When he was turned around, he heard the patient&#39;s phone that she was holding dropped and that she had jerked her arm, which caused her phone to drop. When I went to the patient, she was crying and hyperventilating. I told her to put her head down and take deep breaths. I checked on pt in 15 min, was doing better but had burning sensation at injection site. Kept pt at pharmacy for 30 minutes.

                                                Pt explained on Covid-19 consent form that she has syncope when seeing a needle. She explained she has an intense fear of needles and has fainted in the past when getting vaccinations. She also explained that she has anxiety. She explained that when she faints it looks like a seizure but it is not. When pt was given shot she was responsive during the needle going in.  She was in a seated position. We talked the entire time of administration. After putting the the bandage on her right arm she explained she felt sick(about 40 seconds after injection).  She was still responsive for about two minutes then she fainted and her body shook about two times.  My coworker and I got her on the ground, she was still responsive enough to ask for a cup of water. Which we gave her, she then went unresponsive for 20 seconds and spilled the water. After this we sat with her on the ground for another 5 minutes and she said she was fine. We helped her to a seated position.  We then made her wait  another 30 minutes in our waiting area. She assured us she was fine and reiterated that this has happened before in the past anytime a needle was involved.  On 5/2/2021 she was contacted and she explained she looked a little pale throughout the day of vaccination, but feels fine now and just has a sore arm.

I had her sit in head down position for several minutes and started to monitor her vitals. Prior to vaccine pt was having severe anxiety and has a history of syncope with blood drawns. After several mins of her sitting with ehr head down I checked her blood pressure and it was elevated 155/109 mmHg. 10 minutes later pt felt a little better but started to feel faint and dizzy again. I called emergency sevices and EMS arrived at the scene, assessed the patient and diagnosed her with anxiety/syncope. She opted out from going to the hospital with them. She left the store at 1:01 pm and felt alot better and stated she had an appt with her PCP at 3pm to further seek medical treatment if deemed necessary

I went to check on her and offered her a cold compress for the back of her neck to help her cool down.  After another 5 minutes I went to check on her and the patients mother said she still did not feel good and she would like to have her checked out.  I explained that what she was experience were normal side effects of the vaccine, and she still wanted me to call EMS.  I called 911 and spoke to the dispatcher about her symptoms.  EMS came and checked her blood sugar, and blood pressure which were fine.  They instructed her to rest and explained those were normal symptoms.  She was able to leave about another 10 minutes of resting.

Needed assistance to stand and could not hold a pencil to write. Also numbness and tingling in hands and fingers. Face slightly swollen and red.  400 mg Ibuprofen was administered at  1530. Pushed fluids as soon as fever began. Cooling measures provided, cool shower, cold compress, change of clothes to light pajamas.  We contacted our Insurance 24 hour Nurse line at approximately 2100 when symptoms peaked. The RN on staff instructed us to seek immediate medical care.  We attempted to find an open Urgent Care unsuccessfully and tried to go to an ER but they were full. Fever began to come down around 2230, so we returned home. Continued with ibuprofen every six hours and cooling measures.

For instance, one day her entire palm of her hand, the next day her fingers, the next day the sole of her foot, a few days later it will be just one finger. It is very odd, but she has never had this issue. Also, she has never suffered from headaches until after this second shot. This has been going on for almost a month. We don&#39;t know what to do about it.

                                                My daughter had the vaccine and two days later she started to have teeth shattering and progressively got worse after time, no fever, no chills, uncontrollable day and night, it lasted for about a week. I got her to a neurologist and he gave her Botox on her jaw and after 4 to 5 days it finally stopped. Before the Botox she took an anti anxiety medication and that made it worse then she took a muscle relaxer and that did not help. They did a ton of blood work, EKG. She saw a pediatrician, immunologist, rheumatologist, neurologist. There was an indicator  that she has allergies because something showed blood is elevated when your allergies are bad.

Nothing happens on the 10, however after my mom came home from work she recognized a strange circle on my neck, it seems like an Adam?s apple. But it is really big. And I visited my doctor at the 14th the same month at 3:45, at first he suspect that I have a Thyromegaly.  And I took the Blood Test. However after a several day, the test came out and it says I have a Hyperthyroidism. He advice me to report to VAERS and give me an orders to take the Thyroid Ultrasound, and the Thyroid Uptake Scan. I already made appointments, and I will do it the next 2 weeks.

                                                My daughter received her vaccine at 2:45 on Monday 6/21.  She woke up at 1:45 am on Tuesday 6/22 with chest pains and difficulty catching her breath.  We called 911 and she continued to have those symptoms for another 20 minutes.  She no longer needed oxygen after that and her symptoms started to subside.  The hospital ran tests and concluded the symptoms were related to the vaccination since they did not discover anything wrong with her heart or lungs.  Bloodwork only showed low potassium.  Patient had a fever and still does which we are treating with Tylenol.

                                                I got the vaccine sometime in the afternoon and felt fine for the 15 minutes after the time of injection. I returned to work afterwards, and later that evening I started to feel chills, but it wasn&#39;t severe to the point where I went home. When I returned home from work, the chills remained but I also felt extremely exhausted which was unusual for me. I also had a bit of a headache/felt lightheaded. I took Tylenol which somewhat helped the symptoms. I felt fine after going to bed.

                                                My arm became incredibly sore within an hour. I woke up in the middle of the night aching like I had the flu. The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

I felt very fatigue for a few hours and my head was out of it. Around 7:00 PM I started to get nauseous like I was going to be sick. All the symptoms were gone by the next day except for the soreness in my arm.

                                                I developed an initial fever of 101.2° and was completely bed bound, then that same initial day I began to develop extremely painful and unexplainable mouth sores and lesions. Some developed on my cheeks, some developed on my tongue and they were so painful that I could not eat, drink water, or even talk. I continued to spike fevers for an entire week without being able to control it. The pain was so unbearable and nothing was helping the pain go away, I am still unable to eat solid foods although I no longer have fevers. My throat also really hurt and my neck lymph nodes felt sore to the touch. The lesions in my mouth are beginning to heal but I am still bed bound and am trying to recover. Only thing I can bring myself to eat is chicken broth. I saw multiple doctors, not one of them was able to figure out the source of these awful lesions. They put me on acyclovir and cefuroximeacetil as an antibiotic.

An infectious evaluation including COVID 19 testing, respiratory viral panel, basic lab evaluation (including CBC and CMP), and physical exam were all unremarkable. She was provided PR acetaminophen which reduced her fever and she returned to normal. After clinical improvement, she mentioned that she has developed similar reactions to previous medications (PCN) and vaccines (unknown which type) that always improve with acetaminophen. She did not annotate this on her vaccine screening form. She was provided acetaminophen and had no further symptoms. Will plan to provide her with scheduled acetaminophen after dose 2.

                                                At 6pm on Feb 19, I was very cold no matter how many layers of clothing I put on. Around 8pm I started getting chills and a headache. Around 10pm I almost fainted going up the stairs (I turned white and felt the blood drain from my face, I got very dizzy and had to sit down with supervision). I woke up at 12:30am and had a fever of 101 F and took some acetometaphine to hopefully lower my fever. I checked my temperature again at 8:30am this morning (feb 20) and was at 99.5 F and a slight headache.

                                                It started with bad arm pain at the site of injection. I went to bed around 12:30 but I couldn?t fall asleep. By 3am I figured the only reason I wasn?t sleep was from the vaccine. I then started to feel extremely nauseous and had chills. At 3:30 am I took my temperature and it was 100.5. I laid in bed until 5am with no sleep still and took my temperature again and it was 103.5. I went back into my bed and fell asleep around 5:30 am. The next day I felt as though I had been hit by a truck. I felt extremely groggy and achy and my temperature when I woke up was around 100. Overall, I felt awful.

The following day my bottom lip started to swell and so did my left cheek at 8:30pm. Around 11:30 pm I started to develop a fever, feel soreness and weakness throughout my whole body, and a migraine. In the morning at around 8 am I noticed that I broke out in a severe rash all over my body. It has continues to spread all over.

                                                I received my second dose of the COVID 19 Moderna vaccine on Tuesday morning. By Tuesday night I started to have virtually every side effect that Moderna listed including; fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, nausea and vomiting, and extreme fever. The next morning as I woke up in attempt tp get ready for work, I was not feeling any better and began to feel light headed, and felt the need to vomit. As I had the feeling of needing to vomit, I turned to do so and fainted. From accounts by my family, I was told I woke up, and quickly passed out a second time. As I was awoken, there was probably a minute before I fainted for a third time. All three times I was told I lost consciousness. I was awoken and by that point my family had contacted emergency responders. Paramedics arrived and took all necessary vitals. I did not pass out after that third time. As I expected all side effects Moderna listed, I did not expect to feel as bad as I did and I thought it was worth reporting what happened to be the next day. It caused a panic and I was scared and nervous as I was unsure why that was happening. I&#39;ve tried to look up articles and links between passing out and the vaccine and all I can find is people fainting as they get the vaccine (which is common for any shot) but nothing for fainting that long after the vaccine was administered. I just wanted to report my incident.

                                                Patient received 2nd Moderna vaccine. Patient felt lightheaded and fainted 5 minutes after getting the vaccine. Firefighters and patient&#39;s mother brought her outside the observation room for more privacy and sat patient down on a chair with her head tilted down, and patient regained consciousness within 1 to 2 minutes. Patient&#39;s blood pressure and pulse were both low and patient stated she couldn&#39;t hear out of her left ear. Firefighters decided to call the ambulance and send the patient to the nearest emergency room. I followed up with the patient the next day on 4/10/2021. Patient stated she had a vasovagal response to the injection and received IV fluids at the emergency room. Patient stated it was very unexpected and she had ate before coming to the clinic. She has not felt lightheaded or faint since the incident and is experiencing flu-like symptoms from the vaccine and has been taking Tylenol for it.

I got out of bed and tried to eat yogurt, but felt nauseous and got lightheaded so I had to sit down. I drank some tea and water and went back to bed for 4 hours. I woke up again and still felt terrible and could not even walk short distances without getting very pale, sweaty,  and my vision having spots. I feel chills, a headache, and have been lying down all day. I am most concerned about passing out and becoming unconscious.  I called the Wellness Center and they said to just lie down and stay hydrated

I was overcome with chills, a fever, and a deep, throbbing ache in my lower back that continues to persist. I had to call off of work and even though I felt like I was freezing, I was sweating profusely.

                                                A few minutes after getting the vaccine she started getting light-headed, nauseous, sweats, and blurred vision prior to getting up and informing the pharmacy staff. Pharmacist gave water. She had turned a yellow color. Mother gave liquid Benadryl - adult dose. Epi was offered - but not use.  Decided to see if Benadryl got her back to normal. After the sweat she got chilled. Waited at the pharmacy for about an hour as her color came back to normal.  Had pharmacists take her blood pressure prior to leaving. It was 106/70. Which would be close to her normal range.  Pharmacist initially had trouble getting pulse and blood pressure but was also using the same arm the vaccination was put into. Pharmacist got that blood pressure off the alternate arm. She went to lunch with Mother afterwards. Mother stayed with her until around 4:00 p.m. Shot was around 12:30 p.m. She went to sleep when she got back to her dorm and missed evening class. She has not noted any other side effects other than the tiredness, but she is a college student that&#39;s known to have low iron, was on her period, that just went through a trauma event that probably would have jumped her adrenaline, and she was giving some liquid Benadryl. I&#39;m sure any one of those could keep the fatigue.  There was a call put into the doctor but she&#39;s procrastinating on getting back to them. No rash or difficulty breathing was noticed.

                                                Essentially I experienced flu-like symptoms the next day after I took my first vaccine dose. My first symptom was my throbbing headache that lasted longer as well. My other symptoms were high fever, fatigue, chills, sweating, and sudden rapid heartbeat, a little chest pain in my left part of the chest, and muscle and body aches, and a little difficulty breathing. My fever also lasted for a couple of days and symptoms subsided at the end of the second day after the vaccination day. I would please, please like to know if it&#39;s safe for me to take the second dose? I know I would be able to handle the side effects but expected to encounter them on the second dose and not the first dose, so please let me know as my second dose date will be this  Wednesday on the 21st of April.

She said she was not feeling well before she fainted (did not report to staff) and then she did not remember passing out.  She felt nauseous and hot/clammy afterwards.

                                                Patient experienced a near syncopal episode within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine. She was seated in the Observation area and raised her arm indicating she needed help. The RN responded immediately. I was summoned over and was able to move patient to a table in the back of the room. She was complaining of &#34;Stars: in her vision and not feeling well. First set of vitals were completed at 14:27 BP 116/91, P 100, O2 Sat 97%. Patient is a student. She ate a granola (Nature Made fruit and nut) bar that she has in her pocket. She remained with us for just over an hour , during which time she complained of a fast heart rate, mild nausea and &#34;stars&#34; at the edges of her vision. During the hour she drank over 16 oz of apple juice. She called parents friends to come pick her up and deliver her to her dorm on campus. Last vitals taken at 15:35 110/78 P 104, O2 Sat 99%

                                                After receiving my second dose, I started to develop mouth ulcers covering the entire inside of my mouth. Throughout the weekend, they continued to develop. I went to the ER to receive pain medication, as the ulcers were so bad that I could not talk or eat. The following morning, I passed out going to pick up my medication at CVS, where I was taken back to the hospital in an ambulance and had a 103 degree fever. I was given IV fluids and was sent on my way. I was on strict bedrest for 4 days, until on Thursday 04/22/2021, I was readmitted to the ER due to worsening of the sores and lack of nutrition. For 3 days since then, I have been on IV fluids, pain medication, and taking a steroid solution to help the ulcers in my mouth lessen. The doctors here believe that it is an extremely strong reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine second dose.

                                                PATIENT RECEIVED HER 1ST MODERNA SHOT AT 1:15PM  AT OUR PHARMACY.  IT WAS GIVEN BY NURSE.  AT 1:30P.M. PATIENT STARTED C/O ITCHING ON BILATERAL ARMS AND SLIGHT RASH ON BOTH LOWER PORTIONS OF HER ARMS.  I ASSESSED FOR ANAPHYLAXIS SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT HAD NONE.  SHE HAD NO OTHER ADVERSE SYMPTOMS.  I ADMINISTERED 50MG OF DIPHENHYDRAMINE IM TO LEFT ARM.  THE PATIENT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HER MOTHER.  I REACCESSED PATIENT 15 MINUTES LATER AND SHE FELT A LITTLE BETTER.  THE PATIENT LEFT AROUND 20 MINUTES AFTER THE INJECTION WITH NO FURTHER COMPLAINTS.  SHE HAS AN EPI PEN AT HOME, HAS USED ONE BEFORE AND COUNSELED HER IF AT ANYTIME SHE  WERE TO HAVE S/S/S  OF ANAPHYLAXIS TO USE HER PEN AND CALL 911.  I CALLED THE PATIENT ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER THEY LEFT TO CHECK ON HER, SHE SAID SHE WAS SLEEPY BUT SHE WAS OK.

She had a friend who drove her and I told her to call 911 if any further issues arose. I called the patient the next day and she said she was doing well.

                                                I became very tired and had body aches two days after my second dose of the Moderna vaccine. After that, it had been about four days since I had received my second dose. I started to notice rashes appear all over my body. They were very itchy at times.  So then I went to my local urgent care on May 4th, 2021 to see if they knew what was happening. They prescribed me Hydroxyzine for the itching and Prednisone for the swelling of the rashes. As of May 5th 2021, almost all of the rashes are gone thanks to the medication.

                                                After the first does of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, the next day I had a sore arm, was extremely tires and got chills, but no fever. That night I started noticing some discomfort in my genital area so the following day I examined myself and saw I had genital ulcers on my vulva area. This caused Severe pain when walking. Since it was the weekend, my OBGYN was closed so I went to urgent care and the doctor thought it was BV and prescribed me medication for it, but according to my OBGYN when I went to visit her on Monday, she said it was not BV. My OBGYN tested me for herpes since she said it looked like herpes, but that came out negative but she still prescribed me herpes medication to help with the pain and ulcers. The ulcers lasted for about a week.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

Approximately 1049am, patient started making retching sound. Vomited in small trash can in waiting area. I went out to the waiting area to check on the patient. She stated that she got very sweaty and then vomited but feels better after vomiting. She denies any shortness of breath/trouble breathing or any other symptom. I asked if she wanted a cup of water or ice pack. She requested water and a new mask and denied an ice pack. The patient states she could have had a panic attack.  I requested that she continue to stay for observation.  I checked in with the patient at 1059am and she stated she felt better.  I requested again to stay for additional observation.  At 1110am I asked the patient again how she was feeling. She stated she was feeling better. Over 30 minutes passed since vaccination, patient denied SOB or other symptoms. At 1110am, pt left waiting area.

I had fever and chills, muscle aches, joint pain,  headaches,  and nausea later that night as well. The next morning, my left eye was swollen, left side of tongue completely swollen, lips swollen, and left side of throat closed (anaphylaxis). I took prednisone, Benadryl, and Tylenol to relieve the symptoms, and the swelling around my left eye, tongue, throat, and lips went away. Throughout the day, more hives have developed around my body and face, including my right eye.  I am continuing to take Benadryl and Tylenol and finish doses of prednisone. The fever and chills, muscles aches, joint pains, hives, headache, and nausea are still present.

                                                Near constant ringing in my ears. It is causing me psychological distress. I do not recall this ever being an issue in my life until some time after I received the second vaccine, and I am unaware to any exposure to sound that may have caused this. Not sure if this is relevant, but my body responded strongly in the day or so after the 2nd vaccine with shivers, headaches, and fevers.

She was with her brother and another male. Pt came up to the hostess to let her know the patient was having a seizure. I was called to the waiting area. The patient was sitting with head hung down and hands were moving involuntarily. She was not responding  when calling her name. Her brother informed me that she does this at times and has a somatic seizure disorder. I asked how I could help and he asked that we get her outside in the fresh air. Got a wheel chair and by the time we started to put her in the wheel chair she was becoming more awake. We took her outside and she was more awake but tired. She told me that she did not do this with her 1st COVID vaccine but she has done after other vaccines.

I called my aunt that?s a doctor she told me to take Benadryl which helped. The swelling on my lips lasted until April 27th, and only one side swelled up . 2nd dose of Moderna: I had a fever, chills, swollen lips, itchy tongue, my lips also turned blue. This time the opposite sides of my lip swelled up and it?s extremely painful when rubbed against. I can breathe so I?m not worried.  Allergy medicine seems to help with the swelling and itchiness. My nose is stuffy and i have a lot of abdominal cramping.

                                                My daughter started to experience headaches 2 days after her first dose. On May 13th the headache had become so bad that she would cry and then suddenly became unable to speak or grab. She could not formulate actual words and was unable to smile . This lasted 15 minutes. A trip to the nearest Emergency room was inconclusive and resulted in discharge. 24 hours later , we had the same incident only this time magnified times 10. Where she remained in a catatonic like state for 7 hours only to snap out of it independently without medical treatment. After multiple test she was diagnosed with viral encephalitis. All major causes of encephalittis were ruled out and we were told it was possible a side affect of her first Moderna Covid Vaccine dose. We are still seeing doctors and testing but she seems to have improved without medication which is even more alarming .

                                                Mother alerted pharmacists before administration that their daughter experiences syncope with needles. The mother sat by her side as I administered the vaccine. The patient said that the vaccine hurt and sat their for about 5 minutes . At that time the patient said she did not feel well and laid on the ground. It is unclear if patient passed out for a few seconds. I spoke with patient to make sure she was conscious and then monitored her to look for signs of anaphylaxis. Her symptoms appeared to by related to anxiety rather that anaphylaxis. The pharmacy did call 911, but the patient and her family turned down the emergency service. I sat with patient for about 45 minutes to monitor her condition. When she improved they decided to leave that pharmacy. I did suggest they be looked at by a physician. We also called and check on patients well being and she seems to be doing fine.

This was not a side effect written on the moderna sheet of risks. I was shaking so bad I thought I may have a seizure. I finally settled down and fell asleep. About an hour later, I woke up shaking out of control. I was going to call 911 but my partner was able to grab some NyQuil for me and knocked me out. It was the most terrifying experience of my life and I will not be getting the second shot because of it.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

                                                On the night I received the COVID-19 vaccine, I had a fever that went up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In the morning 24 hours after I had the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I felt a little better from the night&#39;s fever and ate instant ramen, oranges, acetaminophen, and a vitamin C tablet. This was at about 8:45 AM. A few minutes or a minute after I swallowed the acetaminophen and vitamin C, I got a severe allergic reaction that led to me going to the Emergency Room. I have eaten these things before and am not allergic to acetaminophen, vitamin C, or anything in the instant ramen. The reaction was first felt by a shortness of breath and I could barely breath. Then, hives started to form on my face and my lips and face became extremely swollen. I then ended up throwing up after my mom gave be a Benadryl pill and I drank another Benadryl after.  My face had become less swollen but it was still difficult to breath and hives started to form all over my body so we decided to rush to the Emergency Room. We got to the Emergency Room at about 9:30 AM and the hives on my body were worse. They were able to calm down the reaction by giving me more Benadryl through an IV and steroids. They knew I had the second dose of the vaccine so they did not give me anything that would suppress my immune system. Timewise, it could be the acetaminophen, but I have taken acetaminophen in the past many times before without a reaction.

                                                I had cold sweats, a low-grade fever, a headache, body pains, and extreme exhaustion. The symptoms started a few hours after I received the vaccine and got significantly worse the next morning. I had to call out of work because I physically felt that my knees would give out when I was standing. I also could not rest my wrists on anything because it caused too much pain. The next day, I felt much better and was able to go to work.

Around 6:30 I started to get a fever of 100.3 and continued chills with headaches. I took Tylenol when needed. My whole body was sore throughout the day and got worse are the night progressed. My fever was in and out but around 9pm I had the highest temp of 101.4. I didn&#39;t get good sleep due to feeling unwell all night. I belive I stared feeling more myself sometime around 9:34am. But was still feeling a bit warm. But felt way better as the day progressed. My left arm where I received my shot is still very sore. And I still don&#39;t have an appetite.

The pharmacist had administered the vaccine and patient was sent to the waiting area to wait the mandatory 15-20 minutes after receiving the shot. Patient was seated and after 5 minutes, patient disclosed with another patient in the waiting area that she was not feeling well. After a few min she lost consciousness for less than a minute, her eyes rolled back. Epinephrine was not administered. When she became conscious, she refused medical treatment. Patient was nauseous and vomited a few times.  A pharmacist checked vitals and all were within normal limits and a neuro check was also performed which was normal. Patient was given water, gingerale, raw ginger, and ginger tablets for the nausea. Patient was also given saltine crackers. Patient&#39;s aunt arrived at the scene. Patient reported feeling chills and weakness. Patient did not feel comfortable standing/leaving. Pharmacist stayed with the patient for 90 min until patient was stable and walked the patient to the aunts car. At the end of the event patient reported having vasovagal syncope and has a history of fainting at the site of blood, too much stress, and anxiety, but never after vaccines.She reported she did not eat anything in the morning and just drank coffee.

I sat with her for about 30 to 40 minutes to make sure she was maintaining normal breathing.  She did take some oral Diphenhydramine as was very itchy and red. She did have friend with her and we instructed her to go to ER if got worse.  Next day 3/24/21 patient called and said she had a productive cough and was advised by staff pharmacist to go to Dr.  She called back and said did go to Dr. and was prescribed steroids and antihistamine (was on steroid at time of vaccination but we were unaware) and Dr told patient not to get 2nd vaccination. Patient was doing better but not completely recovered

                                                The day after the vaccine I felt tired and weak. I had feelings of tired and cold and I felt nauseous in waves. When I woke up the next morning I was short of breath and it felt like there was a lot of pressure on your chest. I called the hospital that gave me the vaccine and they recommended I go to the ER. I was discharged after 3 hours. I still felt short of breath and had the feeling of pressure on my chest for 48-56 hours. It just got better gradually. I was unable to work because I felt bad and because I also had to quarantine until my test results came back negative for Covid-19.

                                                Later Thursday night, I started to get headache, chills, fever and nausea. This continued all throughout the night and into Friday. The headache was so bad, anytime I moved, it seemed like someone was stabbing my head right in the front. I was hot due to the fever but I never got the temperature. The chills were dramatic, as I was laying on the floor shaking like it was -10 degrees while it was room temperature. I never threw up, but it was hard to drink anything. I couldn?t sleep that night as I was shaking so bad and the head ache hurt. Friday was the same, if Thursday night was a 10, Friday was a 9, so it got some what better. I had to drive and did so with out accidents, but it was t the smartest idea. Couldn?t eat Friday night, but I didn?t throw up. Saturday, everything is almost back to normal, headache is minor, no fever and little nausea, but the first 30 ish hours were the absolute worst in my life.

                                                Following the vaccine, I was perfectly fine and was able to go about my day as normal. However, while doing dishes at 11:30 at night (about 10 hours after I received my second dose of the Moderna vaccine) exhaustion and dizziness suddenly hit me, and my vaccine went black and my ears started ringing. I managed to lie down but I fainted and blacked out for a minute. After I regained consciousness, I had these muscle contractions/shivers (although I took my temperature and had no fever). I felt really exhausted, and went to sleep after that. However, other than that I had no other vaccine side effects. I was told by my doctor to report this though since they had not heard of anyone else fainting, and I have no history of fainting (other than once following blood donation). I also was not thinking about anything remotely related to the vaccine at the time of fainting, and I had no qualms with being vaccinated so I highly doubt it was psychological, especially considering I have no history of fainting, and I had an injectable medication so I have no issues with injections.

Patient stated that she did for sure want to get the vaccine but that she is nervous will needles. She did fine with the administration and for about 5 min. after.  At approximately 8:10, patient had left inj area and walked to a waiting area for  observation. At approximately 8:15 patient fell from the chair landing on side/face head area. No one witnessed the entire fall but I observed her immediately after. She immediately sat up and stated that she just felt like her head hurt. She was offered water, a granola bar and an  ice pack. Her significant other was at her side immediately after and reported to me that she was fine. She waited while her partner received his vaccination and they left (walking) the clinic at approximately 9:00 am

I was hit with chills and then I couldn?t see or hear, it felt like I was underwater and I began to throw up a lot. I also experienced body aches, head aches, and the sweats. I could barely walk to the bathroom and back to my bed.

                                                Fever started at 11:30pm 4/6/2021. Fever ~100 degrees F. Had chills and couldn&#39;t get warm, then was hot and drenched in sweat. Repeated all throughout the night (Hot/cold). Took 500mg Tylenol at 12am that night. Woke up at 2am with a ~102.4 F fever. Took another Tylenol. Got out of bed around 8am 4/7 drenched in sweat. Felt nauseous and vomited almost right away and couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. Still had around 102 F so took 2 more Tylenols. Throughout that night and until Friday, I was achy all over my body. Also, lymph node under left arm pit was swollen and was sore along with my left arm. Throughout the day on 4/7, laid in bed trying to get rest and too nauseous to eat anything other than some cereal in the morning and plain noodles later in the day. Took another Tylenol in the afternoon because I was still staying at 102 F fever. Was slightly dizzy when standing up or moving too fast. I slept the next night and felt fine 4/8 morning (no fever), but felt worse as the day went on, aching everywhere and feeling more and more dizzy. Friday 4/9, I woke up in the morning and when I first started walking, I fell on the floor because of extreme dizziness. The whole day I was extremely dizzy and I&#39;ve never had vertigo before, but it seemed like that based on explanations of it. Also had painful headache every time I stood up, but was fine when I wasn&#39;t moving. The next day it was mild dizziness and completely gone the day after that.  Also, Thursday 4/8 around 7:30pm, I noticed I had hives on the back of my right hand. Not 100% sure if it&#39;s due to the vaccine, but I&#39;m not sure what else would have caused it and it&#39;s worth noting. It was gone the next day.

                                                On the day of the vaccine, I had pain in my arm where I got the shot hours later.  I had a bit of a fever and chills that night.  The next day I began to get bumps on the arm that I got the shot at around 2:00 pm. I took an allergy antihistamine pill and it went away for a couple of hours. Later at night, I noticed small bumps and went to sleep. I woke up at around 6:00 am (2 days after getting the vaccine) and noticed I got hives all over my arms and legs. I went to urgent care and they said I should just continue using the antihistamines. I did and it has been two weeks since the vaccine and every day I still get hives. Not one day has passed where I have not gotten an allergic reaction with hives.

When she turned back around to check daughter her eyes fluttered and she slumped over in chair. She became diaphoretic and pale. Moved her to floor and called me to come help.  Checked respirations and heart rate which were good. Applied cool cloth and ice pack. She stabilized quickly.  Patient was given something to drink and remained in waiting area 15 minutes and then took her to her car and asked her to wait another 15minutes. Mom was driving. Patient may have reported also.

She was sat down and feet propped up. Cold compress was placed on the back of her neck. She stated that she had not eaten anything today so we gave her something to drink in case her sugar was low. After a few minutes she stated her throat felt strange. I asked her if she felt like it was tightening  or lips or tongue swelling or issues with breathing. She stated she didn&#39;t know about the throat other than it felt strange. I gave her 25mg of Benadryl after getting permission from her just in case an allergic reaction was starting. She stated soon after that her throat was getting better. She sat for about 45 minutes in our immunization room until she felt better. She was no longer hot and feeling bad when leaving.

                                                When checking out after the 15 minute wait time, patient said she didn&#39;t feel very well and fell down hitting her head on the pharmacy counter.  When she came to, she said she felt &#34;weird&#34;,  lightheaded and clammy.  We offered her a drink of water and before she could take a drink, she passed out cold. She was out for about 20 seconds and then came to again and we took her down to 1 layer on top and gave her a bag of ice while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.  She was treated/observed by the ambulance crew and after another 15 minutes, agreed she was good to go home with her 2 friends that she had ridden with to get her vaccine.

                                                Around 11:00 in the morning I was starting to feel weak and hard of breathing with a sore arm where the injection site was. As the day went on it progressed to muscle aches and a low fever, I went to bed with chills, muscle pain, heavy breathing, and a 100.8 fever. I work up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and felt nauseous, I don?t remember much but I remember waking up on the floor in a cold sweat, so I assume I passed out from the nausea. I went back to bed and I woke up with a 101.8 fever and weakness and muscle pains. My mother told me to take Tylenol every 4 hours and be on top of things, my symptoms have been decreasing since this morning but as I am filling this out at 11:00 at night I?m slowly getting my fever back. I will add this is exactly how I felt when I got covid back in November of 2020.

                                                Seven hours after receiving my second dose, I developed flu-like symptoms--fever of 100-101 degrees, full body aches, fatigue, and chills, in addition to a sore left arm. These symptoms continued for 18 hours. It was difficult to sleep.  I had the flu three years ago but this felt more severe. Symptoms were treated first with 200mg ibuprofen with no response and then with Tylenol, which improved symptoms.  I stayed in bed for most of those 18 hours to rest. Two days after receiving my second dose, I had a headache for the whole day.  The headache then became a migraine. Both treated with aspirin. Three days after the second dose, I felt fatigued, weak, and still had a headache. To my understanding, the first two days of ailment reflect my body&#39;s immune response and the final two are typical of my body&#39;s stress response. However, I have not experienced either in response to a vaccine.   I should also mention my first menstrual cycle after receiving the first dose of the vaccine was shorter than usual. My periods are not always regular so it may be a coincidence, not causation.

I could not sleep at night and developed the chills with a horrible headache. This was also after taking tylenol. I had the chills the following day and could not leave my bed. I slept the whole day and did not have an appetite. I was also constantly checking for a fever and did not have one, but I still had chills. My symptoms were almost gone by 9 pm of the next day. On the second day, I have neck pain on both sides of my neck. It is bearable but still there. I am otherwise healthy and have not been sick at all within the last year.

I had muscle aches through my entire body. It is now 2 days after the day I got the vaccine and my arm is still sore and hurt when I extend my arm.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA   At 12 pm I started to feel tired. As time went by I got more tired as I was cleaning things. I could not do anything for a long time. I laid on the floor for a while and watched videos. I felt better once I did that. I got tired from sitting and laid on the floor. It went until 4 pm April 24 2021. I got up and was fine after taking a nap on the floor.  April 24, 2021 I got a small headache that was there and now comes and goes with longer time periods. From the time I got the shot 10:43am, I felt a headache after it was done to 5pm. It is now going away at 6pm.  I feel pain at the place of shot even more at 3pm it started now at 6pm it has increased. It is bearable.

                                                About 15 minutes after the patient had the shot, she said her hands were shaky. I asked her to sit a little longer and I offered her some water. About 5 mins later I asked how she was feeling and she said she still felt shaky and thought her hands felt numb. I asked her to continue to sit down and relax. I quickly called our local EMT paramedic service. About 5 minutes later, 2 paramedics showed up, spoke to her, and took her to their mobile service. I called the patient on the next day i.e. 4/25/21 and spoke to her father, who had brought her in for her shot the previous day. He said the paramedics said her blood pressure and oxygen saturation were fine, so they opted to go home instead of to the ER. He said she was doing better at home on 4/25 but still had some cold and flu like symptoms. I asked him to keep us updated and to also inform her primary care provider, so that a decision can be made whether she should continue the Moderna vaccine series or otherwise.

Rph returned to work bench to continue tasks. Another pt nearby alerted pharmacy staff that pt had passed out. Rph and technician approached waiting area and saw pt lying on ground. Rph helped her up and had technician notify store manager. Asked pt if she was okay and had another staff member get her a bottle of water. Managers approached pt and gathered necessary information. Rph had pt wait 30 minutes and check blood pressure before she left. BP slightly elevated so had pt continue to wait. Pt reported headache and stated she wanted to go home and take Tylenol. Instructed her to call pharmacy if she experiences any issues on the way home. Left voicemail to follow up with pt.

That day the rest of the symptoms continued in a milder way and by the day after I was feeling nearly normal again.

                                                The day of getting my vaccine, I had received the shot at 1:30pm on 4/30. I had no symptoms besides a sore arm at the injection site. I woke up at 4:00am on 5/1 with a fever of 99.9F and chills. I decided to take a hot shower because I couldn?t get warm. At the end of my shower I suddenly got a ?sickly? feeling in my chest, similar to symptoms of a chest cold. My vision started going black, almost like when you stand up too quickly. I experienced a sudden throbbing headache out of nowhere. My ears were ringing with partial hearing loss, and I started getting very nauseous. I stumbled out of the shower and immediately vomited.

Also had high fever (reaching 103.8) for four days (starting two days after vaccination) which was reported, and a rash of purple spots across my chest, arms, and back started after fever stopped. Rash was not very bothersome, but alarming. Experienced frequent nausea and lightheadedness, but I also was experiencing those symptoms at the time due to my concussion. One week exactly after vaccination all symptoms were gone and no treatment was needed.

                                                Approximately ten hours after injection, woke up with constant chills, fever of 100.1, body aches, stuffed nose (had to breathe out of mouth), and headache. Acetaminophen helped slightly. For the next 12 hours fever stayed between 101 and 102 despite continuing to take acetaminophen, and headache also didn&#39;t improve. At 6:15 pm that day (~29 hours post-shot) fever was 103.2, headache was very strong (with light sensitivity). Since acetaminophen hadn&#39;t been helping, switched to ibuprofen. About an hour later, the fever finally began to go down and was gone by 10 pm that night. The next day, no fever and minimal headache, but was very weak and lightheaded. At about 51 hours after the shot, symptoms were all gone.

Pain was so extreme that the arm was immobilized- any movement no matter how small caused pain to flare. It felt like a broken bone. Injection at 2:30pm, pain peaked around 10pm. Next morning awoke with same extreme pain and added severe body aches in lower back and legs along with a headache. Pain persists as of report

She was instructed to sit in the waiting room for about 15 minutes with her boyfriend. About five minutes after sitting out in the waiting room, the patient almost passed out and had some convulsive like movements. 911 was called. The patient did not loose consciousness, but was extremely pale. She was nausea and almost vomited three times. She reported feeling shaky, and said her throat felt funny. EMS arrived and took over the care of the patient.

I did feel drowsy and almost like I could not think properly. After that, the symptoms went away.

Her boyfriend who was also there for an immunization and I were able to catch her before she fell, she was brought to floor in sitting position and I recommended she lie down, she was very pale but still coherent. We called store assistant manager who came to assist and he called paramedics to check her out. I stayed with her until paramedics came, they checked her out and determined she was ok and did not need further assistance. She was driven home by boyfriend once she was given the all clear and we all determined she was ok. Patient appeared to have a fear of needles. We called patient later in evening to check on her and she said she was doing fine.

The person who administered the 2nd shot seemed to have injected it way too fast, I noticed a burning sensation as it was injected, and I also noticed that when the needle was removed, the medicine was dripping down arm. A few hours after receiving my shot (5:30 pm), I started to notice a bad headache, feelings of exhaustion, nausea, and hot flashes. I checked my temperature and it was 99.6 degrees, which is higher than I normally run so my body was doing something. I noticed a hard, swollen, red bump at the injection sight on my right arm - which has progressively gotten worse as the days have gone by. I still have the low grade fever, exhaustion, headache, nausea, and swollen/sore arm.

                                                I felt fine up until I went to bed at about 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am on the 20th of May feeling extremely fatigued and feverish. I took my temperature about an hour later and my temperature was 103.3 F. I experienced a racing heart rate and heart palpitations throughout the night alongside the fever. My temperature didn&#39;t lower until another 3 hours, in which I took Tylenol, used cold rags on the skin, and soaked in a cold bath to lower my temperature. My fever went up and down all day during the 20th, wherein I felt generally unwell and feverish. Today, the 21st, my urine is extremely dark and black tea-colored because of blood in my urine, due to a preexisting kidney disorder where blood spills into my urine whenever I contract a virus.

                                                Patient came in for her 2nd Moderna vaccine shot. She had had a similar reaction after her first shot which was also reported to VAERS. She said her first shot reaction lasted until that evening but she was fine the next day and willing to get the 2nd shot. We administered the shot and asked her to wait for 30 mins for observation, because of her history. After 30 mins, we checked on her and she said her arm felt a little numb. We called our local EMS service and they came to check on her. They allowed her to go home after checking on her. I called and spoke to the patients mom/caregiver a couple of hours later. She said the patient was doing better and felt a little worn out. She also mentioned that the patient had a headache, for which I recommended some tylenol.

By the 23rd of May, the place where the injection took place was red and swollen. I still had small pain. On the 24th, it was still red, a bit swollen, and felt a bit itchy, I put on some Vaporub. Yesterday, the 25th, I had a mild headache and the injection site looked like a small bruise but with a green color. Today, 26th of May, the bruise is yellow-ish and still itches.

She was accompanied by her mother, shortly in to her 15 minute waiting period her mother approached and said the patient felt light headed. I asked patient to remove her mask and assessed for any swelling of the lips or the face. Patient stated she did not have any issues breathing but felt very faint. Her eyes were very dilated, and she wanted to lay down. So we assisted patient to the floor, called Code White and 911. I stayed with patient as she lay down, she began to recover, but still looked very pale. I continually assessed patient for anaphylaxis, but patient reported no pain in injection site or issues breathing. Paramedics arrived and assessed patient,  BP was normal, blood sugar was in the low normal range, paramedics determined that issue was not related to vaccine, but that she was dehydrated and had not eaten, which exacerbated the light headedness.

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

                                                *I am a nursing student who received the vaccine because I am in a nursing program. Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

My arm has been red and itchy since the day, but it is increasing becoming warmed, bigger, and itchier every day since.

I could not life my arm past my chest because it was so swollen and sore. I stayed at home and skipped new year&#39;s, going back to sleep around 1030pm. It was not fun

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

                                                I got up to use the bathroom at 4:30 this morning. I was extremely shaky but made it. I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:50pm on 01/25/2021. Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

                                                Patient called to report starting yesterday she has had a fever 101.0, she admitted she took Tylenol this morning  and she took her temperature as we were talking on the phone she stated it was 97.5.  She also said she has been having chills and she is short of breath &#34;after walking across the room&#34;.  I didn&#39;t notice any SOB while speaking on the phone.  We talked quite a bit and I kept asking her what else her symptoms she was having and she didn&#39;t have anything additional to say.  But when I asked if her throat and lips was tingling she stated yes it feels like her throat is closing.  The things I specifically asked about she stated &#34;yes&#34; that was happening to her.  She denied having any Benadryl at home.  I told her to go to urgent care immediately and to call me back once she is seen,

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

It lasted the night, and then I took ibuprofen 200mg in the morning and throughout the day it got better, but around 3pm, it started to come back, so I took another 200mg ibuprofen. I also didn?t eat anything for fear I would throw it up. Later that evening, it got worse and I became extremely fatigued. I was able to eat some soup and crackers. I took another ibuprofen and couldn?t go to sleep until 4am. The next morning I felt better, with only residual side effects. My left arm was also extremely sore and tender from the time of administration until Feb. 6.

This continues to be an issue on day of filing out this report on 2/13/2021. Fevers have been mostly low grade 99.3 to a highest fever being 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I have been taking Tylenol and motrin to help with fevers and headaches.  On 2/10/2021 I was put on  valACYclovir 500 mg tablet to take twice daily in case the vaginal sores were herpes. I discontinued that later the next day per doctor since the results came back negative.

At around 4:00 pm, I felt mild joint pain in my right ankle which worsened to mild/moderate joint pain in my left elbow/wrist &#43; both ankles/knees, so I took an extra strength acetaminophen (500 mg) around 4:30 pm. My joint pain subsided, and I began to feel fatigued around 5:00 pm. Mild chills began around 9:30 pm, and joint pain at the same sites resumed around 10:00 pm. I went to bed around 12:00 am with moderate chills, mild joint pain, and mild pain at the injection site, but I awoke around 12:45 am with slightly worsened chills, joint pain, and pain at the injection site. I took another extra strength acetaminophen and was able to sleep for the rest of the night. I woke up at 9:00 am with no symptoms.

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/10/21 and had a large, red, inflamed area on her arm at the injection site for a few days, but otherwise tolerated vaccine well. She received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/10/21 and the next day (3/11/21) developed fatigue and lightheadedness while exercising, which continued for the next few days. She developed acute onset, sharp chest pain on 3/13/21 AM which did not resolve so she presented to an ED. Vitals were normal but labs notable for troponin I which peaked at 4.36, CK 758, d-dimer 640. CBC/CMP and EKG were unremarkable and initial TTE with EF ~45%. Repeat TTE obtained a few days later with normal LV and RV size/function without any wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac MRI obtained with normal LV function (EF 64%) but late gadolinium enhancement in a subepicardial distribution within the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle at the base most compatible with myocarditis. ESR and CRP were normal. Further workup to determine etiology of myocarditis was negative (ANA, ANCA, RF, hepatitis panel, HIV, full respiratory viral panel, COVID-19 PCR). She was placed on metoprolol succinate 12.5mg XL daily and will follow up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. Family concerned that COVID-19 vaccine was the trigger/underlying etiology of her myocarditis.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had a really awful headache and swollen arm, that was incredibly touch-sensitive. Around 3 pm that day, 25 hours after the injection I was hit with severe nausea. About an hour later, I began vomiting and had diarrhea. For some time, I was unable to keep water down. I called a 24-hour nurse line, and they advised contacting my doctor&#39;s emergency line. I did, they said if I couldn&#39;t make it through the night without keeping water down I needed to go to the hospital. Luckily, right before bed I drank some water and was able to make it through the night. The next morning, I had a telehealth visit with someone from my doctors office to review symptoms. Today I have had waves of nausea, but no vomiting. I have had diarrhea, and I had a spontaneous period that was very heavy and two weeks early today (2 days post vaccine).

                                                I had a bad headache begin a couple hours after receiving the vaccine, and muscle soreness. I woke up and could barely move my arm, and throughout the day I got progressively more fatigued. By the next night, I had a low-grade fever and had extreme all-over body soreness. It felt like I had the flu. By morning, I was feeling a bit better and got progressively better. The next day (2.5 days after the vaccine), I was feeling better other than some soreness in my injection site.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Reaction started out with a localized 3-4 inch inflamed reaction. It looked very similar to hives. This was on Friday, March 19th, 2021 around 9 PM. I went to sleep and woke up the next morning and it was still there. I took benadryl and one ibuprofen to help the inflammation and the reaction, but it only got worse following this. I then had intense tactile and mechanical allodynia, which is often associated with my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but this has been very intense. The allodynia had been occurring across my left hand up to my elbow, but has now moved to both of my arms, my neck, my entire back (more severely around the ribs), my chest, and my feet. I am very fatigued and feel feverish. My current temperature is only 99.2, but the pain is still active. Today is Sunday, March 21st, 2021. I got the vaccine on Saturday, March 13th, 2021 and this reaction is following the vaccine about a week after.

Then around 2 am I woke up and vomited. About 20 minutes later I vomited again. The next day I woke up and was fatigued, weak, and nauseous the rest of the day. I fell asleep multiple times and napped by accident. By 10pm,  almost exactly 24 hours later, I felt fine again.

                                                The syringe was larger and looked full. It took a long time for medication to go into the arm due to the amount of liquid injected into the muscle.  Right away the full left arm and breast were painful.  The arm pain continued to get worse and felt like she hit her funny bone but more extreme and this pain lasted all night into the next day.  She was unable to sleep due to the full arm pain.  The significant pain in the breast area lasted all day into the next day too. Also, felt chills and body aches starting that evening into the next day and night. We did not know the dose was only supposed to be 0.5 ml at the time of injection. We suspect she received at least 5 ml instead of the recommended 0.5ml.The name of the nurse that administered the vaccine is written on the vaccine card but not sure of spelling. RN?

                                                Approximately 12 hours after the event, I had throat swelling, chills, sweats, temperature of 102.5, headache, muscle soreness, dizziness, lightheadedness. Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

Upon calling the health center, they said that I may have eaten something bad. Around 6pm the same day, I started sweating but I was freezing, and had a headache and muscle pain. I had a 101 fever and that persisted until the next day (3/24/21). It is currently (3/24/21) and I have noticed sharp chest pains on the right side of my chest throughout the day, especially when exerting forces breathing (such as riding my bike or walking up stairs, or getting into and out of bed). I still have a slight fever and feel very cold, but I in fact, still have a slight fever of 100.4

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

                                                First day I had immediate swelling at the injection site, red circle form around the site of injection following up with an itch that lasted for 3 days. Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

Within the next hour, my jaw began to lock and my throat began to burn/tighten. Within this timespan, my body, especially my back began to ache as well as my chest feeling tight.  After three hours, I went to the on-campus clinic and they gave me 50mg of Benadryl.

                                                Few hours after I got the vaccine I experienced sinus pressure in my left nostril. I went to blow my nose and a blood clot came out. I tried to blow my nose again but nothing came out. I went to sleep and the next day (the day after I got the vaccine) I still felt the same sinus pressure. I showered about mid-afternoon that day and after I got out of the shower my nose was bleeding, but it was a mild nose bleed. The rest of the day, I experienced a headache that felt like it was coming from the place I experienced the sinus pressure. The head got progressively worse as the day went on, I took Advil to get rid of the pain and went to sleep early. The next few days I experienced a headache that would be mild when I woke up in the morning, then got progressively worse as the day went on. Right now (4 days after the vaccine as I&#39;m submitting this report) the pain of the headache has somewhat subsided, but the pain is still present.

I have aches in my legs, neck, arm, and lower back (I?m supposed to have my period soon, so it?s possible that the back pain is not vaccine related). I have a headache that has persisted since about 11:30 am. I have not taken any medication. I would say on a pain scale of 1-10, the pain is about a 4 (quite uncomfortable but bearable).

                                                Patient stated she felt like fainting post immunization. Pharmacists quickly grabbed adverse event protocol and followed directions as stated. Called code white on intercom to alert store management. Asked patient about symptoms and she reported symptoms of sweating, coldness, dizziness and nausea. Assessed patient blood pressure and asked patient if she wanted us to call 911. Patient did not want us to call 911. Patient never lost consciousness but had low blood pressure on initial reading. Instructed patient to lay down with feet elevated. We gave patient a pillow to assist in elevation of feet and gave her cold compresses to apply to neck and face. After a few minutes, patient blood pressure was normal and patient stated that she was feeling better. We requested that she sit for an addition 15 minutes before she can leave. After 15 minutes patient, patient was feeling ok and left with her boyfriend. She was exhausted from work and this was likely the main factor for the feeling of syncope.

                                                Nurse made errors in administering vaccine. Lower-than-authorized dose volume administered. Fluid leaked out after removal of the needle. The fluid sat on top of vaccine site. Nurse also had trouble drawing vaccine fluid out of vial into needle, so I am unsure if the proper dosage was in the needle to begin with. Nurse pinched vaccination site, leading to potential subcutaneous injection. I did not see the angle or depth of which the needle entered.   3 hours after vaccination, large bump began to form on vaccination site. Has grown large as of time of writing, currently 1.5inch in diameter. Bump is hot and painful to the touch, and tender. Only other side effect is fatigue.

Three days after I woke up and my right eye and cheek were super puffy and I had a rash on my face that was red and blotchy and itchy. It is now four days later and hives and face rash still persist but due to medications don&#39;t seem to be getting worse.

                                                I developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of platelets) and menorrhagia due to the vaccine according to my doctor. I believe there have been about 30 cases of this occurring so far.   In my case, I took the vaccine and felt relatively tired for two days. There were no other symptoms. About a week later, I got my period after not having it for a couple months. The blooding was light for a few days, but then got extremely heavy. After about a week of very heavy bleeding, I went to urgent care. They took blood tests, and found that I had a critically low level of platelets (6 platelets when the normal range is 150-400). I was admitted to the ER for multiple days, and they gave a platelet transfusion and IVIG  fluids, which has helped considerably. I also had to take steroids to suppress my immune system so that my platelets could increase.

Took 3 Advil and drank a cup of water then slept until 5:30 pm. Once I woke up I still felt sick but I took 5 ibuprofen, ate a bowl of noodles and showered and felt perfectly fine. Around 8:30 pm I noticed a light rash forming around the injection site. Does not hurt or itch as of 7:32 pm April 18th

I was nauseous, had body aches, severe arm pain, and a head ache all night and did not sleep well. Then I woke up at 1pm the next day with less arm pain, no nausea, less body aches, and a slight headache. This continued through the day, and then at 7:00pm I started to get a severe headache and arm pain again.

On April 3, I woke up with intense body ache around 8 AM. I took acetaminophen throughout the day. In the afternoon, I developed a low-grade fever that reduced with acetaminophen. On April 4, I woke up at 6 AM with diarrhea. I proceeded to have a bout of diarrhea 20 minutes later. Soon after, I vomited. The vomiting and diarrhea continued throughout the day at a frequency of every 20 minutes until about 4 PM. An anti-diarrheal and Pepto did not help. I was very dehydrated but was able to rehydrate myself once the diarrhea and vomiting stopped. On April 5th, despite being adequately hydrated at that point,  I had a pounding headache that was not remedied by acetaminophen or ibuprofen. The headache lasted the whole day but was not present on April 6.

                                                By the evening of April 16th, I was experiencing a fever of 103.5 after already medicating an hour prior. On the 17th, my fever continued and I noticed vaginal bleeding. On the morning of April 18th, I went to the emergency room because I was still experiencing this bleeding, as well as bleeding from my nose. We came to the conclusion that I had an ovarian cyst rupture.

Breathing got better/slowed down within 15 mins after taking Benadryl. Luckily, I had my Epi-Pen just in case - I I had not had an Epi-Pen I definitely would have immediately gone to the emergency room. It was very scary. I woke up this morning with an extremely sore throat.

                                                Within the first 24 hours a hard uneven lump (about 1.5 inches in diameter), heat around/on injection site, and soreness, and mild itching developed. By 48 hours, soreness peaked and the lump remained with warmth and itching when the area was touched with slight pressure. Between the 2nd and 14th day, the lump was still present (still 1.5 inches in diameter) with mild itching. I began to develop a dry cough, shortness of breath, severe fatigue, and muscle fatigue that lasted from day 5 to day 11 following the Moderna injection. I went to get a COVID test and the results came back negative. After the 14th day the lump went down but now there is a discoloration of the skin where the lump was located that is still present 23 days after the first injection.   I did not use any medications or treatments to heal the adverse event nor sickness symptoms following the injection.

Blood pressure with a wrist cuff was 110/72. No symptoms of anaphylaxis or difficulty breathing. EMS arrived after a few minutes, they assessed her vitals she reported doing better. Patient denied being taken to the hospital for further assessment.

Pt. stated she felt like she took a benadryl, or felt like she just ran 20 laps. I gave her a small package of cheez-its and a small water around 3:00PM. Time of vaccine was around 2:45PM. She said that helped a little. She said she hadn&#39;t eaten since 10AM, and was starving. Said maybe that had something to do with it? Pt. had to use the bathroom, and left my sight around 3:18PM to go to the bathroom at the front of the store.

                                                At 10:40, the patient went in for her first Moderna vax.  She was slightly nervous since she&#39;s not a fan of needles. When she got it a vessel must have been nicked, because she experienced a bit of blood streaming down her arm which surprised us. The nurse wasn&#39;t concerned and stopped it quickly and cleaned up her arm.  Got her a new bandaid and she was sent to the chairs in the waiting area to wait her 15 minutes following the vax.    I had to pick up my regular prescription so I got in line while she was sitting there surfing on her phone.  As I got to the front of the line, the patient called me and said she was feeling lightheaded. I immediately left the line, and was there (I was maybe 15 feet away) and was asking how she felt. She said she felt sweaty and like she might pass out.  Right then, her eyes rolled a bit and closed and she went limp. I was able to hold on to her and a customer that was behind me in line and I were able to alert the nurse that gave the vax and the pharmacist. Both immediately came to our aid.  We got the patient on the floor and on her side.  The nurse wanted us to have an epi pen in case, but we all didn&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction. We checked her blood pressure and it was low.  Another employee was already calling an ambulance and another was getting her some juice. She was beginning to regain consciousness. She was only out for about 2 to 3 minutes at the most.  Her blood pressure was low, but started to come back to normal pretty quickly.  We had her lay there a few minutes and then sit up. Eventually we moved her to the chair a few minutes later.  Within another few minutes the emts arrived. She had already had answered questions for us like her name, birthday, where she was, etc.  The emts repeated those same questions, asked us what happened and rechecked her vitals.  All were back to normal.  They gave her the option of be transported to the ER, but given that she was feeling back to normal she declined and everybody felt good about that decision.

That headache was over and then by that time I had lost my sense of smell for five to six days. I would get nauseous when I would eat - had a mild cough; no fever and body aches. I had  COVID test taken. They told me to take Tylenol  if I had a fever but I didn&#39;t have one; but I took: Dayquil; Nyquil and Theraflu and those things helped. (Telemed Dr. visit - was what I had.)

Some heaviness in her chest  which progressed over next 10 minutes to feeling difficulty breathing - &#34;like a rock on her chest&#34; . At 09:04 AM She used her Albuterol asthma inhaler to see if it would help her breathing. No improvement in breathing, then complained at 0911 of some vision changes, felt like she was having to concentrate to breath - like breathing through a straw and at this time I started to hear her audibly wheezing - Squad was called. When they arrived around 9:18 AM she was having heaviness, closed her eyes - complaining of a little bit light headed, still having difficulty breathing.  She left with squad at 9:24 AM

I started to get warm and felt like I was about to vomit so I washed my face with cool water. I went to sit down and my vision started to blur and my vision started to close in with darkness and I passed out. When I gained consciousness again, I was still extremely dizzy and light-headed and my vision was still not focused. I passed out two more times. When I gained consciousness the final time, I was extremely sweaty and shaky. I called 911 and they sent paramedics to my house. I drank some water and stayed in the floor until they arrived. They took me by ambulance to the hospital to run several tests and everything looked normal.

On Friday, I had a headache when I woke up as well as body aches and pains. Additionally a large swollen, red, warm spot appeared at the injection shot. It is very itchy. I googled it and found that it is considered ?Covid Arm?. Saturday I still had a headache and achey body and both friday and saturday i was very tired. I also developed a deep, junky cough on Friday which I think was due to the shot.

A few hours went by and the nausea increased. I layed down for a while and then my body started to ache intensely. Once I finally fell asleep and woke up from my name the body aches were horrible and then I suddenly had the chills. I almost threw up three times and I had the chills so bad that my body aches more and more.

Woke up on the 19th at 7:30 AM with continued injection site pain and fever like symptoms but no notable fever. Also began to feel nauseous on the morning of the 19th, which continued all day. Woke up on the 27th at 10:00 AM feeling mostly back to normal with a small amount of injection site pain left over.

Every single muscle and joint in my body hurt, it felt like I had been hit by a train. I could feel soreness down to the muscles in my hands. I could barely move, I couldn?t get comfortable. My head and neck hurt the worst, it was just so sore and painful and everytime I stood up, I would get a pounding sensation in my head. It went on like that for almost 12 hours. The next day I felt perfectly fine.

                                                After about 5 minutes of administering the vaccine, the associate overlooking the observation area came to tell me a patient was not feeling well. I immediately grabbed my carat and went out to the IMZ area next to pharmacy. The patient was still seated and she was conscious, but appeared very weak, sweaty, and slightly pale and cold to the touch. I immediately made sure she could respond to my questions. She was able to respond. I asked if she had eaten before coming in and she confirmed she had not eaten that day yet.  I checked her blood pressure and it was 68/33. I stayed by her side and her mother was fanning her on the other side. I had her take several breaths in and out and could visually see her responses improving. She asked for water, which her father handed to her. I checked her blood pressure again and it was up to 125/68. She reported feeling much better and was able to joke around with her sister who also received the vaccine at the same time. I asked her to sit for an additional 15 minutes, on top of her original 30 minutes, and told her parents I would be back to check her blood pressure gain. I came back into the pharmacy and prepared another vaccine. After I administered the next vaccine, I checked her blood pressure again, which read 95/68 and her mom stated this was normal for her. I advised her to stand up slowly before walking. A few minutes later she came to the pharmacy window for her vaccine card and reported feeling normal and her parents thanked me and they all left.

The body aches started around 10:00 pm on the first day.  Then fatigue and joint pain.  Really awful.

I tried drinking water, using the bathroom, and taking deep breaths, but the tightness and racing heart didn&#39;t go away. By 4am, I was having a friend drive me to the ER.  The tightness was gone by the time I was admitted and they started running tests.

                                                patient called this morning around 9:00 am. She states that since getting her covid vaccination yesterday, she feels really sick. Fever/achy and she is having facial swelling. She said she didn&#39;t feel like this after the first dose. Since facial swelling is an abnormal and dangerous side effect, I recommended she go to the ER (or at least an urgent care) to be evaluated immediately because she doesnt want the facial swelling to get worse or extend to her breathing. She stated at that time she was having no trouble with her throat or breathing. She said she was going to go to the ER. I told her in the meantime she could take liquid benadryl while on her way to  the ER

Then the swelling progressed to the right side of her bottom lip. She did not tell anyone at the clinic about this. Within the hour, she had also developed swelling under her tongue, around frenulum. Also had swelling under her top lip, where lip attaches to gum. Also had metallic taste in her mouth and throat was itchy.  These symptoms are the same exact symptoms she gets when she has an allergic reaction to cold substances that she eats/drinks (she has cold urticaria for which she carries an Epipen).  She notified me at approximately 2pm. She said lip swelling had decreased some by that time but other symptoms still present. I had her take 50mg of benadryl. That helped reduce symptoms further but they were still present. At urgent care, she was given decadron IM, told to use benadryl 50mg every 6 hours x 24 hours, and given RX for prednisone 50mg x 5 days. She already takes zyrtec daily.  Within an hour of the decadron injection, symptoms improved further. As of 1300 on June 10, symptoms are resolved.

Unable to move till the pain passes through (around 20 minutes). Painful periods started on June 11, 2021 during the middle of the night around 3:00am when i was woken up by the ability unable to breathe due to chest pain and unable to move till the pain passed through. Then again on June 13, 2021 while i was watching t.v. around 9pm. I had difficulty breathing and had to focus on my heart beat to slow down. However, i am constantly out of breathe and easily fatigued.

                                                1 week after receiving the vaccine, I began having vocal and physical tics. I have never been diagnosed with a tic disorder in the past but had had physical tics every few months prior to vaccine. After the vaccine they became very frequent and, 2 weeks post vaccine, were occuring about once every minute. They went away after 4 weeks post vaccine.  After second vaccine dose (04/02/2021) I began having intense fatigue, lightheadedness, and inability to stand for long periods. These have not improved as of today.  In both cases, it was a significant increase of prior symptoms I have not received proper diagnosis for.

                                                Large painful red welt on injection sight appeared around 10 am the next day. Around 11 pm after recieveing the injection at 4:30 pm I became very fatigued more so than normal. My arm started hurting around 6pm progressively getting more painful and inflammed. Around 2 am i starting having chills and shakes, migrane, as well as body aches and progressively got worse around 11 am the following morning the shakes stopped i woke up with congested sinuses and a migrane as well as enlarged lymph nodes in my underarms and under my chin and jaw. I had extreme fatigue all day following. Currently at 7pm the injection site is red, hot to touch, raised in a circle around the size of a half dollar, it also is very painful to move my arm and very painful to touch.

                                                The date of the second dose was 05/25/2021, which is when the side effects started. I had the normal and expected effects, such as a sore arm and fatigue. I began my period that morning, before I went in for the shot. I would like to be as detailed as possible, so I will likely include some graphic details in this description. My apologies in advance.  My period normally lasts 3-4 days and is moderate (as far as I know) regarding blood loss. After the second dose, the flow was extremely heavy and my period lasted for almost an entire week (7 days). It was miserable. I was bloated and tender in that area, and extremely tired. I was also cramping, which is unusual for me nowadays.  About two weeks after that, I felt a stabbing or ripping pain in the uterus area. It stayed for about two days, throbbing every minute or so. I could not sleep those days. It was not so unbearable that I could not perform everyday actions, but it was taking up a good portion of my thoughts that weekend. After that, it went away and I thought it was over.  About three days ago from today (today is June 22nd, or 06/22/2021), the pain returned and I knew it meant the start of my period. The timing was normal. The next day I began bleeding, but the flow is again much heavier than normal. The pain is back and much worse than before. I am going through many more pads than usual and it is, for me, a worrying amount of blood. Since this is the second period in a row I am experiencing this, I felt it was necessary to report it in. I hope this is okay and not taking resources from those with worse issues.  I would also like to note that I experienced my first panic attack in 5 years the night of my second dose (for no reason- they&#39;ve always had a concrete reason for occurring) and my anxiety was notably worse that week (I am on medication and was otherwise doing very well managing the anxiety). During the attack I experienced the usual symptoms: my throat closing up and making it harder to breathe, and uncontrollable shaking and crying.  I was not thinking of anything that would make me nervous at the time of the attack. I had just finished an online gaming session with a friend and was showering to prepare for bed, so I was fully relaxed.  Additionally, my mental health has notably dipped a bit over the last month, though there are a number of factors at play and I don&#39;t want to blame the vaccine for that. However, I was told to at least make note of it here just in case there does end up being a correlation.

                                                Back pain along spine and  headache started during the night (about 12 hours after vaccination). It was bad enough to keep me from sleeping. I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

At 10:28PM my temperature went up to 101.5. Took Tylenol and fell asleep woke up at 3AM fever of 102.3 . Fell asleep and woke up again with a fever of 102.6. I had chills nausea weakness body aches headache. Took Tylenol again and fell asleep only to wake up again at 6:30Am  still with a fever of 102. Nothing was making it go away I had no appetite extremely fatigued and nauseous it felt like I had covid again. I also felt swollen lymph nodes under my arm. By Sunday I was feeling way better and my fever was gone. Monday my ear popped again lasting a minute that?s never happened before. Monday today 01-05 still having headaches and now chest pain. I felt so bad I wanted to go to the hospital but did not it really did feel like I had covid all over again I would not want to put my self through that again.  Also I did have covid back in October I believe just wanted to put that out there.

My chest felt heavy and I was having labored breathing, My heart was racing at 160bpm and my blood pressure was 180/90, both of which are very high and abnormal for me.  I had severe joint and muscle pain. I had the chills and could not stop shaking.  I was very weak and could not even move out of bed, Leading to me calling 911 for an ambulance at 10:21pm. They kept me in the Emergency department until 5:30am because they could not get my heart rate to stay down. Stony Brook nurse told me it was okay to get vaccine even though I was infected with COVID-19 ON 12/15/2020.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

                                                I had a slight headache the day of the vaccine, and some soreness in my arm. I woke up the next morning after not being able to sleep all night with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit coupled with profuse sweating and a stabbing headache. I took some Tylenol and drank a bunch of water and tried to go back to sleep ( Inhad woken up at 5:30). I was unsuccessful because I ended up having to vomit about 20 minutes later. Throughout the day, my temperature hovered between 99.5-100.4 even though I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen. The symptoms persisted all day and I only started to feel relief around 7 pm. I feel fine today, but I still have a bit of a headache and my left arm is still sore.

                                                I received my vaccine while I was at work around 1400. Around midnight I woke up shivering and could not get warm. My heart rate was elevated but that could have been related to my anxiety. I layered clothing on and finally managed to sleep. Upon waking up around 6 the next morning, I had a temperature of 102, a sore throat, throbbing headache, and was vomiting. My arm was so sore and swollen that I could hardly touch it. After rest, Tylenol, and fluids, I felt better around 8 that evening.

                                                Headaches, body aches, and fatigue started in the middle of the night on the 26th/in the early morning of the 27th around 2-3am. These continued throughout the day of the 27th until around 6pm when symptoms subsided. Slight fever also started around the same time, but stopped around 3-4pm of the 27th. I took 400mg of advil once at around 7:00am, and once again at 1:30pm. These helped alleviate some symptoms. At the end of the day on the 27th, most symptoms (except for sore arm) were gone!

                                                Right after getting the shot, I felt dizzy, had a sore arm, and my heart was beating too fast, for about an hour. At 9:30 the next morning, I developed a fever of 100.5 and body aches. Around 2 pm, I got a headache which felt like it was because blood was hitting the veins in my head really hard- I think that&#39;s high blood pressure? My blood pressure was 126/85. I read not to take medicine because it would make the vaccine less effective, but I had to take an aspirin at 8 pm because I couldn&#39;t handle the headache any more, and ever since, I&#39;ve just had a sore arm and a headache when I walk too fast (it&#39;s been two days after the shot now).

At work (noon), suddenly became very lightheaded, cold, sweaty,  experienced blackout vision around periphery and felt faint and nauseous. Threw up. Went home and had extreme chills and could not get warm. Nausea subsided around 6:00pm 1/27. Headache and neck soreness continues still today (1/30). Headache feels like pressure inside my head, pushing and causing dull pain at the base of my skull and top of neck.

A concerning side effect was that my resting HR was consistently above 105BPM from about 4:30AM-4PM the day after receiving the second dose. It reached as high as 125BPM without doing much movement at all to account for the high HR.

                                                Severe injection site pain (aching) approximately 3 hours after injection on 2/2. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 2200 to take the edge off of the pain in order to fall asleep. Beginning at 0600 on 2/3: Temp of 100 F, chills, body aches, headache. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 1000 which lowered temp and reduced other symptoms for approximately two hours. Symptoms returned at 1200 with temp reaching 100.2 F along with chills, headache, and body aches that were more intense in the shoulder/neck area. Used a heating pad along my back, shoulders, and neck which helped with the body aches. Slept from 1500 to 1800 and woke up with an intense frontal headache with pain shooting through my eyes as well. Temp was 100.7 F. Took 400 mg ibuprofen which made the symptoms more bearable. Tried to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Also had two servings of soup. Symptoms seemed to lessen by 2200. The only symptoms lingering today, 2/4, are a slight headache, fatigue, and mental fog. Otherwise, condition has improved tremendously.

My arm hurt and swelled up for a few days with a large red bump. After a few days the bump went away. Im still having headaches, ive had diarrhea from day 1. I already struggle with my bowels and go to the bathroom way to much already and after given the vaccine those next days and still days continuing after I cant stay out of the bathroom. In 6 hours i had over 7 to 10 bowel movements and I hadnt ate a thing. As i thought I was getting better I woke uo the next day with my throat swelled up and i was all congested like a cold my body is very tired very sore a very light cough formed as well too my breathing is ok so far, my body on the inside feels like its on fire but im cold on the outside, one minute i was cold them im burning up. Its making me very overwhelmed and my nerves are all over the place.

Paramedic onsite immediately listened to lungs and heard diffuse wheezing bilaterally. Within 1m minute patient felt throat tickling and then tightening and breathing was more difficult. Paramedic gave  patient EpiPen with resolution of symptoms in less than 1-2 minutes. Ambulance called and arrived very quickly. Patient was transported to  hospital. As way to hospital patient felt breathing getting worse again and was given solumedrol and benadryl IV and a second EpiPen. Don&#39;t yet know what happened beyond this.

Taking an aspirin alleviated most of the symptoms to where I was more functional. I did call into work and skip a meeting the day after.

I was back to normal after the weekend (about 3 days later). Some mild fatigue and feeling ?off? occurred as well during that 2.5 day period. Took some ibuprofen and that helped a little bit, otherwise just took it easy and recovered pretty quickly (relatively).

                                                The reaction is due to the SECOND dose in the series. I had a fever of 102.5 along with body aches, chills, etc, the day following the vaccine (2/9), but that resolved within 24 hours. The second day after was fine (2/10). The third day after I developed a deep red rash like pattern extending down my arm more than halfway down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was extremely high, just below the top of my shoulder and immediately below the body part of my shoulder, so the extent of the redness is ~6inches long.  It is extremely painful, warm to the touch, and slightly swollen. I went to the urgent care where I was diagnosed with cellulitis. I was prescribed doxycycline 100mg PO BID x5days. I am reporting this on the day of the reaction, and it is unknown how it will respond to the antibiotics or if it will get any worse.

He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

Symptoms would come and go throughout day, but were worse in the mornings. Wednesday (2/10) - Present (2/13) - same symptoms as Tuesday (2/9). Symptoms worse in the mornings and after physical exertion (going to school, walking stairs), and at night as well. Symptoms are not severe, but I am concerned that they have lasted a full week. I have been taking Day-Quil severe every 4 hours. I was also on my period, which just ended yesterday (2/12). I believe my period started the day of the vaccine.  I plan on going to a doctor&#39;s office, but have been too tired to move from my apartment.

That evening I had bad chills through the night and next morning. I took tylenol and got a low fever on 2/13. Lump was red and grew all day. Had low fever all day, increased to 101.6 in afternoon despite the Tylenol. Fatigue, headaches, and body aches. 2/14 I felt better in the morning. Headaches and fatigue still. Large red lump/swelling on arm (around 3 inches wide) at site of vaccination, arm still sore and painful to touch.

The first dose wasn?t too bad but this time I was vomiting so violently that there was a profuse amount of blood coming out for 3 hours. I?ve never experienced a migraine but I?ve had an extremely painful and debilitating migraine since 4am. Around 10am I was dry heaving and vomiting up bile. I have excruciating back pain since 10pm last night, horrible full body chills, fever of 102, skin, and light sensitivity.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

Around the time I went to bed, I began to experience fever and uncontrollable chills and weakness. Headache still persistent through the next day and symptoms persistent all throughout night. Was given ibuprofen to help reduce fever and was effective fairly quickly. I had lasting effects through to the next morning.

                                                Patient had what appeared to be a vasovagal reaction.  She complained of feeling light-headed and nauseous about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  This continued for a short time and she also began to complain of feeling chilled and was noticeably diaphoretic.  I monitored her blood pressure, which was low on the initial reading and then eventually came up to a reading of 89/60 with a pulse of 73 at the point that her symptoms began to subside.  By approximately 45 minutes after the episode began, she reported feeling better and was able to stand and walk without symptoms.  She went home at that time with a friend.

                                                About an hour or hour and half after getting  my vaccine, my head became all fuzzy as though I had just finished drinking three alcoholic drinks. I am not someone that can handle my alcohol very well so by that point I&#39;m really out of it. JUST TO BE CLEAR though I was NOT drinking alcohol. It&#39;s just a metaphor. I could not think clear and was having difficulty communicating beyond simple words. About 30 minutes after this all started, I made the decision to not drive for the rest of the day because I felt my reaction time had decreased substantially.  While all of the head stuff was happening, my arm was also hurting, which I expected. However, the pain didn&#39;t stay localized to my deltoid. Instead it radiated down my arm and into my hand. It felt as though my hand had been stabbed with a knife, so my entire arm hurt but the focal points were in my hand and the injection site. The next day the effects were gone but I had a headache. Not a bad headache but it wasn&#39;t localized to a single part of my head.

                                                At about 8:00PM the night I got the vaccine, I started having intense stomach pain and my head was pounding. I eventually threw up, and then I began experiencing chills and shivering while sweating. In total, I have thrown up around 7 times and I still have chills and a headache. I also have a sore throat and am extremely dehydrated. I can?t keep any food or medicine down and this is going on 24 hours straight with these symptoms.

As i came around the corner, I saw she was pale. she then fainted and I ran out the door.  a male customer caught her and eased her to the floor. i knelt beside her checking pulse and respirations. both WNL. after 10 seconds she came to with extreme sweating. i removed BOTH masks and pull her long hair away from her face to cool her off. got a cool wet paper towel and put on her forehead. i had her raise her legs against the wall to elevate.  her mom came in and said as a kid she fainted often due to a vasovagal overstimulation. her mom helped her to the chair and sat for a few more minutes. leaving at 12:20pm with her mom.

The person that went with me and also got vaccinated mentioned the same observation and his grandmother got a pretty severe urinary tract infection after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine. It may be a coincidence, but it seems odd that several of us noticed it. It isn&#39;t something that would be incredibly harmful to most people, but it probably should be mentioned anyway, so I figured I&#39;d report it regardless.

                                                She took a dose of aripiprazole 5mg immediately before receiving the vaccine. It caused her to have face tingle, which feels kind of heavy. She was able to drive home safely but feels extemely tired. I, the pharmacist, counseled her to skip her next dose and report to her psychiatrist immediately. Also recommended some bed rest for the next 24 to 48 hours with close supervision and to seek medical attention if any other symptoms appear.

                                                Nurse hit something in my arm when she gave me the shot, so she had to move it around in my arm in order to make the needle go in deeper. After vaccination, had fever, chills, fatigue for about 24 hours. About two weeks ago (the week of March 29th, 2021), I got an ache in my arm where the needle was injected. This has never happened before. The ache has happened two or three times since my vaccination. If I push on it, there is still soreness in the spot where the needle went into my arm as of today (4/12/2021). The injection spot has been sore ever since I got vaccinated. It does not seem to be going away or getting better. I am going to see my PCP to examine my arm.

Was unable to get myself out of bed until around 11AM after taking a nap. Used naproxen to bring the symptoms down to a manageable level, but despite taking 440 mg total (220 around 11am, 220 around 8pm), I was mostly bedridden throughout the day. I had very little energy, and moving too much caused dizziness. All symptoms lasted from 4AM on the day after the second dose until waking up the day after that.

I immediately fainted and I lost consciousness for 5 minutes, while unconscious I also was incontinent and peed myself. When I came to, I was disoriented for about 2 minutes and very cold.  -For a week after I fainted I was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up without feeling that I was going to faint.  -The second week after my shot I also felt pressure on my chest for 5 days that has since then gone away.  -Since I fainted 3 hours after my shot  I have experienced constant ringing in both ears that have not stopped for the past 30 days since I got the vaccine. I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

                                                Patient appeared anxious prior to vaccine administration.  When asked if she felt like she was going to pass out, patient advised she did not pass out from needles/shots before, but has fainted because of extreme anxiety; but did not feel like she would pass out at this time.  After shot was administered, pt. was more relaxed, and advised she was feeling ok.  Patient was ambulatory, with no complaints of light-headedness or adverse feelings, and walked to the observation area.  Approximately five minutes following vaccination, patient told companion that she did not feel good, and laid down on the floor.  She then experienced a syncopal episode.  Patient did not hit head, or have any injury as a result of the syncopal episode.  Patient was breathing normally, but was unresponsive for approximately 15-20 seconds.  Following episode, patient regained consciousness (COAx3), and was upset from incident, but confirmed no injury or other illness, following episode.  Patient was evaluated by EMTs on site, and was able to sit up and transfer from the ground, to a chair, and the chair to a wheel chair without issue.  Further evaluation was conducted by EMT on site.  Blood pressure was 110/80, SPO2 was 98% room air, and pulse was 66 at approximately 13:22 hours.  Patient laid on gurney/cot on-site for approximately 20 minutes, to rest, and to be monitored for additional side-effects.  During monitoring, patient advised the only thing she had eaten today was &#34;one peanut butter cup.&#34;  Patient was provided water and a juice box during monitoring time.  Patient was released from monitoring area at 13:45 hours, after she advised she was feeling ok.  She was wheeled into the parking area as a precaution, and left with her companion.  Patient was the passenger of the vehicle.

                                                Around 6:30, I started feeling dizziness and got a severe headache. After waking up from a nap that night around 9, I woke up to a 101.4 fever, itchy throat, dizziness, naseau, and a swollen, red circle around my injection site that was hot to the touch. I couldn&#39;t sleep due to pain and discomfort from my arm and fever. I woke up around 4:30, vomiting. I took Advil and Hydroxizine around 8 am to sleep, but it still didn&#39;t help as I woke up every 30 minutes. I had a fever of 101.3 and these same symptoms the whole day of 4/14. Before going to bed this night, my temperature was down to 100.3. I woke up the next morning (4/15) and my temperature was down to 99.4, so I went to work. I still had the symptoms of itchy throat, dizziness, and weakness. My arm was still swollen and sore too. Another symptom I thought was interesting that I had was waking up drenched in sweat this morning (4/16) and yesterday morning (4/15).  I even woke up through the night to put a fan on me at high speed and took my blankets off, yet still woke up sweating. Tonight, my temperature is back to normal, but I still have an itchy throat, some dizziness, and an itchy injection site.

                                                It started with a sorr arm and fatigue. The problem began after I was lying down in bed for 1 hr and 1/2. I laid down at 3:30am, but at 5am I was still awake and my left arm felt like it had fallen asleep. The problem was, I could not seem to wake it up. When I turned on my flashlight, I found that nearly all of the veins in my left hand were invisible, actually everything past the elbow on that side. I tried for about 10 mins while lying down to get blood flow back, but nothing was working. My face.felt very warm and the rest of my body felt very cold. When I finally got up to turn on my bedroom light, I found that all of my veins from my chest down were almost entirely invisible as well. I normally have very visible and easy to get blood from veins (except sometimes in my right arm), so this was very worrying to me. I got up and paced a little around my room to try and get blood flowing again, and I felt pretty shaky while doing this. My hands and feet would shake when I held them up. After about 5 minutes, I sat down on my bed because I did not feel well standing anymore, and I waited. Maybe 10 minutes later and things seem to be returning back to normal. I am still very tired but my whole body seems to have blood again. I am also currently on day 3 of my monthly cycle, but this has never happened in relation to that either.

                                                At the time of vaccination, patient experienced a vasovagal reaction of nausea, headache, near-fainting. After eating a snack and drinking water symptoms improved over about 1 hour and patient returned home. Pharmacist call to check on patient the next day, she said she was feeling better, not 100%, but Ok. Since then, she had a headache for 4 days and started having mental distress (out of body feeling, memory loss, and covid-like symptoms). She also states she has had excessive sweating since a week ago and feels very unstable on her feet. She went to a doctor who tested her for covid. It came back negative. The doctor advised if the symptoms continue to get worse, she should go to the hospital. She was at work today, we discussed all these things here. She said she couldn&#39;t even remember her name or walk straight. I told her she needed to go to the hospital ASAP and not to work the rest of her shift.

I had my mom check it and it wasn?t swollen but the day after I woke up and felt like something wasn?t quite right. I felt where my lymph nodes are near my clavicle and there were very swollen almost the size of a golf ball, my lymph node under my armpit was also quite swollen. I had a headache on the left side of my head and around my eye. My lymph node near my clavicle is still quite swollen but I?m feeling alittle better. I kept using a cold compress on my arm and lymph nodes as well as taking Tylenol. I did also have a slight fever of about 100 one night but it went away by the next day.

I felt like I wanted to lay on the floor and fall asleep. I went home around 12:15 and slept from 1pm to 5 am. The next day I felt out of it.  The day after my shot I had a large red lump on my arm in the area where I got my vaccine and it was very sore. This lasted a few days and the pain and redness went away.  Yesterday, 4/19/21, I woke up with a large red swollen circle around the injection site. It itches very bad and burns. The skin is very hot. Today on 4/20/21 a red ring appeared around the red circle. It is still very itchy and burning. The skin in this area is very hot. Only ice has helped with the pain.

If my skin touched the air in my room then that part of my body would ache due to the chills.  The next morning I still had a fever and went through cycles of chills and heat waves in my body.  I also had a lack of interest in food.

Following day, arm soreness extremely painful with some shoulder joint pain and pain any time upper arm muscle used. Slightly sore by second day post-injection without much discomfort.  Soreness completely subsided by third day post-injection. First day post-injection developed heavy fatigue at the beginning of the day (~8AM) followed by chills and then a fever a few hours after waking up. Thermometer was not used to detect fever.  Had slightly more energy and minimal chills by evening (~7PM).  Fever was subsiding (didn&#39;t feel as warm) but was still sweating pretty easily.  All fatigue, chills, &amp; fever gone by following day (second day post-injection).

                                                Administered the first Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. No apparent concerns were found when reviewing the PQCF and talking with the patient prior to administering the vaccine. Patient verbally stated she&#39;d never experienced a reaction immediately after receiving a vaccine and specifially referred to receiving flu shots annually. Vaccine was administered at 15:02, and the patient was seated in the designated &#34;Post-vaccine waiting area&#34; located directly in front of the pharmacy windows. At 15:04 patient began to feel nauseated with flacial flushing. CPhT was monitoring the patient. At 15:06, the patient began to exhibit s/s of syncope, including: facial flushing, profuse sweating, nausea, weakness, coldness of extremities, and visual disturbances. At 15:06, the patient&#39;s face/lips began to lose color while stating she was dizzy. Under her own power with aid, the patient was gently transferred from the chair to the floor and placed in the supine position with both feet propped up on the chair. She was given an ice pack and paper towels and remained on the floor for approximately 14 minutes. At 15:21, the patient stated she felt much better and wanted to try to sit up. After monitoring the patient for 34 minutes, she left the pharmacy area under her own power stating she felt much better and still plans on getting the second vaccine. Patient was counseled and questions were answered regarding this reaction.

Noticed my chronic back pain (L5 fracture) was very bad, but didn?t initially connect it to the vaccine.   By 4:00 I was running a fever, fatigue, shivering, sweating, could not eat due to lack of appetite / nausea. Could not think straight.   The night of the 22nd (day I received 2nd dose of vaccine) I had difficulty sleeping, heart palpitations, and extremely strange dreams when I did sleep. The next morning (23rd)  I felt much better, even walked around for a bit, but by noon I was back to having sever symptoms. My fever spiked, my energy was drained, and my back pain was unbearable.   This progressed over the afternoon into unbearable tooth pain along with the back pain and other symptoms. Back pain did not recede with rest as it normally does. Ibuprofen did not seem to mitigate symptoms much.  Brain fog was intense and I could not focus on anything.   Managed to sleep last night and had more vivid dreams. Woke up feelings fine but symptoms seem to be slowly returning.

                                                14 hours after my second dose I became nauseous and threw up yellow bile intermittently (about 5 separate times, each retching fit lasting 5 minutes) until 12:30pm. My primary care physician prescribed Zofran helped curb the vomiting. I also had a fever of 103.1 for half an hour before it subsided to 100, body aches, sweating, chills, headache, and nausea. Today, 4/28 over 24 hours after my vaccine, I started presenting a swelling on my right hand that is itchy and discolored, although the side effects from the day before have lessened to a certain degree.

                                                It feels like I have every possible symptom. After receiving my first dose of Moderna, I had ?covid arm? with a big red welt that then turned into a big itchy rash on the side of my left arm. After my second shot, I immediately felt dizzy, fatigued, and just generally unwell. The next morning, I developed the worst nausea, fever, chills, and diarrhea. My fever increased over the span of about 6 hours until it reached 102 degrees. After the fever broke, I still had a horrible headache but felt so much better. Unfortunately, the fever has come back on the second night post-vaccine and I am at 100 degrees again.

About 48 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, the same arm became exceptionally sore, both on the bicep and the inside of the arm. I could not let it relax at my side, since that was painful, and I couldn&#39;t rotate my shoulder in any way without extreme pain. The next day, the pain cleared up but there was a large visible bruise around where the Nexplanon implant was located in my left arm. I think the immune response in my left arm affected the implant and created a more painful experience than usual.

These spells lasted for a couple of hours but after a few days became more chronic and was matched with fatigue, tightness of chest, headaches, and brain fog.  Impaired ability to complete every day tasks. Began presenting with capilliarities in mid April, along with easy bruising/bleeding and elevated liver enzymes (the enzymes began to stabilize over the following week).  All of these symptoms have persisted (currently May 4th).

I was driving home and had started moving my arm around some to work out the soreness.  A few minutes later I got really nauseated and started fading out of it.  I pulled over, put my  car in park, and put my hazards on. I passed out for 5-10 minutes. It was not just falling asleep but actually going unconscious. When I woke up I was covered in sweat and was very nauseated.   I had a friend come pick me up (obviously it was unsafe for me to drive). I have continued to feel a little woozy and nauseated (about three hours now after the injection). I also have cold sweats come on and off and I feel very tired.   I was well hydrated, not hungry (had eaten semi-recently), and well rested when I went to get the vaccine.

Stood up to take my temperature and almost fainted (had to sit back down on bed, my ears were ringing and vision was grayed out, I may have been unconscious for a second or two). I was sweating and shaking from that, and went to the toilet and threw up a little bit. Dizziness/faintness persisted when standing until around 9 am.

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

                                                Adverse effects lasted 8 hours (until about 6AM). Significant discomfort throughout the night, restless sleep, woke up multiple times. Started having extreme fatigue (really difficult to move around) and then I started having something that felt like sinus pressure/pain. Headache began from the middle of my forehead and went around the sides and back. Got really cold, then got really hot while going to bed. Continued feeling very hot (feverish) throughout the night. Felt like the flu. When I woke up I felt relatively fine other than being fatigued for the entire day.

I knew the fever was a possible side effect, but it got very bad very quickly. I had to call off of work because I could not stay awake and was in so much pain. My fever has lowered 2 days after vaccination, but has not fully gone down.  Also, my neck on the side that my vaccine was administered (the left arm) is very swollen and very painful. I cannot lift my arm and there is a noticeable difference between my left and my right neck in regards to swelling.

                                                Was fine until I stood up at approximately 9:30pm. Immediately got very fatigued, head started hurting. Bent over to pick something up and my back hurt around where my lungs are; it hurt to breathe. Within 15 minutes I could barely stand up. After about an hour of the symptoms intensifying, I started to get a low grade fever. I took something for the symptoms (alka seltzer daytime pill), but went to bed shortly. I started waking up off and on around 6 (I normally sleep in until noon). At 7am, I woke up feeling like I was on fire. I grabbed my thermometer from my nightstand- it read 104 degrees Fahrenheit. I tried to open my medicine but I was so weak I couldn?t do it myself. I walked downstairs and woke my mom up. She took my temperature and it read 103 since I was no longer in my bed warmed by my body heat. She opened my nighttime alka seltzer and gave it to me along with 800 mg ibuprofen. I went to bed with nothing but a sheet and a cooling pillow. At some point my mom came in and handed me my water but I don?t remember it, however it helped cool me down when I fell asleep with it in my bed. When I woke up at 11, my fever was only 100 and it was the only symptom I had. When I got out of bed at 1, I was fever free. I?ve been fatigued the rest of the day but the fever hasn?t returned and I?ve been taking 325 acetaminophen every 4 hrs.

                                                There was a delayed reaction starting 7 days after first dose. Symptoms included redness and soreness at the site of injection and swollen lymph nodes in the armpit of the arm where the shot was injected. 12 hours after receiving the second dose I was shaking, nauseated, dizzy, sweating one minute and freezing the next, pain all over the body, my breathing slowed down and lastly there was a loud deafening ringing in my ears. These symptoms lasted a frightening 10 or so minutes leaving behind the bodily aches.

Vomiting, despite having nothing in my stomach to vomit, and a peak fever of 102F at about 3am. Whole body aches, probably made worse by the intense shivering, are continuing as I type.

Have been vomiting now for more or less 10minutes (all of what I ate during dinner).   Other symptoms include slight headache, feeling slightly warm although I have not checked my temperature and also at the same time slightly cold, and pain in the right arm.   On the previous dose the only symptom I had was pain in my left arm (I switched sides this time around although don?t think that is relevant)

                                                Around 3 the following morning. I woke up to an extreme headache and muscle aches in my hips. I tried to go to work that morning but ended up going home due to felling weak like I could pass out. The muscle pain lasted all weekend. The worse pain is the shot location, hips, and knees. I would have hot and cold flashes. Extreme sweating.

She was advised to sit for her entire 15 minute observation period which she did. After 15 minutes, she went to the front store where I&#39;m told she passed out twice, hitting her head at least one of those times. By the time I was alerted, she was responsive. I tried to keep her laying down, but she sat up and began vomiting. I was unable to get a BP reading before EMS arrived.

She denied further medical assistance and reported that she felt well enough to go home. She had a husband waiting at home to watch her, and she was counseled on s/s that she should go to the hospital for.  She was contacted the next day to check on her, but she was not available. She was contacted on 6/14 to check on her, and her husband reported that she felt better soon after her shot, and has had no other side effects since the original sore/scratchy throat.

I felt kind of flushed and tried and dizzy. Then the dizziness got a lot worse the next day. I was extremely dizzy to the point where I couldn&#39;t drive for a week. Also I started having ringing in my ears which is still present. Since then I&#39;ve had a number of other symptoms that have sort of come and gone. I&#39;ve noticed they have gotten bad my second half of my menstrual cycle. Iv had muscle spasms and nerve pain. My left leg felt like it was on fire for a while. Otherwise of yet I&#39;ve just felt like I&#39;ve had lower energy than normal and had more headaches.

Body hurt a lot, fever of 100.7, arm is hard, hot, and red. Spot around injection site is growing. Took too Tylenol around 10am to make it possible for me to work. Chills became mild and temp dropped to 99.6 for most of the time I was taking Tylenol. 24 hours after the symptoms started they went from severe to moderate (without the use of Tylenol). Was able to sleep last night. No chills but still had a low fever 100.6 woke up today and my body hurts. Temp was 99.3 at 10am. By 4pm 2 days after getting the vaccine my are is still very hot to the touch, red, and hard. It does not look better. Back to normal temp 96.6 and body hurts in the mild range.

                                                I received the vaccine at 11:30am. About a half hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt dizziness and very slight chest tightness. I took benadryl, and was relieved of these symptoms. Then, around 9pm that night, I developed a fever. The highest temperature I recorded was 101.9. I took Ibuprofen around 11pm, and was afebrile by 3am. I have not had any fevers since, and I did have to call off work New Year&#39;s day. I have had an intermittent, mild headache since receiving the vaccine as well,  but overall I feel fine.

                                                I woke up and my shoulder was very itchy. I looked under my sleeve and there was a rash. The itchiness and rash are new today, however a lump has been present since injection. The rash is directly above the lump. It may be unrelated, but I&#39;ve also been unusually drowsy (noticed before taking the benedryl).  I took benedryl and applied lotion to the rash. My pregnancy began July 4th and I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the vaccine. My estimated due date is March 25th, 2021. At the time of the adverse reaction, I am 29 weeks pregnant.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

                                                First symptom was pain in my arm. Then I spiked a low grade fever. Then I got nauseous. Around 7pm I vomited and at 3:30 am I aggressively dry heaved. Throughout the whole time my arm was in pretty serious pain and still is. I woke up this morning and my fever got worse. Nausea still but so far no vomiting.

Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

                                                Starting around 8 pm on 1/6 I developed a headache and body aches. I took Tylenol which seemed to help my symptoms. At 2:30 AM (1/7) I was awoken with shivering chills, likely a fever. Fever was not confirmed until 8 AM (1/7) when my temperature was taken - 101.3F. I alternated Advil and Tylenol with minimal improvement. At 2 PM (1/7)  my temperature was still elevated at 100.8 F. Overall I was very fatigued and had a pounding headache in addition to chills. My fever broke around 7 PM (1/7), at which point my headache and chills were improving. By the next morning, my symptoms were mostly resolved, except for a mild headache which persisted throughout the day (1/8) but resolved by evening time.

After one hour, developed skin sensitivity and muscle aches. At this time temperature reading 100.4. After two additional hours of rest and hydration all symptoms intensified and temperature now reading 100.6. Symptoms and fever persisted for a total of roughly 12 hours with fatigue lasting the entirety of the following day.  Was not able to attend work due to severity of symptoms.

                                                Patient only had muffin and coffee that day early in am. Had some arm pain after shot no other reaction.  Did go home felt some nausea . Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                The day of the vaccine about 4 hours later, I started experiencing chest pain. It was not tightness or a heartburn feeling type of chest pain. I have asthma, and it is the type of chest pain I start feeling right before I get bronchitis, almost like breathing in mist and the irritation that comes from having a cough, but I had not had a cough that would have caused this sensation. The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection. Ibuprofen helps the headache slightly but makes the pressure in my head feel worse and makes the joints in my hands and forearms hurt and my fingers swell for some reason which has never happened before for me when taking ibuprofen.

At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

Throughout the night arm pain got progressively worse and could not sleep due to extreme  pain and inability to move through range of motion, in addition to night sweats.  (did not have a fever). Woke up the next morning with a severe headache and nausea. Fainted around 10am (18 hours post vaccination). Headache and minor dizziness continued throughout the rest of the day.  By 24 hours post vaccine, no symptoms besides very minimal arm soreness.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

I had not felt great from the moment I got up on Sunday, and felt progressively worse throughout the day. I had really bad body aches and chills, to the point where I was shivering, even with three layers and a puffy coat on. I normally never get cold. I also had a really bad headache. By the time my shift was over at 1pm, I wasn?t even sure I could trust myself to drive home. Eventually I decided it was fine, but by the time I got home I felt so terrible that it took me at least 15 minutes to get out of the car. I took a hot shower and went to bed. I was shivering violently, even with lots of blankets, and couldn?t even sit up to drink some water. I laid in bed for hours, doing absolutely nothing and feeling miserable. I got up after 7:00 pm to eat some dinner and felt so nauseous that I was dry-heaving into the toilet.

                                                Moderate pain in injection site for first two days (02/02/2021, 02/03/2021). Nausea, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat, low-grade fever (~99°F) and persistent headache, and took Theraflu nighttime before bed on day two (02/03/2021). Temperature of 99.7°F throughout day three (02/04/2021); also, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat with swollen lymph nodes and tonsils with white spots (did at-home test for strep-A, got a negative result), and persistent headache?this night I also took Theraflu nighttime. Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

After 2nd shot on 02/06/21, I had most symptoms listed. I got the 2nd dose at 9:03am and once I woke up from a nap at 1pm, most of the side effects had already started. I had severe pain at the injection site where I was unable to dress myself or do normal activities, severe muscle pain and soreness, severe chills, a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a mild headache, severe dehydration that remained throughout the day and night even though I drank almost 2 gallons of water, stomach pain and bloating, and nausea and vomiting that occurred in the middle of the night at 2am, and extreme fatigue. Even though I had fatigue, I was unable to sleep due to the pain. I finally took pain medicine at 8am on 2/07/21 to help myself go to sleep as well since I was awake for over 24 hours. I slept for 6 hours and woke up still having chills, muscle soreness, a slight fever, a mild headache, and pain at the injection site where I am still unable to lift my left arm and put clothes on.

The majority of these symptoms started around 12 hours after the vaccination, with fever, chills, headache and dizziness being the most prominent. Ibuprofen (200mg) was taken about 18 hours in (as was advised to only take within the first 24 hours). Most of the symptoms are gone now after 24 hours of vaccination and taking ibuprofen. While most other symptoms are gone, there is still continued fatigue, and slight headache and nausea.

                                                I am almost a licensed pharmacist so I am aware of what was going on with my body* I started with a sore arm and fatigue on the day of vaccination. The following morning I woke up and got dressed and used the restroom. I proceeded downstairs to make my coffee.  As I was doing so I became dizzy and nauseous. I sat down on the floor and then I lost my vision and hearing. I broke out in a profuse sweat and had no concept of time. My boyfriend was with me and said it took 5-10 minutes before I began to normalize. I apparently had shallow breathing and turned pale white including my lips, I slowly regained awareness although I never fully lost consciousness. 911 was called and paramedics arrived. by this time I had begun to normalize with most of my vision returning. I ended up declining to see medical attention because I normalized and told the paramedics I would seek attention if it came back.  * please note the physician listed is my PCP but I was not seen for this reaction.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

                                                Friday morning I woke up extremely fatigued. I saw stars in my vision and I had to lay in bed all day. I didn?t have energy to even eat. Saturday evening or Sunday morning I noticed red splotches along my torso. Sunday they began to itch and I still have them along my neck, back, upper and lower torso, and a few on my legs. I haven?t changed any environmental factors (no new lotions, creams, hair products, diet, or perfumes). Today I used Benadryl cream, but in the past I?ve been putting my regular, non-scented Aveno lotion and coconut oil.

Over the next few days, I became incredibly itchy and developed a rash on both of my arms. I now have what I think is considered, &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. There is a red circle around the injection site that is swollen, red, and tender. I then noticed the inside of my mouth was sore and I had blisters developing on the roof of my mouth near my gums. My throat is super sore and swollen and has a yellow pocket on the back of my throat. I am also having body aches under my arms near my ribs and back.

                                                Around 5 minutes after they administered the second dose of the COVID vaccine, my throat started to feel heavy.  Afterwards, they put an oximeter in my index finger and I think it was a little high (I am not sure). They took me to a separate room and checked my breathing. It got better several minutes later and they gave me 15 mg of Benadryl. Then, the EMT took me to the hospital for observation. At 4:36, they gave me prednisone in the hospital and at 4:49, they gave me famotidine. I was still feeling the tightness in the throat and chest, accompanied with mild pain, but it was better than before. They kept me in the ER for observation until around 7:30 pm.

I administered ammonia inhalant was used within 1-2 minutes of her LOC, and patient gained consciousness but was diaphoretic and pale.  Within 2 minutes of the ammonia inhalant, she began convulsing (full body convulsions, eyes rolled)  For 30-45 seconds.  She had continued LOC for 1-2 minutes, 15L O2 mask was administered, and patient slowly came in and out of consciousness for the next 5-10 minutes, bradycardic 35-45 bpm, BP 72/50, HR irregular, RR 16 BS clear.  At the time of observed convulsions, 911 was called and arrived within 10-12 minutes.  When EMS arrived, she remained pale but with some improved pallor, HR 45 bpm, and more alert.  Transported by EMS to hospital for eval.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

                                                Received her Moderna vaccine on March 12 at approximately 5pm.  Within moments her arm and face began to itch.  The nurse administered Benadryl.  The symptoms did not go away or worsen so she left when released.  Around 7 the symptoms had progressed to tongue feeling heavy, sore throat, and some difficulty breathing (although her O2 fluctuated between 96-99).  She went to the ER, they administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroids.  Within a couple hours the symptoms had subsided.  As directed, we continued Benadryl and Pepcid for 24 hours.  After being off the Benadryl and Pepcid for 12 -15 hours the symptoms returned, she took one dose of both and now seems to be fine.

Arm was very sore, hot to the touch, and swollen for nearly 3 weeks following the injection.  Second shot on 3/5 R arm, also developed a small red rash but was smaller and went away within a week. Within 24 hours of getting the vaccine, a high fever developed, fatigue, weakness, nausea, pain throughout my body, and migraines.

Muscle pain was mainly in the shoulders (more on the side of the injection), lower back, and in the legs. Lasted through the night and took a Tylenol 500mg tablet that next morning (3/18). Symptoms improved slightly, but did not got away and got a little worse as the day progressed (but still improved from the morning).

                                                The day after I had a dull headache and pain at the injection site. I also had a slight body ache. This progressed as the day went on. The headache became a severe migraine and extreme body aches. Symptoms are somewhat relieved today, but are still bothersome to the point of having to miss a day of work.

The next morning, I had a severe tightening of the left side of my neck and shoulder, along with arm soreness. I saw my Physical Therapist and was told that it was a result of the vaccine. I was fine until I got the vertigo Friday evening. It came on really quickly and I&#39;ve never experienced it before. I was okay the next morning with the exception of a headache, which lasted for about a month after that. My doctor offered shots for them, but I couldn&#39;t take them due to my current meds. I was told to come back if they continue.

                                                Patient reported no to having prior history of fainting or dizziness after receiving vaccine. Vaccine was administered at approximately 9:04 am and patient&#39;s boyfriend was administered at approximately 9:08. Upon return to his seat beside her at approximately 9:10 am, he noticed she was losing color and going limp. He called for help, and I assisted. The pharmacy team sent a Code White on the radio and several members of management responded to check on the scene. We moved the patient to the floor and applied ice packs to the neck and chest and removed her face mask for better circulation. The patient was wearing a thick sweatshirt so we attempted to increase air flow around her head and neck to cool her down as she was visibly sweating. The patient never lost consciousness or breathing and her pulse was always palpable. By 9:20 am, we had moved the patient from the floor to a sitting position then to a chair and provided her with a cold bottle of water and continued one ice pack on her neck. She stayed seated until 9:40 (34 minutes after her injection). She denied the need for an ambulance transport as she had her boyfriend here who could drive her.

Some mild confusion and dizziness (though I have been experiencing cognitive issues for over a year now. I believe the fever is exasperating pre-existing symptoms). Some mild nausea and a mild headache. I am not completely back to normal yet (as of 7pm) but I do believe I will be fine as time goes on.

                                                On Sunday, March 28th, I started experiencing intense nausea past noon. About twenty minutes later, I started to vomit, and couldn&#39;t stop. In less than an hour, I had vomited over 8 times. I couldn&#39;t drink water (let alone hold any liquid down) before the next vomiting episode. I started to see blood in my vomit after the 2nd time (the doctors say this was due to my stomach aggressively contracting and causing little tears in the muscles). Around 1:30 p.m., my mother took me to the ER to get fluids and anti-nausea medication (magnesium oxide, sodium chloride, lactated ringers, and zofran). After my puking episodes stopped, I was discharged from the hospital and was prescribed more ondanestron (which I&#39;ve used again at home after feeling nauseous again). Other than these symptoms, I have also experienced muscle aches, chills, and a very sore arm. I understand that nausea/vomiting is a reported side effect with Moderna for some people, but considering I&#39;ve never experienced this symptom in any other vaccine (and never vomited back to back so quickly in a short period of time) I figured I would report my symptoms.

About 5 pm I vomited up all my food. I also started having very bad diarrhea. I puked again about 7 pm after eating a few crackers and drinking water. Then puked four more times between 8pm and 11pm with absolutely nothing in my stomach. I continued having bad diarrhea during this same time. I also got cold chills during this time too. I was intensely nauseous and couldn?t keep my eyes open. I went to the Emergency room around 11pm and they gave me an IV with Saline and nauseous medicine. I went home around 1 am. On Sunday I proceeded to be slightly nauseous and have had a constant headache from Sunday and still have it today on Tuesday. But I  am just starting to more solid foods.  Had diarrhea until Monday afternoon. And haven?t pooped since.

                                                The night of my vaccine, I had a 100 degree fever, body aches, and chills.  That was resolved by the next day.  On 3/29, I woke up with itchiness behind my right ear.  around 4:30pm on the same day, I had broken out into hives on my face and arms.  By 5:30 they had become itchy and had spread to my neck and chest area.  I had also developed swelling around my eyes, above and below them.  I woke up at 1:30am on 3/30 with itching and burning and more swelling around my eyes.  At 7:30am on 3/30,  my eyes were almost swollen shut and I sought medical attention.  I had itching and burning on my entire body, swollen eyes, full body aches, and joint pain.  I was prescribed steroids and began that course around 1:30pm.  I was also prescribed two epi pens.  Around 6:30pm that night, I had a 100.7 degree fever.  It dropped without the use of a fever reducer within the next two hours. The swelling reduced around my face by 8pm.  This morning, I had almost no swelling, but still a full body rash.  I am treating it with benadryl, zyrtec and maximum strength pepcid, steroids, and calamine lotion.

                                                That night after I got the shot, I started getting muscle pains throughout my body and extreme fatigue. That night, I had really disturbing vivid dreams and kept waking up, and feeling feverish (my head feels warm), fatigue, strong head pain, muscle pain throughout, and very strong pain at my injection site.

                                                I woke up at 1;00 with a rapid heart rate - it was up to 140. I got up and took my temperature - 102.8. I started with taking ibuprofen. I went back to bed. Got really nauseous; started vomiting; started having diarrhea. By 5:00 am, my fever still had not gone down and I took some Tylenol. Temperature still hadn&#39;t gotten down at all at 08:00. I went to my Urgent Care clinic - I was really dehydrated and My vital signs were not looking well 101.9. They gave me two liters of fluid with IV Zofran to help with nausea. I was there for four hours with the IV the whole time. They released me with a prescription for Zofran. I went home and slept the rest of the day. I continued to take Tylenol.  I didn&#39;t have any vomiting and nausea after that. I was completely fine on the 25th.  I was having at least one headache a day for two weeks after that which is not normal for me. I started having heart palpitations and chest pressure within a few days of being in the URGENT CARE. Once I went back to work (after a couple of days off) I started having  3 - 6 occurrences of heart palpitations and chest pressure  a day-    I saw a  2/22/2021 cardiologist - 140&#39;s that day - the heart monitor came back and everything seemed fairly normal. I have a follow up appt with cardiologist on 4/26/2021.  I am still having  heart palpitations and chest pressure but very few - not as often at all as it use to be.

It went away after a while and came back worse later that night. My tongue began to itch and I had a rash on some areas. I immediately took 2 benadryls. When I woke up the next morning, the itching was gone. My arm was sore, and I was just tired.

On Monday following the vaccine (4 days after the vaccine) I began feeling joint pain / stiffness at night. I thought it was from skiing  for 3 days after the vaccine but it did not go away. It got worse and I began feeling joint / muscle pain throughout my body, especially in the morning and night. When I wake up in the morning it still hurts to roll over. Once I am up and moving for the day and take ibuprofen I start to feel a bit better, but overall I feel very painful joint and muscle pain daily.

                                                Fatigue on 4/1/21 that became very noticeable around 2:45 pm. General muscle soreness/aches on 4/1/21 and a bit on 4/2/21. Left shoulder sore and uncomfortable to move through full range of movement from 4/1/21 afternoon until afternoon of 4/3/21. Soreness did noticeable die down as time passed.  Discomfort/muscle tightness starting around 3:00 pm 4/6/21 in the left axillary region. No swelling/redness/rash visible on surface. Discomfort most noticeable when stretching arm forwards/backwards or squeezing upper arm against side. Squeezing arm to side results in a feeling similar to if someone were trying to hold a marble in their armpit.   4/8/21 woke up still with arm pit discomfort and a return of the discomfort in the out shoulder muscle where the vaccine was administered.

Manifested no additional or worsening symptoms so she went home and 8 hours after felt flu like symptoms for 79 hours.

                                                Within 30 seconds of the injection of my second dose of Moderna, I experienced extreme nausea unlike any that I have experienced before. Within 1 minute of the injection, my face, arms, chest, and neck flushed and I turned completely red. I felt hot and started to sweat. At the same time, I began having trouble breathing with the sensation that my throat was beginning to close. My eyes filled with tears and I was not able to talk to communicate what was happening. My mom, who was with me at the time of vaccination, asked the administering pharmacist if I could remove my mask because I was having trouble breathing. Throughout this reaction, the pharmacist froze and was visibly in shock of what was happening. Because of this, my mom began asking me questions to figure out what else I was experiencing. Once I was able to remove the mask and breathe deeply, the reaction subsided after two minutes. The pharmacist, after my reaction began to subside, stated that they had an epipen ready to administer if needed. I was never administered the epipen. The pharmacist asked me to wait 30 minutes instead of the general 15 minutes before leaving the site. Because the symptoms went away and did not return within the 30 minutes, I left the site. After the vaccination, I experienced a low-grade fever for 79 hours, chills, a headache, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue. After realizing my reaction was not considered ?normal,? I began to research and realized these symptoms align with anaphylaxis, even though they subsided quickly after experiencing them.

Very tired throughout day, headache lasted most of day. Tried to get out of bed to do laundry but was too lightheaded to finish and had to go sit down. Cold pack on forehead was only treatment I used. The next day fever was gone but still very tired - tried to go outside for a walk but turned around quickly due to nausea / tiredness. Back at work on day 3 and feeling totally fine.

Ibuprofen 600mg was taken twice, 5 hours apart, which improved symptoms. I felt feverish, but temperature peaked at 99.9F, although this was after the first course of ibuprofen. The following day, symptoms were significantly improved with some persistent body aches and intermittent chills.

Muscle stiffness - started an hour after vaccine and lasted about 48 hours, no pain medication or stretching helped, caused sleep issues due to not being able to get comfortable.

Concurrent medical conditions included Psoriasis. Concomitant products included USTEKINUMAB (STELARA) for Psoriasis.    On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced COELIAC ARTERY COMPRESSION SYNDROME (Celiac artery was compressed) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MALAISE (feeling sick) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VOMITING (did not stop throwing up) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and NAUSEA (nauseated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, COELIAC ARTERY COMPRESSION SYNDROME (Celiac artery was compressed), MALAISE (feeling sick) and NAUSEA (nauseated) outcome was unknown and VOMITING (did not stop throwing up) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       She gave her stool sample on 12 Apr 2021 and result will take 1 to 2 weeks, she was still throwing up on and off and she was not 100% better. She took ondansetron to treat her vomiting and nausea. She was concerned if she can she take 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine and what would happen if she miss the time limit.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

Never have had issues with shots before  - heart rate noticeably accelerated during 15 minute waiting period post-vaccination  - a couple of hours later, uncontrollable shaking and teeth chattering with accelerated heart rate. All of a sudden went away - Thursday 4/15, could barely move arm and feeling of accelerated heart rate. A lot of discomfort from these sensations - Friday 4/16, pain in arm alleviated but heart rate still accelerated and pangs of pain in head. At night, numbness/tingling warmth in left hand and random shooting pain in area of left foot, ankle and shins.

                                                Onset of pretty severe neck and upper back pain that made it difficult to sleep because I was unable to find a position that didn&#39;t cause any pain about 12 hours after injection (inj: 12:45 pm on 4/16/21; onset: 12:30 am on 4/17/21). Saturday, 4/17/21, the pain lessened and I just felt a bit of fatigue and injection site pain. Sunday night (4/18/21) going into Monday morning (4/19/21) I was woken up from my sleep with very severe upper neck pain that radiated down the R-side of my back, on the muscle. I could not fall back asleep for 2 hours because any position I was in I experienced intense pain. Today, 4/19/21, during the day, the pain is definitely less severe. I took my meloxicam this morning as I usually do but it was still pretty bad pain so I rubbed CBD cream on it. Pain still feels dull but tense, with occasional flare-ups of sharp pain. Today it is more widespread, across my shoulders and in the bilateral upper back area. When I rubbed the CBD cream on it, it hurt to touch. I also take gabapentin at night, which is my standard for my fibromyalgia, and I&#39;m not sure if that is what is exacerbating this pain, seeing as it is so much worse at night. I have never woken up from pain before like I did last night, and I deal with pain daily with fibromyalgia. It was very intense.

                                                Had my shot at noon on 4/19, and around midnight or shortly after (at 1am-ish on 4/20) I had really terrible chills and was shaking, but my forehead felt hot, I felt quite nauseous, and I had a headache. I got out of bed and took my temperature using a thermometer and it was 100.6 degrees. Continued to feel bad until falling asleep around 3am, woke back up at 6am and took my temperature again and it was still feverish at 99.8 degrees. Woke up once more briefly at 11am but did not take temperature and fell back asleep. Finally woke up for the day at 3pm and fever had broken, temp was back down to normal at 98.5. Still felt a little nauseous but that was probably more from not having eaten all day! Now as of 4/21 I am back to normal. (If it helps for further info, I have also not to my knowledge contracted Covid before, and I had no adverse effects other than a very sore arm from my first shot. The second shot my arm was less sore but of course I was distracted by being actually sick. Also possible data to note is that the second shot felt like it hurt less and I got an unusual new bandaid type the pharmacist called an inject safe barrier bandage.)

The next day I noticed my body was achy, nothing too terrible, but there was some discomfort as well as feeling like my energy was completely depleted. By the evening the aches became terrible and I had also had chills badly. I had at some dinner, was fine at the time, woke up mid night and was extremely nauseous and ended up throwing up. By the middle of the night I had woke up completely drenched in sweat. Next day after I am fine, but still slightly achy.

Briefly this is a 23 yo female with unremarkable PMHx; Meds- OCPs; Allergies- PCN and Gluten. Pt received the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 12:25 PM with RN. Per RN report the patient informed her that she had a remote history of &#34;passing out&#34; after a vaccine as a child, but it had not happened recently.  The RN observed the patient at her vaccine station for 3 min then accompanied her to the observation area.  Per report of COVID-19 Patient Observer, pt was seen falling out of her chair in a seated position and it was unclear if she hit her head.  Per a witness, pt hit her head on the computer cart that was nearby.  The COVID-19 Patient Observer called for assistance and 911 was called.  She was immediately evaluated by COVID-19 Patient observer and RN and noted to be unresponsive initially.  The RN reported that she opened her eyes and became verbally responsive to verbal stimuli and touch.  Upon my arrival, pt was noted to be responsive and lying on floor on her abdomen.  She initially denied pain, but later complained of pain at crown of her head to touch.  Pt denied CP, HA, SOB, difficulty breathing, pruritis, rash, nausea, or visual disturbances.  Orthostatics were obtained (lying- 124/90-102; sitting- 137/81-115; Standing 123/87 - 96).  Patient maintained her O2 sat at 98% throughout the evaluation.  She was assisted to wheelchair and reported feeling better.

                                                After the first dose (end of March), I had a large red rash at the injection site which lasted almost two weeks.  After my second dose (April 20), I had an intense reaction. I was up most of the night freezing cold, leg hair standing on end, and body aching. Had to take a hot shower to cope with the chills. I finally fell asleep for two hours and woke up in hot sweats and an intense headache. I was fine by the afternoon, but developed a new and unusual symptom around 1pm -- sharp localized pains that would intermittently shoot through random parts of my body (mostly legs, but also arms and midsection). They were so bad I would keel over while standing and gasp. Each day since, they have lessened in intensity, but are still somewhat present (it is 11pm on April 26, one week later). Now, I have what I would describe as subtle, localized cramps (?) in random areas (calves, thigh, tricep, back) that come and go -- more of an ache-y sensation but widespread across my body. It is nothing I have experienced before, and only started after the vaccination.

                                                About 24 hours after first Moderna Vaccine, on 3/3/21, pt developed fatigue, body aches and vaginal ulcerations/sores. These continued to worsen and spread to a lesser extent to face, upper chest and back on 3/4/21 at which time she was seen in my clinic. Lesions appeared consistent with HSV although was difficult to explain chest/back lesions. Swabs for herpes and shingles completed. Lesions continued to worsen and pt soon developed oral sores. She was admitted to hospital on 3/6/21 and tested for mono, herpes, etc. White count was elevated but no infectious source identified. Treated with rocephin and azithromycin although GC/CT negative. Lesions resolved on their own. Fatigue and body aches have slowly improved.

Within 30 minutes, I was vomiting and went from being hot to shivering from chills. I didn?t  have a temperature reader, but I was fairly certain I was suffering from a fever. I continued to vomit and shake from chills until approximately 10am after taking Tylenol. From 10am to 11pm, I suffered from fatigue and body aches. I woke up at 11am 5/3/21 feeling no longer suffering from side effects. In addition to side effects after the vaccine, I was also suffering from head cold symptoms (sore throat, coughing, congestion). I had these symptoms start 4/30/21, so I tested for COVID-19 that day and my results came back negative.

Felt chills. This lasted from the morning after the first dose, and has gotten better due to receiving medical attention in the emergency room, I needed two IV?s and Tylenol with codine. They did blood work and a CT scan on my head and chest, and I received Azithromycin to treat the chest pain. I am feeling slightly better, however there have been occasional pangs of pain on my head (right side), and a persistent dull chest pain that is on and off. I also had some break outs on my back, and my back still aches and my bones crack more often than usual. I am also dealing with drowsiness and some nausea. On 05/02/2021 they kept me in the emergency room until nearly 10pm.

However, I took Tylenol (650mg) preemptively because of my experience with the first dose. This may have affected onset time and severity. Side effects had set in by 9 PM that evening, with the worst being the headache. Ringing in my ears (tinnitus) came with the onset of other side effects, and the severity coincided with the severity of the headache. I took Tylenol, which helped reduce (but not eliminate) side effects, but ringing in ears persisted, if only less intensely.  I have continued to take Tylenol (and occasionally Ibuprofen--I tend to avoid because of stomach sensitivity), with all symptoms lessening over the week (5/3-5/10), except for ringing in ears and slight headache. The ringing does not seem to go away with OTC meds (Tylenol, Ibuprofen). It is worse in the left ear, which is the side I got the shot in.

                                                Woke up around 3AM in chills and a cold sweat. Was unable to fall back asleep until around 7:30AM--didn&#39;t check my temperature until about 8AM, and it was 103.4 degrees. My temperature peaked at 104.1 later that morning. I took Ibuprofen, stayed in bed, kept a cold cloth on my forehead, and drank a lot of water in the meantime. My fever started to come down in the afternoon, but did seem to climb if I wasn&#39;t adamant about keeping a cold cloth on my forehead--for example, it would come down to about 100, but if I took of the cloth for about 30 minutes, it started to climb back up toward 102. My fever seemed to break around 4 or 5PM, but I slept most of the day, so I don&#39;t have an exact time. After that, I had a little &#34;brain fog&#34; for the rest of the evening (Friday, April 7th), but when I woke Saturday (April 8th) I felt almost totally recovered.

She was given some water to drink.  Then she said her dizziness was getting worse and was having a really bad headache.  I asked if I can call an ambulance for her to take her to ER she refused worrying about the cost.  Her mother was contacted and was notified of the situation.  Once patient started getting worse and started having visual changes with flashing lights, 911 was called immeidately and paramedics took over.

                                                Central Venous Sinus Thrombosis in Superior Sagittal Sinus  I arrived home at 12:38 on Sunday, 5/9, and opened the door to see my sister with facial droop, slurred speech and a contracted right hand/fingers. She was crying and immediately knew she was having a stroke. She had been trying to clasp some jewelry while getting ready for Mother&#39;s Day. She was able to walk down to the car with me no problem (no extremity involvement other than right hand/fingers). We arrived at the hospital within 10 minutes and she was a Code Stroke. A CT scan showed the clots as well as a tiny Subarachnoid bleed and she was admitted to NeuroICU. The symptoms waxed and waned for a few hours and at one point she developed the droop again, had headache and heartburn and vomited. A CT scan was repeated after some Heparin had entered her system and it was stable/not worse; subarach bleed was not changed and Heparin was continued.   She  has now been admitted for 3 days and the Heparin is complete. She is now being transitioned to oral Xaralto. She has no deficits whatsoever and has made a full recovery so far. We are still pending the results of her coagulation studies to see if she has a hereditary condition.   The doctors believe the clot is due to her Nuvaring Estrogen, which is most likely. However, I would still like to report this event just in case.

                                                Three hours after the second vaccine there was a soreness in my left arm, followed by a headache. The next day around 12:00pm, I started to experience swelling in my throat. The swelling made it difficult to breathe. About an hour later I experienced tightness in my chest, making it difficult to breathe again. I experienced shortness of breath and the tightening in my chest did not leave. I was able to make it more bearable by taking my inhaler, used for my asthma. Today (5/17), I am still experiencing tightness in my chest, although it is not as severe as it was yesterday. The swelling in my throat as disappeared today (5/17).

                                                Patient stated she was feeling tired and felt like her heart was racing. She was instructed to sit down as a precaution to passing out. She stated she had a breakfast biscuit and half a cup of coffee for breakfast. She was given crackers and water as a precaution. Pt waited a total of 50 mins and drank all the water and did not eat the crackers. She also stated that she had only had 5 hrs of sleep, which may have been a contributing factor. She also had stated that when she received an epidural she had started feeling the same way and they had to give her epinephrine due to a very low blood pressure. Her blood pressure was taken and was 133/88 HR 85. She continued to wait and stated she had been feeling better. She was instructed to wait another 15 mins to see if her symptoms continued to improved, which they did, and patient said she felt fine to go home. She was instructed that if she started to feel worse, had trouble breathing or swelling to see immediate medical attention as allergic reactions can occur up to 4 hours after vaccination.

                                                Cold sweats began about 11 hours after receiving the vaccine followed by diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and dizzyness. The majority of the side effects continued for 3 days after receiving the vaccine but the vomiting was only done twice on 5/12/21.

                                                About one week after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of enlarged cervical LN, sinus pressure, fevers. This progressed to develop rash and eventually SIRS. She was admitted several times over the course of April and May to determine a diagnosis and had extensive workup for infectious, autoimmune and hematologic malignancy. The ultimate diagnosis was macrophage activation syndrome/HLH but it is unclear if this was triggered by the COVID vaccine or not.  She is responding to steroids in taper and Anakinra and still recovering in the hospital at this point.

                                                Received the second dose Moderna at 11:00am. Then felt a little fatigue, didn?t think anything of it. Was fine until about 7/8 pm. Started to feel cold and got the chills. Then felt fatigue even more, but after taking Tylenol felt fine again. Next day, felt totally fine just a little fatigue and loss of appetite. But I notice a rash starts to appear on the arm I received the vaccine. And as time passes, the rash spreads to my entire body and even face. Went to the ER to figure out what it is and was given antibiotics so hopefully that works.

                                                Severe fatigue, headache, arm pain that lasted 5&#43; days, and severe heart fluttering (kept feeling like it was pounding out of my chest and skipping a beat). I made sure my blood pressure was stable (usually reading 128-135 systolic) and tried taking my propranolol for anxiety to stop the effect. Nothing really made it go away. This is not normal for me, but unfortunately I had to work so I worked through it. Would cause me to feel out of breath at times. It finally went away for the most part on the Monday of the next week, but it comes back occasionally.

It subsided after roughly 15 minutes but my chest did remain tight.

                                                Severe headache lasting more than two weeks. After 3 days I went to the emergency room. I went due to a number of symptoms(fever, chills, nausea, severe body aches, neck stiffness, blurred vision) the headache was my chief complaint and thought to be the cause of the other issues. My heart rate upon arrival was 223 causing me to be hooked up to a cardiac monitor, and my blood pressure was 72/56. I was swabbed for the flu and Covid. Both resulted negative. All labs blood and urine were normal. X-ray or chest was done and showed all clear. CT scan was also done and to my knowledge was clear. I was told I needed to get a lumbar puncture to check for meningitis because it was the only other thing they could think of. Upon doing the lumbar puncture CSF gushed from the needle used to puncture and my headache was gone within minutes. I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri. Thought to be caused by my IUD. After going to see my OBGYN I was informed that my COVID vaccine had caused my IUD to release and unusual amount of hormones and that?s what caused the excess buildup of spinal fluid in my brain. I?m still, almost two months later experiencing headaches and back/neck pain. My IUD is still not working properly and is scheduled to be removed temporarily.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

                                                On the morning of 1/8/2021 (exactly 6 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I woke up with large hives concentrated mostly on my upper body (face, neck, chest, stomach). I tried taking various antihistamines (excluding Benadryl, which would later prove effective) to combat the hives, but they were largely ineffective. The hives shifted throughout the day, starting in my upper body and working their way down to my lower extremities. The next day, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with worse hives (now all over my body, mostly concentrated on my stomach, hips, and legs) and angioedema in my face. At this point, I went to the hospital and received a course of IV fluids/steroids/Benadryl/anti-nausea medication and all symptoms subsisted. Symptoms returned a few hours after discharge, where I continued an oral regimen of the aforementioned medications. The next day, 8 days after the initial dose, my symptoms were equally severe and coupled with gastrointestinal distress, feverishness (likely due to dehydration from the Benadryl) and nausea. This morning (1/11/2021), 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my hives have largely subsisted. In summation, starting 6 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced 3 full days and nights of severe hives and swelling.

At 2 am on Saturday I took my temperature and it was 101.6 F, at 3 am it was 102 F. The body aches, joint pain, fever, and headache continued through the next day until about 6 pm on Saturday. Also on Saturday around 12 pm I began experiencing severe nausea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. At one point it felt as if I was going to pass out. All the major symptoms finally subsided Saturday night around 6 pm. Saturday till Sunday I have felt fatigued and sore but otherwise fine.

                                                Passed out twice; Pain in the injection site; Slight headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 24-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced the events, passed out twice, pain in the injection site, and slight headache.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. No concomitant medications were reported.

Upon waking up the next morning (today) at 7am, I felt very weak. I ate breakfast by 8am and head to work. The weakness persisted, by 10am when I went to the restroom I felt as if i was going to collapse from how weak I felt while standing.  Felt some chills as if my chest was breathing in cold air.

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.  Suspect anaphalxis reaction given rapid decline in status while talking with her. epic pen at bedside immediately and then due to increasing heart rate and complaints of chest discomfort gave her epipen times one. Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

Hurt to raise above my shoulder. This went on till about 1/9/21. Then it went away nothing at my infection site then it came back which is what my concern is same as 1/7/21 itchy, swollen, red and bruised. Why I?m reporting is I?m wondering if I should take my 2nd dose or not from these reactions just at the injection site and only fatigue. This is Day 10. I also took pictures 1/8/21 and 1/15/21

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

There was also tenderness and pain in my left axillary lymph nodes. The swelling and redness continued until 1/13/21 until it started to dissipate. On 1/15/20 I woke up with a sore throat on my left side.

                                                Pt c/o itching and tingling at site of injection.  Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

Briefly this is a 24-year-old with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy myopathy without obstruction presenting with fevers, chest tightness, and rigors after her 2nd COVID vaccine yesterday.   She took Tylenol at home yesterday and on presentation this morning she already felt better.    Her chest tightness was no longer present on admission and did not recur. EKG relatively unchanged from prior studies. She was febrile with an initial temperature of 39.3° C and tachycardic to 110. She was given 1 g of Tylenol and 15 mg Toradol as well as 2 L normal saline.  Her temperature came down to 37.1 and her heart rate came down to 90. Subjectively she felt a lot better and was comfortably sitting upright in her bed. Her blood pressure on admission was 105/58 and had dropped to 91/45, she was given an additional 1 L of normal saline (for a total of 3L) and her blood pressure improved to 103/46.

                                                After about two hours my arm pain was so intense it felt like it was nearly broken and continued to feel worse. I had EXTREME headache and nausea which nearly led to vomiting but kept having to hold it down while alternating between Advil and Tylenol and Tums just to feel a little relief. Pain medications did not help substantially for the first 36 hours. I felt bed bound , had no energy to even move to pick up the TV control a few feet away from me. I had SEVERE chills, and still have them nearly 56 hours out with the headache and nausea still prevalent . I had such bad body aches and dizziness. Have had a hard time getting sleep because of the intensity of my symptoms. Absolutely has been the worst ever and I would NEVER get this shot again. Y?all need to do better. This is completely unacceptable for this to be side effects experienced by people even if it?s less than 10% experiencing the severity I felt. This is so messed up on so many levels. I?m going into medicine myself and although I believe in vaccines, this is not one I will be advocating for until research gets it together and provides a vaccine that is safer for people to receive. Completely anxious and worried and scared as to how my next few days and weeks will go especially with how severe my side effects have been and the news articles showing how some people seem to be dying within hours or days of the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Unacceptable. I can?t believe the amount of fear for my life I have right now.

                                                I was completely fine the day of and the next day in the morning developed chills, a fever of 100.1, and a headache. Took Tylenol but the fever continued to rise. By 12 noon it went up to 104. Contacted the immunologist on call   who prescribed antibiotics and took Naproxen with Celebrex 400 mg. Eventually by 9 pm or so the fever went down. Took Tylenol. In the middle of the night, I vomited. The next day started off with 99 and after taking another Tylenol, it did not come back. The headaches continued with fatigue for about 7-10 days. Currently working with the immunologist to figure out if I need to be pre medicated and post medicated before the 2nd shot.

                                                around 4AM of 01/06/21 (approximately 10 hours after receiving injection) I woke up with stomach cramps, feeling as if I needed to have a bowel movement which is extremely unusual at that hour. I went to the bathroom and ended up having extreme diarrhea. Went back to sleep, proceeded to wake up at 7am for work (I work at a hospital). Went to work, temperature upon arrival to work at 8am was 96.7. Didn&#39;t start to experience any other symptoms till around 10-11am. Developed a headache and thought, &#34;hm this is weird, I haven&#39;t had a headache since I had COVID but I hope it goes away soon.&#34; Then I went to lunch at noon and everything hit me all at the same time - freezing and sweating profusely, headache became so debilitating that it was burning/hurting my eyes, uncontrollably shaking, felt so weak (body aches all over, everything hurt). Took my temperature while I was at home for lunch and it was 101.5 and my heart rate was 160 (my heart rate is usually high because I take a stimulant but it is never that high). Went back to the hospital because I wanted to go to the ER and needed to get the rest of my belongings anyways. The ER physician and staff found the same things when doing initial vitals - high fever and heart rate. I made the ER physician aware of the fact that I had just received the vaccine the night before while also just having had COVID less than one month prior. I was instructed to go home at that point to get rest and recover. For the rest of the day on 01/6/21 and all of 01/7/21 I had to take off work because of adverse symptoms and effects. For all of 01/7/21 I was extremely fatigued and the headache never went away until 01/08/21.  On 01/08/21 I returned to work and symptoms diminished.

Normally I stay up for a bit, but I felt achy and fatigued so I went to bed early. I woke up around 10am with a fever of 101.4 degrees, administered acetaminophen and went back to sleep. Woke up at 1pm and temp had dropped to 100.3, administered acetaminophen again and slept some more. My temp hovered around 100.3 until about 3pm on 01/29/21 when it dropped to 99.8. Around 6pm on 01/29/21 and about 48 hours after vaccination, my temp dropped to 98.9 and I went back to work. Along with fever I experienced headache, chills, skin sensitivity (likely due to the fever as that&#39;s a typical comorbidity for me), and body aches. I also had minor injection site side effects including redness and pain.

Woke up next morning with my fever maintained at 101 and a pounding throbbing headache. The injection site is also hard and red, with the bump increasing in size. I took Tylenol and slept then woke again at 6pm 2/2 with a 100.7 fever and body aches. Took more Tylenol and went to bed. This morning 2/3 I feel about 90% back to normal. The bump on my arm however is growing in size and more painful.

My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

By around 6:00pm on 01/31/2021, I started experiencing fatigued, what felt like a tension headache,  and cold to the point of shivering. I also started experiencing aching all over my body. At around 8:00pm, my body temperature was at 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit (sublingual measurement). By 10:00pm, my body temperature was 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit. I alternated between feeling really cold to feeling hot to the point of sweating through my sheets throughout the night.  I took an initial dose of acetaminophen 1000mg PO at  around 6pm, and continued taking an additional acetaminophen 500 mg PO every 2-3 hours until 4 am. In total, I took 3500mg of acetaminophen.   By 1pm on 02/01/2021, my flu-like symptoms had resolved. I continued to have a low level headache and a sore left arm until 02/02/2021.

After a few hours, and a nap, I had a fever of 101.9 along with chills, severe fatigue and severe nausea.  After a 2 more hours my fever raised to 103.3, I had muscle cramping in my legs, nausea, headache and fatigue.  All of those symptoms lasted until 9pm that night when the fever resolved.  The following day I still had slight warmness, a temperature of 99 and headache, chills and fatigue/weakness.  All of those symptoms, continued until Thursday evening.  On Friday morning I woke up with no headache (only mild intermittent head pains), mild fatigue and arm soreness.  Every day this week my heartrate has been higher than normal with the average rate around 120-130BPM. This was at rest, without any caffeine or other stimulants.  I took alternating tylenol (1000mg) and ibuprofen (800mg) all 4 days.

                                                I had a headache, extreme fatigue, nausea, aches, fever, and chills for 24 hours beginning at 8:00pm the day that I received the vaccine. I had a burning sensation and lypmhadenopathy in the armpit of my injection arm, significant pain at injection site, with slight tingling and numbness radiating down to the hand of my injection arm as well. I took 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours for 24 hours, which provided minimal symptom relief. All symtpoms were relived within 72 hours of receiving the vaccine.

                                                Starting around 9AM I began noticing a high heart rate while inactive. My heart rate was at 140 bpm (measured manually and with Watch). Normal for me is between 80-100 bpm. My heart rate remained high (between 120-140 bpm) for about 6 hours. I did not notice it go down to 100bpm until the next day. The high heart rate was never provoked by any physical activity. I rested in bed or in a chair all day and drank lots of water. Throughout the day I had fluctuating periods of feeling very hot and very cold. I took 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 hours throughout the day.  I also experienced expected side effects (chills, joint aches, muscle aches, nausea, headache, fever (100F w/ Tylenol)).

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                Within an hour, I had a headache and dizziness, which persisted for the remainder of the day. By the next morning, the headache and dizziness were still present and I also had body aches as well as hot/cold flashes, but no fever. This also lasted the entire day and into the following day. It has now been over 72 hours and I am still having dizziness and my head is spinning almost constantly, especially when I move around.

I had my doctor call in Valaciclovir to help me get rid of them it was so bad. I took the Valaciclovir the day after my vaccine, on 1/16/21 and I was STILL breaking out in new cold sores a week later and had to take another dose of Valaciclovir.  My arm was so sore and I couldn&#39;t move it higher than my hip for two days. I was lethargic for two days and slept for a total of 40 hours over the course of the two days following injection. I also had a headache for about a week after the injection.

On 2/5 at 1:00am, woken up with new onset fever (102.2F), chills, rigors, sweats, systemic joint pain, skin sensitivity, left arm pain and prominent axillary lymph node swelling. On 2/6 at 2:00am, headache onset, Tmax now 102.7F. On 2/7 at 7:30am, woke up with minimal arm soreness, resolution of other symptoms

I took advil to combat it, which helped, but it always came back until around 7:00 PM the following day. Along with this, my body ached making it tough to move. Once these two side effects went away, the next two days consisted of a severe migraine when bending down and standing up. This particular side effect did not affect my daily life, though.

I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

                                                A few hours after the injection I began to have fatigue which got increasingly worse throughout the day, at around 7 pm the night of my injection I had body aches and began feeling chilled. Around 9 pm I checked my temperature and had a 99.3 degree fever. Throughout the night my fever increased to 101.8 and stayed within 100-101.8 for the next 8 hours. The next day I discovered I had a full body rash. It appeared like leopard spots. It did not have any raised bumps and did not itch but was hot to the touch. The rash persisted for another 24 hours.

                                                Around 5 pm on 2/11 (day of vaccination) I began to notice a very sore arm and dry mouth/dehydration. Drank water and continued as normal. Around 2 am of 2/12 I woke up with chills and had been sleeping very restlessly.  I had body aches in my arm, legs and back. Around 3am my temperature was 100.2. I also felt very faint when standing and thought I may pass out.  3 times when standing, I had to quickly sit down to avoid it. I do suffer from vasovagal syncope so this may be unrelated to vaccination. I took Tylenol and drank more water. Temp rose to about 100.6 before beginning to drop at around 4 am. I continued to take Tylenol every 4 hours and it helped keep temp below 100 but towards the end of the 4 hours, it would start to rise again. I ate normally and drank extra water due to feeling dehydrated still. Around 1 PM 2/12 I started to feel nauseous and had an upset stomach. I was still have a general body aches and elevated temperature around 99.5. My normal temp is usually about 98.0. Nausea led to diarrhea 1 time. Symptoms continued until approximately 8 pm when very quickly the body aches, nausea, fever and soreness in injection arm all went away. None of these symptoms have returned and it is now 2/13 at 8 pm.   I did test positive for Covid-19 on December 28, 2020 but have been fully recovered with no symptoms since 1/8/2021.

                                                Severe joint and muscle pain starting in the early morning the next day interrupting sleep to pretty drastic pain in all my joints (arms, shoulders, elbows, knees, hips, and back for specific examples) and also with cramping muscles in calves and thighs that have been very tight and tender for the rest of the day. Also experienced lethargy and nausea on the day after the vaccine. I did have GI upset immediately after and for a few hours after getting injection but that subsided overnight and I experienced some neck stiffness within an hour of the vaccine but that seemed to wear off through the day.  As of writing this (10:20 pm) I am still experiencing joint pain but it has decreased as well as muscle soreness; went from a 9 at the worst and is now a 3/4 and better with analgesics

About 5 hours after the vaccine, I started getting side effects of a fever, chills, body aches, and a headache. On 2/14/21, I noticed a rash at the vaccination site. It does not itch, but appears to be spreading on the same arm of the vaccination.

                                                Client came to be vaccinated on February 11, 2021. She stated that she received Moderna vaccine for her first dose. She did not bring her card with her showing which vaccine she received. I asked her again which vaccine she received she stated she received Moderna as her first dose. I gave her the Moderna vaccine. Afterwards I noted according to the computer she had received the Pfizer vaccine. I asked the patient about this, she continued to adamantly that she had received the Moderna vaccine.  Patient was immediately informed of the vaccine error and that according to the CDC there was no indication for further vaccination at this time. Patient agreed. Phone follow up with client revealed that she had fever and chills for 24 hours after receiving the dose of vaccine. No further reports.

                                                Mild arm pain appeared immediately. From 12am - 4am I experience severe chills (despite putting on multiple layers and blankets) that caused me shiver so severely I felt like I was convulsing. No position was comfortable when lying down and nothing made the chills better. I also felt dehydrated, which is unusual for me. From 4am - 6:30am the symptoms reversed and I got extremely hot and uncomfortable. At 8am I noticed a prominent red, warm patch of  swelling around the injection site.

I already have issues with that but the vaccine made it worse. It went away on Monday, but I still had irregular heartbeat until around Wednesday. The 3 worst days were Saturday, Sunday and Monday.  The symptoms slowly went away, but yesterday seemed to be better.

Seven days after receiving the vaccine and having no other symptoms, developed a large, swollen, red welt (raised approximately 1.5 inches) over the vaccine site, along with pain and itchiness. The swelling dissipated after 24 hours, but redness expanded and continued with a diameter of approximately two inches.

Tylenol was taken around midnight but did not break the fever or aid in body aches.  Fever, headache, and body aches continued through next day until around 11pm. Highest recorded fever was 102 about 24 hrs after vaccine (felt higher throughout the night but no access to thermometer at that time). Tylenol was taken every 6 hours, only suppressing fever and aches slightly for about 4 hours after taking it.

I woke up at 1am with a temp of 102.7, drenched in sweat, and shaking so badly my partner thought I was having a seizure. I did not seek treatment, because I was able to sleep after taking Tylenol and having my partner use cold washcloths and ice packs on my neck, forehead, back, and chest. I also attempted to take a shower, but I was so weak I required assistance to walk to the bathroom. I had similar side effects the next night although less intense.

                                                Redness and swelling around the injection site (it?s hard around the site and itchy). There is no rash anywhere else but I also felt very tired and had a headache the day of and then for most of the following day. I will continue to monitor the symptoms - so far it?s only been 2 days.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 1/27/2021. I then went to receive my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 2/17/21. However, when I was about to get the vaccine, I was advised that I was getting the Moderna. I told them that since I got the Pfizer for my first dose, I would need Pfizer for my second dose. However, they insisted that it was okay and unnecessary. I then told them to please go check to confirm since I said that I needed the Pfizer for my second dose. They came back 15 minutes later and stated that I was correct and that I did indeed need the pfizer for the second dose and that I would be receiving Pfizer. After I had received the vaccine, when I requested for documentation for my vaccination card, they insisted that it was not necessary and sent me away despite me insisting that I needed it. I had the regular COVID vaccine side effects (body aches, chill, fatigue, headache). When I contacted the  Immunization Information System to get the LOT number, I was advised that it looks like I received the Moderna on their system. This is EXTREMELY CONCERNING and NOT SAFE and ILLEGAL to be giving someone an immunization and saying it is one thing and then documenting it as another. Now I am not sure what vaccine I received, if I am protected, and what to do next. CDC,  211 and my state has not been able to help me with this.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

My whole body (muscles) felt sore and I felt sick-ish  with body fatigue, headache, body soreness (I felt like how one might feel on day 2 or 3 of having a cold.) I only threw up twice in the morning between the hours of 8am and 10am, and I didn&#39;t throw up nor did I feel nauseous the rest of the day.  I rested and ate plain foods and felt much better the next day.

Then the following day I felt better but had a annoying, constant headache all day. Then when showering I found a tender lump in my right armpit (same side as my vaccine). I?m pretty sure this is a swollen lymph node, and thought I should report it since I don?t have a spleen and I developed it pretty soon after the vaccine.

I went to bed and my body wouldn?t warm up under the covers. I woke up around 1:16am feeling very hot. I was running a fever of about 102F. After removing the covers and using a cold compress it dropped to the 99F range and fluctuated quickly between about 98.7F-99.9F. I continued to have chills and feel very cold during this fluctuation. When I would stand to go to the bathroom my body would be very weak and I would get almost lightheaded.  I fell asleep by about 3:30am. The following morning my fever was completely resolved. I continued to feel weak during the first half of the day with some mild intermittent nausea. By the second half of the day my side effects resolved entirely.

This progressively got worse during the day, including a hard lump and was itchy. Approx. 6 hours later, I became fatigued and had body aches all over. At 30 hours post second vaccine, I started to run a temperature. It got up to 101.5 F, I took Tylenol and went to sleep. By the morning, it was gone. The next 2 days, I had a headache and very sore arm. On day 3 I developed a very sore armpit/under arm area on the same arm as I received the vaccine. As I&#39;m writing this (4 days later), my arm is still sore &amp; itchy and my underarm area is still sore, but no fatigue or fever.

                                                Mild muscle soreness in right arm (injection site) beginning within an hour post-injection, noticeable with movement. Took 400mg of ibuprofen before bed.  At 10.5 hours post-injection (middle of night), right arm soreness was moderate-to-severe at rest and severe, almost unbearable, with movement. Mild muscle soreness and joint pain were present throughout the body; joint pain (wrist, elbows, and knees) was an issue prior to injection and was exacerbated during the event.  I also experienced chills and sharp headache pains. Took 400mg of ibuprofen, 1000mg of acetaminophen, and secured right arm with a pillow, which allowed me to fall back asleep.   At 17.5 hours (following morning), muscle soreness was present in right arm alone and was mild at rest, moderate with movement. All other symptoms were gone. Experienced fatigue that afternoon (approx. 24 hours post-injection), treated effectively with a short nap and vitamin D (through sun exposure).  On the 2nd full day post-injection, right arm muscle soreness is minimal with movement.

She reported no history of blood sugar issues, but she said she only had some donut to eat today. I initially gave her three glucose tablets and a bottle of water, which she sipped. She reported feeling better within a few minutes. I checked her blood pressure at 10:59 AM. It read low at 81/44 with a pulse of 73. But, I checked again since I doubted the accuracy of the reading. The second reading was 101/56, with a pulse of 79. Patient said she was feeling better, but continued to sit. I gave her one more glucose tablet to equal a total of 16 g of carbs given. She sat for at least fifteen minutes until she felt well enough to get up and shop. She checked back after shopping and said she was fine.

A couple minutes later she was feeling better, but she was asked to remain sitting for another 10 mins to monitor her. She claimed to be dehydrated, and had not eaten much of anything today. Her friend brought her some water and food. After eating a bit and drinking the water she said she was feeling almost normal. We provided a motorized cart for her even though she said she was fine to walk. I gave the patient a follow up call a few hours later and she claimed to be feeling fine.

My stomach currently still hurts but not as much as it did over night. I have not been able to identify any action/medication to alleviate the pain.

About 30 mins after the vaccination I started getting a headache that turned into a migraine within the hour and did not respond to over the counter treatments (alieve, excedrine) nor did it respond to my second course treatments from the neurologist (as I get chronic migraines), such as triptans (imitrex, and today I tried amerge). I just wanted to report these symptoms to a) increase awareness of negative side effects in populations of the chronically ill and b) provide information that could alter the vaccination&#39;s preparation so others may not have to suffer the same side effects in the future.

                                                Like I said previously, it initially started that night, I got the fever and chills, which I was told to expect along with the extreme body aches and tiredness. Most of it (the fever, chills, body aches) went away Sunday and I was just tired with pain in my left arm where the shot was. All of these things didn?t worry me so much, however, Sunday night, the mouth area of my face along with my chin started breaking out into hives. My boyfriend gets hives often so he gave me some Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream that I left on overnight. Today the apparently went down a bit, but they?re still present and I?m unsure what to make of it. I applied more of the cream hoping for the best. Nothing I ate is out of the ordinary from what I usually eat, so it couldn?t be food related and I don?t have a history of hives, so I?m not sure. I still have them and am kind of waiting it out, I?m unsure if mask wearing is gonna help this situation.

                                                I woke up and my arm was really swollen with a red ring around the injection site and really hot. I also generally felt sick. I waited until the next day to see the doctor. He examined my arm and said the reaction was so delayed that it concerned him. He put me on a steroid and antibiotic in case there was infection. He told me to contact an allergist, who said it was too soon to get tested to see if I was allergic to the vaccine since they don&#39;t have a test for it. So, my doctor just told me to continue the meds. He also advised me to not get the 2nd dose and I haven&#39;t. I still have random shots of pain at the injection site.

                                                Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, I got extremely light-headed, vision went almost totally black, body drenched in sweat. This passed after about 5 minutes. 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, my throat and tongue started to swell. Went to the ER after benadryl wore off and the swelling returned. Am still managing the swelling of the throat and tongue 4 days later.

Patient called nurse triage on 4.9.21 - with complain of intermittent sharp/severe right upper abdominal pain x3 days.  Went to ED - ED 4/9 note:  Given the on visualized pregnancy did order repeat quantitative beta-hCG to be obtaining 48 hours.  Also instructed the patient to follow-up closely with her OBGYN for repeat evaluation and possible repeat ultrasound.  Also messaged her OBGYN regarding this and the need for close follow-up.  I explained the reasons that require a return visit to the emergency department and the patient verbalized understanding.   Symptoms:  4 weeks pregnant. Received 1st Moderna vaccine yesterday morning. Body aches, temp of 100.3. Has a slight stomach ache on 4/9/21 and went to ED because of pregnancy. Wondered if abdominal pain could be from vaccine.

                                                One week after the injection I started developing a rash that started out the size of a quarter and has been getting increasingly worse since it developed 4 days ago.  The rash is now larger than a softball and is swollen, red and itchy. Along with the rash I have been increasingly experiencing shortness of breath when talking, clammy skin, excessive sweating, body aches, and fatigue. The bottoms of my feet have also been itchy. I have been taking Pepcid and Benadryl which have helped to alleviate symptoms. I contacted my primary care doctor and hope to speak with her in the next 24-48 hours.

Consumed regular diet and drank about 2 L of fluids until 6 PM. Laid in bed around 5 PM and got up at 6 PM to urinate. Felt fine, just a bit tired and sore arm.   While urinating, experienced slight nausea. When washing hands, experienced dizziness and lightheadedness. Attempted to stabilize self on doorway of bathroom and quickly after exiting bathroom, lost consciousness and fainted. Remained unconscious for a couple of minutes and returned with full clarity and processing, but weakness. Checked bp about 3 hrs later and was very low, with orthostatic numbers even lower. Fever measured at 100.5 F. Took 250 mg Tylenol and hydrated.   Days later, bp remains low -- Friday, one day after: standing - 81/57 with temperature of 101.4 F, remaining entire day, with fatigue, joint pain, muscle cramps.  on Monday: 86/64, with fatigue, no fever   Bp is usually on lower side of healthy range, but no history of clinically low blood pressure, nor orthostatic bp.

This went away after an hour. Then a few hours later the same thing happen in my left arm. That also resolved in a few hours. 26 hours after my shot, at just before 1:00pm the following day, I felt the subtle cramping at the base of my pinky and ringer finger on my left hand. This has lasted for a half an hour.   Other than the above, I have experienced fatigue, pain at injection site, slight nose congestion, and dry throat/slight throat discomfort (i.e. feeling dry and only slightly swollen or congested)

I began sweating and my skin was very red. However I also had not had any food up to this point and believe it may have been caused by my sugar bottoming out. I left after about an hour under observations. It has been about 2 hours since the shot and I still feel light headed and a little fatigue.

                                                HOUR 0-6: Ache in arm was immediate. Felt alright, with very light nausea. Drank lots of water under advisement.  HOURS 6-12: there were some chills. HOURS 12-24: By 4 am I was shivering, fevered, and aching enough to officially call out of work, though there was no coughing (and honestly that made me wonder if i was being a wuss, but the next day, the difference was real). The rest of the day was mostly aching and chills, with rest when possible. I felt distinct sluggishness. Bright light or changing orientation too quickly resulted in headaches and squints. My lips were dry even though i had been downing water constantly, thank you fever. Very light eating the whole day, dry toast, pretzels, etc..  HOURS 24-36: Felt vaguely crummy throughout the rest of the evening. After sleeping the next night through i felt great, and even exercised before work.

                                                On Sunday after the injection, my left deltoid muscle was sore but manageable. On Sunday night, the deltoid was very tender and my body was sore. On Monday I feel fatigue and body soreness all day. On Tuesday my body aches and arm soreness was minimal or gone, but I developed a rash on my left arm in the bend of my elbow around 5PM. The rash was itchy and looked similar to an eczema outbreak. The rash on Tuesday went away after a few hours. On Wednesday morning the rash was popping up on different parts of my body and is very red and itchy. The rashes are about the size of my hand and located on my right leg behind my knee and inside of my thigh, my entire left arm, and the right side and back of my neck and my right shoulder.

                                                Woke up at 2am with severe migraine. Went back to sleep, woke at 8:30am with severe migraine and HR near 150bpm. Checked fitbit and had been tachy since 2am. Went to ER. Migraine reached 7/10 intensity, was brought down to a 5/10 with 30mL liquid tylenol and two zofran (unknown strength). Was given 1L saline at 400mL/hour. Tachycardia lasted 14hrs before we got it back under 100bpm. During ER visit felt feverish but temp was not rechecked after triage. Checked at home and was 99.1°F (high for me as I don&#39;t get fevers). This broke overnight and did not have a recurrence of tachycardia episode. Continued tylenol for 3 more days, migraine was slowly lessening. As of today I still have a headache but it does not warrant tylenol.  I was treated at the ER by a Dr., who diagnosed me with a post-vaccination reaction and stated my POTS likely was why I had such a strong tachycardic response.

                                                Female patient reported no history of issues with vaccine. Arrived for administration of her second moderna dose, received it successfully. After about 10 minutes she asked for an additional bandaid, while I was wiping the blood off her arm and applying the new bandaid she said she wasn&#39;t feeling well, then fainted in her seat. I held her stable for about 15 seconds at which point she woke up and answered my questions which were: can you hear me? (yes) are you having any trouble breathing? (no) did you have something to eat this morning? (no). I provided the patient another chair to elevate her feet. I notified the other pharmacist on staff of the situation who stayed with the patient while I got a bag of chips and a soda for her. I asked her to stay a while longer until she&#39;s feeling well, then I went back to the pharmacy (while keeping the patient in view) to continue preparing and administering vaccines. The patient recovered well, laughing at herself and apologizing because she&#39;s never had this happen to her before. I assured her that no apology was necessary, I&#39;m glad she&#39;s feeling better, and that she should stay as long as she needs. After about 15 more minutes the patient rose from her chair said that she felt fine and was going to leave to go get breakfast. I wished her well and allowed her to leave.

                                                Headache, nausea, episode of vomiting, fatigue, and chills. Symptoms began at 10pm on 4/26 (got 2nd dose at 1:00pm that same day) and resolved at 10am with sleep and ibuprofen. Also I have a strange rash under my right eye that appeared on 4/27. The rash is not painful or itchy. It?s just reddish purple with some minor swelling. With the first dose I had a skin reaction on my back similar to pityriasis rosea, which leads me to believe the rash under my eye is related to the vaccine as well.

Pain in thigh occurred about 20 minutes after injection and has not subsided. All other symptoms began about 2 hours after injection and gradually got worse throughout the day.  So Fran was initially taken for nausea. Tylenol was taken for the pain. It did not eliminate all pain but made it much more tolerable and helped with nausea.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after the injection, I began having persistent ice pick headaches, which lasted 1-2 hours. I have a history of these, but they are almost never so intense.  About 25 hours after the injection, I began having intense pain in the center of my chest. It dissipated and returned a couple of times over the next 5 hours or so. The pain was so great that it was difficult to stand, and I came close to passing out. I have not experienced this severe level of pain since about 30 hours post-injection.

Patient was asked to lie down on the floor with feet elevated but patient did not want to leave the chair she was sitting in. Patient was feeling increasingly faint and experiencing increasing panic due to her vision and hearing loss. EMTs were called and responded within 20 minutes of the call. Patient vision and hearing were returning by the time EMTs arrived. They checked her blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation,  and blood glucose - all were within normal range. The patient refused transport to the hospital and left with her significant other as her driver after she was feeling normal again.

Dose 2: The night of the second dose, I had chills and then around 8pm I developed a fever (100F) and tried to sleep. I woke up around midnight with a temperature of (104F) and a headache. I took 500mg of ibuprofen and stayed in bed. At 2am my temperature was (102F) and stayed around 102 until 8am that morning. I ensured to stay hydrated during this time.The day after the vaccine I had a fever around (100F) until 6:30pm and took an additional 200mg of ibuprofen.

                                                That evening my arm swelled up and became very painful - not as much as the first vaccine. I had a hard time sleeping - nausea and headache throughout the  night. 4/3 - extremely tired; felt like I couldn&#39;t get enough air (shortness of breath) body aches and muscles aches - over all lethargic. 4/4 - I was dizzy, short of breath . Those two symptoms lasted along with fatigue - which lasted for two days. I almost passed out that day - everything went black and I had to be assisted to the couch to recover from that.  I used Tylenol for my symptoms when needed.   I still have ongoing headaches - three weeks ago (about a week after I got the vaccine) - I noticed I was having ongoing headaches and I still have these.  Pregnancy - 2nd pregnancy; 1st one was full term. Date of delivery expected - September 9, 2021.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 17-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainted), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)). On 18-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol). On 19-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) and FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug). On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period) and PALLOR (Pale as a ghost). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainted) had resolved, SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work), SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol), FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period), PALLOR (Pale as a ghost), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)) outcome was unknown and DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) had not resolved. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported. Treatment medications include Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) for diarrhea for 1.5 days (unknown dose/frequency).  Patient waited out 20 minutes post-vaccination and then went to the bathroom. When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

Extreme pain all over my body began around midnight the day after vaccination, and I could not sleep because of the pain. My entire body hurt, especially my back, hips, and the injection arm. I experienced chills and hot flashes on and off. I also experienced fatigue and weakness. These symptoms persisted throughout Friday (my vaccine was Thursday).  Ibuprofen helped ease the symptoms. I felt mostly normal on Saturday, with some lingering back pain and fatigue.

Immediately after my first shot I experienced distorted tastes and smells. Lots of food still (after 5 weeks) taste nasty to me. Meats, fruits, and more. Hard to describe the smell and taste, sometimes soapy. My reactions to the second shot similar to first. Cold chills achey, feel really hot, fever, tingly arm, etc.

I am breastfeeding my 5 month old daughter, so sleep is already  broken up but I can normally sleep soundly between each feed.   In the middle of the night, i had a mild fever and troubles walking 5m.  In the morning (05/21/21), I took a paracetamol 500, still had fever, migraine, chills, and was generally very weak.  At 2pm, I took a paracetamol 1g and at 2.30pm, my temperature under the arm was 37.8°C.  Thanks to the paracetamol the fever went down but I still a a strong migraine.  8pm, temperature at 38.4 under the armpit, took paracetamol 1g.  Fever and chills went down,  still had the migraine and nausea.  05/22/21: 2am, chills and general pain, took a paracetamol 1g.  Could sleep 8am, no fever still headache.  Migraine and nausea all day.  10pm, no symptoms anymore except for the muscular pain in the right arm when the injection was done.  05/23/21. Only subsides the muscular pain in the right arm.

                                                It started out with vomiting and fever and then really bad stomach pains. Stomach pains after anything I ate or drank. That happened for a couple of days. Then I had blood in my stool and it was like diarrhea. So I went to the ER on 02/09/2021 and they gave me a CAT scan and said there might have been some kind of colitis. Referred me to a specialist. Right after I went home and two days later I went back to the ER with even worse pain. Had blood in my vomit and was kept there for a couple of hours. They again referred me to another gastro appointment. I wasn&#39;t able to get into a gastro appointment until 02/26/2021 I believe. When I saw the specialist they said that my symptoms had to do with Colitis. Symptoms worsened and I was admitted again. Became to weak and couldn&#39;t walk. I lost like 15lbs. Sched for 03/08/2021 was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. I was point on medication and put on medical leave for three weeks. I started mesalamine treatment. That didnt work so now im on a biological treatment for every 8 weeks or until further notice.  REMICADE is what I was prescribed. My iron levels had dropped and I had to get two iron treatments through I.V. as well. Seen hematologist

                                                I received my vaccine on May 17th and exactly eight days later, May 25, I woke up with what is known as &#34;Moderna Arm.&#34; My left arm where the injection was became, red, hard, swollen and itchy. Throughout the day on May 25th I then started to develop small red bumps on my hands. On May 26th, I woke up with more bumps on my hands, torso, legs and feet. By Thursday May 27th I had them from head to toe. The palms of my hands, feet, the tops of my hands and feet, elbows and knees were by far the worst. The rest of the bumps were spread throughout the rest of my body. Friday, May 28th I had even more and they were extremely itchy and painful. I also had a headache and slept most of the days. By Saturday May 29th they began to seem to heal. It is now June 1 and my feet, knees, hands and elbows still have some but the rest of my body has healed for the most part. I took a lot of Benadryl and put anti itch cream on but nothing seemed to really help.

                                                Got the 2nd dose at 5:15pm June 1st. Woke up at 2:30am with a splitting headache and moderate nausea. Both symptoms last all day. Around 6pm, I start violently vomiting regularly (about 20-30 minutes in between) until around 11pm. Couldn?t keep anything down, including water, Tylenol, and pepto to try to ease the nausea, so there was really nothing to throw up but stomach acid. Otherwise it was dry retching for hours on end. Finally fell asleep after 11pm with mild discomfort in my stomach. Woke up the following morning (today) with just some mild stomach aches and soreness with a slight headache. I could keep down water this morning for the first time in 24 hours.

She said that she felt light-headed and that she was itching all over. I gave her Benadryl 25 and asked her wait around. After about 10 minutes she said that she needed my help. She said that she needed an EpiPen shot because her heart was racing, she was sweating, and her tongue was beginning to feel swollen. I gave her the EpiPen shot and called 911. She was released from the hospital about midnight.

On Monday I woke up with a rash on the left side of my chest, small red dots and this resolved by the end of the day.

                                                Starting at 9pm, I experienced chills, shaking, headache, wide spread muscle soreness, fast heart rate, and nausea. My temperature was 99.5 consistently throughout the night but did not exceed this number. I took Advil twice throughout the night which relieved some of the headache. My symptoms stopped about 12/13 hours later.  Symptoms felt very similar to the flu.

Around 4 am I had a sore throat and a stuffy nose. At about 7 am I had a headache, fever of 37.6 Celsius, chills, and horrible body aches.

                                                I felt fine the rest of the day after I received the vaccine.  However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

After one dose of 650 mg acetaminophen my temperature went back down to 98.6 F. The next day 1/7/21 I did not have a fever; I still had mild chills and headache and pain at the site of injection.

                                                (Written next day) Patient stated that shortly after receiving the vaccine approximately 30-60 min minutes later she started to feel swelling in her face as well as her lips. She took a photo of this and showed it to me today and well. The swelling around the eyes seemed minimal. Her lips were swollen. She also notes that she felt tired and had a mild shortness of breath where she felt more comfortable sitting up. She states these symptoms have somewhat improved, though she has been experiencing increasing nausea since yesterday and continues to feel that way. She states that she does not believe she is pregnant, she has an IUD. She also noticed some body aches yesterday, continuing this morning, but they seem to be improving. They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

Patient&#39;s aunt called me and told me that niece (patient) is 25yo having issues with coordination about a week after 1st Moderna vaccination shot. Unsure of exact vaccination date and onset of symptoms.  really having to focus to place hands under water to wash them, walking through doors without bumping into them, turning on faucet, getting dressed; left hand is worse than right and not able to easily align things properly;  &#34;feels like her brain isn&#39;t doing what she&#39;s telling it to do&#34;.  Aunt said the symptoms are not improving. Patient had tested negative for Covid the day she got the vaccine.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

I developed a low fever of 101.1F and had chills. By the  next morning your symptoms were relieved.  I did get diagnosed last Tuesday with Covid which was one week after the Moderna vaccine. A few days after I got diagnosed with Covid, the swelling returned at the injection site.   As of today I have no redness or swelling anymore at the injection site.

                                                Arm became incredibly sore about 4 hours after injection.  The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

The following day on Friday, I felt fatigued, but it was hard  to tell what from, because I was also experiencing the first day of my menses.  The fatigue felt different because it was my entire body as opposed to the fatigue I feel just in my legs during my menstruation.

By 11:30pm I could not move my arm and also could not pick my son up who  weighs 30 pounds. On the following day I continued with severe  body aches  and joint pain. I went to see a doctor about 10:00am who examined me and advised my to take Tylenol and Ibuprofen  for pain.  They did a Covid-19 swab which as negative.  My symptoms are improving and I can say that it took about 24 to 48 hours to recover from my right arm.

                                                After receiving the vaccine 1/9 in my left arm, I had normal side effects of chills, body aches, and fatigue. On 1/14, I noticed the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, no pain with palpitation. On 1/15 the underside of my left arm was itchy but no visible rash. On 1/16 the arm was still itchy and the lymph node was more enlarged. No neck or axillary nodes were enlarged. On 1/17 in the morning I woke up with a large red rash on my left deltoid. It was not itchy, but as the day went on was more red, raised, and warm. The node in my neck was causing some neck discomfort. I presented to Urgent Care and was treated for a local reaction. I was given a steroid cream to use on my arm and was told to take an OTC antihistamine. I have been using the cream for 2 days and so far the rash is resolving but is still visible. The node has not yet decreased in size.

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

                                                About 30 min after the vaccination I felt dizzy. It felt almost like I had gotten up too quickly and felt dizzy, that kind of dizziness. Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                I started to notice on Tuesday, January 19th, that there was a red bump on my arm. It looked more like a mosquito bite to me and was not bigger than a quarter. It didn?t feel itchy but I thought nothing of it. I noticed when I got home it was twice as big but I still felt no pain. It appeared that my arm was also swollen. The following day on Wednesday, it has grown in size again covering my arm, maybe the size of four quarters. Throughout the day it felt a bit hot, especially when I touched it. It did not feel itchy and I didn?t feel any pain. I felt a bit tired this day so I?m not sure if it was because of it. The redness has gone down today (Friday, January 22nd) however the mark is still big and in the shape of a square now. The outer part of the mark is more red and raised up, like it has a red border.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

I took my temp and it was 100.3F . I starred with body aches and I took a Tylenol. My fever was gone about 3AM next morning and I was able to sleep the rest of the night and when I woke up I was very tired, no fever and just body aches. About 8 or 9PM the next day I was feeling normal again.

The pain was so severe I almost went to the ED and had to take off work the following day. My temperature was as high as 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. I took acetaminophen but this did not help the pain. However, this only lasted less than 24 hours and I made a complete recovery. I have not experienced any issues since.

                                                Woke up around 5AM with a severe headache and tenderness at injection site. Throat was also very dry. Was not able to go back to sleep due to pain. Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

                                                I received the vaccine around 2:30/3 PM. The same night I began feeling as if my throat was itchy around 11 PM. I took a Zyrtec because I thought my friends dog was giving me a little allergies. 20 minutes later my throat itch got progressively worse to where I started to feel a little wheezy and harder to breathe. My arm where the vaccine was felt itchy. I had a rash all on my left arm and upper chest where I had received the vaccine. Immediately, I took a benadryl then went to sleep. Around 3 AM I woke up uncontrollably shivering. My fiance was able to get me a heater because I was so chilled with shivers but was sweating profusely. These shivers lasted about an hour to where I finally just went to sleep. I woke up around 7 AM with a pounding headache so I finally decided to take my temperature. It was 102 F. I ran a fever all day and brought it down to 100 with ibuprofen.  I ran a slight fever the next day as well with extreme fatigue.

                                                The day after the vaccine I started spotting  and my back started getting numbness down my legs. I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

                                                2nd dose of moderna vaccine given IM in the R arm at 0800 on 1/26/21. I had severe chills, severe body aches, a mild fever, and extreme redness and swelling at the injection site. The side effects kept me out of work for one shift. The chills, body aches, and fever subsided within 36 hours, the severe redness and swelling at the injection site has continued to persist. I took Tylenol 1g q8hr for the side effects.

I Iced my arm I also applied hot compress to the injection site. I also had some chills as well. I took acetaminophen to relieve the discomfort. Today is 1/2/2021 and i am feeling a lot better. My arm has stopped bothering me. I don&#39;t have a bump around the injection site and it isn&#39;t tender to the touch. I have also stopped taking the acetaminophen and i don&#39;t have any chills. I only had this reaction for one day.

                                                Pt had fatigue yesterday and went to sleep. She woke up on the bathroom floor and was unaware of how she arrived there. She called 911. They came and assessed her. She was stable and was no need to be transferred. She is afebrile and her only symptoms is headache. She will continue to monitor and call back if anything changes. I recommended that she go to urgent care.

                                                Approximately five minutes after receiving the shot, I began to feel a burst of pain rush through my entire left arm. A few seconds afterwards, I started to feel nauseated. Immediately, I felt weak, light-headed, and tired. I began to sweat profusely, as well. I could barely move my arm to flag down one of attendants who was monitoring us. She asked me what was wrong, and I tried to describe what was going on, but I could barely talk or keep my eyes open. She radioed for help and the paramedics came over to me. They wanted to move me to a private room and asked if I could walk. I tried to walk there, but I started to fall so one of the paramedics hoisted me up to help me. They asked me some questions will they were waiting for a stretcher, all of which I could hear and understand, but I was unable to response to. The stretcher came and I laid down, but I was already starting to feel better by then. I was very out of it, but I think this entire process took maybe 10-15 minutes. I laid there for maybe another 15 minutes, and I began to be able to talk again and open my eyes. I tried sitting up and that went alright. I answered some questions for them while they took my blood pressure, monitored my pulse, and took my temperature. After another 15 minutes or so, I felt well enough to walk back to my office in the Health Department. I didn&#39;t have any other problems for the rest of the day.

I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

All of my lymph nodes were swollen and my entire body hurt. I was unable to sleep last night 4feb/5feb due to muscle pain.  As of today I feel a little better and am without a fever, but I am still incredibly nauseous and have developed a sore throat.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

On 2/3 my arm felt very warm, so I looked at it in a mirror and found a large, round/hexagonal area of swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness. Today is 2/6 and it continues to spread the redness, swelling, and warmth down towards my elbow. It occasionally itches, but is usually painful and stings.

                                                felt fine besides soreness after vaccine.  My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

And then it lessened so I could use it but still pain for three or four days. Redness on injection site - just a big, red spot (not rash). Red spot went away and then a big white spot - six days for white spots. Almost like my arm wasn&#39;t getting blood - just white like that for a few days. Headache - still have it - minor enough when I wake up but when I go to bed that every other day I&#39;m still taking medicine for it; nausea; fever; chills; hot flashes - lasted 5 or six days; fatigue - still have a little fatigue. It is better than it was. At first I was sleeping 15-16 hours a day. Still have to go to bed earlier than normal. Stomach pain - those are gone now; runny nose; loss of appetite; brain fog - I knew what I wanted to say or do but couldn&#39;t. Advil was taken and I tried Tylenol, too. I iced my arm. I did a humidifier.

                                                Arm pain developed throughout the day starting 4 hours post vaccination administration. That pain then spread to my upper back alongside a mild headache. I was otherwise well until 12.5 hours post the vaccine where I developed fever and debilitating chills which went on for the remainder of the night. I had full body aches and immense pain in my arm, and kind of a stiffness all over my body accompanied by fatigue which may just be due to the lack of restful sleep I obtained. I also had a loss of appetite. I took 2 advil the next moring and felt better within 2 hours and regained my appetite. The sweating from what I presume to be fever still hadn&#39;t subsided nor had the chills. I would say within 36 hours all that remains is mild arm pain.

                                                I woke up around 4AM with fever, cold chills, nausea, and body aches. I had the body aches and chills for two days and then I was okay. My arm was very swollen, red, and painful. I also had a reaction to my first vaccine lot #011J20A where 8 days after the dose my arm had a red rash, very swollen, hot to the touch, and painful. This reaction took about 5 days to go away.

I could not say the words I wanted to and words that I could get out sounded very slurry. I went to the Emergency Room where I was stroke-activated. I was admitted to the hospital 1/30 and discharged 1/31.

I had laid on back; and my arm and feet started to  feel like Charlie-horse. It was very hard to speak. My words became slurred as I was speaking. I felt like I was having heart attack.  I had the worst flu symptoms for about 2 days and symptoms went away.

The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

                                                About 16 hours after the vaccine I began to experience sweating along with fever and chills. Despite taking an ibuprofen 800 mg I experienced extreme muscle aches, joint pain, fever, chills, extreme migraine with loss of vision, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms did not cease until Friday morning. Friday still experiencing disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea.

                                                Starting about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt feverish (no fever), lightheaded and dizzy. The doctor on site had me wait for an hour until I felt well enough to drive home. Over the next several hours, my lightheadedness became so bad I felt as though I would faint if I stool for longer than a few minutes. On Saturday, 2-13-21, I did pass out on the stairs and again in my livingroom. On Sunday, 2-14-21, I decided to go to urgent care in which I was told to &#34;wait it out&#34;. However, my symptoms had gotten worse over the last couple days to include body aches, headaches, muscle/joint pain, congested sinuses, slight cough, and feeling feverish (no fever) along with being dizzy. Therefore, I went to the ER later that morning 2-14-21, to see if I could get better treatment for my symptoms. I received IV fluids and they preformed blood work, a urinanalysis and an ECG. I was released from the ER around 8pm. My symptoms were better for the remainder of the evening, but have gone back to what I was feeling before for the last several days. My symptoms have been unresolved now for 1 week. I am getting tested for COVID-19 on Saturday 02-20-21.

I took aleve and was still in a lot of pain, had trouble sleeping due to the pain. My arm was throbbing from shoulder to fingers. The following day the pain was still uncomfortable but improved from the previous day. I also felt a little ?out of it? and tired, minor headache. I was back to feeling 100% by Friday.

Pt stated began &#34;feeling funny&#34; with feeling of increased heart rate approx 20 minutes after vaccine administration, but thought it might just be anxiety. Pt waited 5 more minutes, then states her symptoms continued to get worse.

While nurse was assessing pt, pt then stated she felt like her throat was starting to feel tight, as well. Pt stated she had hx of asthma and carries inahler. Pt took puff of inhaler while nurse injected pt with 50mg of IM Benadryl into her L deltoid. Benadryl administered at 0956. Nurse stayed with pt. Over the next few minutes pt stated her heart rate began to normalize. Stated her chest and throat tightness were getting better. Pt waited 30 more minutes before leaving the building.  Pt stated that prior to leaving her s/s had resolved. states she did not feel drowsy at all from the Benadryl. Encouraged pt to have someone pick her up from the site instead of driving home. Pt stated she felt well enough to drive herself home and experience no drowsiness from the Benadryl. Nurse called pt 2 days after vaccine administration. pt states was feeling completely back to normal now. states after returning home, later in the afternoon she still felt like her breathing wasn&#39;t as good as normal. Pt used her prescribed nebulizer treatment at home and experienced instant relief. no recurrence of any s/s after that.

                                                A few days after the shot I had a horrible headache behind the ear and right side of forehead that wouldn&#39;t go away with tylenol for about 3 days. 1 week after the vaccine I had routine blood drawn, afterwards ate breakfast and had jaw pain and couldn&#39;t open my mouth fully. Within a few hours my whole right side of my face was weak. I was able to get into the dr at 2 pm and was prescribed antiviral Valtrex and pregnozone for 1 week. Started taking them immediately and doing facial excersizes. No improvement so far.

At this time on 2/28/2021, I still have the raised red mark on my area but it has lightened and it is still itching. My lymph nodes are still swollen and a headache is still present as well as fatigue but the sore throat has mostly resolved.

                                                pt stated that 10 minutes after receiving the covid vax her throat started closing so she went to the ER.  She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

                                                My arm started hurting very bad after about 2-3 hours. At the 12 hour mark from my vaccine (11:30PM), I started to have chills, a fever, and feel nauseous. Around 1 AM I started to vomit and this occurred for about 15 minutes, and then repeated again about an hour later. By the morning of the day after I was no longer vomiting or had chills but still had a fever. The most prominent symptoms on the day after my vaccine were extreme body aches and horrible joint pain. My hands and feet felt swollen and stiff. I had terrible pains and aches in my whole entire body. I was also very tired and still had a low grade fever. On the second day after the vaccine I had bad chest and neck pain and started to have a mild cough. By the third day after the vaccine, the chest pain was gone but still had bad neck pain and a headache that radiated through my skull.

I also had severely painful swollen axillary lymph nodes on the same side that I received my injection. I was not able to work or do any of my daily activities for almost three days. Then on day 7 after receiving my first vaccine dose, I developed a itchy, painful, red rash and hives surrounding the injection site (about a two to three inch radius around the injection site. I also got hives and red itchy painful skin on my face. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed prednisone and a week of pepside and zyrtec. After a week I stopped taking the allergy meds and then the hives came back, so I kept taking the allergy meds until my second vaccine dose.

Has slowly gotten better but still hurts(48&#43; hours later) I had a headache through the night and into the next morning (12 hours). My chills started around 12 hours after the vaccine and continued into the night for a few hours. I felt fine again the next morning(around 24 hours after my vaccine)  I did take Tylenol twice. Once before bed, and once when I woke up.

The sleep aid did not help as I only slept a few hours but could not stay asleep due to the pain. I woke up at 7 AM to feed my cat, then tried to lay back down, but was unable to. I went to the toilet feeling nauseous and wretched a few times but did not throw up. I did, however, experience diarrhea that morning and throughout the day. I laid down on the couch and fell in and out of sleep for a few hours. I felt the headache most of the morning, until about 11 AM,. I felt the chills throughout most of the day. I treated my pain with ibuprofen 200mg tablets (3 taken each time, 4-6 hours apart), Pepto-bismol for the nausea and had mostly liquids such as water and juice as well as bread and crackers. I felt much better by around 2 PM, except for the tenderness and swelling in my arm.

I laid down and also breathed in a brown paper bag, got my heart rate down to 150. Then, my parents took me to the Emergency Department. Today is 3/12/21 (8 days after receiving vaccine), but my tachycardia, palpitations, and shortness of breath has continued. Heart rate continues to be anywhere from 85-135 bpm while I am at rest. Palpitations have also continued and are worse at night. Shortness of breath has also continued, but is not as bad as before.

                                                Initially sore arm and chills around 8pm. Around 2 am notes Fever, chills, body aches all over, a killer headache, nausea and I could not stay asleep. I took 2 extra strength Tylenol at that time, put an ice pack on my forehead, and drank a Pedialyte.   In addition to those, at about 4 I had ringing in my left ear and then lost the hearing in it. I just went to bed. When I woke up, around 10am on Friday, I could hear, but super dizzy. I couldn?t really walk without  feeling like I?m going to fall over, especially with turns. All symptoms continued throughout all of Friday.  I continued to take the Tylenol per the instructions on the bottle with my last dose around 5pm, I also drank 3 more pedialytes throughout the day in addition to plenty of other fluids. Took a warm shower around 7PM which seemed to help some with body aches and chills, however, dizziness/vertigo remained.  Saturday I woke up several times drenched in sweat. Around 9am my fever was gone. Still feeling a little ?off? in terms of balance/vertigo but nothing compared to Friday.  Slight body aches remain. Other symptoms gone.

                                                When originally obtaining the vaccine, I had little side effect; the only thing I noticed was a slight fever for a few hours and a sore arm for a few days. 8 days after the shot was given, I developed a small swollen welt at the site of injection. I thought it may have been a mosquito bite, as I had spent the evening outside. That evening, I kept an eye on the swelling, and it was about the size of a half-dollar coin by the time I went to bed. When I woke up throughout the night (this is normal, as my sleeping patterns are irregular) I noticed more soreness in my arm. When I awoke for the day, the swelling had grown to be about the size of my hand. It is now sorer, and somewhat itchy, but I am managing with ibuprofen.

The morning after the vaccination, I also had fever, chills, headache, joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue. The fever was relieved somewhat by an ibuprofen, and went away entirely about 24 hours after the injection. Other symptoms subsided more slowly. The second day after the vaccination, I still had a mild headache and some joint and muscle discomfort, and my right arm was still painful, though somewhat improved by evening. The third day after the vaccine (Monday 3/15), I had no symptoms except occasional joint pain and a slight soreness of the vaccination site.

It felt like my heart is overworking itself even though I am just sitting still on the computer. Other side effects were headache, nausea, and chills. Noticed my heart rate was fast during the 15 minute observatory period at the facility but assumed it was from the adrenaline &#43; fear of needles. By the twelve hour mark, heart &#43; chest no longer hurt and most side effects were gone.

                                                Around 6:00 pm on the day of vaccination I started to feel very fatigued and developed body aches - this felt similar to the beginning of developing Covid-19 symptoms. (I had Covid-19 back in November of 2020)   Around 8:00 pm I had developed some head congestion and swollen lymph nodes along with some throat pain and sinus congestion - again feeling very similar to Covid-19 symptoms.   Around 10:00 pm as I was heading to bed the symptoms became  a lot worse, I had pretty intense body aches and started to experience chills as well as a slight fever (around 99.5 in F). At this time the symptoms felt similar to how I had felt during the worst of my previous Covid-19 symptoms, very weak and achy, headache was very bad, and felt very uncomfortable overall.   Around 2:00 am on March 13 I woke up with a fever of 101.8. The previous symptoms had also gotten worse, I was having a hard time getting out of bed because things were very uncomfortable, I drank a lot of water and took some ibuprofen to combat the fever, about an hour after this the fever had come down to about 99.9 and I was able to fall asleep, but before taking the medication I couldn&#39;t have fallen asleep because of the discomfort of the aches, chills, and fever.   Throughout the following day I was unable to complete many of my day to day activities without taking a daytime cold and flu medication. With the medication I still felt sick but was able to walk around and complete some simple household chores, this carried through into the evening, when the medication wore off the chills and aches and headache were much worse and I still had a fever around 99-100. That night I was able to sleep with the cold and flu medication taken right before bed.  Upon waking up the next morning (March 14) I still had some congestion, headache, and general discomfort but the worst of the aches were gone and I no longer had a fever, these symptoms continued to diminish throughout the day.   On March 15 and March 16th I have had a slight lingering congestion headache, this also feels really similar to the lingering headache I had upon recovering from Covid-19. It is not debilitating and is continuing to improve. Otherwise I am feeling healthy again and have been able to complete my usual activities and even exercise.   Overall the symptoms felt like a couple days of having Covid-19 again, but recovery was much faster, and it was definitely worth receiving that first dose of the vaccine and getting started with the process of doing my part to reduce community spread.

Patient said she was feeling fine with no reactions and was given permission to leave. Patient returned to office 5 minutes later and stated that her throat started  itching and had mild shortness of breath. Patient was immediately checked by PCP and was administered 50mg of Benadryl IM. Patient responded very well to Benadryl and symptoms started to clear up right away. Patient was monitored for 25 minutes before being released from doctor&#39;s office.. I followed up with patient this morning (03/16/2021) and per patient, all symptoms had cleared and was doing very well.

Reaction continued to spread, arm/hand numbness &amp; general feeling of illness, slight fever continued for approx. 2 weeks following vaccine. Site reaction fully subsided visually by 1/26 (began 1/15). Allergist suggested it was severe immune reaction to vaccine. Felt generally unwell for approx. 5 weeks following vaccine. Was told I should not get second dose or any covid/flu vaccines in the future. I have history of poor reaction to vaccines/site reactions.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.

But took some meal around 9.30 a.m. Then I started vomiting from  12 p.m. to 3 p.m. several times. My whole body was dizzy and tired for a whole day.

Fever lasted from about 10 pm to 3 pm the following day and then stopped, without the use of medicine. However, the fever and aches later came back that night (3/20, the day after vaccination) at around 10 pm.  Vomiting: Certainly the effect that caught me most off guard. Vomiting lasted from 4:30 pm on 3/20 (day after vaccination) until 7:30 pm that same day. I vomited 5 times in this time span, and was quite nauseous for about an hour or two before the vomiting began. No medicine relieved this effect.  Headache: Came and went with the fever. Not too terrible.  Sore arm: lasted for about 30 hours after the injection.

Diarrhea has persisted since hours after the vaccine, almost a month later including painful stomach cramping. These gastrointestinal symptoms were not present beforehand and appeared at the same time as the other side effect but the GI issues have not resolved or even lessened. I may need to seek medica attention if it persists.

She denied that the rash had spread but was uncomfortable and that her throat was burning and really scratchy.   Our nurse here at the health dept. advised her to call her physician now and if symptoms worsened to go to the ER. I called patient this afternoon at 4:30 pm and she said that her doctor had given her a Benadryl shot and had sent her to the ER. She was on her way when I called her so I will call back tomorrow.

Helped her to safety without any injury and observed until symptoms resolved in a few minutes. By the time 911 crew arrived, she was doing good and feeling much better. She did not lose consciousness at any time during the adverse event and after 911 crew arrived. she informed she does not have any chest pain and she was doing well and does not need to be referred to a hospital or her PCP. 911 crew left without any treatment. I called the patient today again at 07:45 PM and she stated she is perfectly fine.

I was tired. I got a really bad headache that evening and I took Tylenol for it. When I went to sleep, I didn&#39;t have a temperature - at one point - it was 96. something. All night I felt hot and feverish internally. I had body aches, groggy, tired and my muscles hurt like I&#39;d worked out - for the next three days. I felt feverish randomly for the next couple of days as well. The facial numbness only lasted about an hour. Still am  experiencing irritation under my axilla from the first reaction to the vaccine.

My body was achy as well and a headache developed. I slept from about 12:30PM to 6:30 PM and took acetaminophen at that time. Feverish feeling and chills broke after pill got into my system. Arm is still in major pain.

                                                These were symptoms after 2nd shot.  I started with a mild headache and sore arm. Then things got worse. At night on Wednesday, 24th, I got a severe headache that was at the back of my neck and could feel in the back of my head. Then I became so achy. My bones and joints hurt so much. It hurt to sit or lay down. All I could feel is the pain in my joints. I became so weak and so achy that I could barely get up and walk to the restroom. I could it stand for more than 2 minutes due to the pain. The subsided slightly on Thursday night, 25th, at 6pm. But then returned in another way. I became very nauseous and dizzy. My muscles instead of my bones began to hurt extremely. I could barely move. I broke down crying a couple of times due to the pain being so intense. Throughout this time, I did try to eat or snack and continue to drink water and Gatorade.  Then finally the pain just all of a sudden went away on Friday, 26th, at 1:00pm. I felt like a different person. The pain was gone. The only lingering effect was when I would get up from sitting down, I would be dizzy and my head would throb for a few seconds. That went away on Saturday night, 27th.  I will say if that type of pain had continued on much longer, I might have had my husband take me to the Emergency Room.

Her vision blurred; she felt dizzy; she had a hard time hearing herself, although she could hear me fine; and she felt faint.  We had her sit back down and got her some water, checking on her every 5 minutes or so.  She was still dizzy, but not as faint.  She also reported a cold sweat.  We got her some orange juice and continued checking on her.  She called her husband to come and get her.  She was able to get up and walk out of her own accord with her husband.  We will follow up with her tonight to see how she is doing.

Laying on that affected side is where it hurt. I woke up - vomited twice - nauseous; did visit through insurance on Saturday, the 23rd  - at 8:30 am and Dr. prescribed Zofran for the nausea. Other symptoms: fatigue, headache and fever. Highest temp was 102.9. I only give myself Tylenol when my temperature when my temp is over 102. I took Ibuprofen as needed for the fever - helped the fever to go down. Mid Sunday, the lymph node started - on the left side of my  neck and also under the armpit of that side. It was a quarter coin size of swelling under the armpit. For that I was drinking water and putting warm compress on the affected areas. The first symptoms lasted 3 days (resolved Monday). The lymph node swelling resolved Tuesday.

I decided to drink some orange juice and when I went to sit back down I started feeling extremely dizzy, I got a very bitter taste in my mouth, my whole body started tingling and my lips and tongue and hands especially started feeling numb.I managed to get to bathroom floor where I grabbed some water and wiped it over my neck but I continued to feel worse where I couldn?t even control what my body was doing and I had diarrhea. The ?snow? in front of my eyes got worse too where I couldn?t almost see anything for over probably 3 minutes and I broke in cold sweat.After the diarrhea I had a very sharp pain in my lower abdomen. That all lasted a few minutes and I didn?t have phone on me and I was alone so I helplessly sat on the floor through it all til I started feeling bit by bit better.The fever continued for 48 hours as well as extreme arm pain for 3 days where I got my vaccine.

Hives still on hands. Day 9 (today): Red splotch has grown to a bit bigger than a golf ball. Doesn&#39;t itch at all but it hurts like the initial shot pain. Bicep is swollen and hot to the touch.

Low fever, dizziness, and chills set in around 24 hours later (Sunday midday), including a change in color and consistency of nasal mucous (thicker, green). At about 40 hours post-vaccine (Monday morning) most of the symptoms had dissipated aside from the fatigue and an atypical level of brain fog, which has gradually improved over the course of the week and is still present.  No treatment taken. Normal amount of sleep &amp; caffeine intake, normal daily dosage of Vyvanse 60mg since Monday.

Around 5pm the day after my shot I had a 101 degree fever, a headache and still the severe back pain. I took Tylenol when I noticed I had a fever and went to sleep. I felt much better on Saturday the 10th, two days after my covid shot, but I did notice redness around the injection sight and still had a slight headache and fatigued.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, the arm it was given to me in was basically dead - very weak, achy, hand couldn&#39;t really grip anything. About 3 minutes after, I was very dizzy and sweaty, and a bit nauseated. Felt like I might pass out.  Starting about 11 hours after the vaccine, and lasting almost 3 days, I had: Extreme body pain, much worse than usual (I have chronic illnesses and I&#39;m always in pain) and more widespread. Low fever. Tiredness.  The hand on the arm where I received dose one of the vaccine still doesn&#39;t have its strength back almost 4 weeks later - can&#39;t open bottles or spray hairspray.  Cannot consume things with bergamot anymore - 1 week following the vaccine I tried to drink a tea that I drink weekly that has bergamot in it. Became incredibly dizzy, there was nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating. Tried it again a week later and had the same reaction. Decided I&#39;d wait until a month after the SECOND dose before trying it again, so may still be sensitive.

                                                Within a few hours after receiving the vaccine, right arm started hurting, soon after the body aches and chills set in. Overnight my arm hurt so bad i couldn&#39;t roll over onto that side or lift my arm up. I developed a fever around 11 pm and it spiked to 101.4 for a few hours before I started taking motrin. Fever was gone by the morning but I had to take it around the clock for about 48 hours or else the body aches and chills would set back in.

Patient was called later that evening around 7pm but no answer.  Patient was called again at 10am the following day and patient reported that her symptoms continued to improve over 2 hours after her vaccine. The morning following she had no breathing or chest issues only reported pain and soreness at injection site.

                                                I received my vaccine in the evening and felt alright until I woke up the next morning. I typically do chores first thing on Saturdays, so I got up to do my chores and recognized that I needed to lay down less than 10 minutes into cleaning the kitchen. I felt weak, slightly dizzy, achy, and had a mild headache. I laid there from 7:30am-6:30pm only getting up to potty. I drank 100&#43; oz of water and a large energy drink while in bed. Over the course of the day, the headache is what became unbearable. My sinuses filled up and it turned into a migraine around 3pm. I had rice around 10am so my partner made me soup with a baguette at 6:30. I ended up calling my dad at 6:30, a 30&#43; year Hospital CEO, to confirm that taking a tylenol would be okay. He said it would be fine. When I took it, I felt better within 20 minutes. Within an hour I felt like I only had allergies. I was eating and watching TV. However, I was tired and wouldn&#39;t have walked far. The next morning I woke up with a severe enough headache that I took a tylenol and drank a coffee (I hear caffeine expedites medication) and by 10am I was at a hardware store buying stuff for house projects.

A day after I was over my cold (no more symptoms) My eye began to water by itself and I could see a stye on my inner lid. The next day (Today) I noticed I couldn&#39;t purse my lips around a straw, and my right side isn&#39;t moving at all. My eye won&#39;t blink unless I force it, and my lip won&#39;t move.

By 7:30pm, she had developed a red rash over her chest, neck, and arms. This rash eventually became very itchy and she developed a bad headache. The patient was advised to take Benadryl liquid, which she did. When her lips began to feel tingly, she was advised to go to an urgent care facility. At urgent care, she was also given Pepcid and told to continue the Benadryl. By the next morning, the itching and redness had lessened some, but she still has the bad headache.

I took a benadryl and took a nap around 1pm woke up at 4 pm with more hives. I bought Allegra and put calamation lotion on the hives and tried to sleep them off for the next day, on 4/10/21 when I woke up I had severe hives all over my body except for my stomach area, I went to the urgent care and the dr recommended I go to the ER which I was prescribed Prednisone and Hydroxyzine and to take Benadryl when needed. The ER doctor suggested it could be good, detergent, or a different shampoo. But I have never been allergic to anything in my life and have not changed anything and it just so happens I get hives after getting the vaccine.  Now today on 4/20/21 I broke out in mild hives around 2:30 am, took an Allegra and it seems to be gone for now. I hope this is not a reoccurring symptom..

On 12-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on an unknown date and the estimated date of delivery was 15-Nov-2021. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant). 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache). On 22-Mar-2021, the patient experienced VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown). On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) and HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue). On 12-Mar-2021, EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant) had resolved. On 09-Apr-2021, ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried), FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown) and FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) had resolved. At the time of the report, VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding), MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, Ultrasound foetal abnormal: abnormal (abnormal) Had some bleeding and found out it was subchorionic hemorrhage. Bleeding is in another part of the uterus where is baby is not. On 01-Apr-2021, Ultrasound scan: abnormal (abnormal) Saw baby heartbeat but was informed baby had not grown.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information provided mentioned ultrasound and cytotec.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable as patient took both doses of the vaccine. Patient reported that she does not blame Moderna, as her OB feels the miscarriage was related to a &#34;genetic issue.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-060699 (Patient Link).   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 13-Apr-2021: Patient updated AE and mentions fetal complications resulting in miscarriage. Events and outcome of case thus updated with new information.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Symptoms began 3 days after shot and began with a fever of 100.5 F in the afternoon on the Thursday  following vaccination. Fever persisted for approximately 12 hours, despite taking an over the counter fever reducer.  After this, I developed nausea and was unable to eat much for approximately 4-5 days. Being worried that I had contracted COVID before the vaccine, I got a rapid test the day after symptoms began. The COVID test came back negative. On Friday I developed a red, stinging, itching rash on the injection arm. The rash lasted for several days. During this time I also developed joint pain and fatigue. An abnormal amount of fatigue lasted more than a week after the vaccine.

                                                I got really tired around 12:00 pm and slept a lot both Thursday and Friday. My entire body ached for both Thursday and Friday. On Thursday around 5 pm I noticed the start of a cold sore on the corner of the right side of my lip. I haven&#39;t had cold sores since I was a teenager and used to have oral herpes outbreaks a lot as a child. But for about 10 years I&#39;ve had zero problems. By Sunday that little cold sore infected both upper and lower lips all over, and my chin. On Monday it got even worse and inflamed with the use of Abreva. My face was on fire and I had to go to my doctor.  My doctor then put me on Valacyclovir.

On 05-Apr-2021, the patient experienced AUTOIMMUNE HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA (Autoimmune hemolytic anemia) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 16-Apr-2021, PLATELET COUNT DECREASED (platelets were incredibly low at 16) outcome was unknown. At the time of the report, RED BLOOD CELL COUNT ABNORMAL (RBC was 3.25), EYE COLOUR CHANGE (yellowing of both eyes) and FATIGUE (felt tired/increasing fatigue) outcome was unknown and AUTOIMMUNE HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIA (Autoimmune hemolytic anemia) and IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 28-Mar-2021, Platelet count decreased: 16 (Low) Low. On 28-Mar-2021, Red blood cell count: 3.25 (Low) Low. On 05-Apr-2021, Platelet count decreased: 90 (Inconclusive) 90. On 05-Apr-2021, Red blood cell count: 2.76 (Inconclusive) 2.76. On 16-Apr-2021, Platelet count decreased: 329 (Inconclusive) 329. On 16-Apr-2021, Red blood cell count: 3.47 (Inconclusive) 3.47.   The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   On either 23 Mar 2021 or 24 Mar 2021 (described as around the 5th or 6th day), the patient noticed bruises on both arms (described as 1 or 2 petechiae on chest, &#34;a little bit on right leg,&#34; petechiae on both forearm but mostly on the left one, &#34;a little bit on both arms but mostly on the left&#34;).

When the patient arrived at the emergency room, the patient had bruises on calves, and their platelets were incredibly low at 16, RBC was 3.25. While admitted, the patient had daily blood tests because the patient was notified that the &#34;immune system started attacking red blood cells&#34;. The patient was initially treated with steroids, but didn&#39;t respond to steroids; then, the patient was treated with IVIG and responded. On 01 Apr 2021, the patient received a platelet transfusion and red blood cell transfusion. On 05 Apr 2021, the patient&#39;s platelets went up to 90, and RBCs were at 2.76. On 05 Apr 2021 around 1600, the patient was discharged with an official diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. On 16 Apr 2021, the patient&#39;s platelets were 329 and red blood cells were 3.47.

                                                Arm pain, arm swelling, bruising at the site of the injection, loss of grip strength in injection arm, all within 10 minutes of vaccination. Within a few hours, tiredness set in, additional loss of grip strength in both hands, but especially in the arm that received the vaccination. 9 hours after the shot, severe fatigue set in, as well as hot and cold flashes, switching between fever and chills, headache, excessive sweating, weakness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, body aches, skin pain, and flare-ups of old injuries. I woke with tremendous, debilitating neck pain as well, which was the site of previous whiplash injuries, in both my neck and lower back, and my knees hurt as well. Woke every hour or so throughout the night, severe symptoms. By the next morning after the shot, the fever and chills had stopped, as well as the nausea and vomiting. Fatigue remained, headache on and off, and body aches. By day 3 most symptoms had gone away except for tiredness. By day 4 I started to notice sun sensitivity, and on day 6 have developed what seems to be a heat rash? My forearms are hot, red, sensitive, and reactive as well. Every day since the shot I have gotten tired in the afternoon as well, even if earlier in the day I felt OK. Have had mild shortness of breath in addition, but nothing that has stopped me from regular activity. As a 25 year old, I experienced incredibly severe symptoms, and this was my first shot of Moderna. No known previous exposure to Covid, either. Noticed that symptoms started worsening rapidly around 6 p.m. the day of my shot after taking my borth control pill as well. Wondering if related, or possibly coincidence.

This reaction is still continuing today 4/30, and I do  not know when it will end. I have been to urgent care twice for steroids, I have taken Benadryl, and Zyrtec but nothing will fully get rid of the reaction. I visited an allergist on 4/29 and she believes that I am having an adverse reaction to the vaccine. She prescribed several antihistamines to counter my reaction to the vaccine, including bendaryl, famotidine, fexofenadine, zyrtec, and an epipen incase my throat starts to close.

I was nauseous and threw up twice. I had a low grade fever of around 99 degrees but at one point it did go up to 101.3. My entire body hurt including my head and Tylenol and ibuprofen did not help. On February 5 I was feeling a little better, I still had body aches but could eat a little.   On February 6 at around 0500 I woke up with chest pain. I waited a little while to see if it would go away but it had gotten more intense. I am a cardiac ICU nurse so I knew what chest pain could mean. I got out of bed and at that time my chest pain was a 10/10 and I was having shortness of breath. I woke my fiancé up and told him I needed to go to the ER.  At the ER they ran test and admitted me to the hospital. They later diagnosed with myopericarditis with a small pericardial effusion.

She went on to have typical side effects (fever, muscle pain, injection site reaction) over the past 3 days, However today when she presented at the pharmacy she said the reaction in her left arm where the vaccine was given had continued to grow worse. She described it as hot, painful and hard to the touch, She also relayed she had been experiencing significant muscle pain only in that arm (the entire arm) as well as some numbness in her left hand and wrist. She did indicate she had previously had an issue with numbness that had since resolved and could not say definitely it was related to the vaccination.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after the patient got her second moderna vaccine she became faint and dizzy. The patient was sitting at the time. A law enforcement officer witnessed her becoming faint and ran over to attend her. I was called over to assess her as well. The law enforcement officer called EMS. The patient stated that she felt faint, dizzy, she said she had a headache, blurry vision, and was nauseous. The patient appeared sweaty and she appeared to loose consciousness briefly twice. She did not show any signs of redness, rash, or swelling. After sitting for a few minutes, and before EMS arrived, the patient said she was improving. She did not lose consciousness anymore but she still had a headache, nausea, and blurry vision. When EMS arrived they recommended that she get checked out at the emergency room, but the patient refused stating that she did not want to go to the hospital and that she was feeling better. The patient called her parents and they came and picked her up.

Patient noticed central chest pain on the second night after the vaccine as well as vague flu like symptoms, bone pain, fatigue and stomach ache. Symptoms all resolved shortly after 2am and have not returned today. Patient recently had covid back in March. Suspect over-reaction to vaccination due to remaining antibodies from recent covid infection. Chest pain likely pleurisy due to location indicated and stable vital signs and no cardiac risk.

I lowered her to the floor and lifted her feet above her head.  An ice pack was applied to the back of her neck.  She started complaining  that her throat was closing up so an epi pen was administered and 911 called.  The epi pen was a temporary fix but her throat started closing up worse than before.  I administered a 2nd epipen.  Patient was violantly shivering. A  3rd epipen was administered with no relief.  At this time the paramedics arrived and she was transported to the hospital.

                                                Confusion/inability to complete tasks: within 20 minutes of getting my vaccine, I was unsafe to drive (drove on the wrong side of the road). Within 2 hours, I could no longer focus enough to work (I&#39;m an engineer). It&#39;s been 6 days since my shot and I&#39;m still confused, forgetful, unable to focus, and unsafe to drive. I forget steps during work tasks, and forget what I&#39;m doing while I&#39;m doing it. It&#39;s like a short term/prospective memory issue. Lack of coordination: 5 days after shot, could not navigate stairs without assistance. Could not remember ADL (did I get mail, did I eat, did I shower, day of week...) Fatigue: Slept/ rested all day for 2 days after the shot. It&#39;s now 6 days after the shot and I&#39;m still unusually tired, needing 2-6 extra hours of rest a day. It&#39;s tiring to walk short distances, to focus/converse, to work. Sore arm: my arm was very sore for 2 days after the shot (painful at rest, worse if touched, like a bruise). By 4 days after the shot, it was not sore even if pressed/hugged. I do not have any headache.

                                                Patient is a 25 year old female. She presented to the clinic for her second dose of Moderna LOT #003C21A.  According to patient&#39;s husband she has no significant past medical history but has ?passed out? with vaccines.  No reaction noted with her first COVID vaccine.  Approximately 10 minutes after receiving her injection today she told her husband that she wasn?t feeling well.  She said was light headed and nauseated.  Patient then proceeded to become nonresponsive.  Her eyes deviated upward and her whole body became stiff.  Her skin had notable pallor.  She was lowered to the ground by staff, myself, and her husband, and put in a supine position with her legs elevated.  911 was called. This episode lasted approximately 40-60 seconds when she became responsive and cried out for husband.  Her muscles relaxed and she became notably upset.  She kept saying she wasn?t able to see or feel her extremities.  Her lack of vision resolved within 10-15 seconds. She had weakness in her arms and legs but was able to squeeze her hands on command.  She was alert and oriented X3.  BP was 130/90.  The patient was stable when the ambulance arrived to transport her to Hospital.

It?s been 11 days and I still have the cough and my chest feels weird and scratchy.  I also felt fatigued for about a week after and still don?t feel quite like I did before. I know several people who developed coughs with the vaccine. It should be LISTED as a side effect. I was tested for covid when my cough was at its wrost and the test was negative.

                                                After the 2nd dose on Day 2 I had a fever for about 3 hours before I took more medication. I took acetaminophen round the clock but still felt uncomfortably hot all day.  I had severe fatigue most of the day and slept or laid in bed. My body ached especially at the injection site and at times it felt like my hand was in pain on that arm. I had brain fog as well.   Today is Day 3 and I have so much pain at injection site it was sometimes hard to sleep. It feels almost intramuscular and my pain from the first dose went away after Day 2 and the site mostly just felt sore.  I have also experience nausea and drainage in my nose. I?m tired today but less so than Day 2. I am still a little foggy in my brain and my neck hurts quite a bit.
