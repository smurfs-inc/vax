                                                I had no pain or discomfort immediately after the shot, during the 15 minute observation period, or an hour after. About 2 hours later (at 2:00 pm), I developed some hives around my neck, and the part of my arm near the injection site started to become more and more sore. I applied Benadryl to the hives and they went away. However, my left arm hurt to touch or move, much worse than any vaccine I&#39;ve had before (flu, HPV). That night, I had trouble sleeping because the discomfort because of the sore left arm. I also could not sleep because of chest tightness and pressure, which worsened when lying down, but that pressure did not progress to the point of wheezing (I have asthma).  Sleeping on my back was the only option because sleeping on either side was painful, which worsened the chest pressure. When I woke up, my fingers felt stiff and I had joint pain in both hands, more so in my left hand. Throughout this, I did not see any redness on my arm. This day it was agonizing to move my left arm. I could pick things up, but raising it above my the height of my waist or twisting it behind my back to get on my backpack was near impossible and was avoided. The chest pressure went away. The second night, I still had trouble sleeping, but the pain was much better, although I still could not sleep on my side. When I woke up, I had no more joint pain. That day, although the left arm was still sore, I could move it pretty well. If I made too strong of a movement, it felt like the injection site would tense up, the pain would slowly ramp up, and then diminish. That afternoon, at 4:30, I was able to play tennis with minimal soreness, and that night, I was able to sleep on my side. The following day, I had a cough, but that might have been because I didn&#39;t dress for the weather, and experiences close to zero soreness.

                                                For my first dose, I had quite mild symptoms. I woke up with a migraine the next morning and some soreness at the injection site. Both of these lasted a couple of days and were able to be treated with over-the-counter pain medicine. My second dose, however, provided much worse flu-like symptoms. About 12 hours after I received the injection, I was woken with a migraine much worse than the first, nausea, chills, joint pain, sore throat, and fatigue. While the chills and nausea subsided, the other symptoms persisted until the next day. As of today (2/4/21), all symptoms are gone except for soreness at the injection site.

                                                I had a fever the night of the vaccine. The next morning I still had a fever and also got a headache. I took some 800mg of ibuprofen. Which broke the fever for a few hours but it returned in about 5 hours. I took 2 Tylenol then. Again the fever and headache subsided. They returned around midnight or 1am that night. I didn?t take anymore medicine. It broke by itself by 7am the next morning. That day I had a cough for most of the day. All symptoms were gone by the 4th day.

                                                Approximately 7-8 minutes after receiving the vaccine, started to feel light-headed, thought she was going to pass out, and her heart was racing extremely high. The health care team at the site took her blood pressure, measured heart rate, gave her water, juice and chocolate and tried to get her heart rate to drop. It was fluctuating up and down and she couldn&#39;t stand up without dizziness;  we waited 45 minutes and then drove her home as she was unable to drive her own car.  She was experiencing significant lightheadedness, and consistent heart racing even while lying down on the sofa/bed. This continued for several days and she stayed home from school and sports. We called her primary care doctor on the 10th and they suggested she wait another day to see how she was feeling. She started to feel a bit better by Friday, was still experiencing a bit of the tiredness, nauseous, light-headed and heart spikes, but was able to drive, move around.  On Sunday evening, she started to experience increased heart rate again, lymph nodes were very painful and started experiencing the light headedness all evening.  On Monday we took her to her primary care provider and they then referred her to ER for the heart racing and a EKG. The increased light headedness, feeling like she will pass out even while laying in bed, dizziness has all increased and her lymph nodes continue to be swollen and painful. It has been over a week since the vaccine and there is no clear sign of her reaction getting any better, if not worse.  The EKG results indicated a new abnormality and we are trying to get her to a cardiologist.  She is and had been a very healthy, varsity athlete that runs over 30 hours a week with track, and since receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine is unable to move very far within the house without feeling that she is going to pass out or that her heart rate is shooting up uncontrollably.

                                                I started having the symptoms in the afternoon. I was really fatigued and throwing up multiple times (nothing left in my stomach); had chest pain. My boyfriend rushed me to the hospital. While I was at the hospital (about 3:00 am) I threw up again at the hospital. They monitored me and put an IV on me. When I was able to hold down water and stop throwing up they let me go home - which was about 7. Prescribed Zofran and Pepsin.  And they put me on a clear liquid diet for a day.  They told me to Zofran, Pepsin and Benadryl before the second dose and told me to eat a meal before getting the second dose and I had no symptoms at all with second dose.

                                                My daughter started feeling feverish several hours after vaccine but by 6 hrs. she was running a fever. It has gone to as high as 103.1. She felt like her fingernails were even hurting her. She said her body had pins and needles feeling. She has stayed hydrated. The fatigue is just to severe for her to get out of bed and even do online school is not possible. Vaccine was given Mon. afternoon and now its Wed. afternoon. Her fever has finally broke and hopefully stays away. Her body always responds to ibroprofen with the sweats pretty fast and a reduction in temperature but this time her body has not been receptive. She wouldn&#39;t even get a sweat like usual. She was dosed at 800mg. I have not taken her to the Dr. but will tomorrow if necessary.

With physical activity, these symptoms just got worse. I had extremely bad pain in my lower back and throughout my back muscles, sending my back into spasam.

                                                I got the vaccine sometime in the afternoon and felt fine for the 15 minutes after the time of injection. I returned to work afterwards, and later that evening I started to feel chills, but it wasn&#39;t severe to the point where I went home. When I returned home from work, the chills remained but I also felt extremely exhausted which was unusual for me. I also had a bit of a headache/felt lightheaded. I took Tylenol which somewhat helped the symptoms. I felt fine after going to bed.

The body aches were so intense I couldn?t dress myself in the morning. All of my lymph nodes in my neck, ribs, and collar bones were incredibly swollen and hurt when touched. I rotated Tylenol and Advil with no relief. My fatigue was like no other. My headache wouldn?t go away either. 48 hours after the vaccine, I still had body aches and swollen lymph nodes in my neck to the point of pain when turning my neck.

                                                Approximately 15-20 minutes after vaccination patient developed weakness in her limbs.  BP and glucose were normal.  Approximately 10 minutes after the onset of symptoms the patient developed bright red rash on the face, increased breath rate, and swelling of the lips and tongue.  She was having difficulty talking due to shortness of breath and swelling in the tongue.  911 was called and epinephrine 0.3mg IM was administered as well as diphenhydramine 100mg orally.  Her rash improved fairly quickly, swelling went down a small amount.  She stated breathing still felt labored and she was feeling like her heart was racing but she was also tired (likely due to medications administered).  She was still having difficulty talking, taking short breaths between almost each word.  Paramedics arrived approximately 12 minutes after epinephrine was administered.  They attempted to walk her to the ambulance per her request, however she was unable to feel her legs.  She was placed on a stretcher and into the ambulance.  The patient stated she was given additional epinephrine in the ambulance as her condition had worsened by the time they got her in there.  She was taken to the ER and given additional diphenhydramine and was observed until approximately midnight, when she said she was discharged.  Follow up was completed the following day, and she had improved dramatically.  She was still feeling a bit weak, but no longer had any issues breathing.

I felt very fatigue for a few hours and my head was out of it. Around 7:00 PM I started to get nauseous like I was going to be sick. All the symptoms were gone by the next day except for the soreness in my arm.

                                                I developed an initial fever of 101.2° and was completely bed bound, then that same initial day I began to develop extremely painful and unexplainable mouth sores and lesions. Some developed on my cheeks, some developed on my tongue and they were so painful that I could not eat, drink water, or even talk. I continued to spike fevers for an entire week without being able to control it. The pain was so unbearable and nothing was helping the pain go away, I am still unable to eat solid foods although I no longer have fevers. My throat also really hurt and my neck lymph nodes felt sore to the touch. The lesions in my mouth are beginning to heal but I am still bed bound and am trying to recover. Only thing I can bring myself to eat is chicken broth. I saw multiple doctors, not one of them was able to figure out the source of these awful lesions. They put me on acyclovir and cefuroximeacetil as an antibiotic.

By 3am I figured the only reason I wasn?t sleep was from the vaccine. I then started to feel extremely nauseous and had chills. At 3:30 am I took my temperature and it was 100.5. I laid in bed until 5am with no sleep still and took my temperature again and it was 103.5. I went back into my bed and fell asleep around 5:30 am. The next day I felt as though I had been hit by a truck. I felt extremely groggy and achy and my temperature when I woke up was around 100. Overall, I felt awful.

                                                04/26/2021 got the shot. An hour later, I had shortness of breath. Kept persisting throughout the week and worsened. On sunday, 05/02/2021 between the hours of 12AM to 2AM, my shortness of breath got worse to the point where I could not breathe. In general, I felt my back and chest tighten. I could only breathe (faintly) to survive. If I took any deeper breaths, my back and chest would hurt even more. As time progressed, My right neck got stiff. Then right my jaw got stiff. Then the right side of my head got stiff. Eventually, the whole right side of my body was numb -- I could move it still but it was still numb and stiff. This happened simultaneously with the breathing issues. This entire time, my whole was tensing, it felt like I could feel my veins while it rushed blood. It was terrible. I thought I was going to die. I did not know which breath would be my last, because every breath got worse and worse. I went to sleep around 2AM and I would periodically wake up. When I&#39;d wake, the pain still persisted. It never went away.  Eventually I got up to go to work around 8AM, the right side of my body wasn&#39;t as numb and the breathing wasn&#39;t as bad, but you could still tell there was an issue. This issue persisted throughout the day. As of now, these issues are not as persistent, but at least once a day, I still feel the effect. It sucks. A nurse called me (working at the urgent care I gave information about) , on 05/03/2021 saying if I was going to see a primary doctor. I told her that I have an appointment with one on 05/10/2021.  She said that though they called me on 05/02/2021 towards the end of the day and told me everything was fine, that they looked a little deeper and realized that the shape of my cells were weird and that when I go to my primary doctor, they&#39;d be able to access my information.  This is of a complete shock because the shape of my cells were never weird before. This happened as a result of the covid-19 vaccine. This is reaction must be put into the VAERS system.

She ended up going to the local ED - since she was still very fatigued and was feeling like she was going to pass out - blood work and U/S done - this is where she found out she had been pregnant but had lost the pregnancy (no heart beat).  Per her report - all other blood work was unremarkable.  No other medications given to her during this visit and was just told that she would be &#39;passing the products of conception within this next week&#39;.

This was not a side effect written on the moderna sheet of risks. I was shaking so bad I thought I may have a seizure. I finally settled down and fell asleep. About an hour later, I woke up shaking out of control. I was going to call 911 but my partner was able to grab some NyQuil for me and knocked me out. It was the most terrifying experience of my life and I will not be getting the second shot because of it.

About 5 minutes after, the patient began feeling nauseated and light headed. I was called to check on here. She was pale and and leaning forward over trashcan. After about 2 minutes of questioning her and getting baseline vital signs, she started to slightly improve. We assisted moving her to an exam room. We had her lay near supine (as moving brought on new wave of nausea and lighteheadedness). She was closely montiroed. About 10 minutes later we began sitting her up, but after only a few symptoms began to return. Laid her back into supine. finally after anothr 30 minutes we were able to fully have her sit up and stand with no residual symptoms other than fatigue. Through out event normal VS HR, BP, O2 (other than slight tachypnea initially).  Normal physical exam (other early noted pallor and reticular rash on extremities, which all resolved). Advised patient that on next dose to ask to be given in a location where she can be laid supine and observed for at least 30 minutes after injection.

After taking a long nap, I felt better for a while. Around 10:30 PM, I felt feverish and had a temperature of 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and developed severe body aches. I had a hard time sleeping throughout the night and had a headache during the night and into the morning. The day after receiving the vaccine, I had body aches, a headache, and a low-grade fever. My symptoms cleared up around 9:00 PM. Two days after receiving the vaccine, I have a lingering headache.

                                                On the night I received the COVID-19 vaccine, I had a fever that went up to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. In the morning 24 hours after I had the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, I felt a little better from the night&#39;s fever and ate instant ramen, oranges, acetaminophen, and a vitamin C tablet. This was at about 8:45 AM. A few minutes or a minute after I swallowed the acetaminophen and vitamin C, I got a severe allergic reaction that led to me going to the Emergency Room. I have eaten these things before and am not allergic to acetaminophen, vitamin C, or anything in the instant ramen. The reaction was first felt by a shortness of breath and I could barely breath. Then, hives started to form on my face and my lips and face became extremely swollen. I then ended up throwing up after my mom gave be a Benadryl pill and I drank another Benadryl after.  My face had become less swollen but it was still difficult to breath and hives started to form all over my body so we decided to rush to the Emergency Room. We got to the Emergency Room at about 9:30 AM and the hives on my body were worse. They were able to calm down the reaction by giving me more Benadryl through an IV and steroids. They knew I had the second dose of the vaccine so they did not give me anything that would suppress my immune system. Timewise, it could be the acetaminophen, but I have taken acetaminophen in the past many times before without a reaction.

The symptoms started a few hours after I received the vaccine and got significantly worse the next morning. I had to call out of work because I physically felt that my knees would give out when I was standing. I also could not rest my wrists on anything because it caused too much pain. The next day, I felt much better and was able to go to work.

I received the vaccine during a shift at work, and I was unable to complete the shift at my normal efficiency or concentration. To my coworkers, I described the feeling as being intoxicated, but not slurring my words. This feeling decreased enough by 9pm where I felt safe to drive home, but it was not completely gone until  approximately 11pm.

                                                Around 2:30-3pm I began feeling tired. I went to lay down and rest and started to get chills and a bad headache along with hot and cold episodes.   I started to sweat but had no fever at the time. This continued all night. I had no appetite after receiving my vaccine. Around 6:30 I started to get a fever of 100.3 and continued chills with headaches. I took Tylenol when needed. My whole body was sore throughout the day and got worse are the night progressed. My fever was in and out but around 9pm I had the highest temp of 101.4. I didn&#39;t get good sleep due to feeling unwell all night. I belive I stared feeling more myself sometime around 9:34am. But was still feeling a bit warm. But felt way better as the day progressed. My left arm where I received my shot is still very sore. And I still don&#39;t have an appetite.

Next day 3/24/21 patient called and said she had a productive cough and was advised by staff pharmacist to go to Dr.  She called back and said did go to Dr. and was prescribed steroids and antihistamine (was on steroid at time of vaccination but we were unaware) and Dr told patient not to get 2nd vaccination. Patient was doing better but not completely recovered

Employee at Public Health Dept agreed I should file this report and file it myself because I have the most accurate description of the symptoms that occurred  What happened after vaccine administration within about ~10 minutes (01/04/2021) -what felt like a bit of throat tightening/swelling that would come in spurts and go away -difficulty taking a deep breath, could still breathe adequately normally  -took more effort to breathe deeply/have a normal baseline breathing pattern -faster heart rate than normal, could feel it ?racing? a bit- was about 82 (radial, took it myself) *thought these were attributed to my anxiety of sitting in a crowded room not close to the exit (I have bad anxiety with being in new locations and not being in control of where I can place myself around others (I do not have an anxiety disorder but experience anxiety of this kind semiregularly)  *sat a few extra minutes (about 20 minutes) and then left the observation area confident I was overthinking and I was just me being anxious/not the vaccine  After walking out/leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable racing heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)  Back home Same things as leaving  -spurt of dizziness/nausea -chills -hot forehead -spurts of widespread headache -effort to take in deep breaths -not as noticeable heart rate -spurts of throat tightening/swelling (not severe)      -spurts of throat tightening went away in about an hour After 1-3 hours -heart rate and breathing still making me uncomfortable but did not feel like an emergency -could feel heart rate when laying down/felt racing to me again when lying down, not very much when sitting up  Breathing remained uncomfortable for the rest of the day/effortful into the evening -heart rate felt normal in the afternoon/evening -talking on the phone took more effort than usual but was not too difficult  Later that night I was able to lay down without a racing feeling heart rate, breathing was better, and slept fine. The next morning I woke up (01/05/2021) without any effortful breathing or racing heart rate and without any other abnormal symptoms; symptoms I did experience were arm soreness and some fatigue Today 01/06/2021 my arm soreness is very mild and I am not experiencing any other symptoms -did not download the v safe app until 01/05/2021

                                                1/5/21-About an hour after receiving vaccine, I had mild nausea, my left arm kind of hurt after receiving the vaccine.. which is weird because I got it in my right arm.  1/5/21- Around 8:00 PM I noticed raised red bumps on both of my forearms.. it?s worse on the right arm. It looked like a mild rash. Around 10:00 PM I developed chills, muscle aches, my right arm was in a lot of pain, I had a slight headache, nausea, and my temperature kept going up. I?ve been taking Advil/ Tylenol to try and get my temperature down.. but after every dose wears off my temp goes back up. I kept waking up multiple times in the middle of the night. In the middle of the night around 2AM, my temperature was as high as 102.9.  Later on in the night around 4AM, my chills had stopped and I actually felt really warm.   1/6/21- I woke up about 6:30 AM and had to call out of work. My temp was about 98 something at this point and I still had muscle aches.  I slept most of the day and my temp continues to go over 100 now every time a dose of Advil wears off. I still have muscle aches and there is still a lot of pain at the injection site. My arm doesn?t hurt as bed as it did though. However, the rash on my forearms is still there. On my right forearm it looks worse than it did yesterday.

                                                On 12/31/2020 I had a headache and I was tired.  Over then next two days my arm was very sore.  That subsided by 1/02/21.  On 1/07/21 I woke up around 8 AM with my arm being sore again and at ejection site I had a red circle. The ejection site was also swollen. I took a benedryl and the pain subsided but the red circle continued to grow.  On 1/08/21 the circle got even bigger (even with taking two 25 mg tablets of benedryl before bed) and it?s warm to the touch.    Also on 1/07/2021 at around 6 pm I began menstrual spotting (this would be in the dead middle of my usual cycle). It continued into today ,1/08/2021. This is unusual for me as I have never experienced spotting in the middle of my cycle.   Also on today 1/08/2021 my arm soreness has returned as the red circle is  growing bigger around the ejection site (approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 inches). I?m also experiencing extra tiredness and a headache.

I could not life my arm past my chest because it was so swollen and sore. I stayed at home and skipped new year&#39;s, going back to sleep around 1030pm. It was not fun

My arm started to have some swelling at the site, but I woke up this morning and the fever, chills, and nausea are still very much present about 24 hours after receiving the first dose.

This headache went away when I woke up the following day.  On Saturday, January 9 I experienced chills, nausea, body aches, and a stiff neck, along with pain in my left arm. The injection site was inflamed and painful. Most of these symptoms were relieved the following day.  On Sunday, January 10 I experienced pain in my left arm that has travelled into my axillary area and my left shoulder. This has yet to be relieved. I am also erythemic at the injection site.

                                                I got up to use the bathroom at 4:30 this morning. I was extremely shaky but made it. I was using the bathroom and had the feeling that I was going to vomit. Next thing I know I was seeing stars and I fainted and fell off the toilet face forward and hit my head on my tile floor. I don&#39;t remember getting to the couch, but my dad was awake to let out the dogs and I couldn&#39;t really speak but he heard me and came downstairs and got me water and a cool rag. I was sweating but shivering. I am nauseous and have slept a total of 13 hours since 4:30am. I am pretty sure I have a concussion. I have a headache, on and off chills, muscle spasms beginning at 9:00PM on 1/14/21. I also have ringing in my ears. My resting heart rate is typically between 75-85 and I checked it at 7pm and it was 100. I have not sought out medical attention and have been debating it all day.

The following day I had a more severe headache and extreme fatigue. I treated my headache with Tylenol and slept most of the day. Two days after I received my vaccine, my face and neck began to swell and I still had a severe headache and fatigue, which I treated with Tylenol and Benedryl. The Benedryl decreased the swelling in my face and neck and when I woke up on the third day, my headache had resolved. I felt fatigued on the third day, but by the evening, all of my symptoms had resolved.&#34;

                                                The first two days after injection it was painful to lift arm above 30 degrees and hurt upon palpation and I had an overall tiredness. A week after the injection on 1/13/2021 I developed a raised, red rash surrounding the injection site (2in x 4 in). The skin that was inflamed was 101.2 degrees fahrenheit.  The intense rash lasted around 24 hours and subsided after 3 treatments of Benadryl cream and one dose of oral Benadryl. The skin is still slightly raised and has a slight redness to it today (1/15/2021) but is much better than before.

                                                I received the Moderna vaccine at 3:50pm on 01/25/2021. Around 3:30am on 01/26/2021 I awoke feeling feverish and nauseous, and my arm at the site of injection was extremely painful. For the next 4 hours, I drifted in and out of sleep as I experienced violent body shakes from chills. Around 7:00am I woke up feeling more nauseous, and my temperature read 99.7 F. I vomited once, just containing stomach acid. After vomiting the nausea subsided but I had a pounding headache with sensitivity to light, joint and muscle aches, and continued pain at the site of the injection, although no redness or swelling was noticeable. The headache and injection site pain improved a little bit with Tylenol. At 11:20am 01/26/2021, I am now experiencing a mild headache and body aches, and my temperature reads 99.1 F.

We talked quite a bit and I kept asking her what else her symptoms she was having and she didn&#39;t have anything additional to say.  But when I asked if her throat and lips was tingling she stated yes it feels like her throat is closing.  The things I specifically asked about she stated &#34;yes&#34; that was happening to her.  She denied having any Benadryl at home.  I told her to go to urgent care immediately and to call me back once she is seen,

                                                Immediate burning in arm right after receiving shot. 15 minutes after receiving shot began to feel tired and got a headache. Later on in the evening I had discomfort in my chest and had to use my inhaler. Pain in arm worsened over night; couldn&#39;t move arm at all. Pains spread into armpit and back. Got up at 3am to my body shivering, thinking I was running a fever I checked my temperature and it was normal but upon standing I had extreme dizziness to the point of almost passing&#39;s out, I had to sit down right away. Had nausea and whole body felt very sore an achey. The morning after my shot I woke with a headache, extreme pain in my arm and armpit, soreness all over my body, stomach pains, and my heart rate was high. Throughout the day my symptoms got worse I ran a fever of 102.7 which broke but then came back later on in the evening.  The following day my symptoms started to diminish, no fever and body was feeling better, arm pain and headache continued. Now I am on day 4 still experiencing pain in my arm and armpit, slight headache, but chest pains have started. It feels as if there is a brick on my chest, almost like a burning sensation with occasional pains in left breast as well as tightness in the left side of my neck.

                                                About 3-4 hours after the injection was given, my left arm began to hurt at the sight of the injection. It was sore red and beginning to swell. After a couple more hours it was difficult to even move my arm; it felt as if my tricep was almost entirely immobilized. These symptoms persisted for about three days, with increasingly less intensity, and after the fourth day, I had no adverse symptoms. Exactly six days after receiving the vaccine, the area where the injection was given (tricep) began to feel itchy. When I tried to scratch it, the itch was not relieved but only worsened and began to swell and turn red. By the following day (7 days after injection), the site of injection and area surrounding the site of injection (about 6 inches along my upper and 3-4 inches in width) had swelled up more and was significantly more inflamed than my opposite arm which hadn&#39;t changed at all. It had a similar swelling, itch, and pain to the sensation one experiences after getting bitten by a mosquito, but in this case a very very large mosquito bite. By the evening of the seventh day, I began feeling very fatigued both mentally and physically and felt very subtle body aches that usually signal the early signs of a fever (at least for me). Upon feeling feverish symptoms I made a drink of turmeric and ginger root powder with honey and laid down for about an hour in an attempt to rest. After an hour, the body aches and fatigue lessened in intensity but my arm was still swelling and now feeling hot in temperature. The itching was unbearable. I went to go take a warm shower later that night and started to feel a mixture of pressure and pain traveling up my arm and into my chest. I began feeling my lymph nodes on the left side of my breast to find that a lymph node in my armpit and another one on the side of my breast had enlarged to about two inches in diameter. They were painful to the touch and noticeably sore when left untouched. These symptoms persisted with no change for about 2 days. After two days, the swelling and itching in my arm went away but my lymph nodes were still inflamed. They did not reduce in size or in pain until about 7 days after the first signs of these symptoms. After a week all symptoms went away.

                                                I woke in the middle of the night, around 4am Feb. 5, with chills, a splitting headache, nausea, stomach pain, and body aches. It lasted the night, and then I took ibuprofen 200mg in the morning and throughout the day it got better, but around 3pm, it started to come back, so I took another 200mg ibuprofen. I also didn?t eat anything for fear I would throw it up. Later that evening, it got worse and I became extremely fatigued. I was able to eat some soup and crackers. I took another ibuprofen and couldn?t go to sleep until 4am. The next morning I felt better, with only residual side effects. My left arm was also extremely sore and tender from the time of administration until Feb. 6.

Reports is a student teacher through  school  and received Moderna COVID19 vaccine yesterday. States that she started having high heart rate today, between 120-160. On presentation, patient&#39;s heart rate was elevated, measuring from 110-160 in the ER. Patient also had 103F oral temperature. Patient denies taking any other medication. Patient ultimately had to have labwork and imaging done.   Will give  tylenol for fever and  NS bolus.  Labs imaging to include CBC, CMP, Mg, lactic acid, TSH/Free T4, UA, urine preg, CXR, and EKG.  EKG with sinus tachycardia and S1Q3T3 pattern.  CXR without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.  D dimer 640.  Mg 1.6, Na 133, K 3.4.  TSH/T4 unremarkable.  UA with trace leukocyte esterase.   Given EKG findings and elevated d-dimer, will obtain CT w contrast to rule out PE.  CT does not show evidence of acute PE.  Patient is afebrile and stable for discharge.  Discussed with patient that symptoms are likely due to inflammatory reaction following the COVID vaccine.  Recommend symptomatic treatment at home and activity as tolerated.

                                                Woke with some muscle aches that I didn?t think much of, but progressively worsened to the point where I didn?t want to leave my bed by the evening. Loss of appetite started around 4pm, despite being hungry. Fever of 102 began at about 1 or 2 pm and persisted until I went to sleep at 8 pm. I woke up with no fever the next day, but still experiencing body aches.

I couldn&#39;t see anything and I felt a little nauseous in the stomach. I was able to lay down for a couple of minutes and felt fine afterwards. Some of the symptoms going home are a sore arm, can&#39;t seem to lift it up, tired, the vaccine site seems to sting, and some chills.

She felt as if she was having a stroke and that got her more worked up.  She denies lower body weakness.  She states that her head feels heavy and she complains of general fatigue.  No n/v.  No headache or blurry vision.

The morning after, about 16 hours after the shot, I had severe body aches and pains, a severe headache, fever, chills, and was extremely fatigued with worse pain in the arm at the site of injection (3/13). This lasted until I woke up the next day, about 40 hours after the shot, I felt physically weak the next day and still had arm soreness at the site of injection but no pain, headache, fever, or chills (3/14). Felt completely back to normal, still some slight pain on the arm at the site of injection, about 64 hours after the shot (3/15).

                                                Patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/10/21 and had a large, red, inflamed area on her arm at the injection site for a few days, but otherwise tolerated vaccine well. She received the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 3/10/21 and the next day (3/11/21) developed fatigue and lightheadedness while exercising, which continued for the next few days. She developed acute onset, sharp chest pain on 3/13/21 AM which did not resolve so she presented to an ED. Vitals were normal but labs notable for troponin I which peaked at 4.36, CK 758, d-dimer 640. CBC/CMP and EKG were unremarkable and initial TTE with EF ~45%. Repeat TTE obtained a few days later with normal LV and RV size/function without any wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac MRI obtained with normal LV function (EF 64%) but late gadolinium enhancement in a subepicardial distribution within the inferolateral wall of the left ventricle at the base most compatible with myocarditis. ESR and CRP were normal. Further workup to determine etiology of myocarditis was negative (ANA, ANCA, RF, hepatitis panel, HIV, full respiratory viral panel, COVID-19 PCR). She was placed on metoprolol succinate 12.5mg XL daily and will follow up with a cardiologist as an outpatient. Family concerned that COVID-19 vaccine was the trigger/underlying etiology of her myocarditis.

                                                The morning after the vaccine, I had a really awful headache and swollen arm, that was incredibly touch-sensitive. Around 3 pm that day, 25 hours after the injection I was hit with severe nausea. About an hour later, I began vomiting and had diarrhea. For some time, I was unable to keep water down. I called a 24-hour nurse line, and they advised contacting my doctor&#39;s emergency line. I did, they said if I couldn&#39;t make it through the night without keeping water down I needed to go to the hospital. Luckily, right before bed I drank some water and was able to make it through the night. The next morning, I had a telehealth visit with someone from my doctors office to review symptoms. Today I have had waves of nausea, but no vomiting. I have had diarrhea, and I had a spontaneous period that was very heavy and two weeks early today (2 days post vaccine).

The next day (2.5 days after the vaccine), I was feeling better other than some soreness in my injection site.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Reaction started out with a localized 3-4 inch inflamed reaction. It looked very similar to hives. This was on Friday, March 19th, 2021 around 9 PM. I went to sleep and woke up the next morning and it was still there. I took benadryl and one ibuprofen to help the inflammation and the reaction, but it only got worse following this. I then had intense tactile and mechanical allodynia, which is often associated with my diagnosis of fibromyalgia, but this has been very intense. The allodynia had been occurring across my left hand up to my elbow, but has now moved to both of my arms, my neck, my entire back (more severely around the ribs), my chest, and my feet. I am very fatigued and feel feverish. My current temperature is only 99.2, but the pain is still active. Today is Sunday, March 21st, 2021. I got the vaccine on Saturday, March 13th, 2021 and this reaction is following the vaccine about a week after.

Then around 2 am I woke up and vomited. About 20 minutes later I vomited again. The next day I woke up and was fatigued, weak, and nauseous the rest of the day. I fell asleep multiple times and napped by accident. By 10pm,  almost exactly 24 hours later, I felt fine again.

                                                The syringe was larger and looked full. It took a long time for medication to go into the arm due to the amount of liquid injected into the muscle.  Right away the full left arm and breast were painful.  The arm pain continued to get worse and felt like she hit her funny bone but more extreme and this pain lasted all night into the next day.  She was unable to sleep due to the full arm pain.  The significant pain in the breast area lasted all day into the next day too. Also, felt chills and body aches starting that evening into the next day and night. We did not know the dose was only supposed to be 0.5 ml at the time of injection. We suspect she received at least 5 ml instead of the recommended 0.5ml.The name of the nurse that administered the vaccine is written on the vaccine card but not sure of spelling. RN?

Onset was over the course of about 1 hour. I had previously taken part in the double-blinded Astrazeneca in COVID-19 trials (meaning I did not know I was vaccinated) in November 2019, so the nurse told me that the response could really be from anything: partly due to some interaction between the vaccines, allergy, and/or already producing antibodies. I was unblinded and told I was given the Astrazeneca vaccine. Interestingly, I had none of these responses to just the Astrazeneca vaccines, just a bit of soreness after the first one. I have never had such a strong response, and I believe this is the highest my temperature has ever been, and my lymph nodes are still swollen. I am much better now; however, even last night and this morning, I was feeling unwell.

Upon calling the health center, they said that I may have eaten something bad. Around 6pm the same day, I started sweating but I was freezing, and had a headache and muscle pain. I had a 101 fever and that persisted until the next day (3/24/21). It is currently (3/24/21) and I have noticed sharp chest pains on the right side of my chest throughout the day, especially when exerting forces breathing (such as riding my bike or walking up stairs, or getting into and out of bed). I still have a slight fever and feel very cold, but I in fact, still have a slight fever of 100.4

                                                First day I had immediate swelling at the injection site, red circle form around the site of injection following up with an itch that lasted for 3 days. Along on those immediate symptoms I got the injection on my right arm and I experienced pain shooting up from my right arm into my neck and currently still have those pains from time to time when I move my right arm at an elevated angle. Day 4 of the vaccine I woke up one morning with swollen glands, congestion, swollen nasal glands, low grade fever of 100 degree F, very itchy irritated throat and hard to swallow, visited a clinic to see if I possibly had flu or strep but all my test results returned negative, also I had a covid test done and it was negative, I have never contracted covid 19 prior to vaccine and current day. Additionally, symptoms of congestion worsened and I am now experiencing some laryngitis due to the swelling of my lymph nodes, only sinus medication lessens the congestion to manage, I feel very fatigue, and experiencing some migraines.  Today only marks 1 weeks since the vaccine

                                                I received an allergy immunotherapy shot the day before my first dose of the vaccine and instantly felt nauseous and extremely tired after receiving the vaccine, which continued for two days after receiving tut. Three days later, I woke up struggling to breathe (but not anaphylactic), covered in hives, itchy all over, shaking, disoriented, and chilled but not truly feverish.  I reported this to my allergist, who prescribed prednisone and suggested the vaccine combined with immunotherapy were too much for my immune system for one week. The hives, itchiness, and difficulty breathing lasted about four days. I struggled with fatigue and nausea for over two weeks, stopping all school and work in the meantime. After my second dose, I feel just a bit tired and sore, so I think this truly was a bad reaction to the two injections combined rather than to the vaccine itself. Still, it was a debilitating experience,  and I would recommend considering putting out guidance that other immunotherapy patients space out their allergy injections and vaccines farther than I did.

Within the next hour, my jaw began to lock and my throat began to burn/tighten. Within this timespan, my body, especially my back began to ache as well as my chest feeling tight.  After three hours, I went to the on-campus clinic and they gave me 50mg of Benadryl.

                                                I developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of platelets) and menorrhagia due to the vaccine according to my doctor. I believe there have been about 30 cases of this occurring so far.   In my case, I took the vaccine and felt relatively tired for two days. There were no other symptoms. About a week later, I got my period after not having it for a couple months. The blooding was light for a few days, but then got extremely heavy. After about a week of very heavy bleeding, I went to urgent care. They took blood tests, and found that I had a critically low level of platelets (6 platelets when the normal range is 150-400). I was admitted to the ER for multiple days, and they gave a platelet transfusion and IVIG  fluids, which has helped considerably. I also had to take steroids to suppress my immune system so that my platelets could increase.

I started running a fever during the night as well. I got up around 5am because I could sleep with the pain , I took my temp it was about 101. I was also nauseas.  This lasted a few hours and was relieved with 600mg ibuprofen.  My arm has been painful the entire time (4days now).  Redness around the site has been getting larger. It started as just a small circle but after two days it started to grow to about 2?x4? and by today (day4) it covers my entire bicep and is starting to wrap around. It is also mildly itchy and swollen.  On the 31st I work up with a painfully swollen axillary lymph node on the left side. It stayed swollen and painful for about a day.

At 10:28PM my temperature went up to 101.5. Took Tylenol and fell asleep woke up at 3AM fever of 102.3 . Fell asleep and woke up again with a fever of 102.6. I had chills nausea weakness body aches headache. Took Tylenol again and fell asleep only to wake up again at 6:30Am  still with a fever of 102. Nothing was making it go away I had no appetite extremely fatigued and nauseous it felt like I had covid again. I also felt swollen lymph nodes under my arm. By Sunday I was feeling way better and my fever was gone. Monday my ear popped again lasting a minute that?s never happened before. Monday today 01-05 still having headaches and now chest pain. I felt so bad I wanted to go to the hospital but did not it really did feel like I had covid all over again I would not want to put my self through that again.

                                                Right after the injection, I had minor arm soreness which increased as the day went on. Approximately 12 hours after the injection I started feeling very tired and achy. My arm hurt very badly and I started getting chills. About an hour later I had a 101.1 degree fever. I also experienced very slight shortness of breath which went away when I used my albuterol inhaler. My shoulder where I got the injection hurt so badly that I could like raise it, lie on it or touch it really.   The fever continued into the night but was gone by around 9am.   I continued to feel tired and achy all day the next day, with occasional shooting headache pains. I did feel better and better as the day went on though.   Question: I take a daily supplement of 6g of marine collagen. I happened to take the marine collagen 1 hour before the onset of chills and fever - could there be a correlation between the collagen and the worsening symptoms? I have never had any type of reaction to the collagen before and have been taking it for about 3 weeks.

I woke up the next morning after not being able to sleep all night with a temperature of 101.7 Fahrenheit coupled with profuse sweating and a stabbing headache. I took some Tylenol and drank a bunch of water and tried to go back to sleep ( Inhad woken up at 5:30). I was unsuccessful because I ended up having to vomit about 20 minutes later. Throughout the day, my temperature hovered between 99.5-100.4 even though I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen. The symptoms persisted all day and I only started to feel relief around 7 pm. I feel fine today, but I still have a bit of a headache and my left arm is still sore.

                                                I received my vaccine while I was at work around 1400. Around midnight I woke up shivering and could not get warm. My heart rate was elevated but that could have been related to my anxiety. I layered clothing on and finally managed to sleep. Upon waking up around 6 the next morning, I had a temperature of 102, a sore throat, throbbing headache, and was vomiting. My arm was so sore and swollen that I could hardly touch it. After rest, Tylenol, and fluids, I felt better around 8 that evening.

                                                Headaches, body aches, and fatigue started in the middle of the night on the 26th/in the early morning of the 27th around 2-3am. These continued throughout the day of the 27th until around 6pm when symptoms subsided. Slight fever also started around the same time, but stopped around 3-4pm of the 27th. I took 400mg of advil once at around 7:00am, and once again at 1:30pm. These helped alleviate some symptoms. At the end of the day on the 27th, most symptoms (except for sore arm) were gone!

At 9:30 the next morning, I developed a fever of 100.5 and body aches. Around 2 pm, I got a headache which felt like it was because blood was hitting the veins in my head really hard- I think that&#39;s high blood pressure? My blood pressure was 126/85. I read not to take medicine because it would make the vaccine less effective, but I had to take an aspirin at 8 pm because I couldn&#39;t handle the headache any more, and ever since, I&#39;ve just had a sore arm and a headache when I walk too fast (it&#39;s been two days after the shot now).

At work (noon), suddenly became very lightheaded, cold, sweaty,  experienced blackout vision around periphery and felt faint and nauseous. Threw up. Went home and had extreme chills and could not get warm. Nausea subsided around 6:00pm 1/27. Headache and neck soreness continues still today (1/30). Headache feels like pressure inside my head, pushing and causing dull pain at the base of my skull and top of neck.

It reached as high as 125BPM without doing much movement at all to account for the high HR.

                                                Severe injection site pain (aching) approximately 3 hours after injection on 2/2. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 2200 to take the edge off of the pain in order to fall asleep. Beginning at 0600 on 2/3: Temp of 100 F, chills, body aches, headache. Took 400 mg ibuprofen at 1000 which lowered temp and reduced other symptoms for approximately two hours. Symptoms returned at 1200 with temp reaching 100.2 F along with chills, headache, and body aches that were more intense in the shoulder/neck area. Used a heating pad along my back, shoulders, and neck which helped with the body aches. Slept from 1500 to 1800 and woke up with an intense frontal headache with pain shooting through my eyes as well. Temp was 100.7 F. Took 400 mg ibuprofen which made the symptoms more bearable. Tried to stay hydrated by drinking water throughout the day. Also had two servings of soup. Symptoms seemed to lessen by 2200. The only symptoms lingering today, 2/4, are a slight headache, fatigue, and mental fog. Otherwise, condition has improved tremendously.

Paramedic onsite immediately listened to lungs and heard diffuse wheezing bilaterally. Within 1m minute patient felt throat tickling and then tightening and breathing was more difficult.

As way to hospital patient felt breathing getting worse again and was given solumedrol and benadryl IV and a second EpiPen. Don&#39;t yet know what happened beyond this.

These started when I awoke around 10am the morning after 2/4/21 getting the dose at 3pm the day before (2/3/21). By the end of the evening (8pm) on 2/4/21, I had mostly recovered from all of the symptoms and at 10am on 2/5/21, I felt fully recovered.

                                                Initially, I only experienced soreness near the injection site. However, 10 days later, I started experiencing mild sore throat and fever, headaches, and moderate aches and muscle weakness. Day 11 after the vaccine, I noticed a red, asymptomatic ring around the injection site. I have never had a reaction to any vaccine or shot before. In total, I experienced fever, sore throat, muscle weakness, fatigue for 4 days after the symptoms started.

                                                Injection site pain making my right arm unusable, splitting headache, sharp, short pains on different places in my body including my back and knees, fatigue. Some mild nausea/loss of appetite. From the beginning of my symptoms to the end of them, my best estimate is about 36 hours. Taking an aspirin alleviated most of the symptoms to where I was more functional. I did call into work and skip a meeting the day after.

I was back to normal after the weekend (about 3 days later). Some mild fatigue and feeling ?off? occurred as well during that 2.5 day period. Took some ibuprofen and that helped a little bit, otherwise just took it easy and recovered pretty quickly (relatively).

                                                The reaction is due to the SECOND dose in the series. I had a fever of 102.5 along with body aches, chills, etc, the day following the vaccine (2/9), but that resolved within 24 hours. The second day after was fine (2/10). The third day after I developed a deep red rash like pattern extending down my arm more than halfway down my arm from the injection site. The injection site was extremely high, just below the top of my shoulder and immediately below the body part of my shoulder, so the extent of the redness is ~6inches long.  It is extremely painful, warm to the touch, and slightly swollen. I went to the urgent care where I was diagnosed with cellulitis. I was prescribed doxycycline 100mg PO BID x5days. I am reporting this on the day of the reaction, and it is unknown how it will respond to the antibiotics or if it will get any worse.

                                                When the person had given me the shot, it was so painful and he had kept in my arm for a while. It was nothing like the first one. He had given it to me in my SUV. My arm was so sore for 2 days to where I could barley even lift it. I struggled so hard to do basic things and had to rest my arm and switch between hot and cold treatments for those 2 days. Still nothing really helped. I couldnt even lift my arm above my head without using my other arm to help support it. Even when i did that, it still was so painful.  The night of getting the second shot, I had body aches and a fever that reached 100.2.  As the days went  one i was able to move my arm more and more but i still have pain when  i move my shoulder a certain way.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

Around the time I went to bed, I began to experience fever and uncontrollable chills and weakness. Headache still persistent through the next day and symptoms persistent all throughout night. Was given ibuprofen to help reduce fever and was effective fairly quickly. I had lasting effects through to the next morning.

                                                Patient had what appeared to be a vasovagal reaction.  She complained of feeling light-headed and nauseous about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  This continued for a short time and she also began to complain of feeling chilled and was noticeably diaphoretic.  I monitored her blood pressure, which was low on the initial reading and then eventually came up to a reading of 89/60 with a pulse of 73 at the point that her symptoms began to subside.  By approximately 45 minutes after the episode began, she reported feeling better and was able to stand and walk without symptoms.  She went home at that time with a friend.

                                                About an hour or hour and half after getting  my vaccine, my head became all fuzzy as though I had just finished drinking three alcoholic drinks. I am not someone that can handle my alcohol very well so by that point I&#39;m really out of it. JUST TO BE CLEAR though I was NOT drinking alcohol. It&#39;s just a metaphor. I could not think clear and was having difficulty communicating beyond simple words. About 30 minutes after this all started, I made the decision to not drive for the rest of the day because I felt my reaction time had decreased substantially.  While all of the head stuff was happening, my arm was also hurting, which I expected. However, the pain didn&#39;t stay localized to my deltoid. Instead it radiated down my arm and into my hand. It felt as though my hand had been stabbed with a knife, so my entire arm hurt but the focal points were in my hand and the injection site. The next day the effects were gone but I had a headache. Not a bad headache but it wasn&#39;t localized to a single part of my head.

I also experience blurry vision and vertigo that hasn&#39;t gone away.  -I have also developed headaches and recently I have an itchy rash on my neck.  -Since then it has been hard for me to focus and sometimes I feel like the world is in slow motion.

                                                Several hours after the shot, I began to feel very hot all over my face and body. I got very dry to the touch and I became extremely thirsty. I also had full body tremors. When I woke up the next morning (5/4) around 10 a.m., I had a fever, headache, and serious brain fog. My legs ached, especially my hips and knees. The intense thirst and dryness also persisted. I felt lightly nauseous on and off. I took an extra strength Tylenol and drank a lot of water before sleeping again until around 4 p.m.. Once I woke up, I was still suffering from all the aforementioned symptoms, but with less severity. I had another extra strength Tylenol and drank water and a sports drink. I ate a granola bar right after the Tylenol and started to feel a little better. Then I got really hungry, so I ate a muffin and drank an energy&#43; juice drink that had 80mg caffeine derived from green and black tea. I started to feel a lot better after that, though I was still weak and experiencing aching in my legs and hips. I took another nap from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. and then ate once more before going to sleep for the night around 1:30 a.m. I have woken up today (5/5) with a slight headache but no other symptoms save the injection site soreness that has also persisted since a few hours after the shot. A note for comparison: as reported, this is my 2nd dose. My first dose had no symptoms whatsoever aside from injection site soreness.

I took benadryl, and was relieved of these symptoms. Then, around 9pm that night, I developed a fever. The highest temperature I recorded was 101.9. I took Ibuprofen around 11pm, and was afebrile by 3am. I have not had any fevers since, and I did have to call off work New Year&#39;s day. I have had an intermittent, mild headache since receiving the vaccine as well,  but overall I feel fine.

                                                I had awful migraines that did NOT improve with Tylenol or Ibprophen.  My migraines had an aura to them on the 1/1/2021.  I was also nauseous and had a difficult time keeping food down.  I was also very tired and slept longer than I normally do.  I had my vaccine done on 12/30/2020 and the symptoms did not occur until 1/01/2021. An hour or so after the injection, my arm started to become sore. It was very sore until 1/3/2021. They lasted until 1/3/2021. Now I feel fine.

The itchiness and rash are new today, however a lump has been present since injection. The rash is directly above the lump. It may be unrelated, but I&#39;ve also been unusually drowsy (noticed before taking the benedryl).  I took benedryl and applied lotion to the rash. My pregnancy began July 4th and I was 28 weeks pregnant at the time of the vaccine. My estimated due date is March 25th, 2021. At the time of the adverse reaction, I am 29 weeks pregnant.

Next morning i woke up sweating and my heart rate was 130 and shortness of breath followed. I then developed a rash the same day which was red and bumpy i also felt really lethargic and fatigued.  Day three  the rash had a line straight through the middle of it and was itchy the rash was spreading horizontally.  After day three I felt  better with the only  side effect being shortness of breath from time to time.  Now on the 7th of Jan I develop the rash again except its raised, the line is back and it itches internally.  I don&#39;t feel bad , it&#39;s just concerning that it came  back stronger all the sudden. I don&#39;t know if I will be allowed to get the second dose.

I woke up a little before 1030PM shaking with chills and nauseated. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night, going between sweating and shaking. The next day 1/6/21 I was still unwell, didn&#39;t go into work, felt weak and sore the whole day and noticed my underarm of the arm I received the shot was swollen and painful,. Today 1/7/21, my underarm is still painful and swollen, but the nausea has subsided. Still slightly going between sweating and being chilled.

                                                On day 1 (day I was vaccinated) I experienced severe pain in my arm where I was injected with the vaccine 3 hours after receiving it. I couldn&#39;t use my arm for the rest of the day and had to take Tylenol to help with swelling and pain. Pain was dull and throbbing. The next morning I woke up to body chills, a low grade fever, muscle aches, vomiting, exhaustion/fatigue, coughing, and diarrhea. The injection site was still very tender, sore, and swollen with limited mobility. All symptoms subsided within two days other than fatigue and a sore arm. On day 3 I developed a cough that lasted 4-5 days. Other than a cough, I had no other symptoms after that. My arm was better with no pain and easy to use. Then on day 8 my arm started to swell again and I developed a distinct rash at the injection site. The skin around the area was hot to touch and very hard and tender. I took ibuprofen and rubbed out the arm to help. I contacted my provider and she examined the arm, concerned I was having a reaction and possibly developing cellulitis. On day 9 the rash spread to the whole upper arm and shoulder were hot to touch/feverish, painful, hard, and still swollen. The swelling has continued to move up my arm. I am seeking medical attention today on 1/7/21 for treatment of possible cellulitis.

                                                I had head pressure that felt like a headache In my temples and the back of my skull around 9-10 hours after the vaccine. Left arm pain starting about 11 hours after shot. Difficult to move arm without intense pain and intense pain at the slightest touch of the arm on or around the vaccination spot. Starting the morning after the vaccination, my glands in my neck were tender and aching like they do when I?m fighting off a cold, I had body aches that you would get if you had a fever for the entire day all over my body. I took ibuprofen that night and they started to go away and I felt hot like I was breaking a fever. I woke up the next morning which is 2 days after the vaccination and felt completely back to normal besides residual arm pain. This pain is bearable and I can move my arm with only a dull pain and I can touch the spot without intense pain however it is still painful.

                                                I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, January 5th at 9:00 AM. I felt fine immediately following the vaccine but quickly felt worse throughout the day. I developed a fever of 101.4F with medicine, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, and general malaise. I know these are all common symptoms, so I didn&#39;t worry too much. However, my fever has persisted. I stayed home from work Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday due to not feeling well and still having a fever. Thursday, I also developed pain in my armpit with movement and palpation. I am guessing that pain in related to swollen lymph nodes. Friday, the pain in my armpit seemed to spread into my arm. Most of my armpit and the upper inside of my bicep is extremely tender to movement and touch. Today, I still have some tenderness in my arm and my fever is still present. Throughout this week, my fever has remained around 100F, even with Tylenol and ibuprofen.   I contacted my PCP yesterday about my concern for my persistent fever and arm pain. They believe that because I tested positive for COVID-19 in October 2020, that I am reacting to the first dose of the vaccine as if I am receiving the second dose of the vaccine. They advised me to continue taking ibuprofen and Tylenol. I am worried that if I receive the second dose of the vaccine, I will be sick for longer.

At 2:30 AM (1/7) I was awoken with shivering chills, likely a fever. Fever was not confirmed until 8 AM (1/7) when my temperature was taken - 101.3F. I alternated Advil and Tylenol with minimal improvement. At 2 PM (1/7)  my temperature was still elevated at 100.8 F. Overall I was very fatigued and had a pounding headache in addition to chills. My fever broke around 7 PM (1/7), at which point my headache and chills were improving. By the next morning, my symptoms were mostly resolved, except for a mild headache which persisted throughout the day (1/8) but resolved by evening time.

                                                Patient only had muffin and coffee that day early in am. Had some arm pain after shot no other reaction.  Did go home felt some nausea . Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                Following the second phase around 5pm the intense feeling being extremely cold and despite being under 4 covers and a heated blanket I did not find relief. At this time the injection site was inflamed and painful to the slightest touch and beginning to experience a severe headache   I took Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL and ibuprofen 800. 5am I am waking up with a fever of 101.7, stiff hands, and a continuation of the headache and body aches from the night. I again took ibuprofen 800, and 2 Tylenols extra strength (as needed) every 4 hours,  and Nyquil Cold and Flu 30mL in the morning and evening.  My body temperature seemed to have fluctuated every hour being unbearably cold to blood boiling hot with every move I make painful to the point of being bed ridden and needing assistance to get up to go to the restroom.  My injection site has grown from the size of a quarter on Friday Morning 1/22 to  about the size of grapefruit by Sunday 1/24 . I have pictures documenting its growth.

                                                The day of the vaccine about 4 hours later, I started experiencing chest pain. It was not tightness or a heartburn feeling type of chest pain. I have asthma, and it is the type of chest pain I start feeling right before I get bronchitis, almost like breathing in mist and the irritation that comes from having a cough, but I had not had a cough that would have caused this sensation. The next day, I was extremely fatigued, had a headache, chills, started getting a cough, and was sent home early from work. The day after, Friday, I had a fever of 102 and was essentially bedridden. I started using my nebulizer and my dr called me in some prednisone. These symptoms continued through the weekend and began lifting that Sunday. However, on Monday, my lymph node under my ear started swelling on my left side (the same side as the shot), my ear became clogged, my sinuses on my left side had shooting pain every time I inhaled, and although I could breathe through my nostrils, they felt full and had immense pressure. Additionally my headache became worse and I began experiencing intense muscle pain right at the base of my skull on the left side near my occipital lymph node that was radiating into my head and making the headache and sinus pain worse. Now, 11 days after my first dose of the vaccine, I still have the ear pain, swollen lymph node under my ear/behind my jaw, sinus pain, muscle pain at the base of my skull, a headache, and extreme pressure in my head/sinus area that has not lifted. I started on an antibiotic Friday night (the 22nd) in hopes that this is a sinus and ear infection. Ibuprofen helps the headache slightly but makes the pressure in my head feel worse and makes the joints in my hands and forearms hurt and my fingers swell for some reason which has never happened before for me when taking ibuprofen.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

                                                Approximately a week after my first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, I developed a red welt at and around the site of injection on my left arm. The welt is very firm and slightly tender to the touch, blanches when pressure is applied, and occasionally itchy. My arm is also sore I am still experience extreme fatigue. No treatment or medications have been taken to alleviate these symptoms at the time of this report submission.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, I had redness around the injection site and a sore arm for about 2-3 days. I received the shot on a Tuesday, and by the weekend my arm felt fine. One week later (Monday 25th), I felt like I had a light fever. My temperature was 99.1F. Tuesday, my left arm where I received the injection was SO SUPER itchy. When I looked at it, there was a huge, red, swollen, bump. The area was about the size of a credit card. The area was also HOT to the touch even though the rest of my arm felt like a normal temperature. From Tuesday 26th through Wednesday 27th (time of reporting), I still have the big, red, hot bump at the injection site, and my fever fluctuates in between 99.1-100.4F. I contacted my doctor who believes it is most likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. He has advised me to take benadryl and tylenol, and if I still have the fever tomorrow, he will test me for strep, flu, and COVID. I have not taken the benadryl and tylenol long enough to see if there is any sort of impact. I should also mention that I get tested weekly for COVID at work, and my test from Monday January 25 has come back as negative.

At 10:30pm began to feel chills and body aches. 11:00pm  got very hot and sweaty, hands began to tingle, vision became fuzzy around the edges, felt like I was going to pass out. Experienced tachycardia, tachypnea, and headache. 12:20am- vomited. Restless sleep through the night, chills, fever (100.6-99.6 on Tylenol), body aches, joint pain, stomach ache, woke at 5:00am.  1/26- spent all day vomiting. At least once every hour. Continued tachycardia, tachypnea, stomach ache,  fever, headache, body aches,  and joint pain. At 7:00pm took Zofran and I stopped vomiting. Still nauseous. Could not eat all day.  1/27- woke up with headache and slight body aches but otherwise felt okay during the day. Was hungry and able to eat. Starting at 10:00pm my stomach began to hurt again. Experienced bloating, sharp stabbing pain and nausea. Felt like I needed to vomit or pass a bowel movement but could not do either. Took Zofran at 11:00pm, did not help in relieving my GI symptoms. Still on round-the-clock extra strength Tylenol. Could not eat all night.   1/28- woke up still with headache, and mild-moderate stomach pain.  Able to eat a couple bites of food.

Throughout the night arm pain got progressively worse and could not sleep due to extreme  pain and inability to move through range of motion, in addition to night sweats.  (did not have a fever). Woke up the next morning with a severe headache and nausea. Fainted around 10am (18 hours post vaccination). Headache and minor dizziness continued throughout the rest of the day.  By 24 hours post vaccine, no symptoms besides very minimal arm soreness.

                                                I received my second dose of the Moderna COVID vaccine at approx. 10:40 AM on Friday, January 29 at clinic. By 12:00 PM, I noticed that I developed facial swelling, which was most significant around my eyes, and I felt lethargic. Between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM, I  developed hives on my neck, chest, stomach, and arms, which prompted me to take 1/2 of a dose of 25mg Benadryl.  Nonetheless, the symptoms persisted and I began to experience dizziness and tightness in my throat around 4-5 PM, which was when I was advised by a nurse to go to the emergency room for treatment. I arrived at Hospital&#39;s Emergency Department around 6:00 PM and I was treated for &#34;Possible Allergic Reaction Major.&#34; I received diphenhydrAMINE (BENADRYL) injection 50 mg, famotidine (PF) (PEPCID) injection 20 mg, methylPREDNISolone sodium succinate (PF) (SOLU-MEDROL) injection 125 mg, sodium chloride 0.9 % iv bolus, and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) tablet 650 mg. I was discharged after 10:00 PM and sent home with a prescription for predniSONE 20 mg and famotidine 20 mg. My facial swelling and hives have gone down but neither have completely resolved since being discharged. I am also experiencing full body aches and fatigue at this time (3 PM on Saturday, January 30).

                                                I got the shot at about 7:25pm on Saturday and then was scheduled to work the next morning, Sunday, at 4:30 am. I had not felt great from the moment I got up on Sunday, and felt progressively worse throughout the day. I had really bad body aches and chills, to the point where I was shivering, even with three layers and a puffy coat on. I normally never get cold. I also had a really bad headache. By the time my shift was over at 1pm, I wasn?t even sure I could trust myself to drive home. Eventually I decided it was fine, but by the time I got home I felt so terrible that it took me at least 15 minutes to get out of the car. I took a hot shower and went to bed. I was shivering violently, even with lots of blankets, and couldn?t even sit up to drink some water. I laid in bed for hours, doing absolutely nothing and feeling miserable. I got up after 7:00 pm to eat some dinner and felt so nauseous that I was dry-heaving into the toilet.

                                                Moderate pain in injection site for first two days (02/02/2021, 02/03/2021). Nausea, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat, low-grade fever (~99°F) and persistent headache, and took Theraflu nighttime before bed on day two (02/03/2021). Temperature of 99.7°F throughout day three (02/04/2021); also, lower back pain, knee pain, sore throat with swollen lymph nodes and tonsils with white spots (did at-home test for strep-A, got a negative result), and persistent headache?this night I also took Theraflu nighttime. Day 4 (02/05/2021), I woke up around 7AM  with severe nausea and went back to sleep after having ginger ale; throughout the early afternoon I had mild lower back and knee pain, same throat and tonsil situation, mild headache, and diarrhea. I ended up drinking a lot of water and had a glass of emergen-c as well as taking two pepto bismol tablets. Less than an hour later, I threw up everything I?d consumed throughout the day (water, hot tea, and emergen-c, no food due to nausea). Tried eating plain white rice and drinking  beer that evening but I couldn?t keep it down. Day 5 (today, 02/06/2022), I woke up with only lower back pain, same tonsil/throat situation, headache, and a slightly higher fever- 100.2°F. So far no nausea.

After 2nd shot on 02/06/21, I had most symptoms listed. I got the 2nd dose at 9:03am and once I woke up from a nap at 1pm, most of the side effects had already started. I had severe pain at the injection site where I was unable to dress myself or do normal activities, severe muscle pain and soreness, severe chills, a fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, a mild headache, severe dehydration that remained throughout the day and night even though I drank almost 2 gallons of water, stomach pain and bloating, and nausea and vomiting that occurred in the middle of the night at 2am, and extreme fatigue. Even though I had fatigue, I was unable to sleep due to the pain. I finally took pain medicine at 8am on 2/07/21 to help myself go to sleep as well since I was awake for over 24 hours. I slept for 6 hours and woke up still having chills, muscle soreness, a slight fever, a mild headache, and pain at the injection site where I am still unable to lift my left arm and put clothes on.

The majority of these symptoms started around 12 hours after the vaccination, with fever, chills, headache and dizziness being the most prominent. Ibuprofen (200mg) was taken about 18 hours in (as was advised to only take within the first 24 hours). Most of the symptoms are gone now after 24 hours of vaccination and taking ibuprofen. While most other symptoms are gone, there is still continued fatigue, and slight headache and nausea.

For unknown reason the patient arrived to vaccine clinic on 2/9/21 without allergy skin testing or follow up. She reportedly told them that she was &#34;&#34;cleared by Occ health&#34;&#34; after her first reaction and the administering RN said that there was no flag on her chart so she was given the vaccine.  Unfortunately, immediately after she got it, she developed throat tightening and got zyrtec. The reaction progressed very quickly (minutes) to diaphoresis, panic, grabbing at throat saying she was suffocating, nausea, and difficulty verbalizing. She was diffusely red but no hives. They couldn&#39;t get a BP and O2 sat and temp were normal but they put her on a non-rebreather and gave her Epi. Rapid response was called and she was taken to the ED.

                                                Friday morning I woke up extremely fatigued. I saw stars in my vision and I had to lay in bed all day. I didn?t have energy to even eat. Saturday evening or Sunday morning I noticed red splotches along my torso. Sunday they began to itch and I still have them along my neck, back, upper and lower torso, and a few on my legs. I haven?t changed any environmental factors (no new lotions, creams, hair products, diet, or perfumes). Today I used Benadryl cream, but in the past I?ve been putting my regular, non-scented Aveno lotion and coconut oil.

Over the next few days, I became incredibly itchy and developed a rash on both of my arms. I now have what I think is considered, &#34;COVID Arm&#34;. There is a red circle around the injection site that is swollen, red, and tender. I then noticed the inside of my mouth was sore and I had blisters developing on the roof of my mouth near my gums. My throat is super sore and swollen and has a yellow pocket on the back of my throat. I am also having body aches under my arms near my ribs and back.

                                                10 minutes post vaccination during observation, patient fainted and did not rouse immediately.  I administered ammonia inhalant was used within 1-2 minutes of her LOC, and patient gained consciousness but was diaphoretic and pale.  Within 2 minutes of the ammonia inhalant, she began convulsing (full body convulsions, eyes rolled)  For 30-45 seconds.  She had continued LOC for 1-2 minutes, 15L O2 mask was administered, and patient slowly came in and out of consciousness for the next 5-10 minutes, bradycardic 35-45 bpm, BP 72/50, HR irregular, RR 16 BS clear.  At the time of observed convulsions, 911 was called and arrived within 10-12 minutes.  When EMS arrived, she remained pale but with some improved pallor, HR 45 bpm, and more alert.  Transported by EMS to hospital for eval.

Arm was very sore, hot to the touch, and swollen for nearly 3 weeks following the injection.  Second shot on 3/5 R arm, also developed a small red rash but was smaller and went away within a week. Within 24 hours of getting the vaccine, a high fever developed, fatigue, weakness, nausea, pain throughout my body, and migraines.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccine on 3/13 at 3:45pm and began experiencing symptoms on the day at 5:30pm including dizziness, nausea, fatigue and wiped-out exhaustion, drunk-like dazed and confused, body heaviness, and developed soreness in the muscle of the right arm where the injection had been administered. The symptoms progressed at 6:30pm to include general muscle soreness, muscle twitching on the right side of the body especially on the right upper thigh, increased appetite, malaise, headache, and chills in addition to the aforementioned symptoms. At 7:30pm the nausea and increased appetite improved with food and fluid intake but sleepiness, yawning, confusion, chills, and fatigue worsened at 8:30pm. Temperature at 9:30pm was 95.7 degrees Fahrenheit and a pale, green-like, clammy appearance was visible on the general skin. At 10:30pm the sleepiness reversed to restlessness and insomnia to the point of hyperactivity, and the appetite increased four-fold along with rash up and down the injected arm, numbness and tingling in the injected arm, chest discomfort with palpitations, anxiety, headache, stomach pain, malaise, and general limb edema which all persisted until I was able to fall asleep at 6:30am on 3/14. Many of the aforementioned symptoms improved upon wakeup time at 4pm on 3/14, but extreme sleepiness with nausea, dizziness, fatigue, head pain and right eye pain, and palpitations with chest discomfort persisted until 10am on 3/15, during which time only the nausea, dizziness, and fatigue persisted.

The symptoms did not go away or worsen so she left when released.  Around 7 the symptoms had progressed to tongue feeling heavy, sore throat, and some difficulty breathing (although her O2 fluctuated between 96-99).  She went to the ER, they administered IV fluids, Benadryl, Pepcid, and steroids.  Within a couple hours the symptoms had subsided.  As directed, we continued Benadryl and Pepcid for 24 hours.  After being off the Benadryl and Pepcid for 12 -15 hours the symptoms returned, she took one dose of both and now seems to be fine.

Woke up in a different spot with a bit of black eye from falling. Woke up and felt very out of it and not sure of things.

                                                Injection site pain, headache, and muscle pain. Muscle pain was mainly in the shoulders (more on the side of the injection), lower back, and in the legs. Lasted through the night and took a Tylenol 500mg tablet that next morning (3/18). Symptoms improved slightly, but did not got away and got a little worse as the day progressed (but still improved from the morning). Took another Tylenol that evening, felt better by bedtime, and feel much better today (3/19). Still have some arm soreness when I lift the arm my injection was placed in, but not too bad.

Doctor checked urinalysis, vaginal swab and hormonal bloodwork. All came back normal. Was sent to urgent care to have a covid test and flu test. Both came back negative.

                                                Patient reported no to having prior history of fainting or dizziness after receiving vaccine. Vaccine was administered at approximately 9:04 am and patient&#39;s boyfriend was administered at approximately 9:08. Upon return to his seat beside her at approximately 9:10 am, he noticed she was losing color and going limp. He called for help, and I assisted. The pharmacy team sent a Code White on the radio and several members of management responded to check on the scene. We moved the patient to the floor and applied ice packs to the neck and chest and removed her face mask for better circulation. The patient was wearing a thick sweatshirt so we attempted to increase air flow around her head and neck to cool her down as she was visibly sweating. The patient never lost consciousness or breathing and her pulse was always palpable. By 9:20 am, we had moved the patient from the floor to a sitting position then to a chair and provided her with a cold bottle of water and continued one ice pack on her neck. She stayed seated until 9:40 (34 minutes after her injection). She denied the need for an ambulance transport as she had her boyfriend here who could drive her.

The next morning, I had a severe tightening of the left side of my neck and shoulder, along with arm soreness. I saw my Physical Therapist and was told that it was a result of the vaccine. I was fine until I got the vertigo Friday evening. It came on really quickly and I&#39;ve never experienced it before. I was okay the next morning with the exception of a headache, which lasted for about a month after that. My doctor offered shots for them, but I couldn&#39;t take them due to my current meds. I was told to come back if they continue.

Some mild confusion and dizziness (though I have been experiencing cognitive issues for over a year now. I believe the fever is exasperating pre-existing symptoms). Some mild nausea and a mild headache. I am not completely back to normal yet (as of 7pm) but I do believe I will be fine as time goes on.

Concurrent medical conditions included Psoriasis. Concomitant products included USTEKINUMAB (STELARA) for Psoriasis.    On 05-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced COELIAC ARTERY COMPRESSION SYNDROME (Celiac artery was compressed) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MALAISE (feeling sick) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VOMITING (did not stop throwing up) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and NAUSEA (nauseated) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). At the time of the report, COELIAC ARTERY COMPRESSION SYNDROME (Celiac artery was compressed), MALAISE (feeling sick) and NAUSEA (nauseated) outcome was unknown and VOMITING (did not stop throwing up) had not resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       She gave her stool sample on 12 Apr 2021 and result will take 1 to 2 weeks, she was still throwing up on and off and she was not 100% better. She took ondansetron to treat her vomiting and nausea. She was concerned if she can she take 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine and what would happen if she miss the time limit.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Muscle stiffness - started an hour after vaccine and lasted about 48 hours, no pain medication or stretching helped, caused sleep issues due to not being able to get comfortable. Difficulty breathing - chest felt tight and felt like I wasn&#39;t getting enough oxygen in each breath so I had to pause to take deeper breaths.

                                                A few days after vaccination I had a high fever and began coughing so hard that I was throwing up. This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA; On 12/30/2020 I began experiencing soreness in my left arm along with a short period of chills and body aches. The next day, 12/31/2020, I noticed the injection site had a small, thumb-print sized red area around it. It seemed to have faded over the course of the next week however on the morning of 1/4/2021 I noticed soreness under my left arm pit. On 1/6/2021, the redness around the injection site increased and a second, distinct red spot developed on my left arm,  close to the injection site. Both spots are raised and hard but not itchy.  I put Cortizone cream on both spots and am monitoring its progress.

                                                awoke at 2 am  with nausea, chills, generalized pain. Immediately felt myself start to pass out or have a seizure- I am not sure which. Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

At 2 am on Saturday I took my temperature and it was 101.6 F, at 3 am it was 102 F. The body aches, joint pain, fever, and headache continued through the next day until about 6 pm on Saturday. Also on Saturday around 12 pm I began experiencing severe nausea, abdominal pain, and dizziness. At one point it felt as if I was going to pass out. All the major symptoms finally subsided Saturday night around 6 pm. Saturday till Sunday I have felt fatigued and sore but otherwise fine.

                                                On the morning of 1/8/2021 (exactly 6 days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine), I woke up with large hives concentrated mostly on my upper body (face, neck, chest, stomach). I tried taking various antihistamines (excluding Benadryl, which would later prove effective) to combat the hives, but they were largely ineffective. The hives shifted throughout the day, starting in my upper body and working their way down to my lower extremities. The next day, exactly one week after receiving the vaccine, I woke up with worse hives (now all over my body, mostly concentrated on my stomach, hips, and legs) and angioedema in my face. At this point, I went to the hospital and received a course of IV fluids/steroids/Benadryl/anti-nausea medication and all symptoms subsisted. Symptoms returned a few hours after discharge, where I continued an oral regimen of the aforementioned medications. The next day, 8 days after the initial dose, my symptoms were equally severe and coupled with gastrointestinal distress, feverishness (likely due to dehydration from the Benadryl) and nausea. This morning (1/11/2021), 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my hives have largely subsisted. In summation, starting 6 days after receiving my first dose of the Moderna vaccine, I experienced 3 full days and nights of severe hives and swelling.

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.  Suspect anaphalxis reaction given rapid decline in status while talking with her. epic pen at bedside immediately and then due to increasing heart rate and complaints of chest discomfort gave her epipen times one. Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

Hurt to raise above my shoulder. This went on till about 1/9/21. Then it went away nothing at my infection site then it came back which is what my concern is same as 1/7/21 itchy, swollen, red and bruised. Why I?m reporting is I?m wondering if I should take my 2nd dose or not from these reactions just at the injection site and only fatigue. This is Day 10. I also took pictures 1/8/21 and 1/15/21

I could have gone to bed at 1600. I could barely keep my eyes open.   ?8 hours post vaccine - fatigue was still very much present, moderate arm soreness with ROM and now to the touch. I felt very feverish, but was afebrile.   ?10 hours post vaccine - fatigue was a little better because I had taken an hour nap. Body aches and headache had set in, and I still felt feverish without a fever. I couldn?t stop shivering. I needed to be under multiple blankets with long sleeves, pants and thick socks on to feel even a little bit warm.   ?13.5 hours post vaccine - fatigue and body aches had worsened. It?s a struggle to go from laying to sitting and sitting to standing. I even fell back down to the couch a few times because I didn?t have the strength to stand up all the way. Right arm soreness has progressed enough that lifting up a water bottle was a struggle, and I could not lay on my right side. My temp is now 101.4°.   ?I tossed and turned between 0200-0630 shivering and aching all over. I slept with my entire body (even my head) under the blankets to try to stay warm. My head was throbbing. I got up at 0630 to take some Tylenol and woke up sometime between 0630 and 1030 drenched in sweat, so I?m assuming I had another fever.   ?30.5 hours post vaccine - it?s now January 1st. Body aches/stiffness, headache, fatigue, right arm soreness still very present. Switching any type of body position was a struggle. Temp is 101.2° now. I got out of bed at 1045 and got back in bed at 1200. I stayed in bed until 1845.   ?48 hours post vaccine - slight headache and right arm soreness. Right arm ROM is very doable again. My neck, shoulders and hips are sore, but much better. Fatigue is gone. I?m able to move around fine without any struggle. I still have SOB from March, but I feel like over the last 24 hours it?s worsened a bit.

                                                Erythema at injection site that started 3 days after vaccination and significantly worsened at day 8 post vaccination. Evaluated on 1/8/2021 with Greater than 10 cm in diameter erythema that was  warm and tender to the touch. Borders had been marked and there had been progression 0.5 cm-1cm over the course of 3 hours. Afebrile. Mild headache. Otherwise no other symptoms. Concerns for cellulitis given delayed reaction time and presentation. Treatment was on a Friday, clinic  closed on weekend. Therefore decision to treat with keflex and benadryl. Follow-up 1/15/2021, symptoms have all resolve, no more skin lesion.

                                                Pt c/o itching and tingling at site of injection.  Upon inspection RN observed redness, swelling, and irritation where pt had been scratching the site.  Offered to give pt benadryl on site, but pt refused because it &#34;knocks her out&#34; for 13 hours.  Advised to take a non-drowsy antihistamine when able, use cold compress, and stop scratching the site.  Pt was asked if she was having any other issues at that time, which she denied.  Telephone call made to patient at 4:18pm to follow up.  Pt stated she started to have an itchy throat and throat swelling and went to the hospital.  There she was offered Benadryl but declined.  She was given a steroid injection because she was having &#34;difficulty breathing&#34;.  Pt states ER doctor recommended a non-drowsy OTC antihistamine, and was unable to tell her if the difficulty breathing was an allergic reaction or due to anxiety.  Recommended following up with 2nd dose in 4 weeks but to see her PCP before that time to discuss.  Pt does not have PCP, so I recommended that she establish care and have an appt prior to her 2nd dose

                                                Shot given at noon- at 3:30PM I started having nausea, vomiting, headache, vertigo, muscle aches and feeling very tired. These symptoms lasted about a week. During the first week the injection site became very sore, swollen, hard lump and is very  hot. About two weeks after the vaccine other areas of my body started getting red, swollen, hot patches as well. I am still having to do treatments for the rashes and my skin feels like it is on fire and is constantly itchy.

                                                After about two hours my arm pain was so intense it felt like it was nearly broken and continued to feel worse. I had EXTREME headache and nausea which nearly led to vomiting but kept having to hold it down while alternating between Advil and Tylenol and Tums just to feel a little relief. Pain medications did not help substantially for the first 36 hours. I felt bed bound , had no energy to even move to pick up the TV control a few feet away from me. I had SEVERE chills, and still have them nearly 56 hours out with the headache and nausea still prevalent . I had such bad body aches and dizziness. Have had a hard time getting sleep because of the intensity of my symptoms. Absolutely has been the worst ever and I would NEVER get this shot again. Y?all need to do better. This is completely unacceptable for this to be side effects experienced by people even if it?s less than 10% experiencing the severity I felt. This is so messed up on so many levels. I?m going into medicine myself and although I believe in vaccines, this is not one I will be advocating for until research gets it together and provides a vaccine that is safer for people to receive. Completely anxious and worried and scared as to how my next few days and weeks will go especially with how severe my side effects have been and the news articles showing how some people seem to be dying within hours or days of the Moderna and Pfizer shots. Unacceptable. I can?t believe the amount of fear for my life I have right now.

Took Tylenol but the fever continued to rise. By 12 noon it went up to 104. Contacted the immunologist on call   who prescribed antibiotics and took Naproxen with Celebrex 400 mg. Eventually by 9 pm or so the fever went down. Took Tylenol. In the middle of the night, I vomited. The next day started off with 99 and after taking another Tylenol, it did not come back. The headaches continued with fatigue for about 7-10 days. Currently working with the immunologist to figure out if I need to be pre medicated and post medicated before the 2nd shot.

My appetite has gone down immensely, and when I DO eat, I immediately have diarrhea afterwards.  I have chills followed by feeling overheated.

                                                around 4AM of 01/06/21 (approximately 10 hours after receiving injection) I woke up with stomach cramps, feeling as if I needed to have a bowel movement which is extremely unusual at that hour. I went to the bathroom and ended up having extreme diarrhea. Went back to sleep, proceeded to wake up at 7am for work (I work at a hospital). Went to work, temperature upon arrival to work at 8am was 96.7. Didn&#39;t start to experience any other symptoms till around 10-11am. Developed a headache and thought, &#34;hm this is weird, I haven&#39;t had a headache since I had COVID but I hope it goes away soon.&#34; Then I went to lunch at noon and everything hit me all at the same time - freezing and sweating profusely, headache became so debilitating that it was burning/hurting my eyes, uncontrollably shaking, felt so weak (body aches all over, everything hurt). Took my temperature while I was at home for lunch and it was 101.5 and my heart rate was 160 (my heart rate is usually high because I take a stimulant but it is never that high). Went back to the hospital because I wanted to go to the ER and needed to get the rest of my belongings anyways. The ER physician and staff found the same things when doing initial vitals - high fever and heart rate. I made the ER physician aware of the fact that I had just received the vaccine the night before while also just having had COVID less than one month prior. I was instructed to go home at that point to get rest and recover. For the rest of the day on 01/6/21 and all of 01/7/21 I had to take off work because of adverse symptoms and effects. For all of 01/7/21 I was extremely fatigued and the headache never went away until 01/08/21.  On 01/08/21 I returned to work and symptoms diminished.

                                                Vaccine given 01/27/21 at 6pm, symptom onset began around 6am on 01/28/21. I work nights so this was the end of my workday. Normally I stay up for a bit, but I felt achy and fatigued so I went to bed early. I woke up around 10am with a fever of 101.4 degrees, administered acetaminophen and went back to sleep. Woke up at 1pm and temp had dropped to 100.3, administered acetaminophen again and slept some more. My temp hovered around 100.3 until about 3pm on 01/29/21 when it dropped to 99.8. Around 6pm on 01/29/21 and about 48 hours after vaccination, my temp dropped to 98.9 and I went back to work. Along with fever I experienced headache, chills, skin sensitivity (likely due to the fever as that&#39;s a typical comorbidity for me), and body aches. I also had minor injection site side effects including redness and pain.

I took Tylenol as a tx, but this kept me awake until about 5:00am.  From 5:00am to 10:30am I was able to fall back asleep and woke up feeling back to normal.  Around 11:30am I showered and noticed a hard lump on my supraclavicular the size of a golf ball that was never observed before. This lump is still present on 2/1 and is planned to be checked as a precautionary measure by my PCP on 2/3.

Woke up next morning with my fever maintained at 101 and a pounding throbbing headache. The injection site is also hard and red, with the bump increasing in size. I took Tylenol and slept then woke again at 6pm 2/2 with a 100.7 fever and body aches. Took more Tylenol and went to bed. This morning 2/3 I feel about 90% back to normal. The bump on my arm however is growing in size and more painful.

By around 6:00pm on 01/31/2021, I started experiencing fatigued, what felt like a tension headache,  and cold to the point of shivering. I also started experiencing aching all over my body. At around 8:00pm, my body temperature was at 100.2 degrees Fahrenheit (sublingual measurement). By 10:00pm, my body temperature was 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit. I alternated between feeling really cold to feeling hot to the point of sweating through my sheets throughout the night.  I took an initial dose of acetaminophen 1000mg PO at  around 6pm, and continued taking an additional acetaminophen 500 mg PO every 2-3 hours until 4 am. In total, I took 3500mg of acetaminophen.   By 1pm on 02/01/2021, my flu-like symptoms had resolved. I continued to have a low level headache and a sore left arm until 02/02/2021.

My upper body in general (from the waist up) it was very painful, very hard to carry stuff. The next day I started with nose bleeds. I was feeling a little dizzy throughout the day. I believe because of the blood loss (substantial). I had headache and felt nauseous throughout the day. The nose bleed was very very heavy, I don&#39;t have nose bleeds. It started getting better with each day and it lasted about 6 days.

                                                I had a headache, extreme fatigue, nausea, aches, fever, and chills for 24 hours beginning at 8:00pm the day that I received the vaccine. I had a burning sensation and lypmhadenopathy in the armpit of my injection arm, significant pain at injection site, with slight tingling and numbness radiating down to the hand of my injection arm as well. I took 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours for 24 hours, which provided minimal symptom relief. All symtpoms were relived within 72 hours of receiving the vaccine.

                                                Monday morning woke up with arm soreness, headache, fatigue and feeling slightly warm. After a few hours, and a nap, I had a fever of 101.9 along with chills, severe fatigue and severe nausea.  After a 2 more hours my fever raised to 103.3, I had muscle cramping in my legs, nausea, headache and fatigue.  All of those symptoms lasted until 9pm that night when the fever resolved.  The following day I still had slight warmness, a temperature of 99 and headache, chills and fatigue/weakness.  All of those symptoms, continued until Thursday evening.  On Friday morning I woke up with no headache (only mild intermittent head pains), mild fatigue and arm soreness.  Every day this week my heartrate has been higher than normal with the average rate around 120-130BPM. This was at rest, without any caffeine or other stimulants.  I took alternating tylenol (1000mg) and ibuprofen (800mg) all 4 days.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                Starting around 9AM I began noticing a high heart rate while inactive. My heart rate was at 140 bpm (measured manually and with Watch). Normal for me is between 80-100 bpm. My heart rate remained high (between 120-140 bpm) for about 6 hours. I did not notice it go down to 100bpm until the next day. The high heart rate was never provoked by any physical activity. I rested in bed or in a chair all day and drank lots of water. Throughout the day I had fluctuating periods of feeling very hot and very cold. I took 1000mg of Tylenol every 4 hours throughout the day.  I also experienced expected side effects (chills, joint aches, muscle aches, nausea, headache, fever (100F w/ Tylenol)).

I had my doctor call in Valaciclovir to help me get rid of them it was so bad. I took the Valaciclovir the day after my vaccine, on 1/16/21 and I was STILL breaking out in new cold sores a week later and had to take another dose of Valaciclovir.  My arm was so sore and I couldn&#39;t move it higher than my hip for two days. I was lethargic for two days and slept for a total of 40 hours over the course of the two days following injection. I also had a headache for about a week after the injection.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

                                                The first vaccine I only had mild arm pain which went away after a few days, exactly 7 days later I had a delayed localized reaction (extreme swelling size of a golf ball, redness, itching, hot to the touch). I spoke with my primary and he recommended to still get the second vaccine. The second vaccine the swelling came on almost immediately (about 2 hours after). It has now been two days since I have had the shot and my arm is now double the size of my muscle. (I am petite, 5?3 and 107 lbs) so my arms are tiny. My arm is red, hot to the touch, swollen and itchy. I have had a fever of 102.8, the lowest I have gotten it down is 101.2 with around the clock Tylenol. Other side effects: vomiting, chills, high fever, EXTREME joint pain. I?m concerned about the localized reaction (I would call it localized allergic reaction). I have photos I?m not sure if I can send them.

The lump feels slightly smaller in size.

Patient was immediately informed of the vaccine error and that according to the CDC there was no indication for further vaccination at this time. Patient agreed.

Tylenol was taken every 6 hours, only suppressing fever and aches slightly for about 4 hours after taking it.

I woke up at 1am with a temp of 102.7, drenched in sweat, and shaking so badly my partner thought I was having a seizure. I did not seek treatment, because I was able to sleep after taking Tylenol and having my partner use cold washcloths and ice packs on my neck, forehead, back, and chest. I also attempted to take a shower, but I was so weak I required assistance to walk to the bathroom. I had similar side effects the next night although less intense.

                                                I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 1/27/2021. I then went to receive my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 2/17/21. However, when I was about to get the vaccine, I was advised that I was getting the Moderna. I told them that since I got the Pfizer for my first dose, I would need Pfizer for my second dose. However, they insisted that it was okay and unnecessary. I then told them to please go check to confirm since I said that I needed the Pfizer for my second dose. They came back 15 minutes later and stated that I was correct and that I did indeed need the pfizer for the second dose and that I would be receiving Pfizer. After I had received the vaccine, when I requested for documentation for my vaccination card, they insisted that it was not necessary and sent me away despite me insisting that I needed it. I had the regular COVID vaccine side effects (body aches, chill, fatigue, headache). When I contacted the  Immunization Information System to get the LOT number, I was advised that it looks like I received the Moderna on their system. This is EXTREMELY CONCERNING and NOT SAFE and ILLEGAL to be giving someone an immunization and saying it is one thing and then documenting it as another. Now I am not sure what vaccine I received, if I am protected, and what to do next. CDC,  211 and my state has not been able to help me with this.

                                                I had no immediate reactions to the vaccine. About an hour after my injection I developed a low grade headache. The next day, 2/26, I woke at 7am with a headache still. The headache and fatigue worsened through the day (2/26/21).  Around 3:00pm I started experiencing waves of dizziness. By 4pm I had begun experiencing temporary loss of feeling in  various body parts. Each part&#39;s loss of feeling came and went separately and lasted about 2-5 minutes each. I experienced this in my left facial cheek, both wrists and hands, and my right hip. I had a coworker drive me home and by 5pm I had a migraine with severe sinus/head pressure and a fever of 99.4. My average resting body temperature is 97.4. I slept from 6:00pm friday till 10:30am on Saturday (2/27). When I woke I still had a headache, but no longer a migraine.  I spent 2/27 dizzy, weak, and achy but no more episodes of lack of feeling in body parts or a fever.  I have not experienced soreness in the arm I got my injection in, but I noticed on Tuesday March 2nd that I my injection site is very swollen, red and itchy. The swelling and redness (to my knowledge) has not gotten worse or better since then, but the itching has gotten worse and the actual puncture wound is now visible since yesterday (3/4) whereas it was not visible anytime  before  that.

I woke up super nauseous at 4:00am and quickly vomited afterwards. From there on I slept for 10-30 minutes in between vomiting for 3 hours.

Then later in the evening at around 4 pm began feeling muscle spasms in my chest and abdomen area which I had not experienced before, so around 7:30pm I went to the hospital for treatment and was given ibuprofen again and also a lidocaine cocktail which relieved my symptoms.

My whole body (muscles) felt sore and I felt sick-ish  with body fatigue, headache, body soreness (I felt like how one might feel on day 2 or 3 of having a cold.) I only threw up twice in the morning between the hours of 8am and 10am, and I didn&#39;t throw up nor did I feel nauseous the rest of the day.  I rested and ate plain foods and felt much better the next day.

Then the following day I felt better but had a annoying, constant headache all day. Then when showering I found a tender lump in my right armpit (same side as my vaccine). I?m pretty sure this is a swollen lymph node, and thought I should report it since I don?t have a spleen and I developed it pretty soon after the vaccine.

I went to bed and my body wouldn?t warm up under the covers. I woke up around 1:16am feeling very hot. I was running a fever of about 102F. After removing the covers and using a cold compress it dropped to the 99F range and fluctuated quickly between about 98.7F-99.9F. I continued to have chills and feel very cold during this fluctuation. When I would stand to go to the bathroom my body would be very weak and I would get almost lightheaded.  I fell asleep by about 3:30am. The following morning my fever was completely resolved. I continued to feel weak during the first half of the day with some mild intermittent nausea. By the second half of the day my side effects resolved entirely.

This progressively got worse during the day, including a hard lump and was itchy. Approx. 6 hours later, I became fatigued and had body aches all over. At 30 hours post second vaccine, I started to run a temperature. It got up to 101.5 F, I took Tylenol and went to sleep. By the morning, it was gone. The next 2 days, I had a headache and very sore arm. On day 3 I developed a very sore armpit/under arm area on the same arm as I received the vaccine. As I&#39;m writing this (4 days later), my arm is still sore &amp; itchy and my underarm area is still sore, but no fatigue or fever.

                                                Mild muscle soreness in right arm (injection site) beginning within an hour post-injection, noticeable with movement. Took 400mg of ibuprofen before bed.  At 10.5 hours post-injection (middle of night), right arm soreness was moderate-to-severe at rest and severe, almost unbearable, with movement. Mild muscle soreness and joint pain were present throughout the body; joint pain (wrist, elbows, and knees) was an issue prior to injection and was exacerbated during the event.  I also experienced chills and sharp headache pains. Took 400mg of ibuprofen, 1000mg of acetaminophen, and secured right arm with a pillow, which allowed me to fall back asleep.   At 17.5 hours (following morning), muscle soreness was present in right arm alone and was mild at rest, moderate with movement. All other symptoms were gone. Experienced fatigue that afternoon (approx. 24 hours post-injection), treated effectively with a short nap and vitamin D (through sun exposure).  On the 2nd full day post-injection, right arm muscle soreness is minimal with movement.

I have a history of these, but they are almost never so intense.  About 25 hours after the injection, I began having intense pain in the center of my chest. It dissipated and returned a couple of times over the next 5 hours or so. The pain was so great that it was difficult to stand, and I came close to passing out. I have not experienced this severe level of pain since about 30 hours post-injection.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 17-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainted), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)). On 18-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol). On 19-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) and FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug). On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period) and PALLOR (Pale as a ghost). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainted) had resolved, SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work), SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol), FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period), PALLOR (Pale as a ghost), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)) outcome was unknown and DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) had not resolved. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported. Treatment medications include Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) for diarrhea for 1.5 days (unknown dose/frequency).  Patient waited out 20 minutes post-vaccination and then went to the bathroom. When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

I felt cold and feverish though did not have a fever. Took 1 g of Tylenol which helped chills and muscle aches. This morning (next day) I am still having muscle soreness so I will probably take another 1 g of Tylenol.

I started to feel chills and back pain around 7 pm.  Throughout the night my arm was throbbing and I had a hard time sleeping. I woke up around 12 am to use the restroom. My body felt VERY heavy and weak. I woke up today (1 day after the shot) and felt better.  However, my arm still has severe pain and I experiencing fatigue. I also feel like the back pain goes in and out.

However, I woke up at 4am the next day with intense cold chills, suspected fever (no thermometer to confirm), and it felt like my arm had been stabbed (much worse pain than usual flu vaccine discomfort).  I took some ibuprofen and Nyquil.  The next morning when I woke up I felt extremely fatigued and had whole body muscle aches.  The cold chills returned around 2pm.  I had a slight head ache.  I took some Dayquil and rested.  The 2nd day after my vaccine I still had some fatigue and muscle aches, but no more episodes of cold chills or fevers.  I continued to take ibuprofen and Dayquil.  The 3rd day after my vaccine I woke up feeling a bit more back to normal and the pain at my injection site was pretty much gone.

My temperature was 99.5 consistently throughout the night but did not exceed this number. I took Advil twice throughout the night which relieved some of the headache. My symptoms stopped about 12/13 hours later.  Symptoms felt very similar to the flu.

After one dose of 650 mg acetaminophen my temperature went back down to 98.6 F. The next day 1/7/21 I did not have a fever; I still had mild chills and headache and pain at the site of injection. For the pain I took 1,000 mg of acetaminophen at morning and at night which eased the pain. The following day 1/8/20 I did not have headache or chills and had very mild pain which was tolerable.

She states these symptoms have somewhat improved, though she has been experiencing increasing nausea since yesterday and continues to feel that way. She states that she does not believe she is pregnant, she has an IUD. She also noticed some body aches yesterday, continuing this morning, but they seem to be improving. They do improve greatly with ibuprofen at home.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

                                                Arm became incredibly sore about 4 hours after injection.  The soreness was so intense that I felt nauseous when I moved my arm or bumped the injection site. About 11 hours after the injection a severe headache began. Roughly 19 hours after the injection muscle fatigue and overall tiredness began, headache remained as well as arm soreness. About 30 hours after the injection all the symptoms above were present in addition to a fever. Currently it is about 54 hours after the injection and only a slight headache and slight arm soreness remain.

                                                I am currently 8 weeks and 1 day pregnant. Wednesday evening after 24 hours after the vaccine i developed redness and swelling at th injection site. I developed a low fever of 101.1F and had chills. By the  next morning your symptoms were relieved.  I did get diagnosed last Tuesday with Covid which was one week after the Moderna vaccine. A few days after I got diagnosed with Covid, the swelling returned at the injection site.   As of today I have no redness or swelling anymore at the injection site.

These symptoms continued through the night and into the next day with periods of feeling extremely hot and sweating and having chills like ice and sweating.

I went back into bed at about 10:40pm still shivering. When I woke up around 3 or 4  in the morning I was no longer experiencing the shivers.   The following day on Friday, I felt fatigued, but it was hard  to tell what from, because I was also experiencing the first day of my menses.  The fatigue felt different because it was my entire body as opposed to the fatigue I feel just in my legs during my menstruation.

                                                After receiving the vaccine 1/9 in my left arm, I had normal side effects of chills, body aches, and fatigue. On 1/14, I noticed the left supraclavicular lymph node was enlarged, no pain with palpitation. On 1/15 the underside of my left arm was itchy but no visible rash. On 1/16 the arm was still itchy and the lymph node was more enlarged. No neck or axillary nodes were enlarged. On 1/17 in the morning I woke up with a large red rash on my left deltoid. It was not itchy, but as the day went on was more red, raised, and warm. The node in my neck was causing some neck discomfort. I presented to Urgent Care and was treated for a local reaction. I was given a steroid cream to use on my arm and was told to take an OTC antihistamine. I have been using the cream for 2 days and so far the rash is resolving but is still visible. The node has not yet decreased in size.

Full body ichy rash stared  4 nd day, after fever aches went away.  Went to my dr on 1/16 since rash did not go away, kept spreading getting worse all over my body.  Dr diagnoised it as some areas posrisis  other areas as eczema.  I have never had either in my life, and have no allergies to anything.  She told me it may go away, or i may have it for life, the moderna triggued an auto immunne disorder.  she gave me a shot of predinsone,  and scripted cream.  Dr said I should not get the 2nd dose of vaccine, and to come back 3 times a year for the predisone shot to keep it under control

                                                Starting 01/16/2021, there was itchiness and a cluster of red papules/wheals that showed up on my right back. The rash continued to spread the next few days with increasing papules and itchiness. The rash is localized to my torso. Most are on my right abdomen and right back but is now spreading to my left side and upper back. There are also a few under and on my right breast and below both my armpit areas. The rash is still erythematous, with some that are papular and some appearing like vesicles. There is still itchiness and some stinging sensation. I am currently on Hydroxyzine 25MG at night and Zyrtec OTC during day but it has only been 2 days since I started the meds. The itch does wake me up at night time. So far the antihistamines have helped a bit with the itch. At the same time, I appear to have a sore throat though it feels more like a mild swelling of my throat as whenever I swallow it feels sore.

                                                About 30 min after the vaccination I felt dizzy. It felt almost like I had gotten up too quickly and felt dizzy, that kind of dizziness. Lots of soreness on the injection site the day of the vaccination and also going down the arm if I tried to lift my arm it was painful, everything else was fine until 4:30PM when I started feeling chills and feverish. Around 9PM the cold chills were so awful I started crying because it was so uncomfortable. I took some Tylenol and it knocked me out. I felt cold and hot during the night. About 7AM the next morning I had hives, on my chest, arms and legs (red itchy, swollen) the chills have gone away in the morning. I took an Allegra around 8AM and it did work after 30 min to an hour. Then I went to see my allergist around 11AM and  the itchiness and redness had gone down a lot but the itchiness was still there. The allergist told me to take some more Allegra that day and it ended up working.

                                                I started to notice on Tuesday, January 19th, that there was a red bump on my arm. It looked more like a mosquito bite to me and was not bigger than a quarter. It didn?t feel itchy but I thought nothing of it. I noticed when I got home it was twice as big but I still felt no pain. It appeared that my arm was also swollen. The following day on Wednesday, it has grown in size again covering my arm, maybe the size of four quarters. Throughout the day it felt a bit hot, especially when I touched it. It did not feel itchy and I didn?t feel any pain. I felt a bit tired this day so I?m not sure if it was because of it. The redness has gone down today (Friday, January 22nd) however the mark is still big and in the shape of a square now. The outer part of the mark is more red and raised up, like it has a red border.

                                                At the time of the vaccination, I experienced a sore arm for about 48 hours, and muscle aches and chills for about 12 hours.   7 days after receiving the vaccination, I noticed a rash at the injection site. It was somewhat itchy for 2 days, and continue to grew in size for 4 days. The rash was improved by taking over the counter allergy medicine (Allegra 24 hour). It was slightly raised and swollen the first 2 days, but decreased over the following days although the rash itself got larger.  I did not seek medical attention because I did not have any other symptoms or side effects with the rash, and was able to self-treat with allergy meds.

                                                Despite not having any abnormal reactions immediately following the vaccine (except for pain at site of injection, muscle aches, chills - which went away after 3 days), a week after the vaccine, I noticed that my left arm was hard around the injection, and a bit itchy. I massaged it a bit, and it started hurting - that night, I woke up from the pain, and had to take ibuprofen to sleep (probably 4/10). The area of also warm, red, and swollen, so I iced it, which made the pain better. This went on all of Friday as well - I took some Benadryl, and that seemed to make it better (or it might have just made me sleepy enough that I didn&#39;t notice, I&#39;m not sure). I measured the area of redness at 8.5cm at longest diameter. Saturday, the pain was mostly gone, but the skin remained red and itchy, although the redness was a bit faded. Some small bumps appeared, however. There was also a second area of redness and pruritus measuring 4.5cm that was located a bit more upwards on the arm than the original area of redness. Sunday, the redness in both areas continued to fade, but the bumps were noticeable and more itchy than before. The hardness seems to have resolved almost completely, although the area is still a bit sore when massaged.

Went to sleep woke up with 101 fever, body ached pain, and chills. Took ibuprofen and felt a little better. Then noticed the spot on arm got bigger and mother drew border, then this morning no fever but feeling uncomfortable joint pain and now the spot is bigger than the border. I went to the urgent care today 1/25/2021 after reading CDC recommendation and was diagnosed with cellulitis and was prescribed penicillin.

                                                My arm started to hurt at the injection site at about 7PM.  It hurt to touch and put pressure on it.  I woke up around 1AM on the 31st feeling cold and went back to sleep, but I couldn&#39;t lay on the arm that had the injection due to the pain in my muscle.  I woke up again at 3AM with chills, cold sweats, and body aches; it felt like I had a fever but I don&#39;t own a thermometer so I can&#39;t say for sure.  Later in the day on the 31st, I did not have an appetite and when I tried to eat, I experienced nausea.  Even the slightest touch to the injection site caused pain and I couldn&#39;t raise that arm.  My fatigue, aches, loss of appetite, nausea, and chills lasted until January 1st.  The pain in my arm lasted for another week or so before I could lay on it or touch it.  To this day, if I scratch the injection site or accidentally bump into it in the exact spot I received the shot, it will cause pain that I did not experience before.

I was a little feverish: 99.9 to a little before 100F.  Then on Saturday I had a pain on my left side from my arm all the way up to my neck, and it was really hurtful. And I also had it on my right side not so strong as the left side.

                                                I experienced fever, chills, fatigue, muscle aches and headache after 9 hours from receiving my second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The pain was so severe I almost went to the ED and had to take off work the following day. My temperature was as high as 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit. I took acetaminophen but this did not help the pain. However, this only lasted less than 24 hours and I made a complete recovery. I have not experienced any issues since.

I took my temp and it was 100.3F . I starred with body aches and I took a Tylenol. My fever was gone about 3AM next morning and I was able to sleep the rest of the night and when I woke up I was very tired, no fever and just body aches. About 8 or 9PM the next day I was feeling normal again.

                                                Woke up around 5AM with a severe headache and tenderness at injection site. Throat was also very dry. Was not able to go back to sleep due to pain. Checked temperature around 7AM and it was at 99.6. Took a rescue medication for the headache. Headache still has not gone away. If not drinking something, throat becomes dry within minutes. Dizzy when standing and it is exhausting to move/walk around. Checked injection site around 9:30AM, site is very red and swollen, redness is about the size of a strawberry. Have the chills. Checked temperature at 9:40AM and temperature is now at 101.3. Heart is also pounding and beating very fast.  Called local urgent care to determine if medical assistance was needed, they were vague and said they do not know how/if they could help or treat me but I was welcome to make an appointment with a current wait time of 90 to 120 minutes.

                                                I received the vaccine around 2:30/3 PM. The same night I began feeling as if my throat was itchy around 11 PM. I took a Zyrtec because I thought my friends dog was giving me a little allergies. 20 minutes later my throat itch got progressively worse to where I started to feel a little wheezy and harder to breathe. My arm where the vaccine was felt itchy. I had a rash all on my left arm and upper chest where I had received the vaccine. Immediately, I took a benadryl then went to sleep. Around 3 AM I woke up uncontrollably shivering. My fiance was able to get me a heater because I was so chilled with shivers but was sweating profusely. These shivers lasted about an hour to where I finally just went to sleep. I woke up around 7 AM with a pounding headache so I finally decided to take my temperature. It was 102 F. I ran a fever all day and brought it down to 100 with ibuprofen.  I ran a slight fever the next day as well with extreme fatigue.

I had severe chills, severe body aches, a mild fever, and extreme redness and swelling at the injection site. The side effects kept me out of work for one shift. The chills, body aches, and fever subsided within 36 hours, the severe redness and swelling at the injection site has continued to persist. I took Tylenol 1g q8hr for the side effects.

I kept moving my legs because I was afraid I was going to lose feeling in them. I got an X-ray and it showed there is nothing wrong with my back and I concluded it has to be from the vaccine because it has resolved for the most part after 3 weeks. I was extremely fatigued for 3 days and my left cervical and right axillary lymph  nodes were swollen. I had a huge welt at the injection site for 2 weeks and now there?s still a bruise there. I am afraid to get my second vaccine because I don?t want to lose feeling in my legs. I need guidance from someone who knows a lot about this vaccine because no one is able to give me guidance.

When I got up, I felt very weak and my head was foggy. I also kept stumbling when I walked. I drank plenty of water in case I was dehydrated and ate protein, but these symptoms lasted the entire day. The next morning I woke up with a mild headache but mostly felt normal.

Later that same day at 8 pm in the evening  my right arm where i received the injection started hurting. I had a small bump around the injection site It was also tender to the touch. I Iced my arm I also applied hot compress to the injection site. I also had some chills as well. I took acetaminophen to relieve the discomfort. Today is 1/2/2021 and i am feeling a lot better. My arm has stopped bothering me. I don&#39;t have a bump around the injection site and it isn&#39;t tender to the touch. I have also stopped taking the acetaminophen and i don&#39;t have any chills. I only had this reaction for one day.

                                                Pt had fatigue yesterday and went to sleep. She woke up on the bathroom floor and was unaware of how she arrived there. She called 911. They came and assessed her. She was stable and was no need to be transferred. She is afebrile and her only symptoms is headache. She will continue to monitor and call back if anything changes. I recommended that she go to urgent care.

                                                Approximately five minutes after receiving the shot, I began to feel a burst of pain rush through my entire left arm. A few seconds afterwards, I started to feel nauseated. Immediately, I felt weak, light-headed, and tired. I began to sweat profusely, as well. I could barely move my arm to flag down one of attendants who was monitoring us. She asked me what was wrong, and I tried to describe what was going on, but I could barely talk or keep my eyes open. She radioed for help and the paramedics came over to me. They wanted to move me to a private room and asked if I could walk. I tried to walk there, but I started to fall so one of the paramedics hoisted me up to help me. They asked me some questions will they were waiting for a stretcher, all of which I could hear and understand, but I was unable to response to. The stretcher came and I laid down, but I was already starting to feel better by then. I was very out of it, but I think this entire process took maybe 10-15 minutes. I laid there for maybe another 15 minutes, and I began to be able to talk again and open my eyes. I tried sitting up and that went alright. I answered some questions for them while they took my blood pressure, monitored my pulse, and took my temperature. After another 15 minutes or so, I felt well enough to walk back to my office in the Health Department. I didn&#39;t have any other problems for the rest of the day.

                                                About one hour after injection: I had a burning sensation in chest and throat and swelling feeling; I felt a bit of throat swelling. I got very tired about two hours after and arm pain. The throat and chest burning/swelling sensation slowly dissipated within an hour or so. Around 4 pm, I got pretty bad heartburn - very rare for me. Very distinct heartburn feeling; uncomfortable and that lasted about an hour. I had body aches at night time before I went to sleep. The next day I woke up feeling fine. One week later, I had another response. I had my throat start to swell again and this time it was worse. I had itchiness on my arm on the 6th night but I didn&#39;t really notice it but that seventh day, I realized there was a rash and itchiness in my arm. I had broken out all over my face - tiny pimples had broken out. I contacted an allergist - I was getting scared about my throat. The allergist said they had seen this a few times after the vaccine - told me to take Pepcid and Benadryl. I did that and that took away the feeling in my throat and made me feel better. I continued both those OT meds for 3 or 4 days. On fourth day, I started getting throat swelling again and the rash on my chest  - these were more mild symptoms than earlier but I called the allergist and he advised I take Pepcid and and Zyrtec instead of Benadryl  for three or four more days. That helped. After that I seemed to be good. On 13th of January - shortness of breath and chest pain. I spoke with Dr and got a COVID test. I had my inhaler at that point (I haven&#39;t had asthma in  years and I had to take the inhaler a couple of different times throughout this time). 14th of January - Chest pain. 22nd of January - Chest Monday. On Monday, the 25th, I started taking - in advance of my second dose  of Moderna- Zyrtec  and Pepcid twice a day on the 25th; twice a day on the 26th - on morning of 26th, I took Zyrtec again an hour before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine. I got the 2nd dose on the 26th. (The days that I had chest pain - I took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.)

                                                As soon as I got the vaccine I was able to taste the vaccine,. Within 5 minutes I felt dizzy and within 15 minutes I couldn&#39;t feel my arm.  I got a rash throughout my whole arm, and was warm to touch as well as a tingly sensation in my whole arm.  It passed on to my right arm and started losing sensation and the tingly feeling started as well. Within 45 minutes I started breaking out throughout  my whole body, within 1hr 15min. my legs felt weak and I couldn&#39;t walk.  I felt dizzy, the whole room was spinning.  They were going to send me to the hospital but I didn&#39;t want to go and I went home and injected myself with an EPI pen. and also took 2 Benadryl&#39;s. I started feeling my throat close but not all the way, I could feel I was having an allergic reaction.  I just had a really bad headache and went to sleep from the Benadryl . I woke up with my eyes little swollen, and a rash on my left arm and chest area, my whole body was very itchy.  This lasted for two days. The doctor at my work said if it got worse to go to ER and or urgent care.  They didn&#39;t recommend me getting second dose.

I was hit with intense nausea and vomiting that has been persistent since the night of 3 FEB. I can?t keep much down. 4 Feb I had a fever of 102.3 starting around 4am, I brought it down with a 600 Mg dose of Ibuprofen but it came back off and on throughout the day alongside sweats and chills. All of my lymph nodes were swollen and my entire body hurt. I was unable to sleep last night 4feb/5feb due to muscle pain.  As of today I feel a little better and am without a fever, but I am still incredibly nauseous and have developed a sore throat.

On 2/3 my arm felt very warm, so I looked at it in a mirror and found a large, round/hexagonal area of swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness. Today is 2/6 and it continues to spread the redness, swelling, and warmth down towards my elbow. It occasionally itches, but is usually painful and stings.

My 9pm I felt dizzy, had a headache, and started feeling nauseous  I took some Tylenol and ibuprofen and a snack (can?t take it on an empty stomach when nauseous  Was able to fall sleep but woke up at 2am very shaky, nauseous, and with extreme joint pain. I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

Throughout the night, I would wake up frequently suffering from body aches and cold chills. Symptoms lasted for about 15 hours from time of onset.

Treated with ibuprofen and resolved about 10 hours after onset. Swelling and lump the size of a quarter at injection site noticed about 10 hours after injection. The next morning size increased to about 4 inches in diameter, skin was hard, hot, and painful to touch. Left armpit is also swollen and mildly painful.

And then it lessened so I could use it but still pain for three or four days. Redness on injection site - just a big, red spot (not rash). Red spot went away and then a big white spot - six days for white spots. Almost like my arm wasn&#39;t getting blood - just white like that for a few days. Headache - still have it - minor enough when I wake up but when I go to bed that every other day I&#39;m still taking medicine for it; nausea; fever; chills; hot flashes - lasted 5 or six days; fatigue - still have a little fatigue. It is better than it was. At first I was sleeping 15-16 hours a day. Still have to go to bed earlier than normal. Stomach pain - those are gone now; runny nose; loss of appetite; brain fog - I knew what I wanted to say or do but couldn&#39;t. Advil was taken and I tried Tylenol, too. I iced my arm. I did a humidifier.

                                                Arm pain developed throughout the day starting 4 hours post vaccination administration. That pain then spread to my upper back alongside a mild headache. I was otherwise well until 12.5 hours post the vaccine where I developed fever and debilitating chills which went on for the remainder of the night. I had full body aches and immense pain in my arm, and kind of a stiffness all over my body accompanied by fatigue which may just be due to the lack of restful sleep I obtained. I also had a loss of appetite. I took 2 advil the next moring and felt better within 2 hours and regained my appetite. The sweating from what I presume to be fever still hadn&#39;t subsided nor had the chills. I would say within 36 hours all that remains is mild arm pain.

I could not say the words I wanted to and words that I could get out sounded very slurry. I went to the Emergency Room where I was stroke-activated. I was admitted to the hospital 1/30 and discharged 1/31.

                                                I started to feel flu like symptoms. I stood up to get out the bath and felt fatigue and vision became blurry. I had laid on back; and my arm and feet started to  feel like Charlie-horse. It was very hard to speak. My words became slurred as I was speaking. I felt like I was having heart attack.  I had the worst flu symptoms for about 2 days and symptoms went away.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Three days following the injection I had most of the symptoms. The injection site was hot, hard and quite painful (I couldn&#39;t sleep on that side of my body for three nights). I felt generally unwell and achy. After about three days all of my symptoms went down and most of them were gone except for I could still feel a small amount of swelling under the skin that continued to go down. On Tuesday Feb 10, almost a week out I started to experience an itching feeling that increased throughout the day to a deep itch that feels like it goes down to my bone. The injection site has become red, hot and hard again and the lymph node in my left armpit is extremely painful and swollen. I feel dizzy and nauseous.

These symptoms did not cease until Friday morning. Friday still experiencing disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea.

                                                1 week and 1 day later it was noted while showering that there was a 2 in red raised mark surrounding the injection site that was itchy. 2 days prior to red mark appearing I was experiencing extreme headaches, fatigue, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. At this time on 2/28/2021, I still have the raised red mark on my area but it has lightened and it is still itching. My lymph nodes are still swollen and a headache is still present as well as fatigue but the sore throat has mostly resolved.

Took 2 Tylenol every 6 hours, lots of fluids, took 2 ibuprofen about 30 hours after getting vaccine because fever would not reduce.  Symptoms began to subside 32 hours after vaccine.

                                                A few days after the shot I had a horrible headache behind the ear and right side of forehead that wouldn&#39;t go away with tylenol for about 3 days. 1 week after the vaccine I had routine blood drawn, afterwards ate breakfast and had jaw pain and couldn&#39;t open my mouth fully. Within a few hours my whole right side of my face was weak. I was able to get into the dr at 2 pm and was prescribed antiviral Valtrex and pregnozone for 1 week. Started taking them immediately and doing facial excersizes. No improvement so far.

She had hives, chest tightness, and unable to breath.  They injected epi-pen and administered steroids, Pepcid and Benadryl.  She was released to go home after 5 hours.  The next day she had really bad sternum chest pain, back pain, neck pain and fatigue so she went back to the ER.  They did chest XRAY that came back clear, did an EKG w/ normal results, and blood work w/ high white blood count.  New RX for Naproxen 500mg, lidocaine patches, Zofran and has an EPI pen on order. Pt states since leaving the ER she still has fatigue, pain in neck, arm, back, and now in the face. She states her face is numb and has bad pain and blurred vision in both eyes, more so on the right side.  The ER told her to come back if she needed to FU.

                                                My arm started hurting very bad after about 2-3 hours. At the 12 hour mark from my vaccine (11:30PM), I started to have chills, a fever, and feel nauseous. Around 1 AM I started to vomit and this occurred for about 15 minutes, and then repeated again about an hour later. By the morning of the day after I was no longer vomiting or had chills but still had a fever. The most prominent symptoms on the day after my vaccine were extreme body aches and horrible joint pain. My hands and feet felt swollen and stiff. I had terrible pains and aches in my whole entire body. I was also very tired and still had a low grade fever. On the second day after the vaccine I had bad chest and neck pain and started to have a mild cough. By the third day after the vaccine, the chest pain was gone but still had bad neck pain and a headache that radiated through my skull.

By day 1 after the vaccine I also had hives and a rash at the injection site. A week after my second dose, I also had more hives pop up on my face and a bit at the injection site. And every few weeks, I have a few come up at the injection site and on my face, and then they go away.

I also had severely painful swollen axillary lymph nodes on the same side that I received my injection. I was not able to work or do any of my daily activities for almost three days. Then on day 7 after receiving my first vaccine dose, I developed a itchy, painful, red rash and hives surrounding the injection site (about a two to three inch radius around the injection site. I also got hives and red itchy painful skin on my face. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed prednisone and a week of pepside and zyrtec. After a week I stopped taking the allergy meds and then the hives came back, so I kept taking the allergy meds until my second vaccine dose.

The sleep aid did not help as I only slept a few hours but could not stay asleep due to the pain. I woke up at 7 AM to feed my cat, then tried to lay back down, but was unable to. I went to the toilet feeling nauseous and wretched a few times but did not throw up. I did, however, experience diarrhea that morning and throughout the day. I laid down on the couch and fell in and out of sleep for a few hours. I felt the headache most of the morning, until about 11 AM,. I felt the chills throughout most of the day. I treated my pain with ibuprofen 200mg tablets (3 taken each time, 4-6 hours apart), Pepto-bismol for the nausea and had mostly liquids such as water and juice as well as bread and crackers. I felt much better by around 2 PM, except for the tenderness and swelling in my arm.

I took 2 extra strength Tylenol at that time, put an ice pack on my forehead, and drank a Pedialyte.   In addition to those, at about 4 I had ringing in my left ear and then lost the hearing in it. I just went to bed. When I woke up, around 10am on Friday, I could hear, but super dizzy. I couldn?t really walk without  feeling like I?m going to fall over, especially with turns. All symptoms continued throughout all of Friday.  I continued to take the Tylenol per the instructions on the bottle with my last dose around 5pm, I also drank 3 more pedialytes throughout the day in addition to plenty of other fluids. Took a warm shower around 7PM which seemed to help some with body aches and chills, however, dizziness/vertigo remained.  Saturday I woke up several times drenched in sweat. Around 9am my fever was gone. Still feeling a little ?off? in terms of balance/vertigo but nothing compared to Friday.  Slight body aches remain. Other symptoms gone.

                                                When originally obtaining the vaccine, I had little side effect; the only thing I noticed was a slight fever for a few hours and a sore arm for a few days. 8 days after the shot was given, I developed a small swollen welt at the site of injection. I thought it may have been a mosquito bite, as I had spent the evening outside. That evening, I kept an eye on the swelling, and it was about the size of a half-dollar coin by the time I went to bed. When I woke up throughout the night (this is normal, as my sleeping patterns are irregular) I noticed more soreness in my arm. When I awoke for the day, the swelling had grown to be about the size of my hand. It is now sorer, and somewhat itchy, but I am managing with ibuprofen.

It felt like my heart is overworking itself even though I am just sitting still on the computer. Other side effects were headache, nausea, and chills.

By the twelve hour mark, heart &#43; chest no longer hurt and most side effects were gone.

The morning after the vaccination, I also had fever, chills, headache, joint pain, muscle aches, and fatigue. The fever was relieved somewhat by an ibuprofen, and went away entirely about 24 hours after the injection. Other symptoms subsided more slowly. The second day after the vaccination, I still had a mild headache and some joint and muscle discomfort, and my right arm was still painful, though somewhat improved by evening. The third day after the vaccine (Monday 3/15), I had no symptoms except occasional joint pain and a slight soreness of the vaccination site.

                                                Around 6:00 pm on the day of vaccination I started to feel very fatigued and developed body aches - this felt similar to the beginning of developing Covid-19 symptoms. (I had Covid-19 back in November of 2020)   Around 8:00 pm I had developed some head congestion and swollen lymph nodes along with some throat pain and sinus congestion - again feeling very similar to Covid-19 symptoms.   Around 10:00 pm as I was heading to bed the symptoms became  a lot worse, I had pretty intense body aches and started to experience chills as well as a slight fever (around 99.5 in F). At this time the symptoms felt similar to how I had felt during the worst of my previous Covid-19 symptoms, very weak and achy, headache was very bad, and felt very uncomfortable overall.   Around 2:00 am on March 13 I woke up with a fever of 101.8. The previous symptoms had also gotten worse, I was having a hard time getting out of bed because things were very uncomfortable, I drank a lot of water and took some ibuprofen to combat the fever, about an hour after this the fever had come down to about 99.9 and I was able to fall asleep, but before taking the medication I couldn&#39;t have fallen asleep because of the discomfort of the aches, chills, and fever.   Throughout the following day I was unable to complete many of my day to day activities without taking a daytime cold and flu medication. With the medication I still felt sick but was able to walk around and complete some simple household chores, this carried through into the evening, when the medication wore off the chills and aches and headache were much worse and I still had a fever around 99-100. That night I was able to sleep with the cold and flu medication taken right before bed.  Upon waking up the next morning (March 14) I still had some congestion, headache, and general discomfort but the worst of the aches were gone and I no longer had a fever, these symptoms continued to diminish throughout the day.   On March 15 and March 16th I have had a slight lingering congestion headache, this also feels really similar to the lingering headache I had upon recovering from Covid-19. It is not debilitating and is continuing to improve. Otherwise I am feeling healthy again and have been able to complete my usual activities and even exercise.   Overall the symptoms felt like a couple days of having Covid-19 again, but recovery was much faster, and it was definitely worth receiving that first dose of the vaccine and getting started with the process of doing my part to reduce community spread.

Patient said she was feeling fine with no reactions and was given permission to leave. Patient returned to office 5 minutes later and stated that her throat started  itching and had mild shortness of breath. Patient was immediately checked by PCP and was administered 50mg of Benadryl IM. Patient responded very well to Benadryl and symptoms started to clear up right away. Patient was monitored for 25 minutes before being released from doctor&#39;s office.. I followed up with patient this morning (03/16/2021) and per patient, all symptoms had cleared and was doing very well.

It spread outside of line that was drawn the next day so I went to ER. They did nothing &amp; told me remain on antibiotics &amp; to see allergist &amp; PCP. Reaction continued to spread, arm/hand numbness &amp; general feeling of illness, slight fever continued for approx. 2 weeks following vaccine. Site reaction fully subsided visually by 1/26 (began 1/15). Allergist suggested it was severe immune reaction to vaccine. Felt generally unwell for approx. 5 weeks following vaccine. Was told I should not get second dose or any covid/flu vaccines in the future. I have history of poor reaction to vaccines/site reactions.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I noticed extreme tiredness and light headedness. I got up to notify staff and my vision went and I began to feel nauseated. They helped me to a seat and I began sweating profusely and the nausea intensified. After several minutes the nausea and vision changes subsided and I continued to feel extremely tired and light headed.  The staff put a heart rate monitor on me and I saw that my heart rate was sitting around 38-42. I felt like I just wanted to close my eyes but the staff kept asking me questions. After several more minutes a cop arrived. Later on an ambulance arrived and when they put the blood pressure cuff on I noticed tingling in my hand from it. I continued to feel light headed and extremely tired through arriving at the hospital via ambulance around 10:30am. These symptoms gradually subsided throughout the afternoon leaving me with light headedness  only when walking or moving around. While at the hospital they did an EKG which showed inverted T waves (from what I remember of the PA&#39;s description) and so admitted me for observation and performed an echo which came back normal. I was discharged around 10pm on the same night.

On that day, my body felt very cold and did not get sleep at that night. Saturday morning, my head was dizzy and no appetite. But took some meal around 9.30 a.m. Then I started vomiting from  12 p.m. to 3 p.m. several times. My whole body was dizzy and tired for a whole day.

Fever lasted from about 10 pm to 3 pm the following day and then stopped, without the use of medicine. However, the fever and aches later came back that night (3/20, the day after vaccination) at around 10 pm.  Vomiting: Certainly the effect that caught me most off guard. Vomiting lasted from 4:30 pm on 3/20 (day after vaccination) until 7:30 pm that same day. I vomited 5 times in this time span, and was quite nauseous for about an hour or two before the vomiting began. No medicine relieved this effect.  Headache: Came and went with the fever. Not too terrible.  Sore arm: lasted for about 30 hours after the injection.

These gastrointestinal symptoms were not present beforehand and appeared at the same time as the other side effect but the GI issues have not resolved or even lessened. I may need to seek medica attention if it persists.

She denied that the rash had spread but was uncomfortable and that her throat was burning and really scratchy.   Our nurse here at the health dept. advised her to call her physician now and if symptoms worsened to go to the ER. I called patient this afternoon at 4:30 pm and she said that her doctor had given her a Benadryl shot and had sent her to the ER. She was on her way when I called her so I will call back tomorrow.

I was tired. I got a really bad headache that evening and I took Tylenol for it. When I went to sleep, I didn&#39;t have a temperature - at one point - it was 96. something. All night I felt hot and feverish internally. I had body aches, groggy, tired and my muscles hurt like I&#39;d worked out - for the next three days. I felt feverish randomly for the next couple of days as well. The facial numbness only lasted about an hour. Still am  experiencing irritation under my axilla from the first reaction to the vaccine.

Client came to us to &#34;start over&#34; and my nurse signed off and vaccinated her with 1st Moderna vaccine on 3/24/2021.  No reactions.

Injection site was hot to the touch and it felt like a knot was under my skin. around 10:00am I began to feel feverish all over my body. I began to have the chills and began to feel tired. My body was achy as well and a headache developed. I slept from about 12:30PM to 6:30 PM and took acetaminophen at that time. Feverish feeling and chills broke after pill got into my system. Arm is still in major pain.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after the patient got her second moderna vaccine she became faint and dizzy. The patient was sitting at the time. A law enforcement officer witnessed her becoming faint and ran over to attend her. I was called over to assess her as well. The law enforcement officer called EMS. The patient stated that she felt faint, dizzy, she said she had a headache, blurry vision, and was nauseous. The patient appeared sweaty and she appeared to loose consciousness briefly twice. She did not show any signs of redness, rash, or swelling. After sitting for a few minutes, and before EMS arrived, the patient said she was improving. She did not lose consciousness anymore but she still had a headache, nausea, and blurry vision. When EMS arrived they recommended that she get checked out at the emergency room, but the patient refused stating that she did not want to go to the hospital and that she was feeling better. The patient called her parents and they came and picked her up.
