                                                Syncope; Shaking; Struggling to breathe; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 90-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications reported included warfarin, ezetimibe, bupropion, finasteride, tamsulosin, furosemide, potassium chloride, rosuvastatin, and nitrofurantoin.    On 26 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 032L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 26 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient stayed at the vaccination site for fifteen minutes to watch for any reaction, he had none, so he left. Later that night the patient began shaking and struggling to breathe, so 911 was called. At the hospital, the patient was diagnosed with syncope. He spent overnight in the hospital and had an echocardiogram the following day. No results were provided for the echo, but the patient was cleared to go home after a sixteen-hour hospital stay. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was unknown.  The outcome of the events, syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe, was resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 90 year-old, male patient, who experienced events of syncope, shaking, and struggling to breathe.  The events occurred the same night after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.

                                                2/14 Emergency room HPI Patient is a 94 y.o. male who presents with complaint of cough that started about a week ago, and was seen by primary care provider on the 9th February 2021.  Patient was started on Augmentin and has taken it for about 5 days but said the cough is worse and productive of clear sputum.  Patient in ER to get checked for pneumonia.  Patient denies a fever or chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea vomiting and no headache or dizziness. Transferred to another facility h&amp;pHistory of Present Illness:  94-year-old former smoker with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not currently on anticoagulation, coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, CKD 4, prostate cancer on surveillance, TAVR 2/17, with a son who is a doctor and a caregiver who is a Radiology NP by his report, who presents in transfer from previous Hospital due to a large right pleural effusion.  He has had a cough for some time now, but thinks it may have worsened, at least per his caregiver, over the last 4-5 days.  He was seen by his PCP on February 9th and placed on Augmentin, but nothing changed.  He himself denies being short of breath, having any chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, change in appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea.  Of note, on a chest x-ray in June he had bilateral pleural effusions, and on an MRI in July to investigate a renal mass, he was noted to have a small right-sided pleural effusion.        On arrival to facility this morning, he was afebrile, normotensive, had a normal heart rate, sometimes mildly bradycardic, normal respiratory rate and saturations of 97% on room air.  Labs demonstrated chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, stable stage 4 kidney disease creatinine of 2.6, BUN 64, glucose 187.  Chest x-ray demonstrated a moderate right pleural effusion, noting that underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  He was also felt to have bibasilar atelectasis.  CT of the chest without contrast showed a large right pleural effusion with most of the right lower lobe being collapsed.  Superimposed infection could not be excluded.  He had a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and a small pericardial effusion as well.  EKG and procalcitonin were not performed.  He was sent to our facility for thoracentesis.         On arrival here, vitals remained stable.  His bedside RN informed me that upon returning from the bathroom, he appeared to be a bit dyspneic, but the patient himself denies any shortness of breath or ?huffing and puffing?. 2/25 admEd to hospital admission

They should not have given him should not have given him the vaccine that is on hospice, it was not the right decision. I am worried about the elderly and those very sick.

The pt&#39;s COVID-19  screening questionnaire prior to receiving the vaccine was negative. The pt presented to the ED on 01/13/21 for weakness and m  PCR test on ultiple recent falls (since receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine). The pt&#39;s COVID-19 01/13/20  was positive and he was admitted. He was started on treatment with remdesivir &#43; dexamethasone on 1/14. The pt initially required supplemental oxygen via low-flow NC, however his oxygen requirements increased to 100% NRB. On 01/16/21 his MPOA elected for hospice care.  The pt passed on 01/17/21. Unclear if the COVID-19 vaccine attributed to the patient&#39;s hospitalization and eventual death, or whether these events occurred from COVID-19 itself, however this case is being reported the FDA since this vaccine is under an emergency use authorization (EUA).

Of note, the 2/8 telephone note makes it sound like he was hospitalized at time of death - that is incorrect. His daugther  listed as EM contact works in the eye clinic here. He had mild illness, completed 10d isolation but missed his scheduled booster dose on 2/2 due to isolation. He was called on 2/5 when there was a booster visit cancellation and received his booster dose on that day. His daugther reported that he was doing fine and looking well on 2/7 AM, ate breakfast, shortly after stood up and just collapsed.
