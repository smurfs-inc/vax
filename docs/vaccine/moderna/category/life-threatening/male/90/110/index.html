                                                Patient had started peritoneal dialysis at home with me, his wife, 8 days before the second shot. All was going well. We got his second shot on the morig of March 18.  His only reaction seemed to be soreness at injection site. At 11 pm we started dialysis as usual, with the cycler.  At 12 pm he was having trouble breathing after just having been filled with 1500 ml of dialysate. This was the first time this happened. I gave hi nitro glycerine and had the cycler take out the 1500 ml of dialysate, and stopped the therapy for the night. He then felt better, and apologized for waking me up. In the morning he was dead.  I believe it is possible that the vaccine tipped the balance of patients already taxed system. As I know that people who have serious diseases and are older are encouraged to take the vaccine, this outcome should be known to the CDC.

                                                My birthfather had an adverse reaction after he got his 1st Moderna COVID vaccine.  He lives alone and was doing well with some underlying conditions. The day of the shot was fine.  The next AM, he had vision changes and sudden numbness in his R arm/leg and fell after getting up.  ?The numbness went away pretty quickly, but the visual changes remained.  He refused to go to the ER/Dr.  The next week and a half, he was weak, tired, and couldn?t think as clearly.  ?He was brought to the ER? on Wed, 3/3/21 at Hospital.  He was found to have a low oxygen level, possible a-fib, fluid retention, emphysema, and aortic stenosis, in addition to his other health issues.  ?The Dr said his symptoms the day after the vaccine were a mini-stroke..  He was released from the hospital on Friday, 3/5/21.  On Saturday, Hospice came to see him, since nothing can be done for his medical conditions; however, they decided not to sign him up yet, since he I was told they didn&#39;t feel he needed to, at this time.  One of my sisters is staying with him during the day until he builds his strength back up.  Do you think his Mini stroke and health changes had anything to do with the vaccine? He will not be getting the second COVID shot.   ?We?re all caught between a rock and a hard place as far as what to do, esp for older folks.

It was very itchy, red and very painful. I went to the dermatologist right away and was diagnosed with Shingles infection. The doctor gave me an injection (don&#39;t remember name) and prescribed Valtrex and Pepcid. The medication did not help resolve the shingles and it got worse. I went to the hospital 4/6/2021 and I was admitted to the hospital for 7 days.  I was admitted because I was dehydrated and had an allergic reaction to the shot the dermatologist gave me. I also pneumonia and septic.  They ran every test they could run and gave me antibiotics for the pneumonia and infection. I was discharged to follow up PCP.

                                                Hi, my name is, I&#39;m a RN and am submitting this report about my grandpa.  I took him into the VA to get his second covid vaccine on 2/17/21.   At that time my grandp lived semi-independently in a house between my parents and my uncle .  He didn&#39;t get out very much but with some help of grocery shopping and organizing his medication he was still able to live alone and function well independently.  My mother reported to me on 2/18/21 that my grandpa was confused, weak and tired.  My grandpa has never had any signs of dementia.  At this time he developed a delerium that waxed and waned.  He complained of headache, no appetite and extreme weakness.  On 2/23/21 he fell down in his house and we decided to move him into my uncles spare bedroom to keep better eyes on him.  The delerium persisted and on 3/5 he was taken to Hospital for a workup for his delerium and weakness.  There he saw Dr. an internal medicine doctor at hospital.  The workup showed an elevated BNP (probably baseline but I&#39;d have to look at previous lab results) but nothing further.  We opted not to do further imaging and instead take him home.  It became obvious to me that this was the end of his life and so I requested a hospice referral from Dr. My grandpa died on 3/24/21.

Patient was started on Augmentin and has taken it for about 5 days but said the cough is worse and productive of clear sputum.  Patient in ER to get checked for pneumonia.  Patient denies a fever or chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea vomiting and no headache or dizziness. Transferred to another facility h&amp;pHistory of Present Illness:  94-year-old former smoker with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation not currently on anticoagulation, coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, CKD 4, prostate cancer on surveillance, TAVR 2/17, with a son who is a doctor and a caregiver who is a Radiology NP by his report, who presents in transfer from previous Hospital due to a large right pleural effusion.  He has had a cough for some time now, but thinks it may have worsened, at least per his caregiver, over the last 4-5 days.  He was seen by his PCP on February 9th and placed on Augmentin, but nothing changed.  He himself denies being short of breath, having any chest pain, fevers, chills, sweats, change in appetite, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea.  Of note, on a chest x-ray in June he had bilateral pleural effusions, and on an MRI in July to investigate a renal mass, he was noted to have a small right-sided pleural effusion.        On arrival to facility this morning, he was afebrile, normotensive, had a normal heart rate, sometimes mildly bradycardic, normal respiratory rate and saturations of 97% on room air.  Labs demonstrated chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia, stable stage 4 kidney disease creatinine of 2.6, BUN 64, glucose 187.  Chest x-ray demonstrated a moderate right pleural effusion, noting that underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  He was also felt to have bibasilar atelectasis.  CT of the chest without contrast showed a large right pleural effusion with most of the right lower lobe being collapsed.  Superimposed infection could not be excluded.  He had a small left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis and a small pericardial effusion as well.  EKG and procalcitonin were not performed.  He was sent to our facility for thoracentesis.         On arrival here, vitals remained stable.  His bedside RN informed me that upon returning from the bathroom, he appeared to be a bit dyspneic, but the patient himself denies any shortness of breath or ?huffing and puffing?. 2/25 admEd to hospital admission

On 22-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (mini-strokes which have increased in frequency) (seriousness criterion medically significant), SEIZURE (placed on low-dose seizure medicine Aptiom 200 and Aspirin 325 to prevent further seizures) (seriousness criterion medically significant), WHEEZING (Wheezing), DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), HEADACHE (Headaches) and MYALGIA (Soreness in arm). The patient was treated with ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID] ongoing since an unknown date for Seizure prophylaxis, at a dose of 325 dosage form and ESLICARBAZEPINE ACETATE (APTIOM) ongoing since an unknown date for Seizure prophylaxis, at a dose of 200 milligram. At the time of the report, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (mini-strokes which have increased in frequency) had not resolved and SEIZURE (placed on low-dose seizure medicine Aptiom 200 and Aspirin 325 to prevent further seizures), WHEEZING (Wheezing), DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), HEADACHE (Headaches) and MYALGIA (Soreness in arm) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 17-May-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: mini-strokes (abnormal) mini-strokes were confirmed via MRI.         The patient&#39;s caregiver reported the patient stopped taking amoxicillin 875-125 prior to receiving the second dose of the vaccine. After receiving the second vaccine, he began to experience a repeat of symptoms similar to those after the first dose which were described as a number of mini-strokes which increased in frequency. The patient was treated and released in an emergency room (less than 24-hour stay). It was reported the mini-strokes occurred within 24 to 72 hours post-vaccination.

The pt&#39;s COVID-19  screening questionnaire prior to receiving the vaccine was negative. The pt presented to the ED on 01/13/21 for weakness and m  PCR test on ultiple recent falls (since receiving his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine). The pt&#39;s COVID-19 01/13/20  was positive and he was admitted. He was started on treatment with remdesivir &#43; dexamethasone on 1/14. The pt initially required supplemental oxygen via low-flow NC, however his oxygen requirements increased to 100% NRB. On 01/16/21 his MPOA elected for hospice care.  The pt passed on 01/17/21. Unclear if the COVID-19 vaccine attributed to the patient&#39;s hospitalization and eventual death, or whether these events occurred from COVID-19 itself, however this case is being reported the FDA since this vaccine is under an emergency use authorization (EUA).

He had mild illness, completed 10d isolation but missed his scheduled booster dose on 2/2 due to isolation. He was called on 2/5 when there was a booster visit cancellation and received his booster dose on that day. His daugther reported that he was doing fine and looking well on 2/7 AM, ate breakfast, shortly after stood up and just collapsed.

He was miserable all day.  I called his physician and we decided to keep him comfortable at home and give him the BRAT diet which seemed to be helping with the pain and vomiting.  Dad never got out of bed again.  On February 4th, Dad was placed on Hospice and died on February 7, 2021.
