Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

                                                Stroke; Gotten very sick from vaccine; Tachycardia; Blood pressure issues; Dizziniess; Heart rate issues; This spontaneous case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) in a 40-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. #027L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (hospitalized for 7 days; treated with Remdesivir; long recovery) from 11-Sep-2020 to October 2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure (ongoing issues) and Heart rate (ongoing issues).    On 05-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues). At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke), ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 9.64 after one round of the vaccine. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 220 natural antibodies after 2 months.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient reports that he had worked for an urgent care performing testing and contracted COVID-19 back in 11SEP2020. Patient was hospitalized for 7 days, was administered Remdesivir, and had a long recovery. Patient reports having issues regulating his blood pressure and heart rate so bad that he had almost died during that time. The recovery took up until 1st week of October and did not feel well until then. Patient reports it was advised to defer first dose of vaccination for COVID-19 for 3 months.   Patient self-medicated with OTC Tylenol and Advil which did not help. Patient reports that he was hospitalized a second time around last month (03MAR2021 approximately) for experiencing a stroke. Symptoms felt like he was experiencing a mini-COVID-19 episode and was having a relapse of COVID-19. ER professional advised patient to never take the second dose of the vaccine. Patient reports taking an antibody test (after a single dose of the vaccine) for both natural and for the spike protein on 25MAR2021. Patient reports that he had gotten a 9.64 reading from just one round of the vaccine in comparison to the doctors he had worked who had received both doses of the vaccine, never gotten sick with COVID-19, and produced a 9.0 reading. Patient reports his natural antibodies after 2 months was at 220. Patient wishes to report this information to highlight that his natural antibodies were so high from the previous COVID-19 infection that when he had gotten the first round of the vaccine, he believes that his body rejected the vaccine so strongly that he presented with severe side effects from the vaccine. Patient would like to submit his information to show that he is proof that if someone previously had COVID-19, they should only need a single dose of the vaccine. In addition, patient expressed that if a patient&#39;s natural antibody is high, then a reduced dose should be provided or the vaccine should be deferred until natural antibodies reduce   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 02-Apr-2021: Event details reported; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

Then I rapidly spiked a 102.7 fever and became so physically weak I felt paralyzed. Oxygen saturation dropped into the low 90s and I began to have labored breathing. I made an attempt to stand up and urinate, then passed out and collapsed. Ems came to the house and checked me out. I declined their offer to go to the hospital because I broke the fever, was breathing better, and had no concussion signs from the fall.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Asthma and Hyperthyroidism. Concomitant products included FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE (FLOVENT) for an unknown indication.   On 22-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out to sleep at 745 pm) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 19-Apr-2021 at 11:30 PM, the patient experienced COLD SWEAT (cold sweats), ASTHENIA (really weak), DYSSTASIA (could barely stand up) and ILLNESS (sick to his stomach). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VERTIGO (head spinning), DIZZINESS (dizzy), FATIGUE (tired), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (pain at injection site) and NAUSEA (nauseas). At the time of the report, LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (Passed out to sleep at 745 pm), COLD SWEAT (cold sweats), ASTHENIA (really weak), DYSSTASIA (could barely stand up), ILLNESS (sick to his stomach), VERTIGO (head spinning), DIZZINESS (dizzy), FATIGUE (tired), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (pain at injection site) and NAUSEA (nauseas) had not resolved. Not Provided          Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included thyroid medication.  Treatment information was not provided.

                                                3 minutes after vaccination the patient began to feel a tingling and pain in his arm where the vaccine was placed.  Within minutes the patient began to feel faint and proceeded to faint as he was gently laid to the ground by the healthcare provider to initiate an emergency response.  The patient was alert and oriented at 5:30 but felt nausea and a tingling sensation in the tongue.  The patient stated that he had been fasting for 2 days and we determined low blood sugar likely played into his response to the vaccine.  Glucose gel was placed in mouth and patient felt better within 15 minutes.

I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.

Evaluation was positive for bilateral DVT and pulmonary embolism     Bilateral PE, infarction, bilateral DVTs -No obvious precipitating factors -patient underwent first COVID 19 vaccine injection, is actually due for second shot.  Unclear if this is contributed, recommended to hold on getting second dose and discuss this with PCP.  -Also follow-up with PCP for appropriate cancer screening -patient was treated with therapeutic subcutaneous Lovenox, remained hemodynamically stable and is feeling better today.  Upon discharge we&#39;ll prescribe Elocon is 10 mg b.i.d. for another 5 days followed by 5 mg b.i.d. maintenance dose.  He will be provided with coupon for 1 month supply, he was recommended to follow-up with PCP for further recommendations.  He will probably need anticoagulation for at least 6 months or longer depending on further course. -Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction 50-55%, Mild mitral valve prolapse no evidence of RV strain.      Hemoptysis  -Most likely was related to PE and infarction -resolved.   Pleuritic chest pain, h/o Afib -Most likely pain was secondary to PE, improved -Continue Cardizem as prior to admission -Stop aspirin since patient will be on anticoagulation therapy   History of opioid dependence, alcohol abuse Continue suboxone     Ongoing smoking smoking cessation was advised   Disposition: Routine Discharge Home   CONSULTS: Consults Ordered during this Encounter Procedures ?

I got up to use the bathroom and had a syncopal episode about halfway to bathroom. Fell and i came to immediately when my name was called.  I got back into bed.  My lips were white.  I still felt lightheaded but could breathe freely and easily.  There was no noticeable swelling impairing my breathing.  Initially i could not get a reading on my pulse oximeter.  After a few minutes it worked and by then i was at 95%. I suspect the oxygen was quite low prior to that.  For the next day i had a fever and farigue.  The day after that I had some lingering fatigue but no fever.  Right now I am not planning to get the second shot in the series.

                                                On 1/28/2021 at 0545 hours as I was on my way into work when I started to have severe right side chest pain, so much so that I had to pull over. Shortly thereafter ambulance arrived on scene at which time it was determined that I would be transported to the hospital. Once there, a series of tests were conducted, one of which was a D-Dimer blood test to rule out blood clots. That resulted in an elevated count to which a CT scan was ordered.   The result of the CT scan revealed that I had 2 Pulmonary Embolisms, one in the upper lobe of my right lung and one in the middle lobe of my right lung.   Due to me being what the doctors said was a healthy 45 year old with no underlying conditions or signs of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) they deemed me low risk at that time and advised I was at low risk of dying in the next 30days. However, they advised that at any time, the clot could possibly become dislodged and cause worse problems, possibly death if time is not given to the body to dissolve the clots. Ultimately it was determined that I be discharged and prescribed blood thinning medications to help thin the blood to prevent further clotting should I have a clotting issue (undetermined at this time).

                                                A few minutes after the shot i started getting dizzy. it increased with intensity so i flagged down an attendant for help. I started feeling weak and tired.  I went unconscious during which time i was told my breathing was irregular.  I think i was unconscious for 2 or 3 minutes.  I woke confused,  shortly after i woke the medic showed up to my care.  He took my heart rate and check my blood sugar.  He said my vitals looked ok. He asked if i was feeling better.  I was still very dizzy and nauseous.  i sat in the parking log for awhile before driving home.  I got home and went to bed slept most of the day.  I had a fairly bad headache the rest of the evening and a slight nauseous feeling.  The next morning i still have a slight headache still feel slight nausea but not bad.

                                                Upon waking up felt cold sweat, nauseated and became dizzy. Within 5 min from leaving the bed I lost consciousness for 2-3minutes. Next thing I remember being on the kitchen floor being called by name by my wife, w a sharp pain on back of my skull. Was told I suddenly collapsed onto the floor. I trained to stand up but could not maintain posture. Had to lay down on my left side for 15-20 min. Then I was able to drink water and walk back to bed where I remained for next couple hours.

Concomitant products included WARFARIN SODIUM (COUMADIN) for an unknown indication.   On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 09-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 10-Apr-2021, the patient experienced MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 15-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache). The patient was hospitalized from 10-Apr-2021 to 12-Apr-2021 due to CONFUSIONAL STATE, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT, THROMBOSIS and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. At the time of the report, MEMORY IMPAIRMENT (Memory lapse, difficulty with memory recall), FEELING ABNORMAL (Brain Fog) and HEADACHE (Headache) had not resolved and CONFUSIONAL STATE (Confused), THROMBOSIS (Blood clots) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Cerebral Ischemic Attack) had resolved. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 10-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 10-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low. On 10-Apr-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) revealed blood clots. On 15-Apr-2021, International normalised ratio: low (Low) Low.         It was reported that the patient still has difficulty with memory recall, brain fog, headache, and still having trouble with low INR. The patient did not have any side effects after the first dose. Treatment for the events included Levonox injections and Coumadin (increased dose).  Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the product known safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the reported events, excluding other etiologies causal relationship cannot be excluded. Headache is consistent with the product known safety profile.

I felt a little off, but I thought I was ok.  I entered my shower, and then I was found unconscious on the floor of my shower by my wife about 5 minutes later.  I passed out 2 more times while attempting to stand and exit the shower.  I was extremely fatigued at this point.  I went back to bed and slept until 10 pm that night.  I woke for about 2 hours , ate  some food and drank some water and soda pop.  I then went back to sleep until 7:30 am  the next morning.   I was awake for 3 hours, and then I slept for 3 more hours.  I have been awake for about 2 hours, and I am now typing this adverse event document.   The entire time I have had temperature regulation issues, severe headache, muscle and joint aches, and fatigue.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

Since last seen he initiated AIT in December 2020 and reports he had tolerated his AIT injections without large local or systemic reactions until yesterday, 16 Mar, when he received his first maintenance dose. Within minutes of receiving his dose he developed shortness of breath, dizziness/altered level of consciousness resulting in collapse, and was noted to be hypoxic. He was treated with IM epinephrine with initial improvement but subsequently again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness. He received his second dose of IM epinephrine and a dose of IM Benadryl with transient improvement, but again developed shortness of breath, cough and altered level of consciousness followed by nausea and vomiting. He was noted to be hypotensive and hypoxic despite these interventions so a third dose of IM epinephrine and IV fluids were administered. He was transferred by ambulance to ER where he was given IV solumedrol, monitored, and admitted to the ICU overnight for observation. He reports fever (Tmax 101 F) last night in the ICU. He endorses he took his Allegra prior to his AIT dose and did not exercise. Of note, on 15 Mar he received his second mRNA COVID19 vaccine.

I have waves of Tachycardia and nausea. I had pretty bad diarrhea the first day and second day, this was also a side effect from the Celexa. The Tachycardia was going up to 130-140 .  Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

The patient&#39;s medical history included heart failure and allergies to butter and NSAIDS.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included metoprolol, diltiazem, apixaban, lisinopril and loratadine.    The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 040A21A) on 11 Mar 2021 in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Mar 2021, the patient reported that he experienced a moderate reaction; throat closure (not complete).  He stated that it felt like anaphylaxis.  He also reported having a numb tongue. He reported that the reaction was not immediate and that  it started about four hours after the vaccine.    Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovered/resolved. The outcome of the event, anaphylactic reaction, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 53-year-old male who experienced a serious anaphylactic reaction with serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation and throat closure.  Event onset occurred the same day as the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment not reported. Atrial fibrillation resolved, and anaphylaxis resolving. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Daughter reported to ARNP,RN Director Clinical Support on 01/03 the following outcomes:    Patient first exhibited the first signs of reaction started about 60 hours after vaccine: hives only (no difficulty breathing, dizziness, lightheadedness); applied hydrocortisone cream, took diphenhydramine. Patient slept for a few hours then woke up for lunch. Around 12:30-1:00 the patient exhibited three episodes of syncope. Emergency services was called after the first. Firefighters couldn&#39;t find BP, was in 70s by doppler only. Patient taken to hospital for care.    Discharged from ED around 5, suspecting hypotension 2/2 to diphenhydramine use. Monitored vitals at home; became severely hypotensive (BP 70s/40s both with automatic monitor and manual read) and lethargic again about an hour or so after, but normotensive again right before about to call ambulance. Pt claimed to be okay and had some dinner. Fourth episode of syncope, ambulance was called.         Patient remains at hospital ED since, still in observation unit.

On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.

                                                Mild case of pneumonia; Tested positive for COVID; Shortness of breath; A spontaneous was received from a healthcare facility staff member concerning 55 years of old, male patient who developed shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID. The patient&#39;s medical history included back issue. The patient had an epidural for bulging disk in back in an unknown date in December. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 29-JAN-2021, eight days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) on left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20-JAN-2021, the patient had COVID symptoms including congestion and cough but tested negative on rapid testing. Since tested negative, the patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled on 29-JAN-2021 at Hospital.  On 06-FEB-2021 after experiencing shortness of breath, the patient was retested by rapid test, which was also negative. However, the patient tested positive for COVID on Polymerase Chain reaction test at Urgent Care. The patient had a mild case of pneumonia  The reporter believes that the patient probably was positive before, as patient had been home since 19-DEC-2020 due to a back issue. Thinks that the patient&#39;s son may have been asymptomatic and all eight members in the household tested positive except the reporter. Treatment for the events included antibiotic azithromycin 5 days z-pack.  The events shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID were considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and high probability of corona infection from the close contacts where all eight members in the household were tested positive except the patient immediately before the vaccination, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications included dolutegravir sodium;lamivudine, pregabalin, and modafinil for unknown indication.  On 19 Feb 2021, approximately two days prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 011M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 21 Feb 2021, after receiving mRNA-1273, the patient felt unusually tired for midafternoon that day. The patient had suffered from chronic fatigue issues but never felt more tired than usual at that point in the day. The patient then experienced a black out and woke up face down with a bloody nose and head. The patient felt very dizzy, was not able to walk and crawled to their mattress and fell asleep. The patient managed to get himself to the Emergency room, a CT scan of the head was performed, and it was revealed that the patient had a fracture that had occurred before the vaccine and was not related to the vaccine. The doctor thought the vaccine however maybe related to the blackout or have exaggerated a concussion and have caused these delayed symptoms. No treatment information was provided.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the event experienced a black out was resolved at the time of this report and the outcome of the events, felt unusually tired for midafternoon, woke up face down with a bloody nose and head, was very dizzy and couldn&#39;t walk was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and patient&#39;s skull fracture that had occurred before the vaccine the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Sender&#39;s Comments:  US-MODERNATX, INC.-MOD-2021-057947:Second Dose Case

The hospital discovered a coronary artery embolism with myocardial infarction.  I was taking a blood thinner at the time so the blood clout should not have formed to begin with.   No heart disease was found and once clout was removed by heart function returned.  I had had my first COVID-19 shot the Thursday before the event so I thought I should report the event in case there&#39;s a connection.

                                                According to NJIIS registry, patient received Moderna dose 1 at &#34;Rite Aid 00994&#34; on 3/3/2021.  Patient arrived in ED on 3/4/21 at approx 9AM via ambulance.  ED physician note:  &#34;56-year-old male brought in by EMS intubated with CPR in progress.  It was reported that he arrived to work and then passed out.  CPR was initiated almost immediately.  BLS determined that he was  pulseless and AED was applied.  He was defibrillated twice.  He was then intubated by ALS and administered epinephrine twice with return of spontaneous circulation.  He maintained a pulse for approximately 20 minutes when he again developed cardiac arrest.  ACLS guidelines were again initiated and there was no return of pulse for approximately 20-25 minutes until he arrived in the emergency department.  Emergency department CPR was continued and he was administered an additional epinephrine with return of a pulse.  Is reported that he had no complaints prior to the event.&#34;  Patient was intubated and ventilated, started on norepinephrine drip in ED.  Twelve-lead EKG demonstrated right bundle branch block with left posterior fascicular block and diffuse QRS widening and diffuse repolarization abnormalities.  Family consented to Cath Lab.    Per Interventional Cardiologist note:  &#34;1.  Angiography demonstrated proximal to mid LAD hazy 90-95% lesion likely culprit for cardiac arrest.  1 stent placed.  2.  Diffuse distal right coronary disease that is likely nonculprit for cardiac arrest.  3.  Left ventriculography demonstrated severe anterior wall hypokinesis with overall left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%.  4.  Patient electrically and hemodynamically stable.  Levophed has been stopped.  Amiodarone bolus given in the Cath Lab for frequent ventricular ectopy.  No drip was continued due to resolution of ectopy.  5.  Dyslipidemia he will be on high-dose statin therapy.  6.  Diabetic management as per primary team.  7.  Quad-Lumen placed by me.  Hypothermia protocol to be initiated in the ICU given GCS score less than 8 with no purposeful movements.  Head CT scan completed before cardiac catheterization that demonstrated diffuse cerebral edema.  8.  Prognosis guarded and likely poor.  The next 24 to 40 hours will be critical.  Family was updated in detail.&#34;  Patient transferred to ICU post Cath Lab.  Remains intubated, ventilated in ICU.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 12 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 09 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.

The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the event DVT, leg got really swollen, swelling of the lower calf area and calf pain were unknown at the time of this report. The event pulled a muscle is not resolved. The event sore arm which the patient experienced for both the doses got resolved on 13 Jan and 14 Jan 2021, respectively.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association a causal association between the event of sore arm and the administration of mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The evens of DVT , pulled muscle and swelling of lower calf is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Events were all attributed to muscle strain.

The  patient&#39;s oxygen requirements continued to worsen and the patient was transferred to another facility for higher level of care.  There  his hypoxia worsened and he required mechanical ventilation.  Patient then developed hypotension and required vasopressors for blood pressure support.  Furthermore, patient developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  Despite mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100%, and for vasopressors, patient clinically deteriorated and family decided to palliatively extubate on 02/05/2021.

                                                After developing soreness at the injection site about 6-8 hours post injection, I developed chills and thirst, at 4:30am I got up to go to urinate and afterward I was feeling light headed. I sat on the edge of the tub. After a couple of minutes I went to get up and fainted on the floor.  My BP was 89/49 with a pulse of 86bpm. I was helped off the floor and back to bed where I lay with my feet elevated by a couple of pillows. No further issues at this time.

BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.
