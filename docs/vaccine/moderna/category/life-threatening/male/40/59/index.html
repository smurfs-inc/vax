Discharge instructions discussed.  She is very familiar with an EpiPen because of her daughter&#39;s prior use.  Discharge instructions discussed.    ASSESSMENT and PLAN   This is a 40 y.o. female who presents with nausea vomiting diarrhea, myalgias, diffuse abdominal cramping, severe global headache, onset about 2 hours after first dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  Exam with intact mental status, neurologic system.  Abdomen with some diffuse tenderness but no evidence of peritoneal sign.  She had diffuse palpable soft tissue muscular type tenderness through her upper extremity shoulder and bilateral paraspinal back.  She had no meningeal signs.  She had no cardiorespiratory signs or symptoms.  Her chest was clear.  Voice normal.  Swallowing normal.  Oropharyngeal region normal.   Initial ED ED management focused on rehydration, antiemetics and subsequent treatment for presumptive anaphylaxis with likely system involvement gastrointestinal and neurologic.  She was treated with Solu-Medrol, famotidine and acetaminophen.  She improved during ED course and did not require epinephrine.  Symptoms at ED reevaluation/discharge were resolved.   Clinical impression favors anaphylaxis over medication side effect given time course and abrupt onset of symptomatology and signs.  She has a distant history of anaphylaxis to coconut-based product in her past.  She has no history of ongoing allergic chronic history otherwise.  Other organ systems appeared stable at onset and through ED course including cardiovascular and pulmonary.   Plan is for discharge home with rest fluids.  She will have a course of steroids/prednisone and famotidine.  She was sent home with an EpiPen and understands use and precautions.     Discussed ED &#34;return immediately if&#34; parameters with patient. Ongoing FOLLOW UP evaluation/care coordination via PCP recommended. Patient voices good understanding of current evaluation, follow-up &amp; return recommendations and discharge instructions.   Encounter Diagnosis Anaphylaxis due to vaccination, initial encounter   Plan: -d/c home.  No work next 2 days.  Off work note provided -COVID-19 testing pending -rest with activity as tolerated -diet as tolerated &amp; increased fluids as discussed -acetaminophen PRN -Prednisone 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Famotidine 40 mg daily to finish 4 more days -Zofran as needed (patient has at home) -Loratadine 10 mg OTC as needed -PCP f/u -ED return for interval worsening -instructions discussed &amp; as documented

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included COVID-19 (hospitalized for 7 days; treated with Remdesivir; long recovery) from 11-Sep-2020 to October 2020. Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure (ongoing issues) and Heart rate (ongoing issues).    On 05-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Mar-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues). At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke), ILLNESS (Gotten very sick from vaccine), TACHYCARDIA (Tachycardia), BLOOD PRESSURE FLUCTUATION (Blood pressure issues), DIZZINESS (Dizziniess) and HEART RATE IRREGULAR (Heart rate issues) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 9.64 after one round of the vaccine. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: 220 natural antibodies after 2 months.     mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was withdrawn on an unknown date.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient reports that he had worked for an urgent care performing testing and contracted COVID-19 back in 11SEP2020. Patient was hospitalized for 7 days, was administered Remdesivir, and had a long recovery. Patient reports having issues regulating his blood pressure and heart rate so bad that he had almost died during that time. The recovery took up until 1st week of October and did not feel well until then. Patient reports it was advised to defer first dose of vaccination for COVID-19 for 3 months.   Patient self-medicated with OTC Tylenol and Advil which did not help. Patient reports that he was hospitalized a second time around last month (03MAR2021 approximately) for experiencing a stroke. Symptoms felt like he was experiencing a mini-COVID-19 episode and was having a relapse of COVID-19. ER professional advised patient to never take the second dose of the vaccine. Patient reports taking an antibody test (after a single dose of the vaccine) for both natural and for the spike protein on 25MAR2021. Patient reports that he had gotten a 9.64 reading from just one round of the vaccine in comparison to the doctors he had worked who had received both doses of the vaccine, never gotten sick with COVID-19, and produced a 9.0 reading. Patient reports his natural antibodies after 2 months was at 220. Patient wishes to report this information to highlight that his natural antibodies were so high from the previous COVID-19 infection that when he had gotten the first round of the vaccine, he believes that his body rejected the vaccine so strongly that he presented with severe side effects from the vaccine. Patient would like to submit his information to show that he is proof that if someone previously had COVID-19, they should only need a single dose of the vaccine. In addition, patient expressed that if a patient&#39;s natural antibody is high, then a reduced dose should be provided or the vaccine should be deferred until natural antibodies reduce   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 02-Apr-2021: Event details reported; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.

Patient is a 40 y/o male with no significant PMH who initially presented to the hospital after being found down at a restaurant. Was found to have ST segment changes on EKG, somnolent, and hypotensive requiring pressors. Taken to the cath lab where he had equalization of diastolic pressures and subsequently received pericardiocentesis due to concern for tamponade from pericardial effusion. 350 ccs of fluid was drained and his hemodynamics immediately improved and he came off vasopressors. Pericardial drain was placed. Over the next several days he had ongoing workup for the etiology of his pericardial effusion. His pericardial drain output dropped off, was clamped 5/31 and repeat echocardiogram 6/1 did not show significant effusion. Unfortunately, patient went into PEA arrest in the afternoon and was coded for ~40 minutes without return of ROSC. Unclear etiology at this time, no evidence of significant effusion on echocardiogram

                                                I have Peripheral Artery disease and have had bypasses done on both legs.  It has been managed fairly well with a several minor &#34;tune ups&#34; by angio. I was able to walk pretty well with minimal pain.  About a week after my second dose I started noticing increased pain in both of my calves which has become considerably worse since then.  I cannot walk 1/10 of a mile without taking a break.  Also,  around July 1st, my fingers went numb in my right hand,  then I started getting pain in my right forearm and cramping in my hand. That pain has made it so the way up my arm.  I saw my vascular surgeon and an ultrasound revealed a clot in the bend of my elbow.  I was asked how I think I could have gotten the clot, the only thing I&#39;ve done differently was get that vaccine. It&#39;s extremely obvious to me that the vaccine has caused a severe reaction in me.  I have a surgery scheduled on Wed. July 14 to have the clot removed.

Pt received toradol 30mg, dexamethasone 10mg, benadryl 25mg and reglan 10mg at hospital prior to transfer. CT showed diffuse SAH and CTA showed no signs of obvious aneurysms. He then received 1g IV keppra and was started on Cardene for BP goal &lt;140. He was transferred to NICU for further monitoring.    While in the NICU, his exam and imaging remained stable. He underwent CTA which was unrevealing, and DSA which showed evidence of vasculopathy. BPs came down to &lt;160 and he came off of cardene, did not require additional meds.  He was transferred to the floor. Upon transfer, he had another thunderclap HA, accompanied by HTN to the 200s systolic, tachycardia to the 120s, diaphoresis, and blotchy macular rash over the anterior shoulders. Imaging was negative for vasospasm or recurrent bleed, and it was felt that patient&#39;s presentation was most c/w RCVS. Trigger felt either 2/2 caffeine intake (patient reported drinking 60 oz coffee daily) vs. Sympathetic discharge syndrome such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome. LP was performed, which revealed no nucleated cells and protein elevated in proportion to blood, which confirmed the diagnosis of RCVS. Studies were sent off to diagnose carcinoid syndrome and pheo. Patient was started on nimodipine/gabapentin with standing tylenol and PRN oxycodone for breakthrough pain. Within days, the HAs had markedly decreased in intensity. He was taken off of keppra after 1 week with stable exam and no e/o seizures.  He was briefly switched from nimodipine to verapamil but switched back prior to discharge. He was discharged with outpatient followup.

I was admitted to hospital on April 28.  Echocardiogram diagnosed heart failure, ejection fraction was 25%.  Pulse was also quite high (120-135), and blood oxygen was low (88-90%).  Cardiac catheterization showed no blockages in coronary arteries.  Echocardiogram, EKG, and bloodwork were negative for heart attack.  Ultimate diagnosis from doctor was idiopathic cardiomyopathy.  Currently taking several medications and under care from primary care physician and cardiologist.  At follow up appointment with primary care following discharge, she suggested I report the incident out of an abundance of caution.

                                                After headaches and fatigue following the shot (within 24 hours) I began to notice slight shortness of breath 3-5 days following. I didn&#39;t give it much thought, but, roughly two weeks after my dose I began to experience severe intercostal pain and sharp pain in the lower lobe of my right lung upon inhalation. I thought this was musculoskeletal at first but after it didn&#39;t abate within days, I went to the hospital and was diagnosed with several distal pulmonary emboli.   Luckily I survived and am currently on blood thinners while trying to determine the cause of this, having no history of blood clots personally or in extended family.

He was having yellow sputum production and he had chills. Upon arrival to the hospital on 4/18 the patient was tachycardic and chest x-ray that showed cardiomegaly with fluid overload. Progressively became severely hypoxemic and had to be emergently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Patient developed cardiogenic shock which may be acute myocarditis and was placed on an Impella device and norepinephrine drip. The patient continued to worsen and developed acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia and was placed on CRRT. LFTs were also elevated. Patient also went into atrial fibrillation and was started on amiodarone drip. All of the above mentioned occurred within a 12 hour period.

On the morning of 19 APR 2021 at 0730 I began having chest pain, I thought I had pulled a muscle while exercising the night before. Throughout the morning the pain in my chest got worse until  I called  emergency services. The EMTs told me I had a blood clot in my heart and rushed me to the hospital. Once at the hospital I  had an angioplasty . No stint was inserted.   After the surgery the doctors told me I had very large veins and a strong heart after the clot was removed  flow returned and no stint was needed.   The doctors also told me that they could not rule out the COVID vaccine as the cause of my blood clot as the rest of me heart looked good with no visible plaques or build up.

Wife explained that patient was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome prior to being vaccinated. PCP unaware of diagnosis, and patient did not disclose that on vaccine consent form. Patient reported to his wife that he was feeling unwell after receiving vaccine including unable to move legs well. Patient later diagnosed with thrush and supposedly treated by physician. Patient did not discuss concerns regarding vaccine or WPW with physician.  Patient called his wife the day of death and asked her to bring him to the doctor the following day. Wife reported that patient experienced seizures but not concerned as it was similar to childhood seizure. Wife was done at work and drove home after phone call, arriving at house approximately 10-15 minutes after call. Patient supposedly dead when wife arrived. Wife performed CPR for ~15 minutes until EMS arrived, and EMS attempted for another 40 minutes for any electrical activity. Wife declined full autopsy from ME, suspecting that it was massive MI or clot. Wife and patient unaware that WCW could place patient at risk of clots and wondering if the vaccine was partially responsible.

I did not think much of that is reason I did not report it right away.  Day by day the discomfort and pain got worse.  Exactly one week after my second dose I was not able to sleep due to the pain.  On Wednesday 2/3 I decided to go urgent care.  From there I was referred for an ultra sound a few hours after.  After the ultra sound I was contacted by my doctor, letting me know that the results showed I had a blood clot on my left leg.  I was put on Eliquis medicine right away.  On 2/5 I was able to physically see my doctor who told me that this was caused by the second dose of the moderne vaccine that I took on 1/26.

Had xray but nothing was broken. thought he had sprained ankle.  Given prednisone.  Ankle continued to be swollen for following days so we followed up with family dr. on 3-22  who sent him for ultrasound which showed an extensive blood clot - DVT.   Sent to emergency room.  Put on blood thinner shots for a week and sent to doctor on 3-24.  He did many blood tests.  He started eliquis on 3-30.  Saw doctor again on 4-13.  His blood tests had shown he has Factor 5--Leiden.  On May 11 we saw doctor again.  Remain on Eliquis.  Another ultrasound and more bloodtests show clot is chronic, but blood thinner is doing its job.  No active clotting.

He waited the required 20 minutes to check for any adverse reaction and then left the facility to drive home. On his drive home, at approximately 3:30pm, he started feeling light headed and lost consciousness, striking a telephone pole. He was gasping and struggling to breathe, so the ambulance treated him with oxygen. When he arrived at the ER , the doctor assessed his condition and confirmed that he was experiencing an anaphylactic reaction related to the COVID vaccine and treated him with an epinephrine injection, steroids, benadryl, and nebulized albuterol.to open his airways. He remained at the ER for ~ 6 hours for observation until his blood oxygen levels increased and he was stable to be released. The car accident resulted in PT suffering a fractured sternum as confirmed via Chest CT Scan by his primary doctor. PT has no history of any allergic reaction to any medication or vaccine. Although he does have well-regulated asthma, this incident was not characteristic of any asthma-related reaction he has ever experienced.

Onlookers called 911 and after being transported to hospital CT scan revealed bilateral pulmonary embolisms and DVT blood clots were present. D-dimer blood test revealed a range 400 times the appropriate range.  Number exceeded the scale.  The number of clots on imaging were so numerous, the doctor that read the report said they would not even count them.   Was treated on heparin IV and placed in cardiac ICU, prescribed Eliquis to thin blood allowing the body to not create additional clots. In process of establishing a medical team to treat.

Evaluation was positive for bilateral DVT and pulmonary embolism     Bilateral PE, infarction, bilateral DVTs -No obvious precipitating factors -patient underwent first COVID 19 vaccine injection, is actually due for second shot.  Unclear if this is contributed, recommended to hold on getting second dose and discuss this with PCP.  -Also follow-up with PCP for appropriate cancer screening -patient was treated with therapeutic subcutaneous Lovenox, remained hemodynamically stable and is feeling better today.  Upon discharge we&#39;ll prescribe Elocon is 10 mg b.i.d. for another 5 days followed by 5 mg b.i.d. maintenance dose.  He will be provided with coupon for 1 month supply, he was recommended to follow-up with PCP for further recommendations.  He will probably need anticoagulation for at least 6 months or longer depending on further course. -Echocardiogram showed ejection fraction 50-55%, Mild mitral valve prolapse no evidence of RV strain.      Hemoptysis  -Most likely was related to PE and infarction -resolved.   Pleuritic chest pain, h/o Afib -Most likely pain was secondary to PE, improved -Continue Cardizem as prior to admission -Stop aspirin since patient will be on anticoagulation therapy   History of opioid dependence, alcohol abuse Continue suboxone     Ongoing smoking smoking cessation was advised   Disposition: Routine Discharge Home   CONSULTS: Consults Ordered during this Encounter Procedures ?

                                                Patient  developed episode of diarrhea shortly after 1st shot in series,  this was followed by  lower extremity swelling and mild dyspnea on exertion, that quickly exacerbated after the 2nd shot on 5/15/2021,  that resulted in severe dyspnea on exertion, severe lower extremity swelling with approximately 25 lb weight gain, orthopnea and hemoptysis. Patient reported temperatures of 99.2 F to 99.8 F.   Outside CT chest abdomen pelvis angiogram showed moderate to large acute segmental/subsegmental pulmonary emboli with trace right heart strain and right lower lobe pulmonary infarction, moderate right pleural effusion, acute splenic vein thrombosis with extension to the proximal portal vein and associated splenic infarcts, bilateral renal infarcts, and evidence of portal hypertension. He was transferred to the Hospital for further management. Upon presentation here he was tachycardic but with stable blood pressures and requiring up to 5 L by nasal cannula. Initial laboratory studies were notable for WBC 21.0, INR 1.8, D-dimer 11653, NT pro-BNP 17684, troponins 603 to 579 to 574, CRP 127. He was started on a heparin infusion. He was admitted to the MICU for further management.   Bedside ultrasound demonstrated reduced biventricular contractility. He was given two doses of 40 mg intravenous furosemide with about 3.5 L of urine output since admission (net negative 3.1 L). His oxygen was weaned to 1 L by nasal cannula. Lower extremity venous and arterial Dopplers were negative.  Subsequent imaging  demonstrated a transperineal inferior infarct with akinesis of the inferior septum, inferior and inferior lateral walls with apical and mid ventricle akinesis secondary to a complete occluded RCA.  moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade noted.  Upper extremity ultrasound demonstrated acute DVT in the lower right IJ, innominate, subclavian and proximal axillary veins.  MRI  venogram was negative for clots, but multiple acute and subacute enhancing infarcts within all 3 vasculature distributions consistent with embolic etiology were noted.  TTE showed of mural thrombus along the septal and inferior walls of the LV apex,  severely enlarged left ventricle with EF of 20%, severe hypokinesis.    Patient was aggressively IV diuresis, with improvement in respiratory status.  Maintained on  high-intensity heparin for pulmonary emboli, DVT, and diffuse arterial and venous thrombosis.  He was bridged to warfarin.  Patient was  prescribed LifeVest for primary prevention. Started on beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor given EF.     Patient planning on discharge 6/5-6/07, outcome pending.

Then, a few days later, on a Sunday so my Dr&#39;s office was closed, I started having extreme difficulty in my breathing. I went to the ER and, after having multiple testing, was diagnosed with the DVT and a PE in each lung (almost to the point of full blockage). I was kept in the hospital overnight so they could monitor my breathing to be sure I wasn&#39;t stopping breathing throughout the night. I&#39;m now on blood thinners for life.

                                                On 1/28/2021 at 0545 hours as I was on my way into work when I started to have severe right side chest pain, so much so that I had to pull over. Shortly thereafter ambulance arrived on scene at which time it was determined that I would be transported to the hospital. Once there, a series of tests were conducted, one of which was a D-Dimer blood test to rule out blood clots. That resulted in an elevated count to which a CT scan was ordered.   The result of the CT scan revealed that I had 2 Pulmonary Embolisms, one in the upper lobe of my right lung and one in the middle lobe of my right lung.   Due to me being what the doctors said was a healthy 45 year old with no underlying conditions or signs of DVT (deep vein thrombosis) they deemed me low risk at that time and advised I was at low risk of dying in the next 30days. However, they advised that at any time, the clot could possibly become dislodged and cause worse problems, possibly death if time is not given to the body to dissolve the clots. Ultimately it was determined that I be discharged and prescribed blood thinning medications to help thin the blood to prevent further clotting should I have a clotting issue (undetermined at this time).

He was placed on chair; pharmacist asked if he wouldl like to lie down and he declined. He stated he had felt nervous and scared about imz before his appointment. Patient did cut his lip in fall and was given napkins for bleeding and a cold compress for face and neck. Patient waited with us for 2 hours.

Later that night I started coughing up Tablespoons of fresh blood that wouldn&#39;t go away.  Took ambulance to ER.  CAT Scan showed an inflammation in lung and showed source of bleeding.  They diagnosed me with pneumonia though I had no other symptoms (no fever or elevated white count, cough, or anything).  Gave me IV antibiotics and sent me home with more antibiotics.   Following up with a GP next week and asking to see a pulmonary specialist.

                                                A friend of the patient called us today to inform us that the patient had recently passed away from a brain aneurysm. The friend asked it it were possible that this occurrence was somehow related to patient receiving his covid vaccination. The friend did not have a lot of information about the occurrence; he only stated that the patient&#39;s brain aneurysm was about 6 weeks after his 2nd dose of the covid vaccine. Patient was not a regular patient of ours so we have no additional medical history for him. We administered his first Moderna vaccine on 4-2-2021, and he returned for his second dose on 4-30-2021. I assured the friend I would report this to VAERS and thanked him for reaching out to us on behalf of patient.

Just had a full workup prior for insurance purposes. Pt went to ER as pain would not subside and was sleeping a lot. Was diagnosed with a infarction in the brain x2. Headaches have never really improved and now is currently admitted into hospital with two more blood clots in brain.

                                                Patient reported chest discomfort after initial COVID-19 infection in 12/2020 - mild, lasting for 2 weeks - did not seek medical attention  Received first dose of Moderna vaccine in 2/2021 - chest pain occurred and self resolved after 2 days. Received 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine on 3/19/2021 - chest pain start about 48 hours after wards and was constant prompting him to come to ER on 3/23/2021.  Troponin-I was borderline elevated but flat (0.065, 0.054, 0.050, 0.045 ng/mL); echocardiogram did not show any regional wall motion abnormalities or pericardial effusion and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.   With no reported events of myocarditis related to the vaccine at the time and lack of cardiac MR imaging at the facility, patient was briefly treated for presumed NSTEMI with dual antiplatelet, high-intensity statin therapy and initiation of beta-blocker and ACE-inhibitor.   On 4/19/2021, with inability to arrange for a local cardiac MR, and rule out underlying ischemic heart disease, a treadmill nuclear stress test was performed showing a moderate-sized fixed anterior and mid to apical anterolateral defect (sparing apex) with no evidence of ischemia on myocardial perfusion imaging or stress ECG.     With ambiguity regarding the diagnosis and patient&#39;s reluctance to take empiric high-dose NSAIDs with colchicine for presumed myopericarditis, he eventually underwent cardiac MRI at a tertiary care facility on 5/5/2021 showing preserved biventricular size and function with myocardial edema and subtle left ventricular mid wall enhancement involving inferoseptal/inferior wall at the inferior RV insertion point consistent with myocarditis.   Patient&#39;s aspirin and clopidogrel was subsequently discontinued.  He was initiated on high-dose ibuprofen for 2 weeks followed by 3 months of colchicine therapy with interval resolution of symptoms.

On 1/25/21 at approx 2am I had tremmors, feeling of intense cold, headache, body pain, fatigue. That lasted until approx 0300am 1/26/21. I slept most of the day 1/25 except for taking kid to school and monitoring another at home. I had read the side effects and I felt as though things were subsiding  on 1/26 but I was still weak with body pain. I was not 100%. I was home alone with 2 kids (wife out of town). 1/25 I had a cough and was short of breath but didn&#39;t think much of it. The cough persisted. On 1/27/21 I was still short of breath. I went to a nearby fire station and had them put me on a lifepack. I was in atrial fibrillation. I could not do anything because my wife wasn&#39;t due back until 3pm. At 3PM she walked in and I walked out and drove myself to Hospital. I was diagnosed with A-Fib w/ RVR. I was in A-fib until I was cardioverted on 2/1/21 and was given a cryo-ablation.

His risk factors for PE include immobility; however, the risk of a thrombotic event in quadriplegic patients should be that of the general population after the first year of disability, and he has been immobile for around 2.5 years. He has no known underlying malignancy, and his recent imaging of his chest and head are reassuring in this regard. The patient received his Moderna COVID-19 vaccine 12-23-20 and 2-2-21 with vascular events having been reported as being more common following this immunization. Without a clear cause for his PE, this will be reported on VAERS.

After the vaccine my heart rate shot up to nearly 300 while I was driving home and it eventually came down but I stayed in Afib for nearly 2 months afterwards.  I upped my dose to 400 mg daily from 320 mg of sotolol and eventually got some control of the Afib but now goes out of rhythm more frequently and when it goes out I am not rate controlled.

His Apple watch recorded it&#39;s last heart beat reading at 3:15 pm, 05/21/2021, within an hour after receiving his second Moderna Covid-19.  His heart rate  increased rapidly from 3:00 to 3:15, reading 104 - 106 - 108 - 116 bpm.  I can provide a photo of these last four readings if you need them.  I don&#39;t know other symptoms.  His body was found by police who were called for a well-check three days later, 05/24/2021.  Patient died unattended, at home, alone.  I only know for sure the vaccine was administered at a Target store near his home.  Patient texted me at 2:48pm saying that Target gave him a $5 coupon for getting his vaccine, and he was going to use it to buy Tylenol.

                                                I had the vaccine on Saturday and Monday early morning something woke me up, I was sweating and my heart was pounding like crazy. I thought it was the side effects of the vaccine. It took 3-4 hours to stop. After 2 weeks at 4AM something woke me up again and I was sweating for no reason. The same symptoms I had after getting the vaccine. On 06/18/2021 again 4AM something woke me up and I had the same sweating and I was throwing up. I thought it was the vaccine so I did not go to the hospital. I did not think this was a heart attack since I am young, healthy, non-smoker, non-drinker. Again, something woke me up. I went upstairs with my neighbor and she took me to urgent care because she thought it was COVID and I thought it was just the vaccine and they said to call ambulance immediately because I was having a heart attack. They took me to the hospital, and they started the procedure. They said it was impossible to open here. By helicopter they took me to another hospital. I was on the doctor on Friday and they told me I still have a blood clot and they try to open but they were not able to open so they left it like clotted. Now they told me they need to do the bypass surgery. No heart attack history in my family. I am not having that surgery because doctors do not care here. I am going to another country to have surgery since they do care over there and it is less expensive. They prescribed a lot of medications for my heart.

                                                Patient presented to provider office visit 2 days after 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine with testicular pain for last 2 days, bluish color on tips of left fingers.  Was prescribed levofloxacin x 7 days to cover for possible epididymitis and was told to monitor the finger discoloration and return to PCP next week for recheck.  The following day (7/17), he presented to the Emergency Department for evaluation of the fingertip discoloration.  He reported that the testicular pain had improved.   ED provider noted: Fingertips on 2 or 3 fingers of a few small thin lines that are purplish in color almost as if discoloration of the fingerprint itself.  But it is no more than 1 or 2 lines to 2 or 3 fingertips.  There is no erythema no swelling no tenderness.  There is no muscle soreness.  No axillary lymphadenopathy.  No ascending lymphangitis.  ED Course Differential Dx: Adverse reaction to Covid vaccine, DVT, electrolyte imbalance, coagulopathy, electrolyte imbalance, localized trauma   Lab normal white count hemoglobin platelet count mildly elevated hematocrit of 51.3.  CMP showed a low CO2 22 I suspect this is due to prior elevated respiratory rate he does admit that he slightly anxious.  Glucose was elevated 142 BUN was 6.  Liver function studies normal.  Coags normal   Did do ultrasound of his arm since he recently was vaccinated there is no evidence of DVT or any occlusion.   Patient&#39;s fingers are warm he has intact sensation I am not sure if this is an adverse reaction to the recent vaccine, some sort of unknown localized trauma.  I suggested patient follow-up closely with primary care for reeval this week if no improvement and return if any acute worsening symptoms or problems.

                                                After receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid Vacine I noticed shortness of breath, chronic dry coughing and fatigue/tirdness. Each week was progressively getting worse and rapid declining in my ability to fuction.  I was gaining weigh and felt very tired, but thought it was respitory infection and tried to rest hoping it would clear up and improve. After several weeks, I noticed that both feet and legs started to swell and wouldnt return to normal. The decline was rapidly getting worse and I was not able to simply tasks. I tried to get an appointment at my primary physisan and was unable to get an appt, they recommeded I visit urgent care, so I went and was told to go to ER, where I was admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure.

                                                Onset of shortness of breath and cough on 1/3 that progressively got worse. Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia without fever was made, patient started azithromycin on 1/5 and albuterol treatments every 4-6 hrs. Initially he improved, but then worsened.  chest xray on 1/6 was negative for pneumonia, PCR covid test was negative, albuterol treatment did not bring much relief. He started respiratory distress on 1/10 and was taken by car to the local ER where another covid test was negative and chest CT revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli. The leg US revealed blood clots in both of his legs. He had an emergency catheter-delivered thrombolysis and was discharged home from the ICU on 1/12 on oral anticoagulants. He is gradually improving, but very weak. He tires easily and gets a drop in oxygen to 90- 93%, as well as an increase in the heart rate to 120  when walking less than half a mile. He runs out of breath with exertion.

Baseline plt 74 at admission. Rivaroxaban 10mg PO QD was given 4/19/21 until 4/21/21. Plt count continued to downtrend during admission. Hematology/Oncology service consulted on 4/22/21 who initially suggested thrombocytopenia possibly due to infection or DIC. Yet, worsening thrombocytopenia despite improvement of infection and clinical status was noted. The etiology was then suggested to be Vancomycin induced thrombocytopenia, so Vancomycin was stopped on 4/22/21. Platelet count  Patient was discharged with p.o. prednisone and p.o. Levaquin on 4/27/21. Patient stated almost full resolution of LLE pain and redness. Plt count upon discharge was 51.

                                                The pt had his first Moderna covid vaccine on 3/19, and after the vaccination, he developed left upper lateral calf pain that lasted several weeks.  He then had his second Moderna covid vaccine on 4/22, with left knee pain, and again left upper lateral proximal calf pain.  He denies any chest pain, heaviness, tightness, pressure, palpitations, or dizziness.  He contacted his PCP, and he was advised to come to the ER for evaluation of a possible DVT.   This is very suspicious for a direct thrombotic side effect of the pt&#39;s Moderna vaccine.  The pt has a very high d-dimer, and we can not rule out a mid-distal thigh and left popliteal DVT, so the pt will be covered with Lovenox, and he will present to hospital tomorrow to obtain a venous duplex.  They can then, based on clot burden and his subsequent complaints on continuing lovenox bridge to warfarin or a direct acting anticoagulant.

                                                Narrative: Patient is a 49 year old man with past medical history of hypertension and kidney stones who presented with a chief complaint of word finding difficulties and slurred speech. Patient was last seen normal at 1230 pm on 1/21/2021. He got his covid vaccine and shortly after he developed a headache that was on both sides of his head. Felt like 8/10 pain. He then had difficulty with speaking - he didn&#39;t know what word to say so he would make a noise. He was on the phone, and that person recommended that he come to the ED to get evaluated.In the ED, a stroke code was called. BP 169/97. NIHSS 0. A CT non con did not show any acute bleed or any signs of a stroke. After the stoke code was ended, the patient has a headache severity 1/10 and did not have any word finding difficulties. Patient was non focal by the time that the stroke code was ended. In the setting of hypertension, a blood pressure of 169/97 on admission and fluctuating symptoms, most concerning on the differential is a TIA. Given his risk factors and episodic presentation, he will need to be worked up for a stroke. The differential also includes post-vaccination reaction vs complex migraine.

                                                On January 21, 2021 I started feeling pains in my right shoulder (1st shot was left shoulder) and the following day it had spread across my body, shoulders, chest, arms, legs and calves.   I also had a severe headache along with the muscle pains and woke up each day since in a pool of sweat with the sheet soaked to this day.   Due to the severe muscle pains, I started taking Tylenol and all the symptoms pointed to the virus itself.  I was tested for the virus on Monday, January 25th with negative results on the morning of the 26th.  I continued to self-medicate with Advil every four hours to remove the severe muscle pains noted above.   To back track slightly, I had a colonoscopy on January 19, 2021 and one large polyp was removed without issue.    Due to the full body muscles pains and taking the Advil, it likely caused bleeding from the polyp site of the colonoscopy and went to the ER and they transferred me back the hospital on January 28, 2021, the location of the colonoscopy, and hospital found nothing wrong with the colonoscopy during my 2.5 day stay there.    The did an x-ray of my chest to test for the flu and related items and found everything to be clear.   They also a CT of my abdomen to look for any abnormalities and found none.   Through all this the muscle pains continued when I would move, the muscles would fire up and intense pain persisted until I could calm them down after about 30 mins of intense pain.   Hospital also tested me twice for the COVID virus and each turned out negative.  Overall, I?ve been tested for the virus nearly 12 times and all were negative. From the visit to Hospital, with the colonoscopy and no additional bleeding occurring, Hospital gave me a steroid called Prednisone to mask the pain on Saturday, January 30, 2021 at about 1pm and by 4pm they fully released me with no idea what was causing the severe muscle pain across my body when I moved.   I literally just walked out of the hospital since the steroid masked the muscle pain issue.  The steroids worked but I was still walking up in a pool of sweat and very clammy and wet each morning from 1am until I woke up. On February 2, 2021 I had 3 bowel movements that were all dark purple and full of blood clots which led me back to Hospital and the ER could not get in touch with the Hospital Doctors for transfer so they admitted me to the Hospital, thank God. On February 4, 2021 Methodist performed an emergency colonoscopy to clamp the polyp site, took two additional polyps out and did an endoscopy to ensure my upper and lower GI track were clear, and it was and the two additional polyps were benign.   Through all this the serve muscle pains persisted and Hospital moved me to a patient room and out of the ER. Over the next several days, February 4 thru the 11th Hospital cleared me of everything they could test for, over 85 different tests were ran based on MyChart.     All my blood counts were all over the place, WBC were 19,000, Platelets were nearly 700, my sedimentation rate reached 64&#43; and the server muscle pains persisted and I was basically incapacitated during my entire stay at Hospital.    Hospital had several specialists seem me from Internal Medicine, Infectious Disease, Neurology to Rheumatoid ologist and none of them found anything wrong with me other than my COVID anti-bodies were enormously high with not signs of slowing down.    The conclusion by each of the specialist is that my symptoms all point to an Adverse Level 3 Inflammatory Reaction to the first COVID Vaccine shot.   The Infectious Disease specialists emphasized that I DO NOT get the second vaccine shot since it would like have killed me.  (We had cancelled my 2nd shot, scheduled for February 3, 2021 via Cancer Center the week of January 30, 2021.)  Hospital concluded that they could not do anything further for me since all their extensive testing all came up negative other then the COVID antibody levels and started me on the same steroid via IV on February 10, 2021 and on February 11, 2021 I was released from Hospital with a 28-day gradual reduction of the steroid over that timeframe to see if the COVID antibody production would simply stop.  They had no other recourse or follow up with for any of the specialists.  I?m on my own at this point and scared.  To help with the inflammation the only thing my wife and I saw we could do is see a health and well Doctor to try and purge myself of the inflammation and assist my bowel and liver health with trying to rid me of the vaccine and hopefully the antibody production.    I?m on a strict diet and taking supplements to assists in the reduction of inflammation and cleaning my system out.     Starting today, February 18, 2021 I start stepping back on the steroids prescribed by Hospital and praying that the symptoms and pain simply go away but I?m still having night sweats, weak and shaky.

Symptoms lasted until 6PM the next day. fever went back to normal around 4pm next day after shot.   * I NEVER had a fever when I had covid.   I had an Antibody test completed back in January. It was positive for Antibodies.  I had an antibody test back in 2020 BEFORE I had covid. It was negative.  A week late after 1st does of vaccine. My heartrate started to increase and had symptoms of Afib again. same symptoms of the Afib and heartrate and breathing, back after I had covid. Exact same feelings and symptoms.  The Afib/heart symptoms, stopped last week.   I am supposed to get 2nd dose this Thursday, and I am most likely not going to. I don&#39;t want the heart rate to increase again. I am having problems making an appointment to ask my doctor. My PCM changed, so it is all confusing and a pain.   Its best I just don&#39;t it.  I had antibodies as of january. I just had the 1st dose last month. I think I am god to go. Not worth the risk for me. I am sick of having covid symptoms, so why force it upon myself again....

                                                Got his vaccine, that evening he felt as if his face was on fire like a windburn.  The next morning had an incredible cold chill as soon as air hit him, bone shaking.  Then had cold chills/sweating with soaking of his groin area.  He can go to sleep with extreme chills and then wake up in a puddle of sweat.  He had a headache at first, took Tylenol and it went away.   Numbness in his foot like it&#39;s falling asleep, left hip hurting, left wrist pain.  Today both calves hurt./sore like workout burning pain.  Two days ago his father went to have bypass and was at the hospital with him, and walked painfully in but had difficulty hobbling along and was unable to walk back to his truck and had to borrow his dad&#39;s cane to be able to walk.  Yesterday he was going to cut the grass, knelt down to do something, and when trying to stand up was not able to walk due to the throbbing pain and had to use the cane again.  Also having swollen left ankle with discoloration.  The calf pain is extreme and throbbing, and the pain when he&#39;s not able to walk is in the calf.  The ankle has been swollen since Sunday, 4/18/21.  He spoke with the ICU nurse in the hospital and he told her about it and she grabbed his ankle and asked if he was sure he didn&#39;t have a blood clot.  He has not been able to shake the symptoms.  The issues with walking are intermittent, some days he can walk fine, the other days he has to use the cane.    He still continues with every day hot sweats/cold chills.  It&#39;s 74 where he is right now and has a sweatshirt on as he is cold.  Also the legs hurting, ankle swelling that he ices down at night but the swelling does not go away.  Feels like a hard knot in his ankle.   He has not sought any treatment for this at this point.

Very much flu like symptoms, heart pounding, head pounding and very light headed. I was having trouble controlling BP when I stood up.  I felt feverish, I kept checking my temp but it was normal.  This went on for two day, I wasn&#39;t able to eat or drink liquids. I ended up going and getting a Covid test on Tuesday morning, I was feeling somewhat ok. Then in the evening all my same symptoms came back.  I spoke with a Dr. who informed me I was probably dehydrated. I almost went into the Emergency Room because my high heart rate and thought I was having a heart attack. I didn&#39;t due to high volume of Covid in the ER. I have a follow up meeting with my PA before my second dose to come up with a strategy.  The left side of my face started to get numb and the left side of neck. My neck started to get still and went to my jaw.

At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Respiratory failure), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure), PNEUMONIA (Pneumonia), DEMYELINATING POLYNEUROPATHY (demyelinating neuropathy), BULBAR PALSY (Bulbar weakness), MUSCULAR WEAKNESS (Progressive Extremity Weakness), ASTHENIA (Weakness) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (trouble walking) outcome was unknown and ILEUS PARALYTIC (a dynamic ileus) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-Mar-2021, Electromyogram: abnormal (abnormal) consistent with demyelinating neuropathy.. On 30-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative (Negative) Negative.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   No concomitant medications reported by investigator.  Patient was presented to hospital on 3/6/21 with progressive extremity weakness, bulbar weakness, and respiratory failure attributed to AIDP s/p 5days IVIG. He had received his first Moderna COVID vaccination approximately two weeks prior to this and immediately following administration began experiencing weakness and trouble walking. EMG 3/15/21 consistent with demyelinating neuropathy. Hospitalization was  complicated by the development of adynamic ileus which is improving and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (previously requiring O2 support). Patient was also treated for pneumonia with a 5 day course of azithromycin. Once medically stable he was deemed appropriate for inpatient rehabilitation and was transferred from Hospital to rehab on 3/31/21 under care. The patient tested negative COVID-19 on 3/30, and repeat testing since also has been negative.

                                                1-2 weeks after the second vaccination, pt. began experiencing fatigue, headache, muscle aches. He then developed a rash all over his body, and sores on his tongue. Then he developed a fever, was unable to leave his bed, passed out multiple times, and was eventually admitted to the hospital with a 105 degree fever and pneumonia on the morning of July 10th. They could not keep his blood pressure up and put him on three different drugs to keep him alive, and by the end of July 10th, just 12 hours after he was admitted, he was put on a ventilator because he was not able to breathe on his own anymore. His white blood cell count was 0.2, and every time they changed the IV bags and momentarily discontinued the BP medicine, he would drop to critical levels. On the second day they were fairly sure he was not going to make it, but he has since gotten a little better. They have been giving him blood transfusions and platelets. He has remained on a ventilator for 18 days now, and has developed fevers every afternoon, up to 102 degrees, which they keep bringing down again with medication and ice.   They have tested him for practically ever disease known to man for 18 days. There is no cause they can find. Not cancer, not autoimmune disease, nothing. Pt. has not been to the hospital since he was a child and it was for injury, not illness. He has never had any sort of major disease or cancer or chronic illness. The hospital or me, his mother, can be contacted for any further questions.

He was advised to stay home, was offered Covid testing but refused. On 3/22/21 the RN received an email from patient&#39;s supervisor that he still felt unwell and reported vomiting and diarrhea. Was offered a Covid test but refused.  -Per patient&#39;s friend (a nurse who informed us of the case) various friends spoke with patient up until the morning of 3/25 and he reportedly had no respiratory or cardiac complaints. They were unable to reach him the evening of 3/25, nor the morning of 3/26 so sent the police for a well check and patient was found dead. He lived alone. -Per OSME. Patient did not receive an autopsy but did have an &#34;inspection&#34; which includes an external exam, toxicology and other testing including Covid testing which was positive. The specimen has been sent for sequencing. -Of note, Patient worked in a group  home that had an outbreak of Covid in Jan/early Feb. His last exposure to a &#43; person was likely 2/8/21 but possibly 2/10/21. He had a Covid test 2/15/21 that was &#34;inconclusive&#34;. The test was re-run (same assay) and was also &#34;inconclusive&#34;

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Open heart surgery. Concomitant products included POTASSIUM, FUROSEMIDE (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]), WARFARIN, METOPROLOL SUCCINATE (TOPROL XL), MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (PRENATAL VITAMINS [MINERALS NOS;VITAMINS NOS]), CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) and ESCITALOPRAM OXALATE (LEXAPRO) for an unknown indication.    On 11-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Mar-2021, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required), VERTIGO (Room spinning) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability, medically significant, life threatening and intervention required). The patient was hospitalized from 19-Mar-2021 to 21-Mar-2021 due to TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK. On 21-Mar-2021, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Mini-stroke transient ischemic attack), VERTIGO (Room spinning) and BLEPHAROSPASM (Winking eyelids involuntarily) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient received vaccine in right non-dominate deltoid muscle to prevent COVID-19. Patient was admitted to hospital from 19Mar2021 to 21Mar2021 for a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) scan, with observation and Low-Dose Aspirin. Patient was feeling much better and his cardiologist recommended that he receives his second Moderna vaccine as soon as required and to take an extra Vitamin D supplement as a precaution. Scheduled second dose was due on 08Apr2021. Treatment included was low dose aspirin.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

As the pain did not resolve over the next week and felt similar to a DVT experienced post a spinal fusion in 2018 I consulted, on 4/16/2021, with the vascular surgeon, who treated my post surgery DVT in 2018 . He performed an ultrasound and identified a clot in my right calf. On 4/21/2021 he prescribed a course of Eliquis (initial dose 20 mg per day) to resolve the clot. As of today (4/23/2021) the pain has lessened but not resolved. In addition to the DVT I experienced a significant level of fatigue for 3 days post the vaccination. While the fatigue has lessened it has not completely resolved.

                                                54 days after the first vaccination with Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine, and 25 days after the second vaccination, at approximately 0730 on Day 1, a 52 year old male, height 175.2cm, weight 95.5kg, without significant medical history or prodrome, had an acute onset of dyspnea manifesting as a small sigh at intervals of 4-6 minutes, which increased in frequency to intervals of 2-3 minutes over the course of the day. At approximately 1400 he had a one minute episode of tachycardia &gt;120 bpm. At 1515, his forehead became diaphoretic. He had neither chest pain nor a pericardial friction rub at any time. He went directly to the local emergency department. Additional information for Item 18:   Blood pressure at admission was 155/87, pulse 97, respiratory rate 22/minute, SpO2 98%, and Temperature 37.2. ECG at 1539 interpreted as: &#34;NSR at 85, Lateral ST depressions; ST elevations in aVR, ischemia / Posterior wall MI&#34;.  ECG at 1541 showed: NSR at 82, unchanged from prior ECG. ECG at 1552 interpreted as: &#34;Sinus tachycardia at 102, ST depressions remain in lateral leads but now also in V3 and V4; persistent ST elevations in aVR CW evolving posterior wall MI&#34;. PR depression in leads II and V4-6, and reciprocal PR segment elevation in aVR (pericarditis ECG Stage 1) Atypically for pericarditis, ST depression, rather than ST elevation, was present in leads V3-V6.  Owing to a working diagnosis of an evolving posterior wall myocardial infarction,  an emergent cardiac catheterization was performed, which demonstrated non-obstructive CAD and a small myocardial bridge. Initial laboratory values were notable for a white blood cell count of 11.89 K/mm3 (4.5 - 11.5), monocytes 1.1 K/mm3 (0.0 -1.0), 9.4% (2.0 - 9.0),  neutrophils 7.9 K/mm3 (1.5 - 6.6), 66.9% (40.0 - 75.0). Troponin was negative at admission and 18 hours later. D-Dimer was negative. Viral panels including SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, Influenza B, and RSV were negative. He was admitted for overnight observation. On Day 2 an echocardiogram was normal with no effusion, and ECG was notable for the absence of PR depression and persistent ST depression in leads (PR segment normalization part of pericarditis ECG Stage 2)... His dyspnea persisted, with a moderate sigh every 1-2 minutes at rest. He was discharged with a presumptive diagnosis of coronary vasospasm or a pulmonary etiology, and told to follow up with his pmd. Over the next several days, his dyspnea was continuous and progressively worsened, and he had diaphoresis of the forehead every morning approximately 0900 until Day 20. Sleep remained normal. On Day 5 he was sighing deeply more than once per minute at rest, causing him distress, and ECG showed (?persistent ST depression in V4-6 with reciprocal changes in aVR). On Day 12, ECG showed T-wave inversion in V1-6 and ST depression in V3-6 (ECG Stage 3); a computed tomography of the chest was normal; and blood tests notable for normal monocyte count .57 K/microliter (0.0 - 0.8), normal CRP 2.15 (1.0-3.0), and an ANA titer of 1:80 (elevated) described as a speckled pattern, which is associated with several autoimmune diseases. Repeat echocardiography on Day 26 showed a small, generalized pericardial effusion and was otherwise normal. Cardiac MRI on Day 29 showed delayed gadolinium uptake. Pulmonary function tests on Day 38 were normal. Stress echocardiography on Day 44 was normal. Cardiac CT angiogram on Day 46was normal. The patient was diagnosed with pericarditis of unknown origin and started on aspirin 650 mg p.o. b.i.d. An ECG on Day 80 showed PR depression in II and V4-6, continued ST depression in II and V3-6, without T wave inversion (T wave normalization c/w ECG Stage 4). Symptoms progressively worsened from onset to nadir around Day 12, on which he had continuous moderate dyspnea upon awakening with severe dyspnea with mild exertion. Symptoms then generally improved until after Day 47, he began to have alternating periods of several days without symptoms followed by several days of  mild dyspnea.  Clinical symptoms resolved on Day 85.

He communicated with friends later that same day saying he was tired and needed to rest. On May 13, 2021, a work colleague followed up with a text message to see how he was doing to which my brother did not respond. This same colleague went to his house a few days later to find him dead lying on his couch.

He was found to be in fine ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation efforts failed. He was brought to Hospital ED where he was pronounced dead. He had underlying cardiac disease but his family requested I report this event as possibly related to the recent COVID vaccination.

                                                Patient is a 53 year old man with a past medical history of follicular lymphoma diagnosed in 2008, more recently with DLBCL with CNS involvement (involving hypothalamus; dx 8/2018; s/p HD MTX, s/p BMT- followed by Dr.), autoimmune hepatitis, obesity, adipic DI, central hypothyroidism and type 2 DM who presented to Hospital via EMS after a  fall at home with multisystem organ failure leading to intubation in the ED and subsequent transfer to Oncology ICU for further management.   He was in his usual state if health until Sunday. On Saturday he got COVID vaccine at 4pm, that evening he had no issues. Sunday night around 10pm he didn&#39;t make complete sense and his wife was concerned because of his history of DM and treated CNS lymphoma. BG was 320-340 at that time. Monday he was good and Monday night he started to have shaking of his left hand. Tuesday he had one episode of diarrhea. Later he was more shaky in the shower and he started to fall and his wife was unable to grab him and he slid down the wall and could not get up.  Family was called to help and he was not making sense so they called EMS.  Wife reports that he was down approximately 3 hours before EMS was able to get him up. In EMS he was noted to have a large area of skin desquamation from the right posterior knee to the ankle. His GCS was 15. He had stable blood pressure and heart rate. He was hypoxia to the 50s and oxygen was applied.   In the ED he was found to be in multisystem organ failure and was intubated and had rapid progression of shock requiring  Epinephrine, Levophed and Vasopressin. Crash lines were placed and he was sent to hospital.  Upon arrival he was noted to have a cold pulseless right lower extremity and surgery was called. He was evaluated by Trauma Surgery, Orthopedic surgery and Vascular surgery and eventually underwent above the knee amputation. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all nonviable tissue and he continued to deteriorate. He was taken level 1 back to the OR and an additional 10 cm of nonviable tissue was removed. Unfortunately upon arrive he suffered cardiac arrest in the setting of severe lactic acidosis and hyperkalemia.

                                                Patient report to have been in A-fib for three days after receiving first dose of vaccine; Throat closure; Felt like anaphylaxis; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was a 53-year-old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who developed atrial fibrillation and an anaphylactic reaction.    The patient&#39;s medical history included heart failure and allergies to butter and NSAIDS.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included metoprolol, diltiazem, apixaban, lisinopril and loratadine.    The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 040A21A) on 11 Mar 2021 in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Mar 2021, the patient reported that he experienced a moderate reaction; throat closure (not complete).  He stated that it felt like anaphylaxis.  He also reported having a numb tongue. He reported that the reaction was not immediate and that  it started about four hours after the vaccine.    Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovered/resolved. The outcome of the event, anaphylactic reaction, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 53-year-old male who experienced a serious anaphylactic reaction with serious unexpected event of atrial fibrillation and throat closure.  Event onset occurred the same day as the first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment not reported. Atrial fibrillation resolved, and anaphylaxis resolving. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I am unable to get the lot number of the vaccine because it was entered through the state  system and the lot number did not go over. No lot number is associated with the vaccine.

                                                Eight days after receiving the Moderna shot I woke up in the morning  (3/22/2021) with irregular heartbeat.  My family doctor confirmed via EKG that I was in Atrial Fibrillation (Afib).  Blood samples were taken, test results were normal. Blood thinners were described. Went to see a cardiologist (3/23/2021) where the Afib was confirmed. Following that visit an echocardiogram of the heart was performed, results were normal. Afib turned into persistent mode and I decided to undergo a cardioversion (4/21/2021) to bring my heart back into regular sinus rhythm. Even though the cardioversion turned out to be initially unsuccessful, I experienced the last Afib episode at the end of last month (4/28/2021).

                                                Hospitalized after vaccination with acute submassive PE.  ASSESSMENT / PLAN: Patient is a 53-year-old male in no significant past medical history who presented with complaints of progressively worsening shortness of breath, chest pressure and was found to have acute submassive pulmonary embolism for which he underwent successful mechanical thrombectomy per Interventional Radiology.  Subsequent bilateral lower extremity DVT ultrasound demonstrated acute DVTs in the left popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal veins. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: PRESENTING PROBLEM: Acute pulmonary embolism, unspecified pulmonary embolism type, unspecified whether acute cor pulmonale present (HCC) [I26.99] HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 53-year-old male in no significant past medical history who is admitted for Acute Saddle Pulmonary Embolism. In the ED, the patient was tachycardic, tachypenic requiring 2 L of O2. CT angiogram thorax showed saddle embolus with extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli and evidence for right heart failure. He was immediately started on IV Heparin. PERT Team was activated and the patient underwent a successful mechanical thrombectomy with IR. Dopplers of the lower extremity showed Left lower popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal DVTs. After 24 hours of hemodynamically stable vitals, the patient was transition to Eliquis.  The patient stay was complicated with elevated blood glucose along with Hba1c of 9.7. Endocrinology was consulted and started the patient with Lantus and LDC. The patient will be discharged with diabetic regimen and followed up with PCP/outpatient Endocrine.    The patient was stable, AOx4, without complications and discharged safely to his home with his wife.

Labs at that time were notable for significant thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate, elevated procalcitonin. Chest imaging showed bilateral airspace disease. CT of the abdomen noted hepatosplenomegaly with no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Echocardiogram showed normal cardiac function. He was empirically started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Labs on 5/13/2021 were notable for a markedly elevated ferritin level, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, elevated CRP, elevated transaminase levels, hyperbilirubinemia, markedly elevated CXCL-9 level, markedly elevated IL-18 level, normal natural killer cell function. Of note, while his blood and urine cultures were negative, he was found to have elevated EBV viral load on peripheral blood draw. He had a bone marrow biopsy which reportedly showed rare evidence of cells with what appeared to be erythrocytes within their cytoplasm, concerning for HLH.  Given strong clinical and serological suspicion for HLH, he was transferred to our hospital for a higher level of care. Upon transfer to our facility on 5/18/2021, his inflammatory markers were persistently elevated. He unfortunately developed worsened renal and respiratory failure, and required both hemodialysis and intubation respectively. He was continued on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, however we additionally initiated high-dose steroids as well as anakinra for treatment of HLH. Given EBV viremia, we also began rituximab therapy. He was successfully extubated, however as of 5/26/2021 remains dialysis-dependent with continued improvement in urinary output. His post-intubation course has been complicated by encephalopathy of unknown etiology. We have consulted infectious disease to proceed with a diagnostic lumbar puncture to ascertain potential CNS pathogens explaining the cause of his altered mental status. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of pathology. CNS involvement by HLH remains on our differential.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Obesity.   On 16-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 15-May-2021 at 2:00 PM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 15-May-2021, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Acute hypoxic respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), DYSPNOEA (Stuggling to breathe) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged) and GAIT DISTURBANCE (Struggling to walk) (seriousness criterion hospitalization prolonged). In May 2021, the patient experienced SEPSIS (Acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), CARDIAC FAILURE ACUTE (Acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), CARDIAC ARREST (Cardiac arrest) (seriousness criteria death and medically significant), INFECTION (Blood infection) and PYREXIA (Fever). On 17-May-2021, the patient experienced SEIZURE (Seizures) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant) and THROMBOSIS (Bood clots) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 15-May-2021 to 25-May-2021 due to DYSPNOEA, GAIT DISTURBANCE, SEIZURE and THROMBOSIS. The patient died on 25-May-2021. The reported cause of death was Cardiac arrest, Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, ards and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis. It is unknown if an autopsy was performed. At the time of death, SEIZURE (Seizures), THROMBOSIS (Bood clots), DYSPNOEA (Stuggling to breathe), GAIT DISTURBANCE (Struggling to walk), INFECTION (Blood infection) and PYREXIA (Fever) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 15-May-2021, Blood pressure measurement: elevated (High) Twice normal. On 15-May-2021, Glycosylated haemoglobin: elevated (High) High. On 15-May-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Required intubation and was placed on ventilator.. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 antibody test: negative (Negative) 1 negative COVID antibody test. On 15-May-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negatie (Negative) 3 negative COVID antigen tests.         No concomitant medications were provided.  It was reported that within few hours after second dose of vaccine patient was struggling to walk and to breathe. The reporter and her husband went to see the patient and took him to an emergency room (ER). In the ER his blood pressure was markedly elevated (twice normal) and his oxygen level was low and by midnight he required intubation and was placed on a ventilator. His HbgA1c was noted to be elevated. Two days after admission (17-May-2021), he developed seizures which the medical team believed to be due to blood clots and he was anti-coagulated. It was determined that he did not have blood clots on his heart valves as the source of the clots. The source of the blood clots was never identified. He later developed fever and was diagnosed with a blood infection and treated with antibiotics. At one point his oxygen requirement on the ventilator went down to 65% but later returned and remained at 100%. He ultimately died on 25-May-2021 and as per copy of his death certificate he had 4 causes of death as cardiac arrest, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute exacerbation of heart failure and sepsis.  Treatment included, anticoagulants, antibiotics, intubation and ventilator.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.

                                                Patient was given 2nd Moderna vaccine at about 7:30. Patient was pale and diaphoretic and was lowered to the floor by RN and another patient receiving the vaccine who was a cardiologist. He had several beats of clonus and then woke up. He was awake when his first vital signs were obtained. HR 110, BP 190/96, O2 sat 100%. When he was more awake he was assisted in to a reclining chair. BP monitored every few minutes and dropped as low as SBP 104, HR 70-80s. Pt reported that he periodically syncopizes, last 6mo ago. He reported feeling lightheaded after seeing his arm bleed and be swollen after vaccination. After about 1 hours the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable but he continued to have symptoms of lightheadedness which worsened when I sat him up (though BP was stable). EMS was called and he was transported to the ED.

                                                Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in right lower leg.  Symptoms initially occurred about two days after feeling sick with a high fever.  Initially, the pain in the right calf muscle was thought to be a muscle or tendon strain.  On May 22nd, during a campout, there was pain along the entire right leg, but at the time I thought it was just related to lower back pain from sleeping on the ground.  On May 27 and 28th there was sharp pain at the bottom of my right foot, then on May 29th I noticed sweeling and a hard warm spot just above the inside right ankle.  I reported to a local urgent care clinic first  then was referred to Medical ER.

                                                54 year old male with no  known past medical history who received 2nd dose of his Moderna COVID vaccine at the end of May 2021 (unsure of actual date). The day after he received his second moderna vaccine he developed polydipsia, polyuria and substantial fatigue in addition to muscle aches, nausea, and malaise. His symptoms initially improved but then slowly worsened again, developing shortness of breath, palpitations, heat intolerance, and continued polyuria, polydipsia. Three days prior to presenting to our hospital (which was 3 weeks after his 2nd vaccine dose), pt developed worsening nausea with vomiting and substantial worsening of shortness of breath.  On admission to our hospital, he was found to be in Diabetic ketoacidosis (no prior history of Diabetes, auto-immune Diabetes labs pending) as well has having new pulmonary embolism, Atrial fibrillation with RVR, and hyperthyroidism with anti-tpo abs (other&#39;s thyroid antibodies still pending). Given the time course of his presentation, it seems to us that he developed these conditions as a complication of his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine.

On 5/2/2021,    I started to notice a pain in my leg and went to my normal routine physical and brought that to my doctor&#39;s attention. I was sent to get an ultrasound on 5/6/2021 and 2 blood clots were detected.  DVT thrombosis on my right calf and another behind my right knee.   My 2nd dose of vaccine was schedule for 5/7/2021 and my doctor approved me to go ahead to receive the vaccine (2nd dose Moderna lot #041B21A IM LA).  After getting the vaccine, I went to pick up my prescription (Rivaroxaban) for blood thinner for my blood clots.  I am going to be on that medication for 6 months.  I have also been on Androgel testosterone gel for 10 years which has a warning for blood clots.  My doctor have taken me off of the medication for now.

The patient&#39;s medical history included daily exercise and no personal or family history of clotting issues and no trauma. Products known to have been used by the patient were not provided.  On 02 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 039k20-2a) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 30 Jan 2021, approximately 28 days after the first dose, and prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012m20a) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 30 Jan 2021, the patient reports that for the first 18 hours, he experienced fever, chills and myalgia.   On 01 Feb 2021, the patient reports that he thought the myalgia was continuing, as he had pain in his chest and back. The chest pains gradually worsened.  On 05 Feb 20221, the patient went to the emergency room and was admitted.  He was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. He was started on enoxaparin sodium but switched to apixaban. A computerized tomography study of the lungs showed that he had bilateral pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct and atelectasis. His dimer was 4800. COVID-19 test was negative.  An echocardiograph was performed, no results were reported. An ultrasound of the legs was performed and ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Date of discharge was not specified.  On an unknown date two days after discharge, the patient experienced left leg pain and returned to the emergency department. Patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis that ran the entire length of the femoral artery. Patient was switched back to enoxaparin sodium and taken off the apixaban. A repeat computerized tomography study was done to see if the pulmonary embolism was progressing and it was not, however, it showed pulmonary effusions. All current lab work was reported as normal, except for an increased prothrombin time. COVID-19 test was negative.  Patient continues to be followed by a pulmonologist and hematologist.  Consent to contact patient, pulmonologist and hematologist was obtained.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, fever/pyrexia, chills, myalgia, chest and back pains, bilateral pulmonary embolism/pulmonary embolism, multiple areas of infarct/pulmonary infarct, ateltheisis/atelectasis, left leg pain, and deep vein thrombosis, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. Company assessed the events to be unlikely related to company product.

                                                Mild case of pneumonia; Tested positive for COVID; Shortness of breath; A spontaneous was received from a healthcare facility staff member concerning 55 years of old, male patient who developed shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID. The patient&#39;s medical history included back issue. The patient had an epidural for bulging disk in back in an unknown date in December. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 29-JAN-2021, eight days prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: unknown) on left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20-JAN-2021, the patient had COVID symptoms including congestion and cough but tested negative on rapid testing. Since tested negative, the patient received first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled on 29-JAN-2021 at Hospital.  On 06-FEB-2021 after experiencing shortness of breath, the patient was retested by rapid test, which was also negative. However, the patient tested positive for COVID on Polymerase Chain reaction test at Urgent Care. The patient had a mild case of pneumonia  The reporter believes that the patient probably was positive before, as patient had been home since 19-DEC-2020 due to a back issue. Thinks that the patient&#39;s son may have been asymptomatic and all eight members in the household tested positive except the reporter. Treatment for the events included antibiotic azithromycin 5 days z-pack.  The events shortness of breath, mild case of pneumonia and tested positive for COVID were considered recovered/resolved on an unknown date.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality and high probability of corona infection from the close contacts where all eight members in the household were tested positive except the patient immediately before the vaccination, the event is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

The hospital discovered a coronary artery embolism with myocardial infarction.  I was taking a blood thinner at the time so the blood clout should not have formed to begin with.   No heart disease was found and once clout was removed by heart function returned.  I had had my first COVID-19 shot the Thursday before the event so I thought I should report the event in case there&#39;s a connection.

The time of the shot and the AFIB is NOT a coincidence. I suffered through this attack until Wednesday March 24. On advice through Dr.&#39;s nurse I went to the emergency room at the hospital. After 3 hours  and IV&#39;s to reduce my heart rate I was okay to go home. This is still happening periodically since the ER visit where it was EXTREMELY rare before.  I have decided NOT to get the 2nd dose as I am worried I will have to go to the ER again. Will one dose be enough to combat the virus? Please e-mail an answer if possible.

                                                On 4-18-21, 17 days after 1st dose of Moderna, he developed upper abdomen pain, chest discomfort. He thought it was indigestion and treated it as such. When he got no relief he went to Emergency room where a cardiac alert was initiated. After he died I was told he had developed myocarditis,/pericarditis and they had to remove a liter of blood from the sac around his heart, but that his heart had gone into cardiogenic shock and that he died. They were prepared to insert a stint thinking he had a blocked coronary artery, but his arteries were clear and they had no idea what had caused this to happen.  When he died so soon after the vaccine there were people who wanted to blame the vaccine but I checked into it and there were NO links between the vaccine and myocarditis, pericarditis or cardiogenic shock.  Within a few weeks of his death, there began to be possible links between the vaccine and myocarditis. I know 55 is older than what is being looked at, but he had absolutely no previous cardiac history prior to this and this case should e looked at as well

This presentation required brief hospitalization for treatment of a presumed cellulitis and further diagnostic workup of fevers and lymphadenopathy.  The patient was treated with antibiotics for cellulitis and empirically for possible tick-borne illness (early Lyme, glandular tularemia) with notable improvement in the skin erythema and fevers.

                                                This is a 55 yo male who contacted his care team on 4/28/21 to report that following his covid vaccine (Moderna dose #2 on 4/24/21), he developed Afib (symptoms = palpitations).  Patient does have a history of Afib, diagnosed in 2011, last seen by cardiology in 2017.  Patient reports that he will have Afib episodes every few months, they last 6-10 hours (with palpitations), then he self-converts back.  In this current episode, it has been persistent.  He was advised to report to ED and f/u with his cardiologist.  No notes regarding an ED visit.  Cardiology visit took place on 5/5/21.  BP=134/90, HR=147, Ht=77in, wt=162.8kg; Labs wnl except chol=224, Trig=180, LDL=142.  EKG=Afib with RVR, rate 125bpm.  Patient was initiated on anticoagulation (apixaban) and completed a cardioversion and TEE on 5/13/21.  Patient was managed on diliazem and flecainide. On 5/18, patient called to report he was back in Afib, however he self converted within 24hr.  Although patient has a history of Afib and the vaccine is not a clear cause, I will report to VAERS as a potentially clinically significant event.

                                                I had a sharp pain in my back and pressure in my chest. The ER doctor said that I had a small case of pneumonia. I&#39;m not sure if it had anything to do with the vaccine.

The number one thing that was related to this was low heart rate. Since I&#39;ve been taken off nabibolol 2.5mg, I haven&#39;t had this experience in three days. While I was taking nabibolol 2.5mg, I was having this experience regularly. When I was 45, I learned that I had coronary artery disease and I had 2 stints put in. I have not experienced any other heart issues since then, until now.

It was as if the left side of my body was in a different time zone than the right side.  I called the nurse line; they suggested a visit to the ER.  My BP was way up, and I panicked just a little; but, tried to use my mindfulness practice to observe the unfolding events, rather than being consumed by them.  There was a CT of my skull wherein they found indications of &#34;an old&#34; stroke; so, they decided that it was possible I had a stroke.  I was transferred from the Medical Center to the Stroke Center at the Medical Center under the care of Dr.  Another CT with contrast and a MRI confirmed &#34;OLD&#34; stroke, but nothing new.  I was assured the vaccine had nothing to do do with my symptoms, and that I most likely experienced a Trans Ischemic Attack (TIA), and that the situation was merely a coincidence as they believe the vaccine had nothing to do with the TIA.  However, based on my personal experience of the events as they unfolded, it is my sincere belief that the vaccine was incidental to the effects as I experienced them.  I was kept overnight for further observation, released the next day, and had a follow-up with my primary care physician at the Med Center.  I am now taking an 81 mg aspirin, Plavix, and 80 MG Clopidogrel as a precaution, and my symptoms have been gradually fading away.

Patient arrived in ED on 3/4/21 at approx 9AM via ambulance.  ED physician note:  &#34;56-year-old male brought in by EMS intubated with CPR in progress.  It was reported that he arrived to work and then passed out.  CPR was initiated almost immediately.  BLS determined that he was  pulseless and AED was applied.  He was defibrillated twice.  He was then intubated by ALS and administered epinephrine twice with return of spontaneous circulation.  He maintained a pulse for approximately 20 minutes when he again developed cardiac arrest.  ACLS guidelines were again initiated and there was no return of pulse for approximately 20-25 minutes until he arrived in the emergency department.  Emergency department CPR was continued and he was administered an additional epinephrine with return of a pulse.  Is reported that he had no complaints prior to the event.&#34;  Patient was intubated and ventilated, started on norepinephrine drip in ED.  Twelve-lead EKG demonstrated right bundle branch block with left posterior fascicular block and diffuse QRS widening and diffuse repolarization abnormalities.  Family consented to Cath Lab.    Per Interventional Cardiologist note:  &#34;1.  Angiography demonstrated proximal to mid LAD hazy 90-95% lesion likely culprit for cardiac arrest.  1 stent placed.  2.  Diffuse distal right coronary disease that is likely nonculprit for cardiac arrest.  3.  Left ventriculography demonstrated severe anterior wall hypokinesis with overall left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%.  4.  Patient electrically and hemodynamically stable.  Levophed has been stopped.  Amiodarone bolus given in the Cath Lab for frequent ventricular ectopy.  No drip was continued due to resolution of ectopy.  5.  Dyslipidemia he will be on high-dose statin therapy.  6.  Diabetic management as per primary team.  7.  Quad-Lumen placed by me.  Hypothermia protocol to be initiated in the ICU given GCS score less than 8 with no purposeful movements.  Head CT scan completed before cardiac catheterization that demonstrated diffuse cerebral edema.  8.  Prognosis guarded and likely poor.  The next 24 to 40 hours will be critical.  Family was updated in detail.&#34;  Patient transferred to ICU post Cath Lab.  Remains intubated, ventilated in ICU.

Approximately two weeks after receiving the first Moderna vaccine patient states he started to have pain in the lower leg which was not normal. Pain increased to a point that patient seeked care and was evaluated for a blood clot which he was told was &#34;negative&#34; as no clot was initially found. On 4/28/2021 Patient presented to pharmacy to receive second dose. Pharmacist asked how patient tolerated first dose to which he replied he had no issues, so the second dose was administered. AFTER the second dose, patient did state he was seen by a CNP for leg pain but a clot was ruled out. Approximately 3 weeks after the second dose of Moderna vaccine the patients leg pain increased to a point that he presented to the local ER and it was determined at that visit that he did indeed have a large blood clot in the leg and a second smaller clot in the upper thigh. He was sent home on Eliquis. He subsequently presented to another ER approximately one week later for uncontrolled leg pain due to massive size of blood clot in leg. At this point, patient is at home recovering.

No reaction 1st 15 minutes.    5/15/21 - small fever in the evening    5/16/21  In bed all day with Fever and Fatigue.     5/20/21 Becoming short of breathe going upstairs in my residence.   Complained to my wife after a couple of days saying I was getting winded just climbing the stairs.   I thought maybe it was  common chest cold.   5/29/21 1:00 am - woke up to 102 degree fever.    Fever went down to 99 and up to 100.8 over the next 4 days cycling throughout the day and night.     Shortness of breath was getting a little worse and it would take 10 seconds to recover going up the stairs in my home, after several deep breathes.    June 1st, I went to CVC pharmacy to take a COVID19 test.   The scheduled me for the next morning, June 2, 2021 at 10:00 am.   I completed that test and returned home.  At about 2:00 - 2:30 pm, I stood up from the couch and walked out to my front porch.  I bent over to pick up some light items from the porch so the gardener could trim the bushes near the porch.  As I walked to the garage (main front 2 car entrance), I suddenly became very short of breathe, my heart began racing, and I could not get a full breathe.    I walked slowly inside my house and used my blood pressure cuff and oximeter.  Blood pressure was at 170/121  heart rate 112, and the oximeter showed oxygen level 75  %SPo2 with heart rate 110.    I was taken directly to the Emergency Room where X-ray and CT scans showed I had numerous blood clots throughout my lung arteries.   I am on oxygen and blood thinners for an indefinite amount of time.

                                                I had a  Lifeline screening ( they did an EKG and a Carotid and Blood tests on me) after  the vaccine- I got a odd reading on a c-reactive protein - inflammation and infection in the body - Can get those records from them. Started taking my blood pressure and I noticed thing weren&#39;t right with my heart. I went to my doctor   his office clinic  they are moving their office, though next month) with a federally funded program for the testosterone  replacement therapy- he had give me testosterone replacement therapy which I have since stopped with recommendation by the cardiologist - it makes my blood very thick ) and he told me I had A-Fib - gave me samples of Xarelto and he said to come back on Monday and confirmed the A-Fib. doctor cardiologist and he confirmed A-Fib and recommended a procedure - to reset the heart with the paddles - I haven&#39;t done that yet. Since then,  I have had chronic fatigue, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing; I think it&#39;s related to my heart. I am taking naps every day. I wake up and I&#39;m just wasted. I go run errands and then I&#39;m exhausted. Chronic fatigue. I will be seeing my  brand new primary care doctor on Thursday and I want to talk to Doctor provided me with a whole bunch of diagnoses for all of it. They are saying on the diagnoses paperwork that I could have &#34;blood cancer.&#34; But it could come from TRT treatment. Dental at first and then went to Affordable Dental - Periodontal work done - there was an infection there and they gave me antibiotic mouthwash. I will be going back in three months. I have not recovered from A-Fib - have to get Cardio Version test and I have chronic fatigue - it comes and goes. The blood cancer - I haven&#39;t had a chance to talk to anyone about it yet and no one has been in touch with me about it.  I went to Hospital ER the other day - mostly to get a more accurate diagnosis - I do have chemical disorder history in past. I had mental confusion - it was chemical - it was just like what I had in 2000. But hospital misdiagnosed it.

                                                I received dose 1 on 3/19/21 at 10:30 AM. I went on with my day and evening and noted no issues. The next morning I woke with lower leg pain in my R leg. I thought it may be a pulled muscle as I work out at a gym 5 days a week. The pain persisted as did some swelling in my lower leg so I sought out a medical opinion thinking it may be a torn muscle. I was finally able to get in to see a DR. on 4/1/2021 at which time an ultrasound was ordered which showed multiple blood clots in my R leg (Ankle, Calf and behind the knee). I was immediately placed on XARELTO. I have never had any issues before with clotting. Dr. referred me to Oncologist. Dr. examined me and the ultrasound test results and agreed with the assessment. I have follow a up scheduled with both doctor&#39;s. I have been on XARELTO since. I did get the second COVID shot because both doctor&#39;s could not agree as to if I should or should not get it.

On 11 Mar 2021, his leg got really swollen and on 12 Mar 2021, he visited hospital where it got diagnosed as DVT in his right lower calf. Treatment for the events included blood thinner Apixaban. Patient is concerned about possibility of indirect relation of events to the vaccine.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The outcome of the event DVT, leg got really swollen, swelling of the lower calf area and calf pain were unknown at the time of this report. The event pulled a muscle is not resolved. The event sore arm which the patient experienced for both the doses got resolved on 13 Jan and 14 Jan 2021, respectively.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided which includes a strong temporal association a causal association between the event of sore arm and the administration of mRNA-1273 cannot be excluded.  The evens of DVT , pulled muscle and swelling of lower calf is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273. Events were all attributed to muscle strain.

The patient&#39;s medical history included atrial fibrillation and had a pacemaker placed about 8-9 months ago.  Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event were blood pressure medication, antiarrhythmics.  On 01 Mar 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 030m20a) via unknown route for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 01 Mar 2021, after vaccination, the patient developed red dots on both of his arms. For next two days, the patient had rash on both arms, was dizzy, felt sick, developed fast heart rate; went to hospital twice for heart rate either 07 Mar 2021 or 13 Mar 2021.During first visit to hospital, fast rate was brought under control, while in the second visit, the patient had a procedure in which his heart was cut from top to bottom and was made pacemaker dependent. The atrial fibrillation could not be controlled for 26 hours and had a flutter which was not identified and could not be controlled. Flutter returned after stopping amlodipine and hence patient was restarted on amlodipine. The patient now feels very weak, has a hard time walking, has no energy, cannot do the simplest of tasks, still experiences fast heart rate and flutter every now and then.   No Laboratory investigations were provided. The Treatment information included pacemaker, amlodipine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cardiac pacemaker dependent, atrial fibrillation, red dots on both of his arms, rash on both arms, dizziness, sick, atrial flutter, very weak and no energy, hard time walking, cannot do the simplest of tasks were unknown.

She took his blood oxygen because he is on oxygen for COPD and it was lower than normal. She turned his oxygen up to 5%, then took his blood pressure. His blood pressure was 256/136, so she called the ambulance. When he was brought into the hospital they put him on a ventilator.  He is still on a ventilator as of 5/8/2021. The hospital staff said he had double pneumonia and they plan on trying to take him off the ventilator on 5/10/2021.

                                                Patient presented to the ED after being found down outside. Initially hypotensive, was intubated in ED. Required increasing pressor support. Found to have profound anion gap metabolic acidosis with lactate peaking at &gt;27. Initial workup also significant for WBC 40s, AKI with Cr peak at 2.5. Transaminitis likely 2/2 shock liver. Toxicologic workup was negative for alcohol, Tylenol, salicylates, urine drug screen. Blood cultures grew S. hominis. Other infectious workup including covid, hepatitis, hiv, rocky mountain spotted fever, respiratory panel, GI PCR, all negative. Also found to have a PE which was removed via thrombectomy. Developed DIC requiring multiple transfusions of cryo, FFP, and RBCs. Condition improved slowly with lactate downtrending currently and pressor requirement weaning.

                                                About 3 weeks after receiving the first Moderna shot I developed, what i believed to be a severe charlie horse in my left lower leg that lasted about. week and disopated.   A few weeks later May 9,2021; I noticed discomfort and swelling in the same lower left leg and my, medical alert service dog, kept alerting to it.  I had a regular appointment with my cardioligist on May 10,2021 and advised of my issue and he ordered an ultrasound. The ultra sound revealed blood clots on my llower left leg.  I have never had clotting issues in my life and absolutely believe that this colt was caused by the Moderna vaccine, since i have been on anticoagulants and asprin theray since 2008.

Each day the pain got a little worse and started stretching to my chest. My chest and heart were uncomfortable. My wife was having the same symptoms so we just tried to manage through the pain. One April 28, the pain was so severe it woke me up in the middle of the night. I took some antacids and that seemed to help. The next 3 days the pain was on and off until May 1 evening, the pain was so severe and I was vomiting that we decided to go to the hospital. It was determined that I had a heart attack.

                                                The patient,  who was a pharmacist, developed fatigue and shortness of breath hours after receiving vaccine.  Two days later, on 01/28/2021, the patient went to local urgent care for worsening shortness of breath and was referred to Hospital for worsening dyspnea and hypoxia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital   We was found to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and treated for pneumonia with Rocephin and azithromycin.  He was tested for COVID-19 multiple times, but each of the results were negative.  Despite the negative results, there was high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 and the patient was started on Remdesivir and Decadron.  The  patient&#39;s oxygen requirements continued to worsen and the patient was transferred to another facility for higher level of care.  There  his hypoxia worsened and he required mechanical ventilation.  Patient then developed hypotension and required vasopressors for blood pressure support.  Furthermore, patient developed acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis.  Despite mechanical ventilation with FiO2 100%, and for vasopressors, patient clinically deteriorated and family decided to palliatively extubate on 02/05/2021.

BiPAP was reinstituted to avoid CO2 retention.  One possibility is that the patient consumed a significant amount of Tylenol due to the discomfort exacerbated with the cirrhosis.  LFTs are trending upward still.  -hypercapnia patient consume both the benzodiazepine and morphine supported initially for the 1st 36 hours with BiPAP.  Has had periods where he is off and answers appropriately.  -consider rescanning in a.m. To further evaluate the hemoperitoneum.  Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemoglobins.  Patient is NPO until further delineation  Patient is a functional quadriplegic year and at home is fairly dependent on his stepfather for a total care family seeking long-term care which may mentally benefit the patient with broadening his activities                       -blood cultures pending. &#34; Per Clinical note 3/13/21, &#34;Assessment and plan   Syncope with altered mental status/toxic metabolic encephalopathy  Acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypercapnia  Sepsis  Supratherapeutic Coumadin level INR greater than 9  Anemia  Small hemoperitoneum  Hypotension  Chronic pain syndrome  COPD  UTI  Enteritis  Subsegmental atelectatic changes with nodule left lower lobe the-recheck 3 months  Cirrhosis  Nicotine dependence  CHF-chronic diastolic  Functional quadriplegia    Other:  GI bleed, PAD, hypothyroidism, history of DVT left leg, neuropathy, depression, BPH, CAD, subdural hematoma, acquired thyroid disease, GERD   -patient is more awake and wakening a hourly on BiPAP will remove 1 fully alert and functioning will use BiPAP overnight.

By that afternoon he still had the cramping feeling, and started drinking water as his wife is a nurse and felt that he may be dehydrated.  Throughout the week he had a Charlie Horse pain in his left calf, and felt that it was getting worse and not going away.  The whole week he went to work and on the 7th day it started swelling and went to Hospital after he got off of work, and he saw a resident who said that his leg was swollen and told him that she was going to schedule an ultrasound.  He had that on Friday on 4/16/21, and was scheduled for 4:00 but due to the pain went to the ER and gave him IV and checked his blood work.  The ultrasound showed that he did have a blood clot and prescribed Eliquis and gave him a dose while in the ER.  He told him that he would be on 2 a dat for 7 days  and then 1 a day, but did not tell him how long.  He is supposed to see the resident this afternoon for recheck.   He is still having pain and wanting to know where he is going to do from this point.    He does work out every day at his home gym and has not smoked, and now wanting to know how this is going to affect his life from this point into the future.  He also jumps rope 3 times a day and now not able to do this.

                                                My husband was sleeping the night of getting his 2nd Moderna Vaccination...  He, during his sleep, had a SEVERE Grand Mal Seizure with NOTHING leading up to it and NO PREVIOUS HISTORY WHATSOEVER of having ANY Seizures in his lifetime, nor ANY Epilepsy...  EVER! It was TERRIFYING, to me - I ran to his bedside (I happened to be in the livingroom watching television) after hearing loud grunts and a crash and came to find him convulsing, severely spewing blood and frothing at the mouth.  Grunting, convulsing, and thrashing.  Stiffening, arms and hands (both in a fist) tight and stiff in front of his chest, legs straight, rigid as a board and thrashing about spitting blood, eyes rolled back in his head.  As things began to becoming a little less severe, while waiting for the Fire Dept &amp; EMTs to arrive I felt his legs which were hit to the touch and his face was drenched in sweat! With NEVER EXPERIENCING Anything like this before, and after 30 years of marriage, I thought my husband was dying ???????? He did NOT go with the EMTs, since once he was awake and somewhat cognitive we realized he was over it for the moment and we&#39;re in a wait and see basis. He saw our GP first thing the next morning.

                                                I am submitting this report because I am hoping to help others with the vaccine and to see if the CDC can assist with any guidance for my treatment with  Cardiologist. I am glad to share any of my medical records if it?s helpful I had a heart condition in 2018 that was fully cleared and recovered over 2 years prior to the moderna vaccine. In Dec 2018 I had congestive heart failure (high heart rate, afib, and swelling). The congestive heart failure was resolved within a week with medication only, no stints or surgery. The recovery of my heart to a health condition was confirmed with a heart MRI on Feb 5th 2019. I still had afib that was confirmed cleared on Feb 12th 2020 by an office visit with my cardiologist. He recommended I continue medication and monitoring.  I continued in a fully cleared condition with no Afib or any issues for a year and 3 months up to my 2nd  moderna shot. I had an annual heart MRI on May 3rd 2021 showing no issues and no afib. I had a visit with my cardiologist who said the test results were great. On May 15th 2021 I had my second moderna shot. My shot was Moderna 025C21A, at Pharmacy. Within 24 hours I was in an afib condition with my heart rate between 90 to 100 bpm resting. I contacted my cardiologist. On 6/11/21 he confirmed the afib condition and the elevated heart rate.  He is now guiding me through procedures to clear my afib. I am quite concerned that my health had fully recovered and now have  heart issues directly related to the 2nd moderna vaccine. Any assistance you can give me, my cardiologist to help us thru this is appreciated.  I hope the information I am sharing can help others with the vaccine.

Heparin administered in ER and admitted for two nights to regulate dosage and to have echo cardiogram performed which also showed a thrombus in right atrium of heart.  Doctors said no other underlying cause of clotting and attributed it to the vaccine.  Now on maintenance course of Xarelto.

Patient states it all began about 2 weeks after his first Moderna covid vaccine at mid/end of April. He developed exertional chest pain that felt like a squeezing. He was recommended a stress test at that time, but didn&#39;t have health insurance and wanted to wait until he was covered. He was put on a 5 day course of prednisone, that seemed to improve his symptoms and he felt back to baseline and was able to proceed with the 2nd moderna vaccine in the middle of May. Shortly after that, he developed intermittent dyspnea on exertion and chest tightness. It was difficult to take a deep breath in, felt like something was grabbing him when he tried to take a full deep breath. This has been becoming more constant over the last 2 weeks. Today, he was outside moving a lawnmower when his symptoms significantly worsened. He felt lightheaded. His wife convinced him to go to clinic, where he got a CTA that showed an saddle PE.

Prior to vaccination pt was working full time, active with no significant health concerns other than controlled blood pressure on 1 medication. After his first vaccine in the left arm he reported his arm was very sore, swollen, painful and red which lasted 3 days and he reported he could not move his arm due to pain. He reports for days after he then had extreme fatigue but then recovered and went on with his life. He got his 2nd dose of the vaccine on 6/4/21 and then was hospitalized on 6/16/21 with severe pancytopenia with pathology ultimately showing Acute myeloid leukemia, severe cellulitis of the L lower leg,  and  ultimately developed a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis in that leg as well. Interestingly he injured his right leg just before vaccination and did not develop any cellulitis or poor healing  in that leg just a week before his first dose. He remains hospitalized in guarded condition as of 7/9/2021 currently receiving chemotherapy treatment with decitabine and venetoclax and has receving multiple transfusions of blood, antibiotics, steroids and now anticoagulation.

I was immediately transported to the hospital by the fire department (feeling in my right side started to return while being transported to the hospital). I was admitted to the hospital and a series of tests were administered to find out the cause of my stroke. I was administered medication to reduce my blood pressure and cholesterol along with aspirin 81mg and Atorvastatin during my 3-day stay. I received a prescription for the medication upon being released from the hospital.

Several days after he complained of &#34;not feeling well&#34; and fatigue, but did not give more specific symptomatology.  On 5/17/2021 he had a sudden collapse at home and was transported to local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  Case accepted as medical examiner jurisdiction due to no apparent medical history and sudden death after vaccine administration.  Full autopsy completed on 5/19/21 revealed obstructive pulmonary thromboemboli as cause of death, with lower extremity DVT.  Both portions of the pulmonary thromboembolus and the DVT show organization, thus raising question of whether this process started before or after the vaccination.   No known history of thrombophilic disorder, recent injury, or prolonged stasis/immobility.  Not known to be current smoker.  See below for additional autopsy information.

Telehealth visit diagnosis was Sinus Infection, given a Z-Pack. 5/8 pain was better throughout the day. Later in the evening pain worsened. 5/9 pain was severe. Continued with Z-pack and Tylenol and Advil. 5/10 pain was a 15 on scale of 1-10. Went to ER, blood pressure was extremely high and a cough had developed. Upon triage patient did not have a fever. After CT was done and was clear fever was checked and it was 102.3. Spinal Tap was performed and chest X-rays and bloodwork. Patient admitted to hospital for four days.  Later diagnosed with double pneumonia, sepsis and viral meningitis. The Spinal Tap came back as borderline. Doctors felt the results were skewed due to Z-Pack.

                                                Large pulmonary embolisms in both lungs resulting from DVT in left leg.  About 2-3 weeks after receiving 2nd Covid-19 vaccine shot, I started to have unusual breathing/fatigue symptoms.  I did not seek any treatment for these symptoms but now believe that these were due to several small blood clots in my lungs.  After another 3 weeks on May 10, 2021, I suffered a pulmonary embolism from a blood clot in my left lung.  I still did not seek treatment.  Two days later on May 12, I suffered a pulmonary embolism from a blood clot in my right lung.  This was sufficiently painful that I went to the Emergency Room on May 13 where an MRI diagnosed blood clots in both left and right lungs.  I was hospitalized until May 15 and now am required to take blood thinner Eloquis.  In the hospital, a DVT was identified in my left leg as a source for the clots, though I had no reason to develop such a DVT.  10 years prior in 2011, I had a DVT resulting from a long plane flight but no symptoms since.

They waited the 15 minutes to check for reactions and were unsymptomatic when time was up. The pharmacy did a courtesy call around 3:15 pm on 4/7 to check in with them and see how they were feeling. The wife stated that her husband had passed away the night of 4/5. Wife stated that they were getting ready to go to bed and husband felt hot and shaky so he laid in front of a fan. Wife eventually had to do CPR and stated that she thinks that he passed away during the time while they were waiting for EMS, which took about 45 minutes. Patient was pronounced dead night of 4/5.  Wife stated that patient has a history of heart problems including hypertension and multiple stents place and that she does not think the vaccine had to do with her husband&#39;s death.

                                                Woke up with A-fib (6:00 am) on 3/29/2021. Had old medication on hand Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg   Took 50 mg at 9:00 am and then at 9:00 pm.  Took same dose next day (3/302021).  Third day dropped dose to 25 mg every 12 hours; continued with that for a total of 3 days. Then dropped to 25 mg per 24 hours for 2 days total.  By bed time of same day A-fib started (10:30pm) heart beat was not in A-fib, but erratic - skipped beats, long pauses. Waking up the next day (3/30/2021) rhythm was mostly normal with occasional skips or pause. This has slowly stabilized to normal all the time  about a week after A-fib started. Note: I have had 2 pulmonary vein ablations. The last one was about 7 years ago. I have been in normal rhythm ever since except when I contracted the flu in January 2018. I was treated  at that time with the Metoprolol and normal rhythm was restored in about a day.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No relevant medical history was reported.     On 03-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA Stroke (transient ischemic attack)) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and AMNESIA (loss of memory for 15 minues could not spell the word &#34;side&#34; nor &#34;effect&#34;). At the time of the report, TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (TIA Stroke (transient ischemic attack)) and AMNESIA (loss of memory for 15 minues could not spell the word &#34;side&#34; nor &#34;effect&#34;) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment medication included vitamin-c and fish oil  Company comment:Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

With in 2-3 weeks increase abdominal pain, and discomfort, I thought it was a Crohn?s flair, so I just tried to wait it out.  Early April I went to the ED, for eval and treatment , it was discovered via CT of abdomen I developed Portal Vein Thrombosis, admitted for anti coagulation, and further studies like JAK 2. Place on heparin, followed by lovonox SQ injections, and bridged to Pradaxa.  Symptoms returned after a couple of weeks, and persisted, ,back tp the hospital new CZt scans, showed increase in Portal vein thrombosis, but now included splenic vein thrombosis, and mesenteric vein thrombosis.  Went back on anticoagulation therapy, transferred to  hospital for Intervention Radiology procedure to have a portal vein shunt placed in, and thrombectomy of the spleen, and mesenteric veins. Had bleeding issues, returned to OR for a second IR procedure, and finally a 3rd procedure of splenectomy, blood transfusion for hemorrhagic shock.  Discharged on warfarin, and lovonox as needed
