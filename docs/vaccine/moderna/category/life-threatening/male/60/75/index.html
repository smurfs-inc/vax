                                                DVT blood clot; A spontaneous report was received from a 60-year-old male consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included factor V Leiden, enlarged prostate, DVT, pulmonary embolism and hypertension. Concomitant medications reported included valsartan, alfuzosin, and acetylsalicylic acid.   On 07 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient developed DVT blood clot and experienced leg pain so intense that he could not walk. A doppler exam showed the DVT was from the top of the calf to mid-thigh. Treatment for the event included a rivaroxaban starter pack with dose tapering.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event deep vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot was not reported.  The outcome of the event, DVT blood clot, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 60-year-old male patient with a relevant medical history of factor V Leiden, DVT, pulmonary embolism and hypertension who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Patient experienced the medically significant unlisted event of Deep vein thrombosis approximately four days after administration of vaccine. Treatment for the event included rivaroxaban. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the event occurring after receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of Deep vein thrombosis is possibly related to the product. Of note, the patient&#39;s underlying Factor V Leiden which predispose to developing abnormal blood clots, and prior medical history of DVT with pulmonary embolism are considered risk factors to the occurrence of the event.

ER confirmed that he had experienced a heart attack and had one clogged artery. He asked about reporting and I told him I would report to VAERS on his behalf as his doctor and the hospital refused to do so. He asked whether or not I would suggest he receive his second dose and I suggested that he speak with his cardiologist and doctor to make that decision. I also informed him that he can search VAERS to see what the other reactions may have been that were reported. Patient indicated that he felt well and has recovered.

Admitted 3/17/21 due to hypoxia, had ground glass opacities on CT. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x 2.  Vigorous immune response could have caused lung inflammation and hypoxia, similar to a covid infection, but from the vaccine. 60YM with a history of a chronic inflammatory arthritis on methotrexate, hospitalization in November 2020 with Covid pneumonia, he was discharged on 1 to 2 L of home oxygen, and reports that he was told by his PCP about a month after discharge that he was able to come off the oxygen as his oxygen saturations had normalized.  He returned to his usual state of health and activity with no issues until he received the first dose of his Moderna covid-19 vaccine through his primary care office on 3/13.  The next day he developed arm pain and then progressive body aches, headaches, fevers, chills, and shortness of breath.  He presented to the ER and was found to be febrile with hypoxia and admitted for treatment and evaluation.   Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with ground glass opacities on CT : oxygen 87% on RA in ER, 84% on room air 3/19, resolves with oxygen support of 2lpm.  CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism. SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative x2 as well as respiratory virus panel, CT shows ground glass opacities, patient was started on ceftriaxone and doxycycline for empiric treatment for possible community-acquired pneumonia, although procalcitonin was negative.  BNP was elevated at 458, so an echocardiogram was performed which showed a normal EF, and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction.  Patient was given 2 doses of furosemide during the hospitalization and BNP normalized. Patient was started on prednisone to calm down a possible inflammatory response triggered by the COVID-19 vaccine in a person who likely already has antibodies, causing hypoxia.  With this patient significantly improved and at discharge is on room air at rest, but still requires 2 L/min with exertion.  CRP was markedly elevated, supporting an inflammatory process.  Autoimmune lung disease panel was sent and is in process at time of discharge.  Patient requested discharge home, Discharged on a slow prednisone taper to avoid rebound with abrupt discontinuation of steroids.  Patient will complete 2 additional days of Augmentin and doxycycline at discharge.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Purpuric Rash and Thrombocytopenia After the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 Vaccine. Cureus. 2021;13:4     Previously administered products included for Viral hepatitis C: Interferon. Concurrent medical conditions included Viral hepatitis C, Chronic kidney disease (Stage 4, with a baseline creatinine of 3 mg/dl.), Uncontrolled hypertension, Systolic heart failure (Ejection fraction of 35%.) and Liver cirrhosis.    On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), PURPURA (Purpuric rash) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), NAUSEA (nausea) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills). The patient was hospitalized for 3 days due to ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION, ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE, NAUSEA, PURPURA, RASH and THROMBOCYTOPENIA. At the time of the report, RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia), PURPURA (Purpuric rash), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools) and CHILLS (Chills) outcome was unknown and PYREXIA (Fever) had resolved.

In March 2021, Blood lactate dehydrogenase (122-222): 381 (High) high. In March 2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) Findings consistent with pulmonary edema.. In March 2021, Glomerular filtration rate: 19 (Low) eGFR - 19. In March 2021, International normalised ratio: 1.13 (Inconclusive) INR - 1.13. In March 2021, Platelet count: 84000 (Low) 84000/uL. In March 2021, Serum ferritin (24-336): 2400 (High) 2400 mg/ml. In March 2021, Ultrasound liver: abnormal (abnormal) Ultrasound of the liver confirmed liver cirrhosis..     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown Route), the reporter considered THROMBOCYTOPENIA (Thrombocytopenia) and PURPURA (Purpuric rash) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for RASH (Generalized non-itchy, non-painful rash a day after receiving the vaccine), ACCELERATED HYPERTENSION (Accelerated hypertension), ACUTE LEFT VENTRICULAR FAILURE (Systolic congestive heart failure exacerbation), NAUSEA (nausea), DIARRHOEA (few loose stools), PYREXIA (Fever) and CHILLS (Chills).    Concomitant medications were not provided.  Hepatitis panel showed a heavy viral load of more than 11 (no reference range was provided).  Per reporter, on presentation to the emergency room the patient was afebrile, had a blood pressure 183/106 mmHg, pulse rate of 82 per minute and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.  Treatment included anti-hypertensives and intravenous diuretics. On day 3 of hospitalization, patient left the hospital against medical advice.  Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273. However, the reporter also indicated it could have been precipitated by the underlying thrombocytopenia, liver cirrhosis and Hepatitis C infection. Very limited information regarding the other reported events has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on reporter&#39;s causality, the event purpuric rash is assessed as possible related to mRNA-1273.

                                                In summary this is a 60 year old male who was normal functioning presenting to hospital 4 days following second moderna COVID-19 vaccination with AKI, Rhabdomyolsis, Confusion/Delirium with agitation, multiple acute brain infarcts, DVT, and multilobar pulmonary embolism.  24 hours following vaccination patient began to become slightly confused while driving his wife to her vaccine appointment.  Symptoms progressed and included severe fatigue and muscle aches.  Patient was taking tizanidine and oxycodone to manage muscle / body aches which had been prescribed for his chronic back pain issues.  Patient was noted to be excessively sleeping, and also had fallen twice between vaccination and hospital presentation. 4 days following vaccination he presented to the emergency department with severe lethargy and confusion.  He was admitted with presumption of overdose of medication, given activated charcoal.  A CT of the head (4/11/2021) was completed which demonstrated No acute intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collection or acute territorial infarct. Suggestion of a chronic lacunar infarct involving the left lentiform nucleus. Regions of low attenuation involving the cerebellar hemispheres, right greater than left, which, allowing for image degradation secondary to patient motion artifact, are likely artifactual in nature; follow-up is recommended to assess for stability/resolution.For first several days patient suffered delirium with agitation, he was disoriented to place and time.  CK on admission, 4/11/2021, was 17,086, indicating rhabdo.  Creatinine on admission was 4.39, indicating new acute renal failure. Liver enzymes were elevated with AST of 477 and ALT of 218. PT was 10.6, INR 0.99.  ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.22, co2 45, HCO3 18.4.  Over several days his mentation improved however was noted to still need light supplemental oxygenation.  Because of the delirium a brain MRI was completed on 4/13/2021, which demonstrated acute ischemic infarcts on DWI sequence noting bilateral, right greater than left, acute cerebellar infarcts. Small acute lacunar infarcts at bilateral basal ganglia/genu internal capsule.  Due to the infarcts a stroke workup was completed. Carotid duplex was performed and notable for only small bilateral carotid plaque.  Renal ultrasound unremarkable.  A CTA of the chest was completed on 4/15/2021 for continued hypoxemia, need for nasal cannula to maintain spo2 saturation.  Findings included multilobar pulmonary embolism.  Venous duplex dopplers of the lower extremities were also completed on 4/15/2021 demonstrated an isolated left popliteal vein DVT. No evidence of right leg DVT.  Over several days CK and Cr returned to baseline / normal levels.  He remains hospitalized and is still undergoing treatment.

                                                On or around April 15th I developed a pain in my left calf.  As a senior citizen and avid golfer I chalked this up to age and activity. But the  problem didn&#39;t go away and on some days would be more painful than others. Additionally, the point where my calf hurt seem to move around and sometimes be higher on my calf behind my knee.  Some days the pain was gone altogether only to return the later that same day or the next.   At the beginning of May I started to develop a cough.  I had no fever or other symptoms so I thought it might be seasonal allergies.   The cough continued to get worse so I made an appointment with my doctor on 5/26/21 and was seen that day. I was given a COVID test even though I had taken the vaccine and scheduled for an ultrasound on Friday 5/28/21. During the ultrasound they discovered a DVT in my left calf that extended from my ankle to behind my knee.  Since I was also coughing they scheduled me for a CT scan that same day. The CT scan showed multiple PE&#39;s in both lungs. They sent me to the hospital.

                                                He got his vaccine, had extreme pain in his right arm.  He went back to the pharmacy and let her know that it hurt for several days and then went away, and he is still having the tenderness in the arm.  It was so painful that he could not sleep on it due to the pain.   He then had no problems up until 5/24/21 when he noticed some swelling on his ankle of his right leg.  He put it in cold water to see if the swelling would go down and it did not.  Then he didn&#39;t think about it again until it was stiff, swollen and wanted to turn to the right side and hard for him to drive and taking his anti-inflammatories.  It progressively got worse and around 5/25/21 the swelling was severe and doubled in size and getting worse and on 6/3/21 he could not get his pants off due to the swelling and he went to the Dr. The next day.  He had pain behind the knee, ankle, pain in the leg.  He went to the doctor, and they sent him to the ER for an US which showed DVT of the right leg.  He was informed that it was large and that it was in the thigh of his right leg and not returning blood to his heart.  He was put on Eliquis 5 mg twice a day and is doing well for him.  The swelling is a little better, the ankle is still swollen, and the leg is still swollen, the top of his foot is really bad, front of his leg and thigh.  The knee does not seem to be swollen, but the thigh is.   He has no problem with the left side.  He is to follow up with his doctor on Thursday.  He is on Hydrocodone as well for the pain as needed for his neck pain and lower back.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; This spontaneous case was reported by a health care professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) in a 60-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination.    Co-suspect product included non-company product SELEXIPAG for Pulmonary hypertension.    The patient&#39;s past medical history included Arrhythmia (Abnormal heart beat Rhythmn) on 26-Apr-2021. Concurrent medical conditions included Pulmonary hypertension. Concomitant products included AMBRISENTAN (LETAIRIS) and TADALAFIL (ADCIRCA) for an unknown indication.   On 10-May-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient started SELEXIPAG (Oral) 1600 mcg twice a day. On 10-May-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 10-May-2021 to 15-May-2021 due to ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. The patient was treated with APIXABAN (ELIQUIS) ongoing since an unknown date for Blood disorder NOS, at a dose of 1 dosage form. At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient was seen by his primary care physician on 10-May-2021, 12 hours after getting the Moderna vaccine.  The physician admitted the patient to the hospital due to atrial fibrillation.  The patient was discharged on 15-May-2021. The patient reported that he was in the hospital from 26-Apr-2021to 01-May-2021for abnormal heartbeat rhythm and the hospital ended up having to shock his heart to get it back to normal.  The patient had the second Covid vaccine done around 1 week before reporting date 02-Jun-2021 and said he seems to be doing well.  Treatment was not reported.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. No further information is expected. However, patient has a history of pulmonary hypertension,arrythmia and concomitant medication use of Selexipag considered as co-suspect  that can be stated as confounding factors that may play a possible contributory role.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Spoke to triage nurse on Wed 1/27 who thought were symptoms of vaccine. On Wed 1/27 continued with body aches, extreme chills, headache and developed a 101 fever. On Fri 1/29, went urgent care who continued to attribute the symptoms to the vaccine. On Sun day 1/31, went urgent care again experiencing the same symptoms along wot a 104 fever. Sent to ER and admitted to the hospital. Hospital stay from Sun 1/31 to discharge on Fri 2/5. Admitted to the hospital with pneumonia attributed to my immune system going after the vaccine allowing for the the development of pneumonia.

I contacted the County Medical Examiner&#39;s office who stated that they received his body after he was determined to be deceased at the shelter.  No autopsy was performed and his body was released to a funeral home on 2/26. The ME&#39;s office said that &#34;permit for burial/cremation is pending&#34; and no other information on COD was available. Per staff, he was also tested for COVID as part of shelter protocol on 2/24 and PCR was negative. He arrived to the shelter on 2/19/21.

Daily diarrhea, watery stool, cramping and bleeding lasting one month.  Currently slowly resolving.  Treated with a variety of remedies over the month, individually and in combination.  ( Pepto bismol, charcoal capsules, imodium, rice, tumeric, and Xifaxin)  Imodium would stop the cramping but not the wateriness of the stool.  Unlike any diarrhea over the course of my life. I will not be taking any booster shots.

Nine days after the vaccine slowly had drooping on the right side of his face, numbness on the right side of his face, mainly around the mouth, a little on the eye, hard to close the right eye.  General soreness around his mouth when he tries to eat or talk a lot.  Limited movement of his face do to swelling, difficulty closing his eye, and headache.   Went to the ER on 3/7/21 and admitted him as they believed he had a blood clot, diagnosed him with Bell&#39;s palsy on Monday 3/8/21.  Was given corticosteroids for 9 days Prednisone 60 mg.  The symptoms are slowly improving but still has the Bell&#39;s palsy.

I had symptoms of a Pulmonary embolism while cross country skiing March 18 and officially diagnosed with PE on March 22, 2021.  I was tested for Covid 19 on March 23, 2021 with negative results.

I did have cramping like feeling in my right calf following a x-country ski weekend about 4 weeks prior  to the actual PE (2/22/21) but it appeared to resolve after about 7-10 days

She said they had been very careful, but had met with some friends and 2 of their friends also tested positive.    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: positive (Positive) positive.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.      The day after he received the vaccine he felt minor aches, like he was coming down with a cold. On that Thursday he went into a fib. She took him to the ER and it took several hours to regulate his heart rate. While making arrangement to transfer him to a new hospital they did a COVID test and it was positive. They were shocked as he had not been showing any symptoms. He spent the night in the hospital.  Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested. However the event of Covid 19 and myalgia is unlikely related to vaccine. Covid 19 is  a confounding factor for the event of myalgia and base of the available information, the vaccine is not known cause of Covid 19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the even tof A fib has been provided at this time.

                                                32 hours after the vaccine, he suffered a massive heart attack due to a blood clot and a massive clot in the right arm. He went to the hospital and under went surgery at 12 am on Saturday. The coronary surgeon mentioned that this was not from heart disease as all vessels were clear. Rather, this was due to an embolism due to an unknown origin. A further work up concluded that he also had blood clots throughout his body (both lungs, one kidney, heart, liver, legs, arms, and possibly brain). By 12 p.m. we were asked back to the hospital as he was worsening. Treatment options included a heparin drip, which caused a brain hemorrhage. He was just at the doctors two times this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday and was fine no issues found. They went through with the 2nd dose and came to our home on Thursday.

                                                Went in to physician due to shortness of breath. Found pericarditis.  The physician went in to do a pericardial window and the patient experienced bleeding so the surgeon had to perform a sternotomy to determine where the bleeding originated. Once the chest was opened the surgeon noted a mass that appeared to look like a fungus on the heart. Biopsy of the heart mass, pericardial fluid and a mass on the liver were performed.  The biopsy results originally came back as adenocarcinoma of the urinary (bladder, kidneys) origin. The physicians noted that that would be highly unlikely since there were no tumors noted in the urinary area.  Pathology was sent off again from the pericardial fluid that was obtained by &#34;extracting RNA from tumor enriched sections.  This pathology showed the cells to be squamous cell carcinoma with 90% probability of coming from the lung. The doctors are finding this very unusual .  My husband was very healthy prior to this with no symptoms.  Could this be caused by the vaccine?

His absolute neutrophil count was less than 500, so he was admitted for neutropenic fever. Cultures were obtained. IV antibiotics started.  COVID-19 was tested and, surprisingly, came back positive.  The patient has actually had both of his COVID-19 vaccines and basically, does not have pneumonia, shortness of breath, or hypoxemia.  We did not use any medications for COVID while in the hospital, watching for any signs of respiratory compromise, but none developed.  Blood cultures were negative.  He was switched from ceftazidime to doxycycline at time of discharge.  Will follow up with Dr. (Name) for his next cycle of chemotherapy.  Because of his COVID-19 positivity, we will not schedule any immediate followup appointments, although the patient will call if he has persistent fever, dyspnea, or signs of hypoxemia.  For the past 2 days, the T- max has been 99.9, and most the time 98.6.  He was seen the day of discharge, doing quite well.  Blood pressure 153/80, pulse 90, regular, oximetry 95% on room air.  Glucose was 210. Discharged on Rivaroxaban 15 mg b.i.d., doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., Robitussin AC as needed for cough, Lantus 28 units at bedtime, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily.  The patient did get 1 dose of Neupogen 480 mcg subcu while in the hospital.

                                                My husband fell ill within hours of getting the first dose of the vaccine, he started running fever, chills, body aches-within 7 days he was admitted to the hospital and 12 hours after admission to the hospital  he was diagnosed with Covid Pneumonia. or they thought- his lungs were showing signs of being attacked. He had no illness, no fever, no underlying health concerns, no allergies, he was not over weight, he was not diabetic, he was still young and within 6 weeks of getting the vaccine he was dead. Doctors could do nothing to save his life. The Moderna vaccine killed my husband and it is killing other perfectly healthy people.

I was not concerned until my wife alarmed me in the morning when she looked at me and noticed the left side of my face drooped and had that I had difficulty standing, no balance, little use of my left leg and no use of my left arm and hand.  At that point, 7:00am 03/23/21, my wife drove me to the ER.  I was admitted and an inpatient for 15 days including PT/OT/ST therapies at the hospital for Stroke.

                                                I had a (first ever) stroke. I was attempting to take Flecainide for atrial fibrillation to reduce palpitations, the week prior and during the day of the stroke. I tried to take Flecainide twice before in the past few months, but I was unable to tolerate it. When I had the stroke, I didn&#39;t realize I was having one since I&#39;m in very good health. I emailed my electro-cardiologist about my symptoms that day and found it difficult to use the appropriate words and reading the email later, I could see a number of mistakes. My ability to comprehend spoken language that day was impaired. I could only keep a few sentences in my head at a time and my attention span was poor as well, like having significant ADHD, which I don&#39;t have. I was unable to retain simple amounts of information the day of the stroke. I didn&#39;t seek treatment on the day of the stroke since I felt it was more of the side effects I had been experiencing from Flecainide. After going to the hospital I felt good and much improved, cognitively. An ER neurologist said that my stroke was a 2 on a scale of 1 to 42. Over the remainder of March and until this day (April 16, 2021), I have made steady and rapid improvement. I attribute my recovery to the lower level of stroke damage and the fact that I worked out every day with physical exercise and I worked out cognitively by doing a series of activities that I chose myself: reading out loud, reciting poetry and tongue twisters, playing logic and puzzle games on the PC, returning to my writing tasks for work, practicing grammar, and speaking at length with family and friends as a way to practice speaking. I had one appointment with an occupational therapist and two appointments with a speech therapist and have completed assessment. I now feel I am nearly completely recovered with an odd sense of some improvement in certain areas such as heightened mood and quicker connections for noticing practical matters.

                                                Extensive DVT requiring surgery. Received second Moderna vaccine approximately one week prior to admission, presented with acute onset of left leg swelling and pain.  Left lower extremity ultrasound demonstrated an extensive deep venous thrombosis extending from the common femoral vein into the peritoneal and posterior tibial vein with a patent IVC.  He was given a treatment dose of enoxaparin and admitted to the hospitalist service.  Overnight he developed diminished sensation in his toes and vascular surgery was consulted.  On 3/31/2021 he underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the left superficial femoral and common femoral veins as well as stenting of the left common iliac vein stent.  Of note he was noted to have May Thurner physiology with compression of the left common iliac vein by the external iliac artery on the right.  Post procedurally the patient&#39;s swelling and edema was significantly improved.  He did not have any significant pain or difficulty ambulating.  On postoperative day #1 he was evaluated and found to be hemodynamically stable with improvement of his symptoms and stable for discharge home.  Prior to discharge it was discussed with the patient that he will need to be on a loading dose of Eliquis for 7 days, followed by a maintenance dose of 5 mg twice daily. No h/o COVID.

Saw Dr. and ordered an ultrasound on both of my legs. Right leg was normal &amp; left lower leg had a clot(s) in it. Dr. ran blood work then prescribed Eliquis. Saw him in follow-up on April 14. Swelling down but not gone. Renewed the prescription for Eliquis and set a followup visit for Friday June 18. He ordered additional blood work to be drawn on Wednesday June 16 to have results at the next visit.

No labs were done then.  He returned 3/19 with difficulty walking and talking, was sent to SNF after MRI with diagnosis (probably incorrect) of acute cerebral infarct.  He returned to the ED on 3/29 less alert, and no longer able to speak.  LP showed 10 WBC (mostly lymphs) and protein 70.  MRI was repeated, looked similar to previous scan , but reinterpreted as diffuse cerebritis, worst in basal ganglia.   By 4/02 he was deeply obtunded ... (cont. on next page)

After a &#34;few&#34; days of feeling unwell despite treatment, presented to ER and was found to have AKI, hyponatremia, and thrombocytopenia. Over the course of several days rapidly deteriorated and developed MSOF, including liver failure, DIC, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and shock requiring pressors. Workup for VTE, including V/Q scan, LE dopplers, and head CT negative for thrombosis. Ferritin was found to be highly elevated (12,000) suggestive of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Per ER report, marrow positive for hemophagocytosis on smear. At time of report, transferred to Cancer Center for HLH treatment, currently in ICU, intubated, sedated, and on pressors. PF4 antibody pending.

He was advised that he could be seen in the office the following Monday, 4/5/21, or may report to the nearest emergency department.  He opted to wait until 4/5/21, and was evaluated in the office.  Dr&#39;s staff reported to the pharmacy that a Doppler was ordered for patient, which revealed an &#34;acute DVT in the left proximal / mid-subclavian vein and axillary vein&#34;, and it was suspected that the Moderna 1st dose may have been related.  Pharmacy was contacted by the County Health Department ( nurse), and staff from  County Office of Epidemiology , and instructed to obtain further information from Dr&#39;s office to file this VAERS report.  Pharmacy was NOT able to successfully contact patient for further clarification on medications/prior conditions/allergies, as calls were not returned prior to completing VAERS report.

                                                Patient admitted with left sided weakness on 4/21/21. First covid-19 vaccine (Moderna) received on 3/23/21. MRI/MRA shows acute infarcts of the right caudate body and striatum. H/o HTN, hep C with cirrhosis, COPD, tobacco abuse, alcohol use disorder, GTC seizure disorder. ECHO on 4/21/21 which was normal. Patient thought to be actively overusing alcohol at home. Patient was treated for stroke and discharged on medications to help with alcohol withdrawal symptoms (clonidine, gabapentin) as well as aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin for new stroke. Thrombocytopenia noted (platelets 50K), however patient?s platelets have historically been low likely related to alcohol use. Per hospitalist discharge summary, low suspicion for vaccine induced thrombocytopenia. HIT Ab test ordered on 4/21/21, resulted negative. It seems to be coincidental that stroke occurred about a month after patient?s first covid-19 vaccine but reported to VAERS for completeness. Did not add covid-19 vaccine to patient?s allergy list. Patient received second covid-19 vaccine (Moderna) on 4/28/21.

Went to the dentist on 04/24/21 due to having tooth extraction on 03/18/21. Dentist confirmed that had healed completely and recommended getting blood work done. Went to Urgent Care had blood drawn, report showed ZERO platelets. I was sent to ER where they ran a blood test again, platelets were ONE. 2 bags of platelets were infused, that brought platelets to 5.  I was then admitted to the hospital and four hours later platelets were down to 2. They infused another 2 bags of platelets. Blood test showed platelets at 10.  Four hours later the platelets were down to 4. On 04/25/21 I was diagnosed with ITP and was given an infusion of IVIG, on 04/26/21 my platelets were up to 16. They infused another IVIG on 04/26/21 and on 04/27/21 platelets were at 41. I was discharged on 04/27/21. Went to clinic on 04/29/21 and platelets were at 130.

                                                Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the medical floor with altered mental status, placed on empiric Rocephin/Zithromax for presumptive bacterial pneumonia.  It was later revealed that he received his 2nd Moderna COVID19 vaccination on 5/18, having recovered from COVID19 in Dec 2020.  This certainly raises the question as to if his symptoms are related to immune-response to the vaccine.  He certainly seems to think so, based on timing of his symptoms and being in his usual state of health prior to getting it.  Nonetheless, he is being treated initially for presumptive straightforward community acquired pneumonia.   Quite unexpectedly, within 24 hours of his abrupt decompensation, he has returned to baseline.  Off O2, mental status sharp and at baseline, no further fevers.  This rapid improvement confirms suspicion that his presentation is likely adverse effect/immune mediated response to the 2nd COVID vaccine (Moderna).  He became acutely ill within 24 hours of vaccine and resolved almost exactly 48 hours afterwards.  Creatinine has returned to baseline 1.9-2.0 after IV fluids.  Cultures remain negative.

He is currently admitted at a different hospital.   After vaccine administration on-site, the patient became unconscious for a few minutes. However, this is common for him - he informed us that he almost always &#34;passes out&#34; after vaccine administration. He slowly returned to consciousness without any issues. He was seen by an ED physician prior to leaving the facility. Deemed to be in good health, patient also stated that he felt fine and believed he was okay to leave as these episodes occur frequently following vaccination.

Medical history included treatment for tuberculosis and dialysis. Concomitant medication included calcium acetate, Renvela, glipizide, omeprazole, aspirin, vitamin D, losartan, furosemide, rifampin, and Sensipar.  On 14 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 030L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13 Jan2021, the patient tested negative for COVID-19). On 16 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, and feeling weird/funny. On 17Jan2021, the patient experienced difficulty breathing and swelling. On 18 Jan 2021, the patient declined dialysis, was tired and wanted to lay down. At 8 am, the patient was found nonresponsive and cold and is believed to have passed away around 4 am. The coroner tested the deceased for COVID-19 and the test was positive. No autopsy was reported. No death certificate was issued at the time of the report but the reporter believes it will list cause of death as COVID complications.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  The outcome of the events of limb discomfort, feeling abnormal, dyspnea, fatigue, swelling, unresponsive to stimuli, body temperature abnormal, was fatal.  On 18 Jan 2021, the patient was died. Cause of death was COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: The events developed on four days after first dose of mRNA-1372. Dyspnea, unresponsive to stimuli, and death were consistent with infection in pandemic set up confounded by age of patient and refusal of dialysis Cause of death was reported as COVID-19. Autopsy details were not provided. Based on reporter&#39;s causality the events are assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: COVID-19

No heart beat pulse etc... used CPR machines and paddles  Patient had walked 6 1/2 miles that morning no problems did about 50-60 miles weekly outside. This was sudden and me, his wife, say it was a reaction to something in shot that contributed to this event- there is absolutely nothing you could say to make believe differently. This happened 1 1/2 hours after getting shot.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had no reactions.  The next morning he woke up his arm was sore, and it was that was for 2 days.  Then his breathing starting getting worse.  He started coughing, couldn&#39;t lay down, could not sleep due to that.  He went to the ER and they told him that there was nothing wrong and that it was just allergies.  They told him to go home and take some OTC cold medicine and that everything would be okay.  A week later he went to another ER for the same thing as he continued not to be able to breath, they did a bunch of tests and said that nothing was wrong and that it was just a call.  He then went to Hospital ER and they released him stating it had just a cold.  He then called his cardiologist and they told him to go back to Hospital, was admitted on 5/11/21 and they did more tests and said that he had a blood clot in his left lung and said that it had nothing to do with the vaccine.   He was discharged on 5/13/21.  They put him on Heparin while in the hospital and sent him home as a disgruntled patient.   They also told him that he had fluid around his heart and gave him medicine to get that taken away.  They sent him home on Lasix and Eliquis.  He then went to another hospital on Friday 5/14/21 as he was going crazy about the blood clot and went there and was kept there for 3 days and discharged on 5/16/21 with the same medications, Lasix and Eliquis.   He was also told that he had fluid around his heart again.  Before the vaccine he was very healthy, and was able to jog around his neighborhood and now he&#39;s not able to do so, and they told him that he was now having heart failure and is having trouble breathing because his heart is swelling up.  He went to see his cardiologist last Friday and that&#39;s when she told him about his heart failure.    ADMISSIONS:  ADMITTED 5/11/21 TO 5/13/21; 5/14/21 to 5/16/21.

                                                Patient died with an unknown cause. He was found on the kitchen floor with no blood present. We requested an autopsy but because the County Coroner said there was no foul play suspected, that they would not perform an autopsy on the body to determine the cause of death even though the family had requested an autopsy. The Funeral Home stated to us that it had the looks of a heart attack, but he was not qualified to make that determination. He stated that the way the blood had stopped and purpled in his neck, gave him the indication that the heart was unable to pump all the way.

                                                He had a recent bout of chest pain (like a ligament tear, worse with lying down x 2 days)- which he dates to end of March/early April; he didn&#39;t seek care right away. He subsequently mentioned the episode to EP and was diagnosed with pericarditis with moderate pericardial effusion on 4/8/21. CRP 77. No viral symptoms. He received the Covid vaccine 2/12 and 3/12. Repeat echocardiogram on 5/3 showed resolution of pericardial effusion. He was prescribed colchicine but told to stop it after the echo showed resolution.   He also had a stress SPECT which showed normal perfusion but severe calcification of LM and LAD. He has no symptoms of chest pain. Pericarditic chest pain completely resolved. LDL was 110 and atorvastatin was increased from 60mg to 80mg 2 months ago.    He has no chest pain or shortness of breath. Takes lasix for LE edema. Very active. Walked 5 miles yesterday without issues. Occasionally gets short of breath climbing stairs.

                                                Found dead at home slumped on the floor; Loss of appetite; Body aches; Feverish; A spontaneous report was received from a physician, concerning a 65-years-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, and death.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia. Concomitant medications reported included metformin, glimepiride, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin, methimazole, propranolol, and cilostazol.   On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 037k20a) for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On an unknown date in Jan 2021, some time after receiving the vaccine, the patient was feeling feverish with body aches and loss of appetite.  On 09 Jan 2021 at approximately 21:30, the patient was found dead at home slumped on the floor. According to the paramedics, the patient was dead longer than when his wife found him, and no resuscitation was performed.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, was considered resolved. The patient died on 09 Jan 2021. The cause of death was not reported.  The reporter assessed the event, death, as not related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine. The reporter did not provide assessment for the events, feverish and body aches, in relation to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 65 year old male patient with medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia, who experienced the serious unexpected event of death, non-serious unexpected event of loss of appetite, and non-serious expected events of fever and body pain.  The event of death occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. The events of fever, body pain and loss of appetite occurred an unspecified period of time after the first dose of mRNA-1273.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Definitive causal association is confounded by age and medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia.

As of 1/8/2021 he was prohibited from donating blood due to a hemoglobin of 12.8. 2 weeks later he presented to donate again on 1/26/2021 and his hemoglobin had dropped to 7.8 without evidence of bleeding. He was subsequently admitted to hospital on 1/29/2021 - where he was found to be severely leukopenic and thrombocytopenic. A bone marrow biopsy revealed a diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia. He remains hospitalized but is now at another location. This has also been reported through VAERS.

                                                Passed away; A spontaneous report was received from a Pharmacist concerning a 65 years-old, male patient who passed away/MedDRA PT: death, days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #012L20A) on 12 Jan 2021. On 11 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 030M20A) (route of administration and injection site not provided) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient passed away. The patient did not come to the hospital; therefore the Pharmacist had very little detail of the situation but believed it was due to aspiration based on report received from the patient&#39;s boss. The Pharmacist reported there was no report of any issues from the first vaccine. The patient was found at home by spouse and had yellow stuff on face and chest.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable as the patient deceased.  The patient died on an unknown date. The cause of death was reported as unknown. Plans for autopsy were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the event of death has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine

Per clinic notes: &#34;Brief summary covid vaccine 1/21 with side effect within 12 hr lasting 3 d By around 1/26-1/29 had cp w/ exertion and sob TST 2/2 w/  Minor ekg changes and min workload per pt (mod workload per note) nuc study pending.  Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

                                                My husband had a stroke one week after his 2nd dose. The blood clot affected his occipital lobe. Ten years ago he had a stroke in the same area below this area. On that Monday around 7 PM, he took our refuse out to the curb in front of our home. When he came in he did not recognize me or his surroundings.  I took him to the hospital by car as I was not sure what happened to him. After testing the doctors said he had a minor infarct. The stroke affected his memory. He was very confused and did not remember anything from the moment of the incident until moments before exiting the MRI machine, approximately 2 hours later. He still cannot recall anything surrounding the incident. We questioned if this was related to his recent vaccination and the doctors stated no, however, we believe it is something that should be reported since it occurred a week after the vaccination.

                                                Prior to the vaccine on 2/13/21, He was a healthy 65 year old active college professor.   32 hours after the vaccination on 2/14/21, He had acute pancreatitis, which led to  septic shock and respiratory failure, and he was placed on a ventilator at  Hospital.   On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

                                                Patient presented to our facility due to progressive swelling of his LLE. Patient is an avid cyclist and reports he began training again for the spring season approx. 1 mo ago.  He had L calf tightness present for a few weeks as well as slightly painful knees which he attributed to his age and mild deconditioning over the winter.  He traveled with infrequent stops on 4/2/2021 to visit family.  He continued to have discomfort and increasing ankle pain, thus presented to ER.  LE ultrasound venous dopplers performed showing extensive DVT: L femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial and peroneal veins.  CT also demonstrated acute PE w/in distal R and L main pulm artery and w/in bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulm arteries involving all the lobes.  Patient had remote history of LE DVT in 2017 after  mild bumping of leg and placed on Xarelto for 6 mo. Had genetic testing completed at that time which was negative. He has had no clotting issues since. ( Received Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on 2/3/21 and 3/3/21. Reports brain fog and fatigue approx. 20 hours after vaccination followed by the above.) Patient discharged on rivaroxaban.

                                                Pt received dose #1 of Moderna on 1/20/2021 at clinic. On 1/24/2021, developed self reported fatigue and sleep disturbances with pruritis. Sought no medical care. Routine labs were obtained on 2/23 which demonstrated new-onset transaminitis and hyperferritinemia (ALT 2366, AST 1260, alk phos 362, ferritin 32,000) and was admitted to hospital for evaluation. No etiology for acute liver failure identified, including comprehensive evaluation for viral hepatitis and other common causes of hepatitis common after transplant. Concern raised for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) due to extreme hyperferritinemia, although bone marrow biopsy negative. Ultimately transferred to another hospital for further care at patient&#39;s request. No specific treatment was given and transaminitis ultimately resolved. Soluble IL-2 receptor (CD25) level checked on 3/2, at time of admission, markedly elevated at 2338.6, consistent with diagnosis of HLH. Pt discharged on 3/5. Ultimately readmitted on 3/9 and found to have rapidly progressive Legionella pneumonia and died on 3/16. Two events felt to be unrelated and pneumonia not felt to be cause of HLH due to patient&#39;s status at time of initial admission.

                                                I have experienced an increased amount of Afib following my Moderna covid-19 vaccinations. I used to be able to expect at least two weeks Afib free between episodes, but on the evening of my first shot on March 12th I had Afib only four days after a typical episode. Then again on March 22nd and 30th.  On April 8th I had my second Moderna dose. On April 11th I had Afib again and didn&#39;t think that much of it being related to the shot as I had been fever free for over a day at that time. But with episodes on the 13th, 14th, 17th, 18th, 20th(3 episodes) of April that far surpass the frequency of Afib in my history, I have become quite suspicious of the shots as the trigger. The episodes have thankfully been shorter than in the past, some ending within 15 minutes and some as long as four hours. My historical events had often lasted 12 to 18 hours. The arrhythmia events have significantly subsided with only one  three minute arrythmia (likely flutter) in the last 12 days and less short duration palpitations as well.

On February 28th I started a very symptomatic AFIB, breathless with little energy and stamina , it lasted 8 days which is double previous events.  It then subsided and recurred about 2 weeks later for 11 days.  Again a severe episode which prompted me to seek out medical help.  I just finished a cardiac ablation because of these episodes.  They were far more severe and  persistent than previous events.

Taken to hospital and was diagnosed with stroke. I asked the physician to report this to VAERS and he wouldn&#39;t because he didn&#39;t believe the vaccine was the cause. CDC states healthcare providers are required by law to report any unplanned hospitalization, disability (no date limit) after covid-19 vaccination, but physician kept refusing to report this to VAERS. My husband was from home independently and is now disabled, unable to move his left side and is going to a facility for long term care.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Atrial fibrillation since 2017.    On 10-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. In January 2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). On 28-Jan-2021, the patient experienced LIMB DISCOMFORT (heavy legs) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Not feeling himself). On an unknown date, the patient experienced RHINORRHOEA (runny nose) and BODY TEMPERATURE ABNORMAL (a little temp). The patient was hospitalized from 29-Jan-2021 to 02-Feb-2021 due to CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT and LIMB DISCOMFORT. The patient was treated with Rehabilitation therapy for Cerebrovascular accident and Rehabilitation therapy for Limb discomfort. At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke), LIMB DISCOMFORT (heavy legs), RHINORRHOEA (runny nose), BODY TEMPERATURE ABNORMAL (a little temp) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Not feeling himself) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Concomitant medications included blood thinners which patient had reportedly been taking for approximately four years to treat atrial fibrillation.  Treatment included rehabilitation and learning how to ambulate with a walker.  Although a temporal association exists, provided information is not adequate to assess the causal association between the event and mRNA-1273.  The detailed medical history and diagnostic report has not been provided. Causality is also confounded by the patient&#39;s comorbidities.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-008992 (Patient Link).

                                                I had COVID19 Vaccines EUA on 1/12/21 &amp; 2/9/21. Most adverse effects I had after the first shot. On the same day around 7:30 p.m. head started to burn and the rest of my body shiver. Whole body skin became super sensitive - it hurt to move sharply. I took Tylenol 1300mg and Advil LiquiGel 400mg. Temperature was up &amp; down (97 to 100.7) for 2 days. Friday 1/15 temperature became normal, but my body started to feel severe muscle twisting aches and that continue for 4 days straight. I&#39;ve continue to take Tylenol and Advil every 4-6 hours. After muscle aches subsided on Tuesday 1/19, all joints started to hurt (two days of nagging &amp; strong pain, most-knees &amp; hands). Suddenly I started to cough for no apparent reason.

He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution. Discussed risks of receiving the vaccination vs benefits of the vaccine, which patient states &#34;I already had this discussion with Dr.!&#34; He has multiple comorbidities which place him at a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. Again received the risk vs benefit discussion. Patient stated understanding and desire to proceed with the vaccination. He will be monitored for at least 30 minutes in area where staff can directly observe him. Patient received the COVID vaccination at 13:00. At 45 minutes later, staff alerted that he was c/o palpitations. Due to confusion and weakness, we were unable to transport him to an examination room. Oxygen, water, and vitals machine were brought to him. He presented with SOB, confusion, lightheadedness. Exam demonstrated acute distress, speaking in staccato sentences. HR in 80s, with lungs CTAB and no stridor - despite increased RR to 20s. Vitals with HR in 70s, SpO2 remained 97% or greater on RA. BP was initially 140/72. A code blue was called and Drs. presented to the area. Patient c/o itchy throat and still p/w confusion/combativeness, loss of orientation, and SOB. No visible swelling noticed. At around 13:58, patient syncopized. HR and SpO2 remained 70-80s and &gt;98% on room air respectively. Pulse remained palpable. At that time, an epipen was administered. Patient woke up. During the entire episode, he was able to recognize a staff member with whom he was previously familiar. EMS arrived, vitals remained stable. EMS transported patient to the ER for further monitoring and f/u. Concern for immediate allergic reaction 2/2 vaccination. After event, patient in need of referral to allergy provider for evaluation prior to consideration of 2nd dosage.

                                                He complained of dizziness the evening of the shot.  He went to bed and when he woke up the next morning he was having double vision.  Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

                                                fatigue, body aches, chills, poor appetite Narrative: Patient is a 65 year-old-male who received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 2/12/21. On 2/23/21, patient contacted his primary care nurse to inform he was having side effects from the vaccine, including headache, fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, rash on top of his feet that extends to his knees, bumps on his chest, bleeding from nose, mouth, and gums, and hyperglycemia. Patient reported took aspirin and Airborne for the symptoms. His primary care provider ordered bloodwork to be done the next day. On 2/24/21, patient had the following labs done: BMP (WNL except for glucose which was 363 mg/dL), CBC with diff (notable for very low platelets of 1 K/mm3), and PT/INR/PTT (all WNL). PCP examined patient and noted no obvious rash on chest, skin fair but not pale, no significant bruising or acute bleeding but petechial rash from the knees down. Patient had been sent home to rest while awaiting lab results. Once lab results returned, patient was contacted and instructed to go to the local ED due to his critically low platelets. Patient went to the local ED, bloodwork showed platelets of 4000 at that time. He was tested for COVID-19 on presentation and was found to be COVID-positive. Patient was diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura. He was given a total of 4 platelet transfusions as well as IVIG for 2 days and prednisone for 4 days. Platelets reached 78,000 before patient was discharged on 2/26/21. At the time of this reaction, patient&#39;s active medications included: metformin, testosterone cypionate inj, allopurinol, atorvastatin, carvedilol, dulaglutide, empagliflozin, lisinopril, aspirin, calcium/vitamin D, multivitamin. He also received the TDaP vaccine 1/21/21 (22 days prior to the COVID-19 vaccine). Post-discharge follow up with primary care provider on 3/5/21 revealed patient feeling better, no bruising, bleeding, fever, or chills since discharge. Patient finished the course of oral prednisone started in the hospital. Glucose remains elevated. PMD to recheck CBC for platelets once patient is done with his mandatory quarantine for positive COVID-19 test results.

                                                I received the second vaccine injection, and in about an hour felt a little warm and clammy, I was having some joint and muscle pain, and stomach upset. I had no appetite and did not eat lunch. At supper I still did not want anything, so ate cereal instead. During the night I was restless, and expelled quite a bit of gas throughout the night. Stomach still uneasy. When I awoke, about 6:00 AM, I was hungry and attempted to pour a bowl of cereal but could not due to shaking. My wife found me in the middle of a grand mal seizure and called the ambulance. The ambulance, police, and fire company all responded. They provided medical care onsite and in route to Hospital. I had a fever of 102 degrees, had been biting my tongue raw, flailing arm and hyperventilating. I was somewhat disoriented and delusional. During my hospitalization the injection site was found to be very swollen and red. Ice was applied. An MRI was performed of the head and found to be normal. Several other blood tests were also completed. I remained inpatient from 3/25/21 through 3/21/21.

Patient had a syncopal episode on the toilet prior to EMS call. EMS notes they gave patient 4 epinephrine, 1 bicarbonate, and 1 Narcan. Patient arrived with a lucas machine in place and intubated. Patient&#39;s intubation was verified to be a 7.0 ETT and 23 cm at the lip. Cardiac Activity noted in ED at 2150. See nurses notes for times medications were administered. Further history limited due to unstable vital signs. Pt hypotensive, started and maxed on levophed, epinephrine infusions and additional push dose epi given.  Right femoral central line placed.  Pt began to brady down, was given atropine, ultimately again became pulseless and CPR resumed.  After 2 further rounds of ACLS, total down time approached 1 hour without return of pulse.  On echo, there were occasional agonal beats, but no organized cardiac activity.  EKG and case had been discussed with Dr. Friday and decision was to attempt therapeutic hypothermia prior to second cardiac arrest as EKG showed inferolateral STEMI

                                                Patient received Moderna vaccine dose #1 on 3/3/21 at approximately 0900.  In the afternoon of 3/4/21, patient had sudden onset shortness of breath while at home, as well as fatigue and low energy. Patient knew that a potential side effect of vaccine was fatigue, so he assumed this was just a normal side effect to be expected. States that his difficulty breathing and fatigue continued for about a week. After continued urging from wife to seek medical care, patient visited urgent care center on 3/15/21. The urgent care did a D-Dimer lab, and an x-ray of chest. X-ray &#34;showed something abnormal&#34; so they did a CT scan as well, which showed a &#34;huge pulmonary embolism.&#34; D-Dimer lab was elevated. Patient was transported to hospital by ambulance and had immediate surgery to remove blood clot from lungs at approximately 2100 on 3/15/21. Per patient, the surgeon said the clot was about the size of his palm. Surgeon reported that there was &#34;100% blockage to left lung from the aortic artery and 90% blockage to right lung from aortic artery.&#34;  A DVT in popliteal vein was identified, and the surgeon assumes the clot started in the popliteal vein and broke off and traveled to lungs. Patient was admitted and hospitalized until he was discharged home on 3/18/21. During course of hospitalization, genetic testing was done and it was determined that the &#34;genetic marker for clots was negative, so they think the clot is from a one-time event--patient&#39;s family does not need to be concerned that they have clotting issues.&#34; Patient states that he was started on heparin in the hospital, and was discharged home on Eliquis blood thinner, which is being tapered. Patient states that the doctors think he will be on Eliquis for about 6 months and will not need to be on it for life. Doctors say the DVT in leg will dissolve on its own. During hospitalization, an echogram and cardiac cath was performed, which showed &#34;an old heart attack on the left side, but that collateral vessels have built up already.&#34; Right side of heart was weaker from having to work so hard due to blood clots in lung, but prior to discharge from hospital, the right side of heart was already showing improvement. A heart cath was done to check vessels and it was determined no stents were needed, although there was a small clot in left anterior descending artery. Patient was also newly diagnosed during course of hospitalization with Type II Diabetes in a non-obese person, HTN (which patient had never had before), Coronary Artery Disease, Hyperlipidemia, 1st degree AV block. Was discharged home with metformin, losartan, chlorthalidone, atorvastatin, and Aspirin. The chlorthalidone was discontinued, due to &#34;blood pressure dropping too low--they think his high blood pressure was situational&#34; per wife of patient. Medical doctors advised against receiving the 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine. Patient being followed by Internist at hospital.  Patient&#39;s shortness of breath resolved &#34;immediately after clot was removed&#34; but is continuing to be followed while on new medications and blood thinner dosing.  The above information was provided during telephone interview of patient and his wife.

                                                In the evening of 25-Jan-2021, after my dinner I was watching the TV that after 15 minutes my Left arm from shoulder downwards felt suddenly numb with no sensation. I called my wife and sensing that it may be a stroke took 4 tablets of 81 mg of Baby Aspirin. Some sensation seem to come back after some time (may be an hour or so afterwards), but half of my left palm and little finger remained some what numb. Night passed quietly and kids were anxious that I did not call ambulance or go to ER. Next morning I went to the nearest ER and was diagnosed with Transient Ischemic Attack. All the tests were negative CT scan of Head &amp; Trunk did not reveal anything, only D-Dimer was slightly elevated. I was given a tablet of Aspirin 325 mg and prescribed Eliquis 2.5 mg twice daily for use and advised to follow up with a Neurologist. ER did advise for admission in hospital and a MRI work up, but I declined.

Venous duplex done also revealed bilateral DVTs.  Patient was doing well after fibrinolytic with heparin anticoagulation, but had sudden decompensation on 5/21 (hypotension and respiratory failure requiring intubation).  Transferred to current institution for ECMO evaluation due to severe cardiopulmonary compromise.  Patient deemed not ECMO candidate based on co-morbid conditions based on CT findings.  He underwent mechanical thrombectomy with improvement.  He was continued on heparin infusion, then had sudden decrease in platelet on 5/25 with worsening cardiopulmonary status.  HITT was suspected and heparin was transitioned to argatroban.  Results of heparin induced platelet antibodies (PF4 ELISA assay) and Serotonin Release assay was negative.  Repeat imaging revealed increase clot burden and therefore patient underwent catheter directed thrombolysis followed by aspiration suction thrombectomy.  Due to high clinical suspicion of HITT, repeat heparin induced platelet and SRA sent and pending at the time of report. Of note, patient still in hospital at the time of this report

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On an unknown date, Electrocardiogram: normal other. On an unknown date, SARS-CoV-2 test negative: negative negative. On an unknown date, Troponin: high (High) high.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Patient is on nebulizer treatment of tiotropium bromide and a lot of simethicone. Patient do not know if using either medication helped or not but that was my immidiate reaction. Now patient is on prednisone and feels like he&#39;s taking it just to breathe. Patient has had to go on 24 hr. oxygen since the first shot.   Patient was negative for Covid-19 over the past 3 months at three different times. He continued to have terrible chest pain where he was grabbing and pulling at his chest, pain creeping up to his chest, could not breath or eat anything for 1 week after his first shot.  Patient was in the ER on 10Mar2021. Caller stated he has chronic pancreatitis and breathing issues for which he was prescribed steroids, his doctor told him to decrease the prednisone to 10mg for 2 days prior and day of vaccination. Caller thinks he had a week long stroke since he had high Troponin level which resulted in visit to the hospital where the doctors thought he had septicemia. Caller stated he has not been able to sleep because he keeps having attacks of chest pains that last approximately 15 minutes in the middle of the sleep which occurs 4&#43; times per night.   Kidney&#39;s have gotten worse since 1st shot vaccine. Doctors said &#34;the kidney&#39;s took a shot&#34; after the first shot of vaccine.

On 23-May-2021: follow-up appended, conmeds added, NF added to events, new events added, new allergies coded, generated narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a male patient of unknown age who missed second dose due other adverse events experienced post first dose of mRNA-1273. The other events show temporal association with the use of mRNA-1273 and a causal relationship cannot be excluded. However, the patient has concurrent history that confounds the reported events to include chronic pancreatitis, COPD, kidney and heart disorder.  Missed dose is assessed as not applicable

                                                Outcome: Patient Death CHIEF COMPLAINT in ER: chest pain, SOB  History of Present Illness: Patient is a 66 yo with PMH of chronic afib on chronic anticoagulation who presented to the ER with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and increased fatigue over the past several weeks that has progressively become worse. Patient denies orthopnea or PND but does have some palpitations and occasional chest pain associated with increased fatigue with exertion. On evaluation emergency room patient was noted to be tachycardic consistent with chronic atrial fib, also acute renal insufficiency likely secondary to dehydration. Patient is admitted to the medical service for further treatment and evaluation. DEATH SUMMARY Date of Admission: 04/07/2021 Time of Death: 04/10/2021 at 0737 Final Diagnoses: 1. Sudden Cardiac Death 2. Acute Renal Impairment Secondary to Hypovolemia, A TN 3. Chronic Atrial Fibrillation w/ RVR, Resolved 4. Atypical Chest Pain, Resolved 5. Hypokalemia, Resolved 6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea 7. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure Hospital Course: Patient is a pleasant 66yo admitted for acute renal impairment secondary to significant o hypovolemia resulting in ATN as well as atrial fibrillation w/ RVR after presenting to ER with complaints of chest pain, dyspnea, malaise, and anorexia that began after receiving his second COVID vaccine on 4/01/2021. Please see H&amp;P for full details. Patient reported that on the day after his COVID #2 vaccine, he lost his appetite and was not able to eat or drink. He continued to take his home medications as prescribed including losartan, chlorthalidone, and meloxicam. After experiencing progressive worsening of symptoms for 5 days, patient presented to ER for further evaluation. Upon arrival to ER, patient was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. EKG showed atrial fibrillation w/ RVR. Routine labs were obtained and were remarkable for elevated creatinine and mild hypokalemia w/ normal BNP and negative cardiac enzymes. CXR showed enlarged cardiac silhouette, but no evidence of pulmonary edema or other acute abnormalities. Patient was subsequently admitted for further evaluation and medical management. He was staited on aggressive IV hydration for his hypotension and hypovolemia w/ PRN IV metoprolol as needed for HR&gt; l lObpm. He was continued on anticoagulation. Serial cardiac enzymes were obtained and were negative. TIE report from Dr&#39;s office that was performed recently was obtained and showed EF of 55-60% with Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient&#39;s wife brought his CPAP from home and patient wore his CPAP while sleeping during his hospital stay. During the course of hospitalization, patient&#39;s blood pressure &amp; HR improved, though he remained in atrial fibrillation. His creatinine continued to trend up consistent with ATN, but patient continued to produce adequate urine and he had no signficant electrolyte derangements. IVF were adjusted based on urine output and volume status. Patient had no recurrence in his presenting complaint of chest pain and he overall reported feeling better throughout his course of hospitalization despite reporting that he continued to have little appetite. Patient was monitored closely on telemetry throughout his hospital stay. On the morning of 4/10/2021, lab tech and nurse walked into the patient&#39;s room to obtain specimen for AM labs. Patient reportedly tried to get out of the bed independently, grabbed at his chest &amp; pulled off his telemetry, and fell to his knees. Staff called Code 99 and patient was placed back in the bed. He was noted to be in asystole. ACLS was performed and despite maximal efforts, patient subsequently expired at 0737. I personally called the patient&#39;s cardiologist &amp; personal friend, to discuss the events leading up to the patient&#39;s death. Upon review of the patient&#39;s course of hospitalization, it was felt that patient most likely experienced sudden cardiac death. Of note, Dr reports that the patient frequently contacts him via text message with concerns or complaints. He states that the patient did not message him during the hospitalization to report any chest pain or other concerns. Disposition: Patient Expired

I could not breathe and my fever was 103 degrees. My wife called an ambulance and sent me to the hospital after breathing treatment. I was on a-fib and the doctors/nurses trying to send me back to life. I spent 7 days in the hospital. Blood work, Nuclear tests, fluid tests, lung tests, X-rays, biopsy into my lung and got tissue to get an amount (Bronchoscope). I was very scared. I had pneumonia too.  Every 6 hours, breathing treatments.

Results came back as showing signs of AFib. Never saw this before. I have checked the ECG app on the watch  on and off since getting it in December. Every time  before the second dose of the Moderna vaccine the results came back as normal Sinus rhythm. Since February 18th my ECG on the apple watch has indicated Afib, going on 11 days now.

After the second dose of covid, we checked his pulse rate and it was  34 beats per minute. Irregular heart pattern  was occurring.  Went to NP, who told him to go back to original dosage.  Still reading in the thirties, so called (Internal  Medicine doctor)  He told him to get off medicine.  It took 10 days to get to 70 beats per minute with no afib. Still not taking the carvedilol.

My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

                                                Around 11:35 PM on Thursday March 12, my father dropped his dish and drinking glass. Awokened by the noise, we rushed to him and noticed that his speech was slurred and he was not walking well.  His SpO2 was 94 and his heart rate was in the 140&#39;s. His blood pressue was elevated. He has suffered a stroke in November 2020 and he was acting like he did on that day. Once he sat down, he could not get himself up. The paramedics and my brother had to help him into the ambulance where they administered oxygen. The paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was admitted to the ICU. An MRI did not reveal any damage to the brain. He was diagnosed with a TIA and discharged from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I am not sure if the vaccine had anything to do with this episode, but I thought it should be reported just in case.

He received COVID vaccine on 03/26 with Moderna vaccine (second dose) and was doing well until 3 days PTA. In the doctor&#39;s office patient had an EKG that was read as atrial flutter and doctor sent patient to the ED for rule out PE and evaluation of chest pain and shortness of breath. CTA chest showed numerous bilateral pulmonary emboli and evidence of right heart strain. Of note, his father had history of pulmonary embolism as well as rectal cancer.

                                                DEATH!  About 24 hours after getting his 2nd Moderna Covid-19 shot, patient got deathly ill with explosive vomiting and diarrhea. Not long later he was passing out.  Paramedics were called, and he was taken to the hospital where he passed away from a massive heart attack. The doctors gave him clot-busting drugs in an attempt to save him.  He has never had problems with blood clots in his life.  He was the healthiest one of us all,  and was almost never sick. The doctor said that it was probably no coincidence that he died so soon after receiving his Covid shot. I am convinced that they are connected.  A healthy man suddenly gets blood clots in his heart 24 hours after getting his shot?  Not a coincidence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

                                                I had a Coronary Artery Spasm which led to a Heart Attack. on 3/13/21 at 6:30 am at home. I was stabilized in the Ambulance with sublingual nitroglycerin. The Coronary artery was blocked. The Dr. did a Heart Catheterization which showed that the blockage had receded and no further procedure was performed. I spent 2 Days in Hospital having another heart spasm on 3/14/21 at 05:00 pm which was relieved by Nitroglycerin. I was released and experienced 8 more episodes over the next week. I have been prescribed Calcium channel blockers, blood thinner, and cholesterol drugs as treatment I have constant aching and 2 more episodes requiring Nitroglycerin last week.  I do not have high blood pressure   heart disease or coronary artery disease

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of THROMBOSIS (blood clot in each lung) in a 67-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 039K20A and 029L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below. Concomitant products included CALCIUM FRUCTOBORATE, CHONDROITIN SULFATE SODIUM, GLUCOSAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, HYALURONIC ACID (MOVE FREE JOINT HEALTH) for Joint disorder NOS, MINERALS NOS, VITAMINS NOS (ONE A DAY [MINERALS NOS;VITAMINS NOS]) for an unknown indication. On 21-Jan-2021 at 11:00 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 18-Feb-2021 at 9:30 AM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 28-Feb-2021, the patient experienced THROMBOSIS (blood clot in each lung) (seriousness criteria medically significant and life threatening). On 28-Feb-2021 at 6:00 PM, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath). At the time of the report, THROMBOSIS (blood clot in each lung) outcome was unknown and DYSPNOEA (shortness of breath) had resolved with sequelae. DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 28-Feb-2021, Computerised tomogram: blood clot (abnormal) Blood clot in both lung. On 21Jan2021, patient had received the first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and about 4-5 days later,  he began to noticed that his breathing was labored.  At the time of the report, the patient did not think much about the labored breathing since he was older in age and thought it was due to exercise. Patient received second dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine on 18-Feb-2021 and he reported that his breathing became more laboring where he needed to stop walking to catch his breath. He had 2 scan which revealed that he have a blood clot at each lung and he was prescribed Xarelto 15 mg twice a day, then he will begin Xarelto 20mg once a day on 20-MAY-2021. Patient is on Kirkland C  500mg   as a concomitant medication as well. Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 13-May-2021: Significant FU- outcome of the event.

I went in and out for 9 days and then stayed back in a normal sinus rhythm since.  I monitored my condition with my Kardia 6L and reported the events to my Electrophysiologist via my on-line chart. They monitored me closely but were pretty sure it would settle out, which it did.  I would still take the vaccine again.

                                                Prior to getting my COVID19 vaccination, I was rarely (but occasionally) in A-Fib, most likely caused by my Mitral valve stenosis.  After my 2nd Moderna vaccine, I went into A-Fib, and have not had a normal sinus rhythm recording since then (almost 3 months straight, every day). I have a ECG monitor, so can read my ECGs anytime, and was checking them 3-5 times per day for several weeks after my 2nd shot. I know the vaccination did not CAUSE my A-Fib, but since the vaccine seems to have some metabolic effects beyond just producing protective antibodies (helping folks with long-haul, etc.), I believe it may act as a catalyst which precipitated events leading to &#34;pushing&#34; me into A-Fib 24/7. I just thought you would want to know.

                                                Blood Clot in Leg; Tenderness; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 68-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced blood clot in leg and tenderness.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not  provided by the reporter. Concomitant medications reported included diltiazem hydrochloride, atorvastatin calcium and acetyl salicylic acid.  On 13-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:031M2QA) through intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13-Feb-2021, following administration of the vaccine, the patient had tenderness in his leg that continued until he sought out medical treatment. After medical treatment is was concluded that the patient has a blood clot in his leg and has to receive medical treatment to resolve that condition. The treatment information included rivaroxaban.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The events, blood clot in leg and tenderness were considered recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: There is not enough information to assess the causa association between the reported event of blood clot in leg and the administration if the mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history is lacking. Additional information has been requested.  Howe ever, based on temporal association between product administration and the event of tenderness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

There is no excused for perpetuating the myth that everyone should get the shot no matter what.  A negative covid test and thorough physical should be required before people take this vaccine.

                                                Although I have heart disease, and had triple bypass surgery three  years ago, I consistently take my blood pressure. My blood pressure has been in a  normal range since the operation, and following receiving the first dose of the vaccine it became elevated and I needed to go back on an old medication. Even then, my blood pressure was erratic.  Two weeks after my 2nd COVID shot I had a heart attack due to a blood clot. This clot was able to be removed by a heart cath-lab.  This could be a coincidental flare up due to an old issue, but the timing aligns with both doses of the vaccine.

He said I was in a fib. We watched it for a few days, and  then went in to the doctor. They did an EKG and determined I was indeed in afib. They switched my medication which did not really help. I began having intermittent episodes of the arrhythmia. I went back to the doctor and I was still in afib. They scheduled me for a cardioversion. When I went in for the procedure, they ran tests that determined I was not in afib. I was releases and I have been okay since.

                                                This RN received a phone call from the wife of the client whom is reported in the VAERS. She reports that her husband received a 2nd shot on 2/25/2021 and on 3/20/2021 was in so much pain in his leg that she took him to the Emergency Room. Reports he then received an ultrasound where it was found that  he had a blood clot in his upper leg (near groin). She has heard about the issues with COVID vaccine and blood clots and wanted to make sure that this was reported. He is following with his PCP and Vein specialist. Reports he received the shot from Pharmacy. She said she will probably do a VAERS report also. Reports is doing much better now, but thought they should have it reported.

                                                69 YO M CARDIAC ARREST. PT HAD JUST RECEIVED HIS COVID VACCINATION AND WAS PULLING INTO THE OBSERVATION AREA WHEN HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS TRUCK, BECAME UNCONSCIOUS AND CRASHED INTO A LIGHT POLE. THIS OCCURRED IN FRONT OF THE STANDBY MEDIC UNIT AND OTHER FIRE DEPT STAFF. PT WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN CARDIAC ARREST. CPR WAS INITIATED WITHIN SECONDS OF BEING REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE. EMS WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE AND THE PATIENT WAS DEFIBRILLATED FOR WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SINE WAVE VT/COURSE VF WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF HIS ARREST. PT WAS PLACED ONTO A BACK BOARD AND MOVED TO AMBULANCE IN A PULSED VT AND WAS AWAKE AND RESPONSIVE. ONCE IN THE BACK THE PT WAS WIRED INTO THE FOUR LEAD AND WAS SYNCHRONIZED CARDIOVERTED AT 100 J WITH A CONVERSION TO A PULSED JUNCTIONAL RHYTHM WITH A RATE OF ABOUT 58. THIS RHYTHM CHANGED INTO A SINUS TACH AT ABOUT 100 BPM. IV ACCESS WAS OBTAINED AND 100 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS ADMINISTERED WITH A 2:1 LIDO DRIP HUNG. AMBULANCE BEGAN TRANSPORT TO ER. OVER NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES PT BEGAN HAVING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY IN THE FORM OF PVCs COUPLETS AND EVENTUALLY 4-5 BEAT RUNS OF VTACH WHILE ON PHONE WITH ER MD. DISCUSSED GIVING ANOTHER BOLUS OF LIDO AND INCREASING DRIP TO 3:1 DUE TO INCREASING VENTRICULAR ECTOPY. THE ER PHYSICIAN CONCURRED AND ANOTHER 75 MG LIDO BOLUS WAS GIVEN FOLLOWED BY INCREASING THE DRIP RATE TO 3MG/MINUTE FOLLOWING THE SECOND LIDO DOSE AND DRIP ADJUSTMENT THE PATIENT&#39;S VENTRICULAR ECTOPY RESOLVED AND THE PATIENT REMAINED IN A SINUS RHYTHM / SLOW SINUS TACH THROUGHOUT TRANSPORT AND TRANSFER OF CARE TO THE ER. A 12 LEAD WAS OBTAINED JUST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN ED THAT SHOWED SINUS TACH WITHOUT VENTRICULAR ECTOPY BUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE PACs, FLIPPED T WAVES IN a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

                                                The decedent experienced severe chest pain and dyspnea approximately nine days following the first series of the vaccine. He reported to family members that he was having a &#34;severe reaction&#34; to the vaccine and believed it was acute pericarditis due to the same symptoms he experienced prior. He reported that on 2/1/21 around 0300 hours, the symptoms were the most severe and he was going to seek medical attention, but did not. He waited till the convenient store opened and purchased OTC Tylenol for relief of symptoms. He continued to have dyspnea and chest pain up until 2/9/21, when he called 911 complaining of chest pain and was found to have a STEMI; subsequently died at Hospital in the ER.

A new stroke 24 hours after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccination Moderna  On Tuesday April 6, 2021 the patient showered by himself, walked up and down stairs in the home and was able to walk with the assistance of a cane.  He received the Moderna vaccination second dose at 10:00am (I believe this was an adverse event caused by the vaccination)  Wednesday April 7th at approximately 1:30pm I noticed he was unresponsive prompting me to call 911. His MRI at Hospital clearly diagnosed him as having another stroke, causing patient to no longer walk and use the restroom without assistance.  He is still in the hospital. Hospitalization and Physical Therapy is needed to allow patient to continue practicing as an Attorney.

                                                Took 600mg of Ibuprofen (200mg x3) orally at 7:45AM, 30 minutes later while viewing a medical webinar at my desk at home, I suddenly noticed significant itching of my entire hands which quickly became reddened and progressively swollen as the itching sensation become more generalized within 10-15 minutes. I got up from my chair to go tell my wife but as I walked a few paces, I became extremely weak with visual &#39;closing in&#39; as I barely prevented myself from collapsing to the floor / losing consciousness. At the same time my tongue was now thickened and malfunctioning making my spoken words to my wife almost unintelligible - all consistent with a CLASSIC ANAPHYLAXIS REACTION.  My wife helped me to the couch to recline where I carefully swallowed CHLORPHENIRAMINE 8MG, FAMOTIDINE 20MG; and 15 minutes later DIPHENHYDRAMINE 50MG (I did not have any Epinephrine available from prior &#39;bee sting kits&#39;). At no time was my breathing impaired nor was there any audible wheezing or dyspnea. After ~45 minutes I was improving noticeably, and after ~2-3 hours I had made a 100% recovery with no sequelae thereafter. Although I had taken my routine morning medications several HOURS PRIOR, nevertheless, (after purchasing several vials of Epinephrine 1mg/1mL for protection in case of another reaction), after this event and over the succeeding days I re-added each of those medications separately / one-at-a-time to ensure that NONE of those was the offending agent - NO problems ensued. For obvious reasons, I have 100% AVOIDED ingesting Ibuprofen or other typical NSAIDs since this episode (although my routine single daily aspirin tablet has presented no problems). BOTTOM LINE: DESPITE HAVING USED IBUPROFEN 400MG OR 600MG PERHAPS 1-2 TIMES WEEKLY AS NEEDED FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT OVER MANY YEARS, NEVER UNTIL THIS ANAPHYLACTIC EPISODE 11 DAYS AFTER MY SECOND DOSE OF MODERNA&#39;S COVID-19 VACCINE HAD THERE EVER BEEN ANY TYPE OF ADVERSE REACTION TO IBUPROFEN WHATSOEVER.

I have a history of heart arrhythmias that usually last 8-11 hours at a time, but this episode lasted longer. On the night of February 1, I had a shorter episode but I went to the cardiologist on February 2. He ran tests that showed everything was ok and prescribed the drug Multaq.

Patient had difficulty breathing with swelling feet and ankles that did not begin until April 12th. Patient had no history of breathing problems. Cardiovascular history is unknown at the pharmacy as we had only ever performed vaccinations on the patient. Patient was discovered in his house deceased. Exact date is unknown. The pharmacy was contacted by the patient&#39;s prescriber which requested we file this report. I apologize for the lack of precise information.

Tylenol was finally able to reduce the fever, but the next day it rose to 102,  and the following day also to 102, still having pains in his legs. On day 4, his oxygen level dropped to 80 (he did have congestive heart failure exactly one year ago, but it was corrected in ten days and his oxygen level had been perfect until the vaccine). We are now on day 6 and his oxygen is slowing improving after increasing Lasix. His body had an awful shock with this vaccine which medical people feel contributed to him almost sinking to congestive heart failure again. Even with all his medications he presents as a healthy individual usually.

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

                                                My father received the first Covid shot 3/2; he woke up 3/3 with severe body aches and weakness, which we thought nothing of.  However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

                                                The day after my second shot I got a fever and felt run down through that day, that evening I developed diarrhea which lasted until the following day. All of this I expected from what I had heard that some people have after the second shot. But what I didn&#39;t expect was from then until now which has been approximately 6 weeks I am cramped and my lower abdomen everyday and I&#39;m also experiencing atrial fibrillation almost constantly which I&#39;ve never done before. All my episodes with a fib in the past were due to times when I had been very nauseous or very cramped and would go into a fib which lasted 10 12 hours but for the last 12 years I&#39;ve been on atenolol for that and it has kept me from experiencing those problems. But since the second shot I&#39;m experiencing atrial fibrillation like I said every day with the cramping which I&#39;ve never had before to that extent. I&#39;m reporting this because something isn&#39;t quite right and if this is a coincidence it&#39;s a pretty good one. Thank you for reading this and if I can be of any further help please feel free to contact me through my email.

On CT of neck, an aortic dissection was partially visualized. A CT of his chest was done and aortic dissection was diagnosed. He was transferred to IMC for surgery. At surgery, it was discovered that the dissection had been chronic. He struggled during recovery and was eventually discharged to a SNF. Unfortunately, he developed a stroke in the SNF and was brought back to the ER on 03/17/2021. His prognosis is poor and on 03/22/2021 he was discharged home on hospice.

                                                This was the Moderna vaccine, which I had reaction to the first shot on 2/27/21.  I had listlessness, fatigue, cold/flu symptoms, etc.  With the second shot on 3/29/21, I didn&#39;t seem to have as much of a reaction, but then I started getting diarrhea, and a flare in my Crohn&#39;s.  Since then I have had abdominal spasms, bleeding (as if I was on blood thinners), increased bowel urgency, several bowel accidents, stomach pain, and severe fatigue.  I have contacted my doctor for assistance in my treatment but thought I should report this in case it was a response to the vaccine.

                                                Monday night pt. became ill, threw up and had a fever.  He went to bed, but around 11 pm he woke up disoriented, unable to walk.  Was helped to the bathroom, but was unable to get back to bed on his own.  Fell on his bottom.  I had to call our son to come pick him up and help him back to bed, unable to hold his own weight..  Had trouble sleeping.  Abt 1 pm needed help getting up again, same disorientation, also fell off the toilet and needed help getting back to the bed, unable to hold his own weight.  Finally fell asleep.  Next day seemed fine enough. Tuesday night, became ill again, went to bed.  Got up to go to the bathroom, was wobbly, but able to make it.  Was helped back, wobbly but able to walk. Trouble falling asleep, fever, chills.  Finally fell asleep at 3 am Wed morning.  I had to go to the doctor early, so left him sleeping in bed.  When I came back around 11 am, he was still sleeping, snoring loudly.  Became concerned.  Wouldn&#39;t wake up.  Called Paramedics.  CT scan at the hospital revealed a brain bleed.  Transported to hospital. Put on support for almost 2 weeks.  No progress, no response.  Finally support was discontinued and he died April 19th at 7:52 pm.

                                                Patient became unconscious the evening of 4/14/21.  This event occurred five days after his second Covid vaccination. Patient had just gotten up from a living room chair and was walking over to the stairs to go to the second floor when he became rigid, lost consciousness and fell backward.  911 was called by his girlfriend.  He was unconscious for a couple of minutes.  When EMT&#39;s arrived he was conscious but very groggy.  His blood pressure was 250/157.  He knew his name and year and SSN but did not correctly answer several other questions.  He was taken to ER.  After numerous tests over the course of several days, he was diagnosed as having a stroke.    In the ER, they performed CAT scans, EKG, blood work, urine test and chest xray.  Blood pressure remained high.  Complained of headaches.  Patient was also having trouble voiding urine in the ER so a foley catheter was inserted.  He was admitted to the hospital.  After admission, an MRI, echocardiogram and EEG were performed.  The MRI showed three small blood vessels had burst in his brain.  Echocardiogram showed functions were normal.  The EEG showed some slowing but no signs of seizure.  The conclusion was a stroke.  Physical and occupational therapy examined patient.  No need for further therapy.  Blood pressure remains slightly elevated but he does not appear at this time to have lost any physical or mental functions.  Patient does NOT have a history of high blood pressure or heart issues.  Tests showed his heart was functioning properly.  Per his family doctor, his BP ran approximately 124/64 when tested during the previous 12 months.

                                                Patient presented to the emergency room for evaluation of shortness of breath and chest pain that started two days prior (one day after receiving first Moderna vaccine). Symptoms worse with exertion. Chest pain is described as a heaviness, does not radiate.  EKG in the emergency room that showed ST elevations in III and aVF and his troponin was found to be 40.5 and so code STEMI was activated.  Patient had cardiac cath on an urgent basis and that showed triple-vessel disease, with a very short left main as LAD and left circumflex were almost coming from 2 separate ostia, subtotal occlusion of the LAD and left circumflex and 100% occlusion of the mid RCA.   Evaluated for CABG,  which was declined.  Patient&#39;s echocardiogram showed global hypokinesia with EF of 20 to 25%.  Patient underwent high risk PCI procedure using Impella support with 2 stents to the subtotally occluded LAD and 1 stent to the subtotally occluded left circumflex.  Patient&#39;s symptoms subsided following procedure, however patient suffered mild CHF on initial CXR secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy, successfully treated with Lasix as displayed by downtrending BNP. Patient&#39;s labs also displayed shock liver with AST and ALT liver enzymes both above 1000 on arrival; hepatitis and HIV titers came back negative. Patient suffered from AKI on arrival secondary to ischemia, with an elevated BUN and creatinine; CKD suspected due to lab values showing chronic anemia.

He was found to have extensive DVT LLE.   He denies recent travel or prolonged immobilization, he denies injury to the leg, he denies previous blood clots/blood disorder/cancer.   This is sooner than I would expect patient to begin having symptoms after DVT after covid vaccination however I have no other clear etiology at this time.

                                                71-year-old male with history of lymphoma on chemotherapy and heart transplant in 2011 on immune suppressants presenting with fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath x4 days.  Patient is afebrile upon arrival with otherwise normal vital signs.  He did desaturate to 88% while at rest and was placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  He has clear breath sounds bilaterally without any focal findings.  Work of breathing is not increased and very stable in my opinion.  He appears clinically euvolemic and denies history of heart failure.  No wheezing warranting treatment beta agonist.  Patient will require admission given his acute respiratory insufficiency, will need to discuss appropriate Campus placement with the Heart Transplant Service and anticipate he will require transfer to Grand Rapids.  Given his reported dyspnea, EKG ordered.  Will obtain routine screening labs, COVID-19 swab.  With his reported fever, although not objectively present during this visit, and current immunocompromised state, will treat via the emergency department sepsis protocol and collect blood cultures.  Fri May 21, 2021 1059 EKG with a normal sinus rhythm, rate of 88 beats per minute, no acute ischemic changes are noted.  Patient has a right bundle-branch block.  EKG is unchanged from that of January 21, 2021. BNP is 404, no chest pain to warrant cardiac biomarkers.   [SR] 1113 COVID-19 is detected.   [SR] 1125 CMP was sodium of 128, chloride 95, glucose 303, creatinine 0.87.  Magnesium is 1.9.  Phosphorus 2.1.  Urinalysis with trace blood, no urinary tract infection.  Urinalysis without urinary tract infection.   [SR] 1147 INR subtherapeutic at 1.2.   [SR] 1149 Received a critical result from lab, white blood cell count is 0.04, patient is by definition therefore neutropenic.  Platelets are 21 K without reported active bleeding.  Hemoglobin is 9.3.  Have a call out to Oncology to discuss need for IV cefepime given the reported fevers at home although etiologies presumably viral with COVID-19 test.  Further, I do not know if IV Decadron is appropriate given his profound neutropenia, especially having recently finished a high-dose course of 100 mg prednisone orally x5 days.   [SR] 1150 CXR: Airspace opacities are seen involving both the lungs, more prominent in the right lung, as described above. These are likely due to consolidation/pneumonia. Viral pneumonia can also have similar appearance. Correlate clinically.    [SR] 1218 Discussed case with Dr. from transplant team who agreed with admission to his service .  He did recommend that I broaden his antibiotic regimen to include both IV vancomycin and IV cefepime.  He recommended that I do provided dose of IV Decadron despite the neutropenia to treat his acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19.  Still awaiting call back from Oncology.   [SR] 1454 After multiple pages, I have not been connected to Oncology.  Patient was transported by EMS.  He will need a formal oncology consult upon arrival to admitting facility.   [SR]

On 17-Dec-2020, the patient started ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) (Subcutaneous) 40MG/0.4ML(40 Milligram, Solution for injection in pre-filled. In January 2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. In January 2021, received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. In January 2021, the patient experienced INAPPROPRIATE SCHEDULE OF PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION (Patient received both the doses on smae month). On 12-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SEPSIS (Blood infection) (seriousness criteria hospitalization prolonged and medically significant), ILLNESS (Sick) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), MALAISE (Didn&#39;t feel good) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and CHILLS (chilling) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 17-Apr-2021, ILLNESS (Sick), MALAISE (Didn&#39;t feel good) and CHILLS (chilling) had resolved. At the time of the report, SEPSIS (Blood infection) outcome was unknown and INAPPROPRIATE SCHEDULE OF PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION (Patient received both the doses on smae month) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Catheterisation cardiac: aortic valve calcified (abnormal) Aortic valve calcified. In April 2021, Computerised tomogram: aortic valve calcified (abnormal) Aortic valve calcified.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment for the event included ertapenem for the blood infection.  Company comment: This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of product administration for mRNA1273, lot# (035J202A and 030L20) with no associated adverse events, however the patient experienced some reaction approximately. three months later.

                                                Pneumonia; coughing up blood; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 71-year old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pneumonia and coughing up blood.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included COVID-19. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 19 Jan 2021, approximately 1 day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient began to cough up blood and was seen and treated by a healthcare professional. A chest x-ray was done and revealed pneumonia. Treatment for the event included doxycycline, prednisone and an inhaler.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pneumonia and coughing up blood, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old male subject, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Pneumonia, and non-serious unexpected event of Hemoptysis. The events occurred one day after the first dose of the mRNA-1273 administration. Treatment for the event included doxycycline, prednisone and an inhaler. Since Pneumonia has insidious onset rather than acute onset, the event was possibly related to underlying condition confounded by elderly age of patient. Very limited information regarding these events have been provided at this time. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event of Pneumonia and Hemoptysis, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

At on or around 8:45 PM my dad called my sister that he was having trouble breathing and felt very short of breath. My sister was there in about 7min by the time she got to him my dad was gasping for air he would lift his head up trying to breath. They got him to the hospital shorty after about a 7 min drive. My dad was taken into hospital we were not able to go in due to restrictions.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

                                                My UTI, which was going away, developed into a raging UTI and then later into a bladder infection. I tried taking supplements from my chiropractor but they were not adequate. Even the Pads I wore were insufficient to stem the flow.  There was bleeding as well.  Then went to an Urgent Care facility and they prescribed an antibiotic which worked. It was both painful and embarrassing ( I have to stand and greet people in my position). I suffered for about 6 weeks through this.

                                                about 2 days after the 1st dose of the moderna vaccine, felt very tired and unwell for several days. He felt okay for about 2 weeks then on January 29, 2021 he felt intense chest pain. Concerned it was a heart attack, he was brought to the hospital. He stayed one night and the hospital ran several tests like EKG, stress test and others. Found his results to be normal and was released on January 20, 2021. Even the moment he was released, he felt very dizzy but hospital was not concerned and thought maybe side effect of medication. He continued to feel dizzy, fuzzy brain and hard time staying awake during the day and sleeping through the night for the rest of the week. He passed sometime in the early hours of February 6, 2021. Doctor&#39;s suspicion is a blood clot. He has no history of blood clots, heart problems or any health issues.

                                                My dad started having breathing problems and heart fluttering shortly after getting his first covid vaccination on April 9, 2021. He had contracted Covid back in October 2020. He never told us he was getting the vaccination until we got a call on his cell phone from Public Health the day after he died of a pulmonary embolism. When he started complaining of symptoms, his doctor referred him to a cardiologist at a Clinic. He had an appointment with them a few days before he died. Apparently, they didn&#39;t find any blood cllots, possibly because they were looking for heart issues. Either way, I believe that my dad died from side effects of the Moderna vaccine. My dad died on May 1, 2021 of a pulmonary embolism. The coroner and County Sheriff both said it was one of the biggest blood clots they had ever seen.  Since he had no history of blood clots, I thought it important that I report it.

                                                Two weeks after receiving the final injection, my father was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. He had poor oxygen saturation which prompted a visit to the ER. Upon x-ray he was found to have a large pneumonia in his left lung. After 10 days at the local hospital,  and being placed on a ventilator, he became septic and was air lifted to one of our area&#39;s larger hospitals. There, he was diagnosed with necrotizing pneumonia caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa. He also had heart rate accelerations that would climb into the 150s and they could never figure out why. He was treated aggressively with antibiotics and was successfully weaned off the vent. However, his body was unable to fight off the infection and he ended up passing away from necrotizing pneumonia that caused his respiratory system to fail. My father had underlying COPD that was well-managed at home and he did not require oxygen. I was questioned several times as to whether he&#39;d gotten into or been around anyone or anything different from his usual, but he had not. The only thing out of the ordinary he had was the Moderna injections.

About 24 hours later I went into a-fib, having previously been in sinus rhythm since my last cardiac ablation on Oct 30, 2020.  No meds were missed. The next morning, however, I woke up in sinus rhythm and feel normal.

                                                Started with normal sore arm, ache, tired the day after.  These symptoms went on for a week.  Called Dr and they said they last longer in some people. By the week of the 11th my wife and I were both getting worse.  By Sunday morning, 1/10 we couldn?t get out of bed.  We tested positive for Covid around the 18th  My question is we are supposed to get our second vaccination on 2/3/21, a week from tomorrow.  Given the first vaccine, then testing positive for Covid, should we get the second shot as planned or should we try to delay a week or so to get more strength.  This report is identical for both my wife and myself.  Also, we mask, social distance, no restaurants, etc.  Thank you

Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine. Symptoms:RespDepression, Palpitations, Syncope &amp; cardiac arrest Treatment: EPINEPHRINE 1 MG ONCE 3 rounds given ,CALCIUM CHLORIDE 1000 MG ONCE

                                                Four days after receiving the Moderna second dose, I had a pulmonary embolism of my right lung. It was diagnosed only on Feb. 19, as I was totally unfamiliar with the symptoms and had another indication of a problem: tachycardia, so went to the clinic. I am not sure this isn&#39;t coincidental, but I have no history of embolisms, and no family history. No one at the time of my diagnosis asked when I gotten vaccine. As I said , this may be entirely coincidental, or it may not.  I am presently on eliquis blood thinners, and have had no further problems.

He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

                                                Patient was found deceased in his own home on Monday, March 15, 2021.  He was found on the floor in a sitting position with three fingers of his right hand on his right carotid.  It appeared that he was getting ready for church, which was a routine event.  Although patient was a diabetic, he never had episodes that were life threatening, and was always able to manage to remediate with insulin or food.  Patient last spoke to a neighbor at 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, March 14th, who said he appeared to be just fine and they scheduled a date with their dogs on Sunday afternoon.  A sheet of instructions found on the kitchen counter at the home informed us that he had a COVID vaccine at the VA Hospital on Wednesday, March 10th.  He was documenting side-effects of very sore  right arm and low blood sugars.  that was unusual because if he was able to manage he wouldn&#39;t have noted it.  It was apparent that something sudden happened such that he was unable to get to help and his heart rate must have been of concern.  We believe that patient suffered  onset of some sort of cardiac event, blood clot, high heart rate, or heart attack, that was associated with the vaccine on Wednesday and 4 days later he was suddenly gone, unable to call for help (he has family close by in this community).  We want healthcare providers and individuals to be able to make informed decisions about giving/taking the vaccine when there is another health issue  such as diabetes to consider.  We lost a brother, a father, a friend and a dedicated veteran unnecessarily.

                                                death Narrative: Patient passed away on April 13, 2021 at home at 1810 He was 72 years old had severe aortic stenosis and hypertension and had an aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at hospital on Jan 20, 2021. He was readmitted to hospital for shortness of breath which was evaluated from Feb 19 - Feb 21, 2021 I spoke with his daughter today. She was with him at home when he went to the bathroom and since he had not come out for some time, she knocked on the door and found him collapsed in the bathroom. She called 911, who did CPR, however he had passed away. He was referred to the coroner. He had his first Moderna vaccine on March 15, 2021 after which he had not had any side effects. He received his second dose on April 12, 2021 and had not mentioned any side effects other than mild abdominal discomfort. Daughter said his shortness of breath had been improving after his discharge from the hospital. He had not complained of chest pain, cough, fever, diarrhea, in the last few days. I paid condolences to daughter and told here we would be reviewing the case to see if there was any relationship to him receiving the Covid19 vaccine and that the case had already been referred to the coroners office.

She was fine after about a day.  My father reported  arm soreness and fatigue that lasted about three days after the shot.  He thought he was rebounding from the shot and continued his usual activities.  Though, he started complaining of being &#34;winded&#34; and difficulty breathing.  He slept a lot and continued with fatigue and shallow breathing.  A week after his shot he felt he needed to go to the ER because of difficulty breathing and being exhausted after walking up a flight of stairs (we live in a raised ranch style house).

                                                At approximately 8 pm pt. sucked in a deep breath, head began to roll and he began twitching on the right side of his body. Pt. only has muscle function in the right side of his body due to his stroke damage. His wife immediately approached him in his chair and asked him what was wrong and all he was able to state was &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; before loosing consciousness and stopping breathing. 911 was immediately called and due to his wife being frail herself she was not able to remove him from his wheelchair to perform any CPR. EMS arrived and begin performing CPR until the DNR papers for pt. were located. Medical examiner came to the home and stated she did not feel that an autopsy was needed even though family had told her NUMEROUS times that pt. had received his second Covid vaccine the day prior. He was pronounced dead by the medical examiner and taken directly to the funeral home due to the DNR papers being present.

The next morning on 03/20/2021 around 9:00 AM, I noticed my left arm swelling. I got to feeling real bad.  On 03/25/2021, I was feeling so bad that I went to Family Medicine to see my doctor, MD.  He sent me straight to the Emergency room.  They gave me the clot buster for my left arm. I was in there for 3 or 4 days. I was discharged. I have blood clots in my lungs. I had a follow up appointment.  I also started seeing a new doctor, a pulmonologist,  for the blood clots in my lungs. I lost a lot of weight, 32 pounds.

He had 2 MRIs which concluded he has an infection in the bone of one of his toes. He was sent home after 5 days in the hospital with a PIC line where he has to be on 2 antibiotics and a blood thinner for 6 weeks. If infection doesn&#39;t resolve he will have to have toe amputated. Prior to Covid vaccines my father was very active and healthy. He could do things without distress. He can now barely walk too far because he is so weak.

                                                ED: The patient is a 72-year-old man, who awoke this morning at roughly 0700 hours in the morning with a headache.  He mentioned this to his wife, but attributed the headache to the vaccine he had received for COVID yesterday.  He was able to make some coffee, but went back to bed shortly after this.  He awoke at roughly 0800 hours in the morning unable to get out of bed.  His left leg would not allow him to stand.  He was also slurring his words.  At this point, he called his wife for help.  She activated EMS.  I saw the patient immediately upon arrival at the charge nurse desk for stroke evaluation.  NH stroke scale score was 6.  Stroke alert was activated and he was taken emergently to the scanner and neurology was consulted and highly involved in the case.  Neurology: Unstable right pontine ischemic stroke in setting of high grade basilar occlusion.  His deficits have progressed since yesterday, despite tPA.  Dysarthria and left hemiparesis both worse.  No bleeding on CT, so I cannot attribute worsening to hemorrhagic conversion. I&#39;ve since discussed the case with a stroke expert.  There is mutual agreement that waxing and waning may reflect the nature of unstable, incomplete basilar artery occlusion.  He was in agreement with me that clot retrieval would not have been considered with INCOMPLETE OCCLUSION and stroke scale &lt; 6 prior to administration of tPA.  Dr.  has recommended anti-coagulation over dual anti-platelet therapy, including anti-coagulation for 3-6 months.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.  The outcomes of the events, seizures, mini stroke, and tired, were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack and concomitant medication use can be confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

                                                First injection: mild reactions with no heart involvement. Second injection: Heart A-Fib lasting for 13 hours with very rapid and erratic heart beat ranging from 105 to 151 bpm. Completely resolved by itself and heart rate returned to my normal 75 bpm as measured on my finger-tip pulse oximeter. This type of event has not occurred since my A-Fib ablation done 7 years ago.  Also experienced, fever, aches, sore arm, night sweats within first 12 hours and diarrhea 48 hours after injection.

He received his second dose on 3/9 and came to our Emergency room the same day with altered mental staus and very lethargic. He had a temp of 102.9 upon arrival to the ER. He was hurting all over. He was hospitalized from 3/9-3/12 and was found to have agonal respirations during his hospitalization and a code blue was called and he was moved to the ICU. He did not have to have any code blue medications and only minimal chest compressions were performed. He was discharged home on 3/12 without further complications.

                                                I am writing this to let you know that two weeks after receiving my first COVID 19 vaccination I developed a   severe blood clot from my right ankle to my right groin.   I am Factor 5 deficient, and believe that the vaccine caused the clot.  I had no symptoms at all until I noticed my right calf was swollen (no pain).  My wife insisted I go to emergency because I am Factor 5 deficient and inclined to thickening of the blood.  I  have not been on a plane or taken a long trip by car.  I walk 3 miles a day, play golf and am very active.  I strongly believe the vaccine caused the clot.  I will be on blood thinners the rest of my life..

                                                Patient started feeling woozy, dizzy, slurring words and fatigued around 11:30am. By the afternoon he was extremely fatigued and barely ate lunch or dinner. He went to bed at 9:30pm. By 1:30am, he woke up and urinated the bed because he couldn&#39;t get his urinal in place. He was extremely weak and shaking, and could barely hold his body upright when I used the lift to get him out of bed. He was not making coherent sense when he spoke, though his words and sentences were sensical, it made no sense in context.  We sent him to the ER on recommendation of the advice nurse and 4:30am. He was checked in and showed low levels of sodium and potassium. They gave him an IV and he began to feel better very soon, though he remained weak and woozy and nauseous.  He returned home in early afternoon, but remained weak for over 2 weeks afterward, slurring words and having trouble lifting his arms, though mental  function returned by that same day. The doctors believe that he had a TIA, though no evidence of a clot showed up. They did discover that he has atrial fibrillation, though they had never detected that before on the heart exams following his heart attack.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse effect (No relevant medical history reported) and Surgery. Concomitant products included thyroid medication  for an unknown indication, cholesterol medication.    On 13-Feb-2021 at 10:30 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 13-Feb-2021, the patient experienced SMALL INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION (Blocked small intestine) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On 13-Mar-2021, the patient experienced INTESTINAL ISCHAEMIA (small intestine got blocked and due to blockage blood supply stopped) (seriousness criterion medically significant), THROMBOSIS (started having blood clot thrombosis both in his right leg as well as left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (Missed the 2nd dose). On 13-Mar-2021, PRODUCT DOSE OMISSION ISSUE (Missed the 2nd dose) had resolved. At the time of the report, SMALL INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION (Blocked small intestine), INTESTINAL ISCHAEMIA (small intestine got blocked and due to blockage blood supply stopped) and THROMBOSIS (started having blood clot thrombosis both in his right leg as well as left leg) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications included thyroid medication and cholesterol medication. Patient called in to report that he received his 1st dose of Moderna vaccine on 13Feb2021 in left arm at 10.30 am and his 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine was scheduled on 13Mar2021. On 13Mar2021he went to Emergency Room (ER) and he had major surgery on  small intestine, patient mentioned that his small intestine got blocked and due to blockage the blood supply was stopped and the intestine started to die. On that day, the patient underwent a surgical procedure which the  doctor had to take out 12 inches of small intestine and stapled back. He was hospitalized for five  days. Five to seven days after his surgery,  he developed blood clot thrombosis in his right and left legs. Treatment for the event included blood thinner, which he has been on for 45 days. It was reported that the second dose of Moderna vaccine was missed due to hospitalization for the events and the blood thinner that he was on.

                                                My father received the first dose of the moderna vaccine on February 21, 2021. On March 19, 2021 my father exhibited stroke-like symptoms and was admitted into the hospital for a medical emergency. The doctors ran multiple tests and determined that he suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA). His symptoms subsided and he was discharged on March 20, 2021. He received his second dose of the moderna vaccine on March 21, 2021 and, on the same day, suffered the same stroke-like symptoms which the doctors determined was another TIA. My father had no previous history of strokes, seizures or stroke-like symptoms prior to receiving the moderna vaccine. My father was re-admitted into the hospital on March 21, 2021 and over the course of two weeks was subject to a number of tests which revealed that his platelet count had significantly decreased to the point where his blood began to clot. They diagnosed him with a sudden onset of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The doctors explained that TTP was very serious and life-threatening disease if left untreated. Since this discovery, my father has needed to receive multiple plasma exchanges and rituximab treatments. I have written records asking the doctors about the link between the moderna vaccine and his TTP. The doctors recommended that I report this information. I believe it&#39;s critical for others to be made aware about the serious side effects of the moderna vaccine. I am willing to share my father&#39;s medical records which proves the drastic decrease in his platelet count following his receiving the moderna vaccine.

He was airlifted to another Hospital and was there until 3-13-21 while there he received a feeding tube because he couldn&#39;t eat because he lost the ability to swallow without it going to his lungs. he was then sent to a rehab facility till 4-6-21. with a total hospitals and rehab stay of a month and 2 days. he is extremely weak on his right side unable to stand and walk on his own, he has vertigo and severe balance issues, he also still is unable to see having double vision and other issues escalating the dizziness. still on multiple medications for issues from this. he was a very strong independent hard working man, working more then half the people half his age, this has greatly effected his life and we are lucky to still have him because the stroke was bad enough that we know that they saved his life only by the quick action of the hospital

Patient received Moderna COVID Vaccinations on January 14, and February 11, 2021. On May 17th patient requested a Telemedicine visit for chest congestion, painful cough, tightness in chest since May 14th - diagnosed with acute bronchitis and provided prescriptions for prednisone BID, Doxycycline BID, and Benzonatate  Q6H prn cough. On May 18th the patient presented to the ED for evaluation of confusion upon waking. Upon arrival patient was febrile (102), CRP was 224. Evaluation was significant for acute respiratory failure with hypoxia secondary to COVID pneumonia. CT scan demonstrated multifocal  pneumonia consistent with COVID. He was started on 2L oxygen via NC, dextamethasone, remdesivir (2 doses given), &amp; Duo Neb treatments. He initially did well on 2L. On the 20th, he began to decompensate. He went from 2L to Airvo 55L 70% at 11am. Procalcitonin went from 0.26 to 0.96. Ceftriaxone &amp; doxycycline was initiated. He maintained saturations on the Airvo, &amp; was even weaned down to 55%. On May 21st, he has decompensated further, with saturations quickly dropping to the upper 80&#39;s with minimal activity. RR has been 28-32. Airvo settings were increased to 60L/95%. Saturations are now 88-93%. ABG was 7.45-38-60-27-92%. He was given an additional IV dextamethasone. Patient will be transferred to Medical center for a higher level of care. Patient was treated with tocilizumab on May 21st.

                                                Patient passed away Saturday at 14:04pm. Patient&#39;s wife reports his death was sudden, he passed away sitting in his chair his heart just stopped she said. They tried to perform CPR, 911 was called and paramedics arrived at the scene and he was given medication but never had any return of vital signs and so his death was called at the scene. Wife reports he was not ill, did not have any symptoms prior to the event. They are not going to be doing a autopsy. She wanted us to know based on timing that there may be some possible correlation with his COVID19 vaccine. He obtained the vaccine on 02/09/2021 - wife reports he had no symptoms, not even arm soreness after the vaccine. Had no fever, shortness of breath. Did not complain of chest pain. We can update chart to reflect the patient is deceased and lets make a card for the family.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

                                                The patient was found dead in his home on 3/18/2021, 8 days after vaccination. Due to the remoteness of where the individual lives and his lack of housemate, it is unknown how long he had been dead, but it is not believe that he was dead for more than 1-2 days. He had no adverse reactions in the 15-30 minutes that he was observed post-injection. He also reported only a sore arm to the public health nurse in an email a few days after his vaccination.

After starting the infusion he developed sudden onset shortness of breath.  He is noted to be wheezing.  He was given Solu-Medrol and benadryl prior to transfer to ED.   Acute hypoxic respiratory failure in patient with recent Covid diagnosis with sudden worsening during monoclonal antibody infusion.  Differential includes allergic reaction/anaphylaxis, flash pulmonary edema, worsening Covid. Given the wheezing he was given a DuoNeb with no significant improvement but may be slightly decreased wheezing.  Patient was placed on BiPAP given concern for pulmonary edema and increased work of breathing.  We were able to titrate down the FiO2 to 40%.  He was transitioned to high flow nasal cannula.  Will admit to the hospital for further supportive cares given Covid and hypoxic respiratory failure.

                                                Patient received first COVID vaccine on 2/6/2021 and second vaccine on 3/6/2021. Patient presented to Hospital on 4/09/2021 for persistent nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, hematuria and jaundice. Patient reported a 1 month history of intermittent nausea and vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, feeling dizzy and weak, poor appetite. Patient had a colonoscopy ~2 weeks prior admission to hospital for cancer screening purposes which was unremarkable and labs done by his primary care at that time were all normal (per admitting physician&#39;s note). At hospital, patient was found to have evidence of hemolytic anemia thought to be autoimmune in nature with a positive direct antiglobulin. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital on 4/11/2021 for further workup. Patient is still currently admitted to hospital. Oncology was consulted for workup of pancytopenia and suspected warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Throughout admission, the patient&#39;s platelets have ranged between 59-154 k/µL and hemoglobin has ranged 4.5-8.6 g/dL with no documented history of thrombocytopenia or anemia. Patient received methylprednisolone 125 mg x9 doses, prednisone 80 mg daily (1 mg/kg) x5 doses, prednisone 60 mg x1 dose, rituximab 740 mg (375 mg/m2)  x3 doses, and immune globulin 40 g x3 doses. Patient has also received 4 units of packed red blood cells. Given the timing of anemia and thrombocytopenia and unknown etiology, immune response to his COVID vaccine is on the differential.

He is still hospitalized but improving as of the date of this report. His COVID-19 test was negative on the day of admission. He had no symptoms out of the ordinary on the day of his vaccination. I am reporting this as it occurred in the week after his first dose of vaccine though would suspect the timing is likely coincidental rather than directly related to the vaccine.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

The breakthroughs went mostly away and then began again a few days after the second dose was administered on 2/23/21. This may have nothing to do with the vaccine but may be a recurrence but it seems more than coincidental, timing wise.

The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  The events stroke, unable to speak/ lack of pronunciations and fatigue were considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, a temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Of note, the patient has a pre-existing history of heart attack which is a strong confounder for the reported CVA and speech disorder. Fatigue is consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.

                                                One week after 2nd Moderna, started coughing periodically in day and night chest conjestion started to build at night. After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

                                                Four days later (feb. 12th 2021) had a very uncomfortable atrial fibrillation episode.  This hadn&#39;t happened to me since the July 4th weekend.  Yesterday, March 30, 2021, I had an even more serious atrial fibrillation episode.  My heart hasn&#39;t felt &#34;right&#34; since that first Moderna injection on Feb. 8, 2021.  I didn&#39;t have any of the more commonly listed side effects, but I&#39;ve begun to wonder if the vaccine has somehow taxed my heart to the point that atrial fibrillation is easily brought about.

                                                Dizzy, very tired. And severe atrial fibrillation for about 5 hours.  Pulse was 140 and BP was 104/54.  Very scary. I will refuse further vaccination.   My health is very good and the medications I take are maintenance of my good health. I can do most any physical activity with energy.  There were no other cause and effect possibilities. It was the vaccine.

No recent hospitalizations before, at time of or following vaccination up to time of death. No illnesses recently around vaccination or time of death. No pre-disposing factors to death. Unlikely that vaccine contributed to patient&#39;s death, but was likely a result of advanced age (74 y/o) in combination with comorbidities.

                                                On March 4 patient experienced vomiting. Early morning March 5 he fell and landed on his hip after being disoriented and experienced aches, weakness, and nausea without vomiting throughout the day. On March 6 he experienced excruciating pain in his left hip and went to the local emergency room following guidance from his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.

He was evaluated by the doctor and sent for several studies (EKG) and his heart was weakened. He was sent to do another study, because snoring was heard. He was transferred to the hospital to the ER, he had the fluid in his lungs. He  is placed  intensive and dies on 3/23/2021 from heart failure.

I spoke with wife who stated she was with the patient today, he worked outside shoveling and snow blowing with the winter storm. She saw him minutes before 4pm (she estimated 3:58p) and he was his normal self, then she walked to another room, called out to him, he didn&#39;t respond, so she ran back to where he was and saw him slumped over and weak on the L, she immediately called 911. She has record on her phone of calling a family member (daughter?) about this at 4:01, right after she had called 911, so LKN consider just before 4pm.  Patient states he takes only medications for hypertension at home. Denies being on any blood thinners and no record of blood thinners in his chart. Denies recent surgeries, denies history of ICH, denies bleeding issues in the past, denies ever having had a prior stroke.  BG 122 on arrival. BP initially 121/84 then increased requiring some labetalol.

                                                Patient passed away on 4/30/21. Wife reports that on 4/29/21, she found him in the garage in a &#34;pool of blood, face down&#34; after a fall. Upon finding him on  4/29/21, she took him to the emergency room where he had a CT scan. Patient was diagnosed with a &#34;concussion&#34; and sent back home, and was instructed to follow-up with his primary care provider on 4/30/21. On 4/30/21, patient was &#34;sleepy all day.&#34; On his way out of the house around 3:30, he suddenly put his hand on his wife and proceeded to collapse. The wife also fell, and by the time she gathered herself and went to check on her husband, he had passed away. An ambulance came to the house; CPR was performed for 40 minutes but &#34;they could not get him back.&#34; He was not transported to a medical center. An autopsy was not done, but the coroner informed patient&#39;s wife that he likely died from a &#34;clot, maybe a PE.&#34; Wife wonders how this could be, since he was on Plavix for 5 years. Wife does not feel that the COVID vaccine is to blame, but thought she should report the issue just in case. This writer is assisting wife of patient to fill out electronic report.
