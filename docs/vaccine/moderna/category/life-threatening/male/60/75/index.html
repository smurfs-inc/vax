                                                DVT blood clot; A spontaneous report was received from a 60-year-old male consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot.    The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included factor V Leiden, enlarged prostate, DVT, pulmonary embolism and hypertension. Concomitant medications reported included valsartan, alfuzosin, and acetylsalicylic acid.   On 07 Jan 2021, approximately four days prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient developed DVT blood clot and experienced leg pain so intense that he could not walk. A doppler exam showed the DVT was from the top of the calf to mid-thigh. Treatment for the event included a rivaroxaban starter pack with dose tapering.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event deep vein thrombosis (DVT) blood clot was not reported.  The outcome of the event, DVT blood clot, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 60-year-old male patient with a relevant medical history of factor V Leiden, DVT, pulmonary embolism and hypertension who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011J20A) intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. Patient experienced the medically significant unlisted event of Deep vein thrombosis approximately four days after administration of vaccine. Treatment for the event included rivaroxaban. Based on the temporal association between the use of the product and the event occurring after receiving the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the event of Deep vein thrombosis is possibly related to the product. Of note, the patient&#39;s underlying Factor V Leiden which predispose to developing abnormal blood clots, and prior medical history of DVT with pulmonary embolism are considered risk factors to the occurrence of the event.

He is currently admitted at a different hospital.   After vaccine administration on-site, the patient became unconscious for a few minutes. However, this is common for him - he informed us that he almost always &#34;passes out&#34; after vaccine administration. He slowly returned to consciousness without any issues. He was seen by an ED physician prior to leaving the facility. Deemed to be in good health, patient also stated that he felt fine and believed he was okay to leave as these episodes occur frequently following vaccination.

No heart beat pulse etc... used CPR machines and paddles  Patient had walked 6 1/2 miles that morning no problems did about 50-60 miles weekly outside.

This happened 1 1/2 hours after getting shot.

                                                Patient died with an unknown cause. He was found on the kitchen floor with no blood present. We requested an autopsy but because the County Coroner said there was no foul play suspected, that they would not perform an autopsy on the body to determine the cause of death even though the family had requested an autopsy. The Funeral Home stated to us that it had the looks of a heart attack, but he was not qualified to make that determination. He stated that the way the blood had stopped and purpled in his neck, gave him the indication that the heart was unable to pump all the way.

                                                Found dead at home slumped on the floor; Loss of appetite; Body aches; Feverish; A spontaneous report was received from a physician, concerning a 65-years-old male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and experienced feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, and death.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia. Concomitant medications reported included metformin, glimepiride, lisinopril, atorvastatin, aspirin, methimazole, propranolol, and cilostazol.   On 05 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 037k20a) for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On an unknown date in Jan 2021, some time after receiving the vaccine, the patient was feeling feverish with body aches and loss of appetite.  On 09 Jan 2021 at approximately 21:30, the patient was found dead at home slumped on the floor. According to the paramedics, the patient was dead longer than when his wife found him, and no resuscitation was performed.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, feverish, body aches, loss of appetite, was considered resolved. The patient died on 09 Jan 2021. The cause of death was not reported.  The reporter assessed the event, death, as not related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine. The reporter did not provide assessment for the events, feverish and body aches, in relation to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 65 year old male patient with medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia, who experienced the serious unexpected event of death, non-serious unexpected event of loss of appetite, and non-serious expected events of fever and body pain.  The event of death occurred 5 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. The events of fever, body pain and loss of appetite occurred an unspecified period of time after the first dose of mRNA-1273.  Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Definitive causal association is confounded by age and medical history of diabetes, hypertension, Hashimoto&#39;s, smoker, cataracts, atrioventricular block, occasional premature ventricular contractions, and hypertriglyceridemia.

                                                Passed away; A spontaneous report was received from a Pharmacist concerning a 65 years-old, male patient who passed away/MedDRA PT: death, days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #012L20A) on 12 Jan 2021. On 11 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot # 030M20A) (route of administration and injection site not provided) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unknown date, days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the patient passed away. The patient did not come to the hospital; therefore the Pharmacist had very little detail of the situation but believed it was due to aspiration based on report received from the patient&#39;s boss. The Pharmacist reported there was no report of any issues from the first vaccine. The patient was found at home by spouse and had yellow stuff on face and chest.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable as the patient deceased.  The patient died on an unknown date. The cause of death was reported as unknown. Plans for autopsy were not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the event of death has been provided at this time.  Further information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death days after receiving the second dose of the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine

Discharged per wheel chair to lobby in alert/stable condition, to wait on bus to take him home. At 18:00 his neighbor heard him fall, could not get patient to answer phone, found him unresponsive. Neighbor called 9-1-1, ambulance personnel could not revive patient.  Coroner&#39;s office ruled his death as Natural Causes due to Hypertension, Cardiac disease, Diabetes, ESRD.  There were no indication of anaphylactic reaction noted when I questioned the coroner&#39;s office. The Coroner&#39;s office/EMS were aware the patient had received the Moderna COVID 19 vaccination that day.

Per clinic notes: &#34;Brief summary covid vaccine 1/21 with side effect within 12 hr lasting 3 d By around 1/26-1/29 had cp w/ exertion and sob TST 2/2 w/  Minor ekg changes and min workload per pt (mod workload per note) nuc study pending.  Cough and sob worse over the last 5 d or so, sleeping in recliner, and having trouble sleeping.  Though no desat on march test, he has freq intermittent coughing and he was tachycardic to 110 on exam this am.&#34;   Pt states symptoms worsening over past week. No symptoms at rest. With exertion has anterior chest tightness and dyspnea. No radiation of pain or migration. He can walk usual distances but much slower. Improved at rest. Cannot lay flat at night. Cannot sleep much at night. Dry cough. No wt changes or LE pain/swelling. No f/c. No ill contacts. No chest pain currently. Pt underwent exercise treadmill stress test on 2/2/21 that showed borderline ischemic changes (so a myocardial perfusion study was planned) but patient&#39;s dyspnea on exertion worsened so he was seen in clinic on 2/10/21 where he was noted to have elevated BNP and D-dimer, was sent to the emergency department where CT angiography was negative for pulmonary embolism but it revealed pulmonary edema with bilateral pleural effusions. Patient was admitted, noted to have elevated troponin, anterolateral ST depressions on EKG, noted to have rapid atrial fibrillation, had NSTEMI so he underwent cardiac cath on 2/10/21 that revealed multivessel coronary artery disease, was hypotensive so IABP was placed, percutaneous coronary intervention of left main, LAD and RCA were done and admitted to the ICU. TTE on 2/11/21 showed LVEF 45% with moderate posteriorly directed MR, was diuresed, started IV amiodarone for SVT and atrial fibrillation, IABP was removed on 2/12/21, dopamine IV drip was weaned and patient was transferred to telemetry on 2/13/21 for further care. Heparin was transitioned to Pradaxa on 2/14/21 and dopamine drip was weaned off on 2/16/21. Patient then had an episode of epistaxis on 2/18/21 (resolved with pressure and Afrin spray), had cough on 2/18/21 and chest x-ray showed mild worsening bilateral central patchy parenchymal opacification so IV Zosyn was started (2/18-2/21/21) then changed to Augmentin (with plans to complete course on 2/24/21), Lasix give for diuresis, CT chest and abdomen was done on 2/20/21 for anemia that showed no obvious hematoma or soft tissue collections. Patient continued diuresis and cardiac medications adjusted.  Coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI status post percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiogenic shock, systolic dysfunction congestive heart failure, moderate MR: Patient was continued on current cardiac medications including aspirin (for 1 month post cath until 3/10/21), clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Pradaxa, losartan, spironolactone. Continued lasix 80mg PO daily as maintenance diuretic regimen per  cardiology recommendations. Patient&#39;s current weight is 178 lbs (admission weight was around 189 lbs). Patient was not started on beta blockers given recent cardiogenic shock. Acute kidney injury: Seems to have resolved with current creatinine of 1.2. Leukocytosis: Resolved. Will complete about 7 day course of antibiotics with Augmentin until last dose on 2/23/2021. Tobacco smoker: Patient was counseled on smoking. Patient was advised to quit. Discussed smoking cessation classes. Continued nicotine patch. Anemia: No evidence of active bleeding. Will repeat CBC on 2/26/21 as patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy as well as anticoagulation. Patient was also placed on pantoprazole for GI ulcer prophylaxis. Patient got 2nd COVID19 Moderna vaccine as outpatient on 2/27/21.

On 2/24/21, he was transferred to Hospital and continued to have additional diagnoses, including polyneuropathy critical illness, acute gangrenous cholecystitis, abdominal pain, anemia, impaired mobility, oropharyngeal dysphagia, pulmonary embolism, and assistance with ADL.  On 3/19/21, he was transferred from Hospital to Acute Rehab Unit for acute physical, occupational, and speech therapy.   He remains there today.   We do not know if this sequence of events is related to the vaccine, but because it occurred one day after the vaccine, we thought it should be reported.

He has allergies to bees/egg and a h/o anaphylaxis 2/2 receiving an injection of penicillin in the past. Discussed that prior h/o anaphylaxis to PCN injection was not a contraindication to this vaccination, but is a precaution. Discussed risks of receiving the vaccination vs benefits of the vaccine, which patient states &#34;I already had this discussion with Dr.!&#34; He has multiple comorbidities which place him at a higher risk for more severe illness from COVID-19. Again received the risk vs benefit discussion. Patient stated understanding and desire to proceed with the vaccination. He will be monitored for at least 30 minutes in area where staff can directly observe him. Patient received the COVID vaccination at 13:00. At 45 minutes later, staff alerted that he was c/o palpitations. Due to confusion and weakness, we were unable to transport him to an examination room. Oxygen, water, and vitals machine were brought to him. He presented with SOB, confusion, lightheadedness. Exam demonstrated acute distress, speaking in staccato sentences. HR in 80s, with lungs CTAB and no stridor - despite increased RR to 20s. Vitals with HR in 70s, SpO2 remained 97% or greater on RA. BP was initially 140/72. A code blue was called and Drs. presented to the area. Patient c/o itchy throat and still p/w confusion/combativeness, loss of orientation, and SOB. No visible swelling noticed. At around 13:58, patient syncopized. HR and SpO2 remained 70-80s and &gt;98% on room air respectively. Pulse remained palpable. At that time, an epipen was administered. Patient woke up. During the entire episode, he was able to recognize a staff member with whom he was previously familiar. EMS arrived, vitals remained stable. EMS transported patient to the ER for further monitoring and f/u. Concern for immediate allergic reaction 2/2 vaccination. After event, patient in need of referral to allergy provider for evaluation prior to consideration of 2nd dosage.

Is eye drifted off to the side and he was too dizzy to get up.  He was taken to the hospital.  They did a CT scan which didn&#39;t give a diagnosis, and they were unable to do a MRI scan due to a medical reason,  so they could not determine for sure if he had a stroke.  They are assuming that he did have a stroke and he has oculomotor nerve paralysis on the right side.  The nurse practitioner saw him today and she reports he is doing very well now.  He had been staying in a assisted living type facility when this occurred, but he is expected to return home tomorrow.

Patient had a syncopal episode on the toilet prior to EMS call. EMS notes they gave patient 4 epinephrine, 1 bicarbonate, and 1 Narcan. Patient arrived with a lucas machine in place and intubated. Patient&#39;s intubation was verified to be a 7.0 ETT and 23 cm at the lip. Cardiac Activity noted in ED at 2150. See nurses notes for times medications were administered. Further history limited due to unstable vital signs. Pt hypotensive, started and maxed on levophed, epinephrine infusions and additional push dose epi given.  Right femoral central line placed.  Pt began to brady down, was given atropine, ultimately again became pulseless and CPR resumed.  After 2 further rounds of ACLS, total down time approached 1 hour without return of pulse.  On echo, there were occasional agonal beats, but no organized cardiac activity.  EKG and case had been discussed with Dr. Friday and decision was to attempt therapeutic hypothermia prior to second cardiac arrest as EKG showed inferolateral STEMI

                                                I suffered a heart attack on March 11, 2021, at approx 145pm, while sitting at my desk - WFH.  My symptoms were sweats, nausea, followed by chest pains beginning on the left side of my chest; sweats and nausea subsided for approx 1 hr, returning again, followed by chest pains radiating  the across the full chest approx.  I left my desk at the onset to wash my face, returning to my desk to talk a scheduled phone call at 2pm, lasting until 3pm.  I left desk to walk outside to take in some fresh air, my wife ask me if I was ok, I said no.  She ask if I was having a heart attack, to which I replied, I don&#39;t know.  shortly there after we left for the ER at arriving approx 4pm.  At that point ER staff did a quick assessment, taking my to an ER patient room where i was advised by the attending Dr that they thought I was having a heart attack.  Shortly thereafter I was taking to the Cath lab where a stent was insert and then taken to ICU.  Where I remained until I was released on 3/12/2021 at 3pm.  There was no detectable heart damage and I was placed a regime of blood thinner, a beta blocker and cholesterol med.  I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or history of heart problems.  My last physical was Feb 2021.

About 4:30 am next morning I got up to use bathroom and passed out for unknown length of time.  I tried to go back to bed and passed out two more times. The 3rd time my wife says my eyes rolled back in my head and she could not arouse me for 3 to 5 minutes. I went back to bed to sleep. Several hours later I was still to dizzy to stand and had a knot on the back of my head from the falls.  We called 911 and I went to ER at Hospital  for further evaluation.

State girlfriend found him sitting in the chair a few minutes before they called her.  The Coroner did not order autopsy.  Did not sent patient to the hospital.  Sent him directly Funeral Home.  Death Certificate Number 123-2021-002593 list cause of death as pending.  I spoke with the patient&#39;s primary doctor who gave me the history of HTN, Diabetes, &amp; High Cholesterol.

                                                Blood Clot in Leg; Tenderness; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 68-year-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced blood clot in leg and tenderness.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not  provided by the reporter. Concomitant medications reported included diltiazem hydrochloride, atorvastatin calcium and acetyl salicylic acid.  On 13-Feb-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number:031M2QA) through intramuscularly in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 13-Feb-2021, following administration of the vaccine, the patient had tenderness in his leg that continued until he sought out medical treatment. After medical treatment is was concluded that the patient has a blood clot in his leg and has to receive medical treatment to resolve that condition. The treatment information included rivaroxaban.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The events, blood clot in leg and tenderness were considered recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: There is not enough information to assess the causa association between the reported event of blood clot in leg and the administration if the mRNA-1273 vaccine.  Critical details such as the patient&#39;s medical history is lacking. Additional information has been requested.  Howe ever, based on temporal association between product administration and the event of tenderness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He reported to family members that he was having a &#34;severe reaction&#34; to the vaccine and believed it was acute pericarditis due to the same symptoms he experienced prior. He reported that on 2/1/21 around 0300 hours, the symptoms were the most severe and he was going to seek medical attention, but did not. He waited till the convenient store opened and purchased OTC Tylenol for relief of symptoms. He continued to have dyspnea and chest pain up until 2/9/21, when he called 911 complaining of chest pain and was found to have a STEMI; subsequently died at Hospital in the ER.

                                                patient states that immediately following administration of covid vaccine on 2/5  he began to experience profuse sweating, dizziness and nausea. He went home and then went to the ED for syncope on 2/6. Prior to ED, patient states that he became so dizzy that he lost control of his head and it slammed on the table he was sitting at leading him to go to the ED. The ED note is without mention of the vaccine. However, when pt saw me on  2/9, he states that all of his symptoms were r/t the vaccine. He left ama from the ED who wanted to admit him for a cardiac eval. I did not witness administration nor did I know patient prior to visit. I just saw him following his ED visit. It is not my intent to mislead the Department of Human and Health Services, I am simply reporting what the patient told me.

                                                The patient was admitted for recurrent syncope that began on Friday evening 2/19. He fell twice and struck his head, knocking 2 teeth loose. He continued to feel lightheaded the next day and came to the ED and was admitted for syncope workup. His workup was negative. On discharge, patient recalled that he received his 1st Covid vaccine.  His symptoms resolved after admission. This event was likely related to his vaccination.

But, by 10:00 PM that evening it was 98.6.  I returned to work on Feb. 11 and 12.  Then on Feb. 13, I developed a severe pain in my chest and back area and it persisted all day and thru the night.  I could only sleep sitting up.  The pain was pretty severe when I laid down flat on my back.  On Feb. 15 at 7:00 AM my wife insisted I go to the ER .  Initially, their computer showed I had a heart attack.  So, I was admitted for Observation on Monday evening and Tue. morning the Dr. admitted me to the hospital and a heart cath. was conducted and ruled out that I had a heart attack, but they are treating me Pirocarditis.  I feel that this is a side effect of the second vaccine since I have NEVER had any heart concerns prior to this.

                                                My father received the first Covid shot 3/2; he woke up 3/3 with severe body aches and weakness, which we thought nothing of.  However, every day, he got weaker and weaker. He has been treated for Liver cancer, he received his first infusion of Opdivo almost 4 weeks before the vaccination.  About 7 days after the shot, he was having trouble swallowing so he went to the ER to get a CT scan. He was found to have greatly elevated troponins, the DR was baffled he wasn?t having any chest pain; they were apparently not trending either., he has never had a heart attack or any other heart problems, takes Nadolol for high blood pressure. The CT scan showed significant growth of his tumors  which had been stable for a year and the last CT scan was the end of January; liver enzymes were also significantly elevated whereas they were stable before.  My father deteriorated rapidly, and died on 3/18/21. The day he got the shot just prior, he was hauling wood, shoveling snow and living a normal life feeling good. The day after the shot he could barely get out of bed he was so weak, until he finally died 16 days later.

                                                Pneumonia; coughing up blood; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was also a 71-year old, male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pneumonia and coughing up blood.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included COVID-19. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 19 Jan 2021, approximately 1 day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 20 Jan 2021, the patient began to cough up blood and was seen and treated by a healthcare professional. A chest x-ray was done and revealed pneumonia. Treatment for the event included doxycycline, prednisone and an inhaler.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pneumonia and coughing up blood, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 71-year-old male subject, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Pneumonia, and non-serious unexpected event of Hemoptysis. The events occurred one day after the first dose of the mRNA-1273 administration. Treatment for the event included doxycycline, prednisone and an inhaler. Since Pneumonia has insidious onset rather than acute onset, the event was possibly related to underlying condition confounded by elderly age of patient.

At on or around 8:45 PM my dad called my sister that he was having trouble breathing and felt very short of breath. My sister was there in about 7min by the time she got to him my dad was gasping for air he would lift his head up trying to breath. They got him to the hospital shorty after about a 7 min drive. My dad was taken into hospital we were not able to go in due to restrictions.

                                                Feb 25th afternoon I started feeling pretty yucky. As the evening progressed I had chills, body aches, and fever. I thought I had covid. On the 26th I was worse. on the 27th I went to the ER, and the diagnosis was &#34;unknown virus&#34; I continued to get worse. On March 3rd I called the nurse and she said &#34;I need to go to the ER, don&#39;t go to the  ER, go to the closest ER to you&#34;. I received the same diagnosis. I thought maybe my CPAP machine had bacteria and they tested for bacteria and it was negative. I went home. On march 8th I was really bad off, I had 103.7 fever still and O2 was 70-80. I was admitted to the hospital. they tested me again and I had bacterial pneumonia. 3 days later they were going to send me home but when I woke up that morning I felt like I had been kicked in the ribs on my right side. I sat in a chair and if I coughed, hiccuped or anything It felt like a knife through my chest. a CT scan showed a massive blood clot in my lung. I was put on medications and I was discharged on March 17th. My left lung had 100% pneumonia and the blood clot was in the right lung and my lungs were unable to help each other. With any exertion, my heart rate jumps and my O2 drops. I can only sit. The theory they had at the hospital is that the Moderna vaccine had the full attention of my immune system which allowed other infections to come into my body unchecked. Since the pandemic started I have left my house on my bicycle to the store and that is it. I have had almost no exposure.

(First dose was 3/11/2021) He filled out his Pre-Vaccination Checklist for COVID-19 Vaccines and signed the consent. His form was reviewed and he was given his vaccine in his left deltoid. He then was given his CDC card and waited at least 15 minutes and then exited the building. At 1p.m he was in an accident on the main highway.  He was conscious after the accident, but later did pass away.  This information came from a Police Officer as no one at the pharmacy witnessed the accident.

                                                2nd maderna vaccine was given to my dad on 02/26/2021 and on 03/15/2021 my dad was visiting me all day and he acted fine and normal. At the end of our visit between 8 &amp; 9 pm we went to the store where he started to gasp for breath. He had to keep stopping and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had him sit several times because I didn&#39;t know how bad it was. By the time we reached the doors to leave after a short trip  he almost fell over and he became confused and said he couldn&#39;t breath. I had another customer get my dad a wheel chair close by while I called 911. The ambulance came quickly but at the hospital my dad went into cardiac arrest and his heart stopped 2 or 3 times and it had to be restarted. When I was able to get to the hospital my dad was on a ventilator and sedated. They had put him on medicine to blast the blood clots they had found. They said he had 2 very large blood clots with one on each lung. Later his kidneys started failing him and they said he would need to go on dialysis as soon as the next day. Later that night they told me my dads heart was shutting down and he had developed pneumonia. My dad died that night and I had to watch him take his last breath. If you want further information please contact Medical center would be the ones to contact for all information and my dad was in the critical care unit.

                                                Started with normal sore arm, ache, tired the day after.  These symptoms went on for a week.  Called Dr and they said they last longer in some people. By the week of the 11th my wife and I were both getting worse.  By Sunday morning, 1/10 we couldn?t get out of bed.  We tested positive for Covid around the 18th  My question is we are supposed to get our second vaccination on 2/3/21, a week from tomorrow.  Given the first vaccine, then testing positive for Covid, should we get the second shot as planned or should we try to delay a week or so to get more strength.  This report is identical for both my wife and myself.  Also, we mask, social distance, no restaurants, etc.  Thank you

Patient received his first dose of the COVID vaccine on 01/15/2021and felt poorly thereafter. He was describing shortness of breath to his wife and requiring 5L of O2 at home to maintain saturations in 80s, while he usually was on 3L to maintain saturations in the mid 90s. He had been oriented but more fatigued than normal and described bilateral shoulder pain (which was not new for him) as well as indigestion. Took Tylenol with some relief. He had decreased PO intake and less appetite. The patient&#39;s wife encouraged him to come to the hospital daily for a week prior to admission, but the patient did not want to because he felt his side effects were secondary to the vaccine.

It was diagnosed only on Feb. 19, as I was totally unfamiliar with the symptoms and had another indication of a problem: tachycardia, so went to the clinic. I am not sure this isn&#39;t coincidental, but I have no history of embolisms, and no family history. No one at the time of my diagnosis asked when I gotten vaccine. As I said , this may be entirely coincidental, or it may not.  I am presently on eliquis blood thinners, and have had no further problems.

                                                this is all per family, 4 to 5 days after 2nd COVID vaccine he was acting unusual and was taken to the hospital. He had a clot in his brain and underwent brain surgery. He experienced seizures after the surgery, but it was ultimately reported the surgery went well. He remained intubated and on a ventilator after surgery. He developed complications of his lungs and kidneys while on the ventilator. Ventilator was removed 3/16/2021 and he passed away that day. The hospital providers thought the clot in the brain may have been from hitting his head over a month ago. From my understanding he was A&amp;O, independent with ADLs, and lived in his private residence prior to these complications.

                                                Patient was found deceased in his own home on Monday, March 15, 2021.  He was found on the floor in a sitting position with three fingers of his right hand on his right carotid.  It appeared that he was getting ready for church, which was a routine event.  Although patient was a diabetic, he never had episodes that were life threatening, and was always able to manage to remediate with insulin or food.  Patient last spoke to a neighbor at 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, March 14th, who said he appeared to be just fine and they scheduled a date with their dogs on Sunday afternoon.  A sheet of instructions found on the kitchen counter at the home informed us that he had a COVID vaccine at the VA Hospital on Wednesday, March 10th.  He was documenting side-effects of very sore  right arm and low blood sugars.  that was unusual because if he was able to manage he wouldn&#39;t have noted it.  It was apparent that something sudden happened such that he was unable to get to help and his heart rate must have been of concern.  We believe that patient suffered  onset of some sort of cardiac event, blood clot, high heart rate, or heart attack, that was associated with the vaccine on Wednesday and 4 days later he was suddenly gone, unable to call for help (he has family close by in this community).  We want healthcare providers and individuals to be able to make informed decisions about giving/taking the vaccine when there is another health issue  such as diabetes to consider.  We lost a brother, a father, a friend and a dedicated veteran unnecessarily.

                                                Seizures; Mini stroke; Tired; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 73-year-old male who received Moderna Covid-19 vaccine and experienced seizures, mini stroke, confused, agitated, eyes were abnormal, memory impairment, and tired.   The patient&#39;s medical history included heart attack and stent placement in 2011. His relevant concomitant medications include acetylsalicylic acid, candesartan cilexetil, clopidogrel bisulfate, diltiazem hydrochloride, ezetimibe, adenosine, gabapentin, metoprolol tartrate and rosuvastatin calcium.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 on 14 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, 30 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received his second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot#010M20A) intramuscularly in left deltoid for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Feb 2021, With in 30 minutes of receiving the vaccination, the patient had a seizure. They took him to the hospital, where he had a computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood work and had a consult. After consult, they said, it&#39;s a mini stroke. They released him and told her if it happens again call 911. He felt so tired and went to sleep at home. Around 17:00 dinner time, he woke up looked very blankly, and his wife reported knowing he had another seizure. She reported he ran to his keys saying, &#34;I have to go&#34;, seemed confused, agitated and didn&#39;t know where he was. She called 911 andhe was transported to the hospital in an ambulance.  Around 19:00 the same day, he was admitted to do scans overnight. Around 21:00, patient&#39;s eyes were abnormal, he became agitated again and nurses confirmed he was having another seizure. 30 minutes later, he was talking to his wife and daughter as if he didn&#39;t remember anything. He mentioned some metallic taste in his mouth.  On 11 Feb 2021, they did an electroencephalogram (EEG) and confirmed that he was having seizure. He was prescribed seizure medication and released him from hospital. However, the patient and his wife reported not wanting him to take the medication as they believe the events were due to the vaccine. Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with vaccine is not applicable as the patient received both the doses.  The outcomes of the events, seizures, mini stroke, and tired, were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  The patient&#39;s medical history of heart attack and concomitant medication use can be confounding factor. Further information has been requested.

                                                Patient passed away Saturday at 14:04pm. Patient&#39;s wife reports his death was sudden, he passed away sitting in his chair his heart just stopped she said. They tried to perform CPR, 911 was called and paramedics arrived at the scene and he was given medication but never had any return of vital signs and so his death was called at the scene. Wife reports he was not ill, did not have any symptoms prior to the event. They are not going to be doing a autopsy. She wanted us to know based on timing that there may be some possible correlation with his COVID19 vaccine. He obtained the vaccine on 02/09/2021 - wife reports he had no symptoms, not even arm soreness after the vaccine. Had no fever, shortness of breath. Did not complain of chest pain. We can update chart to reflect the patient is deceased and lets make a card for the family.

                                                loss of consciousness;febrile Narrative: Patient received his 2nd vaccine at 10am 2/17. That evening he felt subjectively febrile and then suffered a ground level fall at 0400 on 2/18. He did not lose consciousness or injure his head. EMS was contacted and assisted him into bed. At 0600, wife noted increased work of breathing, which prompted another EMS call, who found him hypoxic with fever of 106. He was transported to a community hospital, where he was found to have temp 102.9 and blood pressure in 70s-80s systolic. He was transferred to hospital at 1300 on 2/18/21, requiring norepinephrine for pressure support after fluid resuscitation. He c/o stiffness and soreness all over but presenting ROS was otherwise negative. Patient was treated with 4L IV fluids and vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam at the outside ER. Here at the hospital he was treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam and levofloxacin along with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Despite this he had several fevers with Tmax 103.5F the night of 2/18-2/19 and he required norepinephrine plus vasopressin overnight to maintain blood pressure. Piperacillin/Tazobactam was discontinued in favor of meropenem. His last fever was at 6am on 2/19. ID consult was obtained 2/19/21 and vancomycin and levofloxacin were weaned off. Ultimately his blood pressure improved and he was weaned off of all vasopressors the morning of 2/20. Notably, he never developed severe hypoxemia at rest while in the ICU, but did require BiPAP non-invasive ventilation at night instead of his usual CPAP to keep his oxygen levels &gt; 90% while sleeping and additionally had desaturations into the low 80% range with exertion from which he was slow to recover. His oxygen saturation was &gt;90% on 30-40% FiO2 via aerosol mask overnight and 3L (his current baseline) NC during the day. He was transferred out of the ICU on 2/21 based on hemodynamic improvement, stable oxygenation, and improved mentation and symptoms. Unfortunately, on the morning of 2/22/21, patient had an abrupt change in status and was found to be unresponsive with hypercarbic respiratory failure and hypotension. ABG during this event was 7.16/121/65. BiPAP was initiated as patient&#39;s code status was DNR/DNI. CXR with no significant change from 2/18/21. CT of head without contrast was negative for acute processes. Based on lack of rapid improvement, the decision was made by wife to transition to comfort care. Patient died at 1446 on 2/22/21. **Of note: patient was admitted for 1 week for covid 19 pneumonia November 2020. During this hospitalization he was found to have chronic R sided PE, no acute PE.

He is still hospitalized but improving as of the date of this report. His COVID-19 test was negative on the day of admission. He had no symptoms out of the ordinary on the day of his vaccination. I am reporting this as it occurred in the week after his first dose of vaccine though would suspect the timing is likely coincidental rather than directly related to the vaccine.

                                                My grandpa had a stroke on the 15th of February. He claimed he had been feeling &#34;off&#34; for a few days, but didn&#39;t say anything. A blood clot had formed in his brain. He was doing better and about to go to rehab to strength his right side of his body. On the 22nd he took a turn for the worst. He was having trouble breathing and they sedated and partially paralyzed him to put a tube in his mouth. I believe another blood clot had formed and oxygen wasn&#39;t properly going through his body. They could not stabilize him, and he passed away the same day.

After three days of cough periodic and each night became more conjested with problem being to not inhale deeply, and lower right side adobonem pain. Sought medical appointment March 20 but did not get appointment until March 9 with medical facility due to increasing pain and not sleeping from conjestion.  March 10 doctor visit ordered blood and urine tests and CT scan. Early Mar11 test B type natriuretic protein was high (CHF), Doctor ordered chest xray, ekg and echogram. CT scan found clot in right lower lung. Told to go to ER Mar 10 evening, ER ordered Ultrasound images of the legs.BILATERAL LOWER EXTRE BILATERAL LOWER EXTREMITY DEEP VEINS: Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal right femoral vein and popliteal vein extending into the tibioperoneal trunk. Thrombus is hypoechoic and expansile consistent with acute thrombus.Left lower extremity veins are patent and compressible. Left common femoral vein demonstrates normal waveform without loss of respiratory phasicity.Positive for right lower extremity DVT of the distal femoral vein, popliteal vein, and tibioperoneal trunk. CT;LUNG BASES: Small right pleural effusion with overlying compressive atelectasis and consolidation. There are addition, there are apparent filling defects within the subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches suggestive of emboli. Many /multiple blood tests March 9, 10 ,11 , 12 and 16 available to examine details..one perhaps low Platelets count 151 K/uL (range) 140 - 400 K/uL. I can give permission for these tests results to study to correlate lung and leg clots . This is unique because hospital data available to diagnose in detail my reaction after 2nd Moderna shot. Please look into it with experts..Did Moderna cause my clots I never had before?

                                                On March 4 patient experienced vomiting. Early morning March 5 he fell and landed on his hip after being disoriented and experienced aches, weakness, and nausea without vomiting throughout the day. On March 6 he experienced excruciating pain in his left hip and went to the local emergency room following guidance from his primary care physician. He was diagnosed with fluid near his hip joint at the hospital and was discharged the same day. The next day, March 7 he was still in pain but able to walk with assistance. On March 8 he got an x-ray from an orthopedic physician and severe arthritis was found. March 10 the severe pain persisted, but he was able to walk with a walker. On March 12 he received a cortisone shot and required emergency medical assistance to get into a personal vehicle with a family member who drove to the appointment. The next few days, the pain persisted, became worse, and spread throughout his body. On March 16 he was transported by emergency medical services to the local emergency room for treatment and was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia. On March 18 he was still being treated when he experienced cardiac arrest while being intubated. He was resuscitated and was on a ventilator being treated for a few more days but ultimately succumbed to sepsis on March 30.
