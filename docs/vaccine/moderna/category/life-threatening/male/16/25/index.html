                                                Admission HPI: Right-sided chest pain began 2 days prior to admission (3/19) after getting out of car, without identifiable trigger. Pain was sharp, pleuritic, and worst with movement; didn&#39;t feel it when still. Pain not responsive to ibuprofen or heating packs. Reported 30-60 seconds of self-resolving heart racing during ocular migraine which has been his baseline for years. Not associated with SOB (at rest or with exercise), palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. No viral URI symptoms, N/V, or rash. He did receive his 2nd Moderna COVID vaccine about 1 week PTA, followed by 36hrs of fevers, chills, and body aches. Given persistence of pain, Patient asked his parents to present to urgent care.   In UC, he was noted to tachycardic with CXR with bibasilar atelectasis and b/l effusions, per report. Given continued tachycardia, decision was made to transfer to ED to r/o PE.      In ED, tachycardic to 104-116 and tachypneic 22-26. Had one episode of tachycardia to 182 iso ocular migraine. Endorsed chest pain but points to R middle abdomen when asked where worst. Exam was unremarkable. He received 1 dose of morphine which reduced pain from 10/10 to 0/10. Labs notable for leukocytosis (14.61), thrombocytopenia (422), elevated d-dimer (1.56), and elevated CRP (5.6). Otherwise normal chem and coags. COVID/RVP negative. CXR unremarkable. CTPA showed scattered PEs in b/l lower lobes with small pulmonary infarct in RML. No evidence of right heart strain. Heme was consulted who recommended starting him on lovenox and sending lupus anti-coagulant. Cardiology was consulted who recommended EKG, BNP, and troponin, all of which were normal and reassuring against right heart strain. ECHO was therefore deferred to the AM. The decision was made to admit.   Upon arrival to the floor, Patient was tachycardic 114 and tachypneic to 22, otherwise stable vitals. He denied any pain since morphine. Denied any unexpected weight loss; reports that car ride was short. Mom reports that Patient has been less active d/t cold weather and baseball being on hold. Denies family or personal history of clots. Last seizure ~13 years ago.  Hospital Course: (3/21 - 3/22)  Patient was admitted to the hematology service. He was therapeutically anticoagulated with LMWH injections and his anti-Xa level prior to discharge was 0.92. (goal 0.5-1.0) Lower extremity ultrasound with Doppler showed patent veins and no evidence of DVT and upper extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of DVT, though there was potential evidence of collateralization seen in mid and distal third of right subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein. Since this was an unprovoked PE, a full thrombophilia workup was sent and will be followed up by the outpatient hematology clinic. Cardiology consulted regarding possibility of right heart strain and the tachycardia during migraine episodes. Echocardiogram performed on 3/22 was technically limited but showed no gross abnormalities. The cardiology team requested a repeat echo scheduled outpatient for 1-2 months after discharge.

Was found to be in AFib with RVR. Was given adenosine 6 mg x 1, then 12 mg x 1 en rote via EmS with no change to heart rate. When in the ER, his heart rate was 189.  He was initially started on Cardizem drip. Admitted to CVU. Cardiology was consulted. An echocardiogram was ordered which did not show any significant abnormalities. No further workup recommended at this time. Hemodynamically stable for discharge. Recommend following up with primary care 2-4 weeks post discharge.

Approximately five minutes later around 3:15 pm, Patient experienced syncope, fell out of his chair, hit the left side of his forehead on the ground. Due to the fall, he experienced a mild abrasion on the left side of his forehead, which led to bleeding.  The Physician?s Assistant rushed to aid Patient who was lying on the ground in a supine position. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) - Fire Department and ambulance were called immediately and approximately five minutes later EMS arrived. During the time frame prior to EMS arrival, the Physician?s Assistant asked numerous questions to Patient to assess his condition. She asked Patient if he could breathe and he responded ?yes?. She asked Patient  if he was short of breath and he responded ?no?. She asked Patient if he felt like his throat was closing and he responded ?no?. At this point, an Epinephrine pen was not used.

Patient also mentioned that he only consumed two cookies and coffee for that day.  When the EMS arrived (about 5 firefighters), they interviewed him and performed a blood pressure test. His sitting blood pressure was 130/82. One of the firefighters assessed his spine and Patient denied cervical, thoracic, and lumbar tenderness or pain.

EMS gave Patient gauze to address his head wound Patient initially refused to go to the hospital, but per EMS protocol, fluids needed to be administered.

On admission patient was found to have a platelet count of 1. Heme/ onc was consulted and thrombocytopenia was deemed secondary to ITP.  Hepatitis B panel, showed previous hepatitis B infection, although results may be inaccurate due to patient receiving IVIG prior to hepatitis panel being done.  Patient also had an equivocal syphilis result, which also could be a false positive due to immune response.  Patient received 2 IVIG, 4 days of Decadron, and 1 dose of Nplate.  Patient did not receive rituximab, due to stable increasing platelet count.  Patient received hepatitis-B prophylaxis for 2 days in case he were to receive rituximab.  Platelet count now stable at 25, to follow-up with hematology in 1 week outpatient for repeat CBC.  Patient also to follow-up with his Primary Care Physician in 1 week.
