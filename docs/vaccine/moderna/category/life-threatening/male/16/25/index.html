                                                I began to feel ill in bed. I stood up to get some water. While pouring the water, I felt much worse - out of it. I dropped the cup but it didn&#39;t register with me. I tried pouring again but dropped the pitcher too. My girlfriend came out, woken up by the noise, and then saw me collapse and start shaking. I don&#39;t remember anything after dropping the pitcher. When I came to (maybe a few seconds later?), I asked if I hit my head. She said I hadn&#39;t (luckily she was there to catch my head) but I did urinate on myself. I was very cold shivering, teeth clattering. She got me over to the shower where I turned the temperature all the way up and sat underneath. After a while I began to feel better - the fog had cleared for sure. I got in bed after and slept it off. When I woke up I had sweat through my clothes and still had a mild fever, but aside from that I felt almost entirely better. It&#39;s been about two days since then and I still feel completely well.
