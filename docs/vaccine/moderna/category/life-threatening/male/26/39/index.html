On the way back to the bedroom I felt my blood pressure bottom out and lost consciousness briefly and regained consciousness lying on the floor and my wife helping me up. I was able to make it to the bathroom and lay against the toilet because I thought I was going to throw up. I had that same feeling of my blood pressure dropping and again lost consciousness and regained consciousness with my head laying on the toilet seat. I also had sever chills and body aches, particularly in the neck area. I also struggled talking and communicating with my wife. She tells me I wasn?t making sense and my words were slurred.

                                                About 5 to 10 minutes after the shot I felt extremely lightheaded and then fainted.  When I came to about 10 seconds later, there was a public health official there rubbing my chest asking me if I knew where I was.  It took me a second to fully come to my senses but then I realized where I was and what had happened.  I was very pale, felt chills, was sweating, and it took effort to open my hands.  The EMTs ran a bunch of tests, my Blood pressure was low (I think the number I remember was 104/33), but the rest of the measurements like blood sugar or the number of ekg like tests they did all came back normal.  The EMTs in the field said they think it was a response to the vaccine.  After about 20 minutes of the EMTs monitoring me, my numbers came back up and I was feeling relatively normal.  I waited another 30 minutes before leaving just to make sure.  It has been almost a week and I haven&#39;t felt any symptoms close to that since then.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient  is a 29 y.o.  with a history that includes # Asthma # Diabetes, recently diagnosed # Obstructive sleep apnea # Remote pulmonary embolism, no longer on anticoagulation who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of known COVID-19, since admitted to Hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -&gt; 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.

                                                Around 11:15 am, Jan 17, 2021, while standing at the toilet, my son either lost his balance or fainted and fell to the floor.  He was able to cushion his fall so that he did not have any broken bones, bleeding etc.  He said he felt weak and tired.  I had to help him up from the floor.  He was able to assist me but it was like lifting a dead weight (he weighs about 150).  He was able to walk to his bed  with his arms around my neck holding him upright.  He is very tired/lethargic and not himself.  Temperature is 99.7F by mouth.  He has rested since the incident.  Giving him apple juice to keep him hydrated.  I need to help him up to a sitting position before he can drink.

                                                Patient lives with family in private residence with parents and 2 siblings. Spends most of time in own room. First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

Treatment for the events included paracetamol, unspecified intravenous (IV) medications, ondansetron and ketorolac tromethamine. The emergency room discharge diagnosis was stomach flu.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The events, loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, GI upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, stomach flu, chills and fever, were considered resolved on 24 Dec 2020.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 31-year-old, male subject with a medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, who experienced the unexpected events of loss of consciousness (LOC) x 2, gastrointestinal (GI) upset, diarrhea, difficulty sleeping, pallor, and stomach flu, and the expected events of chills and fever. The events of chills, fever occurred approximately 6 hrs. and the events of GI upset, loss of consciousness, difficulty sleeping occurred after 12 hrs. after the first dose of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine. The time to onset for the events of GI upset and diarrhea were unknown. The reporter did not provide the causality assessment for the events. Due to the temporal association between the LOC and the administration of the vaccine, a causal relationship cannot be excluded, however, the subject&#39;s medical history of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and other concurrent conditions of GI upset, diarrhea, and stomach flu remain as confounders.

He placed is head between his knees, he started to sweat and I gave him some water at his request.  He sat back and started to get pale and more sweaty, he complained about pain in his arm and neck.  He then began to slightly shake and passed out.  He was awoken very quickly by his wife who was standing in front of him.  We kept talking to him and I checked his pulse and called 911.  After about 30 minutes he was feeling much better and did not need to go to the hospital.  His vitals were strong and he walked out on his own.  I contacted him 3 hours later and he was resting but feeling fine.

While sitting down his eye rolled back and he passed out.  His spouse said his body was shaking.  She lowered him to the floor and he awoke.  Paramedics were called and determined his blood pressure was very low. They tried to stand the patient up to take another blood pressure reading, but the patient had to sit down as he became dizzy and lightheaded again.  The paramedics took him to the ER where the doctor said he was fine and discharged him.

                                                Patient symptoms of chills, headache, and body aches began on Sunday 3/28, 6 days after vaccination.   One day later, on 3/29, patient started experiencing pain in the right armpit, the same shoulder where the vaccine was received.  That pain built up until Wednesday 3/31, when the arm was very swollen, purple, and rapidly loosing sensation.  The patient went to the ER.  In the ER, via ultrasound, the patient was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis of the right subclavian and axillary veins.  From 4/1 to 4/2 the patient underwent an interventional radiology procedure, thrombo lysis, using tPA directed by catheter to the site of the 12 cm long clot.  On 4/2, it was determined that the flow was not restored to the vein, and the radiologist informed the patient that right first rib removal would be necessary.  On 4/9, right first rib resection surgery was performed to alleviate pressure on the subclavian vein.  Patient is currently recovering on the blood thinner Eliquis.  Additional procedures for thrombo ectomy and angioplasty will follow in approximately two weeks to clear the subclavian and axillary veins.

                                                Pt. was very sick the day after the shot, then Friday morning his heart was going into atrial fibrillation and jumping between 110 heart rate and 160&#43;. He was out golfing when he noticed this. He rested later that day but was extremely tired and felt sick. Saturday morning (2.5 days after vaccine) he needed to go to the emergency room because his heart rate was back over 160. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia and gave him a message for it but it made it worse and the rate was over 200. They had to stop and start his heart then put on beta blocker which brought it to 180, then another beta blocker brought to 150. Following EKGs showed atrial fibrillation, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and super ventricular tachycardia. Pt. had this about a year ago but was fine after a few days. This was the first time he was hospitalized for it and is now on daily medications. He fears the Moderna vaccine triggered it and is very worried about the second dose.

At about 10:30am, after waiting 15 minutes after the shot, the patient stood up from his chair in the waiting area. He staggered over to the pharmacy drop off window and stated that he felt like he was going to pass out. His eyes rolled back and he collapsed. Another patient was approaching the counter at the same exact time and was able to catch him on his way down. By the time I ran from behind the pharmacy counter, he was awake, breathing heavy and confused. One of the pharmacy technicians called 911 immediately and started the emergency response. he was able to regain his composure and move himself back the chair. The EMTs arrived and took his vitals, and discussed what happened. They eventually determined that he was ok and was free to go. The patient did not go to the hospital.

Chills, dizziness, and body aches continued mildly through Sunday.   I also passed out/blacked out the night of getting the vaccine while using the bathroom. Unclear if this was simply due to standing too quickly while experiencing the above mentioned symptoms and blood rushing to my head or a true side effect of the vaccine.

I had my arms up and felt a lot of pain in my arm, and blacked out and fainted. I don&#39;t recall the events for the next 60 seconds. My wife said that I fell on the bed, was unresponsive, saw foaming at the mouth, had seizure, and urinated in my pants. She adjusted the bed so that my head is up, and threw cold water at my face, mouth and teeth, which made me responsive, and then walked me to the bathroom.     During the night, I had fever, Chill, pain at injection site, vomit, nausea, headache, light-headed.  I didn&#39;t have appetite in the morning and had nausea and headache. I felt better ~3pm when I could finally eat rice, yogurt and chicken. I am feeling well now, but worry that the seizure had caused any long term damage.

Within seconds I was unresponsive for what appears to have been just over 1 minute. My wife called 911 and I was starting to come to while she was wrapping up the call with the dispatcher. I remained seated upright, did not fall over, but was completely unresponsive.  When the EMT&#39;s checked vitals (within 5 minutes of me coming back to awareness), all was normal. Simply a full body cold sweat. It&#39;s now 10pm and I feel no other symptoms. Completely &#34;normal&#34;.

He went to the waiting room and all of a sudden he told his wife he thought he was going to faint. He did and she got on his lap immediately so he wouldn&#39;t fall. She was tapping his face and talking to him. Others in the waiting room were helping. He punched his wife in the stomach (she is pregnant) but she seemed to be ok as she was trying to get him back to normal. I called 911 and  manager gave him water and ice. The paramedics came and checked him out to make sure he was ok. He was very alert by the time they got here and then they left. He continued to sit for awhile and I asked if his wife would be driving. She said yes. I told him if they needed anything to call us.d

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

In addition, I developed a rash on my arm and was bedridden. I took a small walk that day and proceeded to swell up on the left side of my body but it subsided within a few hours. The next day, I suffered a stroke due to blot clotting and the clot flowing to my brain. I had to go to the hospital and was there for a few days.

                                                Maybe 1 minute after receiving the vaccine I began to have a syncopal episode, the nurse practitioner thought that since I was heavy I began to have a vasovagal reaction.  From there they asked me to sit with the others waiting 15 minutes to make sure they were ok to leave. As I sat the symptoms would come and go, as if in a pattern, and then return.  The longer I sat there the more the symptoms began to grow, after sitting for an hour they decided to send me to the ER. At this time I was experiencing nausea, vomiting, sweating, I was itchy, I could not stop coughing, it was difficult to breath, and I had the worse headache.  When I got to the ER they gave me drugs to reverse the allergic reaction and told me they would watch me for a while. In the next 4 hours all of the symptoms started again and I had to get another round of the reaction drugs, I ended up going through this process 4 times before I was safe enough to go home the next day.  The provider that saw me and admitted me did not do any blood work or labs, they simply provided me with the reaction drugs when needed and my home medications.

                                                Felt fine until about nine hours after the shot. Had been sitting at computer for at least six hours straight (and probably smoking more pot than I should have), felt dizzy and short of breath, got up, ended up losing consciousness on the living room floor. Woke up a few minutes later and put myself to bed; felt fatigue, aches, chills, and like I might have been running a mild fever. Slept unusually well; woke up this morning feeling perfectly fine. Not particularly concerned but felt like I should report it.

                                                Patient became very pale and sweaty and was close to passing out.  Patient moved from the bench where he was sitting down to the floor.  I came to check on him and gave him water and orange juice to drink.  I checked his blood pressure twice, approximately 2 minutes apart.  The first blood pressure reading was 73/46mmHg and a heart rate or 46bpm.  The second reading was 110/74mmHg and HR 66bpm.  After the second BP reading, patient stated that he was feeling better.  This was just likely vasovagal syncope.   Patient remained on the floor because it was a cooler location for approximately 15 minutes and was feeling better and went home with his father-in-law and mother-in-law.

He called his mother and told her that he was sick to his stomach with cramps and that he was throwing up blood.  The girlfriend found him on the floor on the 21st dead on the floor in his hotel room at 8:00 AM.  The girlfriend said she had spoken with him around 10:00 PM and that he said he was going to sleep on the floor in the bathroom as he was throwing up and the floor was cool.  She subsequently found out that he was throwing up blood, and autopsy report showed that his stomach was full of blood and further testing is being done to see what has caused the bleeding.

                                                grand mal seizure; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand mal seizure) in a 36-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 022M20A and 017B21A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Grand mal seizure since an unknown date. Concurrent medical conditions included Mental disability (Mentally handicapped). Concomitant products included PRIMIDONE (MYSOLINE) and LEVETIRACETAM (KEPPRA) for an unknown indication.   On 25-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 25-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 26-Mar-2021, the patient experienced GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand mal seizure) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand mal seizure) had resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information included midazolam and diazepam for seizures.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

                                                patient received his first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. After receiving in our immunization room, he left the room and then shortly walked over to the pharmacy in-window and told the pharmacy tech that he did not feel well and felt dizzy. Tech had him go sit down in the waiting room and went and got the nurse, who went out to check on patient. Patient was slumped in the waiting room chair with eyes closed and very sweaty. Patient said he wanted water, so staff quickly got him water. After a few sips, patient&#39;s head rolled back and he lost consciousness for roughly 10 seconds before waking up startled and confused. Ambulance was already called and when the arrived they triaged the patient for around 15 minutes. After about 15 minutes the patient seemed much better and the paramedics decided it was OK for him to leave and drive himself home.

He refused further treatment stating that he feels fine now and that this has happened before.

A shopper alerted our staff and when I came to check on him, he was just rousing but had his eyes closed due to blurred vision. He was able to speak and look directly at me. He said this reaction had never happened to him before. He seemed jittery probably due to the reaction. Asked for water and was able to drink. He said that he most likely hit his head and compressed his finger during the fall but feels okay. We are not sure how long he was out for.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) in a 37-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 045A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).    On 19-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 21-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and THYROID HORMONES DECREASED (Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) and THYROID HORMONES DECREASED (Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 21-Mar-2021, Blood thyroid stimulating hormone: low (Low) Low. On 21-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation (abnormal) Atrial fibrillation. On 21-Mar-2021, Stress echocardiogram: atrial fibrillation (abnormal) Atrial fibrillation.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications were not provided. The patient was in emergency room for few hours and was given 3 doses of apixaban (Eliquis) for treatment for the events. The patient was on holter monitor for 3 days.  The patient reported, his thyroid level comes near normal after one and half weeks.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. He is pilot and kept off the duty for Atrial fibrillation.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Felt completely normal at time of injection, and for several hours afterward. Began feeling pain and soreness at injection site around 11PM. Felt overall coldness and increased soreness at injection site when retiring to bed at 11:30PM. Experienced extremely vivid dreams prior to awaking at ~4AM with the need to urinate. Felt extremely hot, and somewhat concerning shortness of breath. Sat up in bed for 45-60 seconds prior to standing vertical. Felt normal when walking to bathroom and while urinating, no straining or abnormal effort required. Upon nearing completion of emptying bladder, ears began increasing intensity of ringing, followed immediately by cascading sensation of weakness. Realizing I was probably rapidly losing consciousness, I grabbed sink for support, in order to get as close to the ground as possible. Regained consciousness an unknown period of time later, though believed I was in bed. Upon noticing how cold my &#34;bedsheets&#34; were, I realized/remembered that I had lost consciousness. Felt completely weak and rested on floor for 30(?) minutes; attempts to move to a more veertical position were met with vague sensations of nausea. Eventually felt strong enough to drag myself to a nearby couch, where I slept on and off until 11:30AM, and gradually woke up to eat breakfast. I have experienced 1-2 episodes of syncope in my lifetime, and this instance aligns with how I felt at those times. Have never experienced micturition syncope at any point before, though.

                                                I had a headache and fatigue starting about 5 to 6 hours after shot.  After going to sleep at 10 am, I woke up not feeling well at 2am...after going to the bathroom and walking towards my bed I passed out.  My wife found me on the floor a few seconds later confused and covered in sweat..my headache was much worse..  I went back to sleep and in the morning still had a headache as well as muscle aches and pains.      \

                                                About one hour after shot, I fainted while going up stairs to go to work. I woke up on stairs. No head injury. This was around 1200pm on 12 JAN. I began to feel ill. Arm hurt, headache, weight on chest. Body hurt. I went to bed early. I woke up on 13 JAN and felt worse. I stayed in bed until around 1300. I got up and went and sat in my office to work. At around 1700, I went to go get my children from a neighbors yard to bring them for supper. I made it to my back yard before feeling to tired to continue. I went inside and laid down. At around 1900 or 1930, I was putting my kids to bed. I then fainted once more. I don&#39;t know how long I was out each time. I don&#39;t think I hit anything with my head. I got up and went to my bed and texted a Doc.

Reports that after 5-10 min his symptoms improved/resolved, and he has felt fine since. States he is feeling great today.  He was advised by PCP NOT to get the second dose of the vaccine, and if he would like a second opinion, will need to be referred to an allergist. Patient declined referral, leaning towards not getting the second dose.

                                                Nurse/doctor hit blood vessel during vaccine injection. I bled afterwards but did not feel it.  Immediately that evening I began to feel symptoms of fatigue. This grew into an overall feeling of sickness and 3 days later, I had major brain fog. This then developed into high anxiety.  However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.

                                                Severe middle back pain beginning February 21. Initially thought it was a kidney stone, but a visit to a urologist on February 25, determined it wasn&#39;t a kidney stone. The urologist ordered some blood work and that indicated that I most likely had blood clots. Went to the ER on the 25th and had further tests that determined that I indeed did have blood clots in my lungs.

There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal. A check for blockage of the heart, also had looked fine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Tachycardia, Heart rate increased, and Dyspnoea was unknown.  The outcome of the event Anaphylactic reaction, Hypoaesthesia, Eye swelling, Hypoaesthesia oral, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Hypoaesthesia oral, Oropharyngeal discomfort, Blood pressure increased, Somnolence, Pruritus, Tachycardia, Heart rate increased, Dyspnoea, and the patient&#39;s O2 sat would drop as well, O2 levels were reported to be 88% was considered to be unknown at the time of this report.  The treatment medications diphenhydramine, EpiPen injection x 2,  and Methylprednisolone steroid injection x 2 was reported to be taken by the patient.  The events Anaphylactic reaction, Anaphylactic reaction/Anaphylaxis, Hypoaesthesia/Numbness, Eye swelling/Swollen eyes, Hypoaesthesia oral/ Numbness of tongue, Hypoaesthesia oral/ Numbness of lips, Oropharyngeal discomfort/ Closing of throat, Blood pressure increased/Extremely high blood pressure 180/111mmHg, Pruritus/ Extreme itchiness were considered meet seriousness criteria of hospitalization,  life threatening, and medically important..  The events Somnolence/Sleepiness, Pruritus/ Extreme itchiness, Heart rate increased / 35bmp resting heart rate, Dyspnoea/Shortness of Breath, and Tachycardia /Tachycardia were considered medically important.  The causality per reporter was not provided.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 39 Y/O M hospitalized with a serious expected anaphylactic reaction and unexpected BP increased, oropharyngeal discomfort, eye swelling, hypoaesthesia, pruritus, and NS unexpected somnolence, tachycardia, heart rate increased, and dyspnea with O2 saturation decreased. Event onset 3 minutes after first dose mRNA-1273. Based on current available information and temporal association between use of the product and start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded
