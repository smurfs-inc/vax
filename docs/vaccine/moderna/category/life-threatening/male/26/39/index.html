Symptoms have resolved and RN reports that the patient has had no recurrent symptoms or seizures while in the emergency department.

                                                Patient noted on form that he had a severe reaction to peanuts which causes him to have anaphylaxis.  He stated that he does carry an EpiPen and any time anything with peanuts touches his mouth/lips he immediately notices his throat starting to close.  He also is allergic to cats.  Before administering the vaccine, the patient noted that he does not like needles and was not going to look.  I administered the vaccine and the patient and I exited the vaccination room.  I explained that he should sit in the waiting area for about 30 minutes due to his severe allergic reaction in the past.  By the time that I walked back into the pharmacy, the patient&#39;s wife shouted &#34;He&#39;s not breathing!&#34;.  My technicians called 911 while I grabbed an EpiPen and rushed to the patient.  I immediately administered a 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine and observed that the patient had passed out, was not breathing, but had a pulse.  A few seconds later he regained consciousness and his breathing was erratic.  I gave him water and he stated that he felt very lightheaded and dizzy.  I instructed him to remain seated.  He also noted that his vision was blurry and he saw a black dot.  His wife was fanning him to cool him down while I tried to obtain the patient&#39;s blood pressure, but could not get a reading.  The paramedics came and evaluated him thoroughly.  His blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, and blood sugar were all within normal limits.  They determined that the syncope was most likely due to the patient not eating during the day and not liking needles.  The patient was feeling much better and declined further medical treatment, including going to the hospital.  He was instructed to go home and relax.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient  is a 29 y.o.  with a history that includes # Asthma # Diabetes, recently diagnosed # Obstructive sleep apnea # Remote pulmonary embolism, no longer on anticoagulation who presented to the ED with worsening shortness of breath in the setting of known COVID-19, since admitted to Hospital for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 viral pneumonia. History herein is derived from patient interview and review of the electronic medical record. patient developed fever, cough, and shortness of breath approximately one week ago. These symptoms developed very shortly after he received his first dose of the Moderna vaccine. He initially attributed these symptoms to side effects of the vaccine. When they persisted, however, he called his primary care physician who recommended that he seek evaluation. He was evaluated at an urgent care on 3/30 where he tested positive for COVID-19. His shortness of breath progressed, and he presented to the ED on 3/31 for evaluation. CTPE was negative for PE but did demonstrate viral pneumonia. Ambulatory pulse oximetry was negative for desaturation. He was discharged home. Since discharge, his symptoms have continued to progress. He was planned to receive monoclonal antibody earlier today, 4/2, however when he presented for his infusion he was found to be hypoxic to 89% and tachycardic to 130s. He was sent to the ED for evaluation. He continues to have diaphoresis and chills although believes his fever has improved. He has some chest tightness with deep inspiration. He otherwise denies unusual headache, sore throat, productive cough, chest pressure, abdominal pain, flank pain, dysuria, and diarrhea. He reports that his PE was provoked by obesity and a lengthy plane flight in 2017. He was on anticoagulation for 8 months and has since been off.  On arrival to ED, VS AF, HR 122, RR 30s, BP 120/90, SpO2 97% on RA. He was in significant respiratory distress and was therefore placed on HHFNC with improvement. VBG 7.42/39 and lactate 3.9. CMP w/ AST 40, ALT 40, AG 15. Serum creatinine elevated at 1.13 from baseline 1.0. CBC w/ WBC 5.6, HGB 17.7, PLT 257. HS troponin 10 -&gt; 8. Given his hypoxemia and history of pulmonary embolism, CTPE was performed and negative for PE however did demonstrate bilateral consolidations consistent with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Procalcitonin was negative. He was given dexamethasone. He was also given 500 mL LR with clearance of lactate. He was admitted to Hospital in stable condition.

                                                The patient presented to his PCP&#39;s office with a 2 day history of chest pain associated with deep inhalation NOT relieved by heat or Tylenol. He was vaccinated with the Moderna COVID vaccine on May 5th which caused fevers and sore throat that resolved. His pleuritic left sided chest pain began 11 days from vaccination. Given the symptoms, the PCP ordered a CXR and d-dimer. Because of the elevated d-dimer and tachycardia while in the office, she ordered a CT chest for PE protocol. This showed bilateral pulmonary emboli so the patient was directed to the ER. He was admitted and started on anticoagulation therapy. Given the CT chest findings of adenopathy, Hemotalogy-Oncology service was consulted and ordered labs.

First family member diagnosed with COVID-19 on 12/21 2020,  the other 3 family members diagnosed with symptomatic mild COVID on 12/26/2020. Parents are healthcare providers and used specific informed diligent protective strategies to prevent infection in patient with minimal close contact and gloves, masks. Patient never had symptoms and was not tested for COVID.. Had first vaccine dose on 1/16. On 1/17 had shaking chills with temp to 101.3F, gone on 1/18.. No other overt reactions. Subsequently in usual state of health.  On 2/15 he developed vomiting and fever with progressive abdominal pain and transient wheezing.  Outpatient testing for SARS-CoV2 was negative and full respiratory pathogen panel (including SARS-CoV2) also negative. With worsening fever to 40.2C and abdominal pain, was admitted on  2/18.  Found to have high leukocyte count, low lymphocyte count and transaminitis.  CT imaging with terminal ileitis, thought possibly infectious but extended GI pathogen panel negative. Experienced persisting daily high grade fevers to up to 39.1.C. Developed transaminitis and  hypotension and was transferred to intensive care unit on 2/21. Was intubated for hypoxia, agitation, required levophed, large volume resuscitation and empiric antimicrobials. Had transient AKI. Antimicrobials stopped on 2/22  with negative cultures. Colonoscopy performed with leal biopsy of identified ulcerative disease with focal active enteritis without specific etiology identified by stains.  Ferritin rose to 24,000 with hypertriglyceridemia and  thought to have possible HLH and underwent bone marrow biopsy which showed leukocytosis and lymphopenia, and rare hemophagocytosis.  Dobutamine was started for low LVEF and levophed weaned. High dose dexamethasone started on 2/23 and pressor further reduced, dobutamine weaned to off on 2/25. Extubated on 2/24.  Febrile still to 39 on 2/24 and with leukocytosis but transaminases, ferritin and triglycerides improving. Discussion ongoing about HLH vs macrophage activation syndrome. Currently meets 4 criteria for HLH with soluble IL-2R and NK activity pending.

Symptoms mostly subsided on 4/9, so I returned to work at 3:00 pm. By about 5:00 pm, the crest pain returned and worsened until I went home, and then to the hospital around 7:00 pm. Tests were done before I was diagnosed with &#34;acute myocarditis, elevated troponin level, coagulopathy, NSTEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction)&#34;, told I likely had a heart attack, and was put on a Heparin drip and kept for additional testing and observation until 4/11/21 at approximately 5:00 pm.

Vet reports she had always had random spotting between periods, that was light and not every cycle. Vet reports that she would sometimes keep the nuvaring in for 4 weeks to skip periods, sometimes. She was advised she May replace immediately with new ring after 21 days, to skip period for up to 3-4 months at a time, but she will have increased spotting risk when attempting to skip periods. Vet wants to continue the Nuva ring. Vet agrees to vaginal ultrasound and will report any problems with ongoing bleeding, or if she had pain, so that gyn referral could be placed.

Sunday morning (6:00 am) presented with chest pain for about ten minutes that subsided. Sunday night/ Monday morning at approximately midnight (12:00 am) presented again with chest pain that continued as we sought medical attention from local fire department, to which an ambulance was called, meds were given and diagnosis was heart attack from labs drawn at hospital. Took him back for a heart cath and there was no blockage. From everything I was told they couldn&#39;t figure out what caused the chest pain.  He spent 2 days in CCU. He discharged Wednesday the 12th of May. He is now on Plavix, Coreg, a low dose aspirin, and Atorvastatin.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.    Co-suspect product included non-company product ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) solution for injection for Crohn&#39;s disease.    Concurrent medical conditions included Crohn&#39;s disease (moderate to severe).   On 14-Oct-2020, the patient started ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA) (Subcutaneous) dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand maul seizure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (vision changes) and NECK PAIN (Feelings of pressure at the back of his neck radiating to right side of his head). At the time of the report, GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand maul seizure) had resolved and VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (vision changes) and NECK PAIN (Feelings of pressure at the back of his neck radiating to right side of his head) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient had a seizure three days after his first Moderna Covid vaccine and was hospitalized.  CT scan was negative.  The reporter&#39;s causality for co-suspect drug, adalimumab, was not provided.  Concomitant product use was not provided. No treatment information was provided.  This case concerns an adult male, with PMH of Crohn&#39;s disease, hospitalized with a serious unexpected event of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (grand mal seizure), and nonserious unexpected visual impairment and neck pain. Event onset with unknown latency after first dose mRNA-1273. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an adult male, with PMH of Crohn&#39;s disease, hospitalized with a serious unexpected event of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (grand mal seizure), and nonserious unexpected visual impairment and neck pain.

                                                Pt. was very sick the day after the shot, then Friday morning his heart was going into atrial fibrillation and jumping between 110 heart rate and 160&#43;. He was out golfing when he noticed this. He rested later that day but was extremely tired and felt sick. Saturday morning (2.5 days after vaccine) he needed to go to the emergency room because his heart rate was back over 160. The EKG showed sinus tachycardia and gave him a message for it but it made it worse and the rate was over 200. They had to stop and start his heart then put on beta blocker which brought it to 180, then another beta blocker brought to 150. Following EKGs showed atrial fibrillation, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and super ventricular tachycardia. Pt. had this about a year ago but was fine after a few days. This was the first time he was hospitalized for it and is now on daily medications. He fears the Moderna vaccine triggered it and is very worried about the second dose.

                                                I woke up the morning after my second dose experiencing  the common symptoms related to the vaccine -- persistent headache, body ache, fever, cold shivers, and fatigue. These symptoms lasted for approximately 24 hours, and I continued to have a headache for a total of approximately 48 hours.   However, I then developed pain in my left calf approximately 10 days after the second dose and on three consecutive evenings at approximately 9pm I developed an all-body itchy rash (big red raised welts) that would disappear by the time I woke up the next morning. The rash only occurred on these three evenings, but the pain in my calf persisted. I went to see my primary care doctor the following Monday (05/17/21) who gave me a referral for an ultrasound to rule out a DVT, although he said that it was not urgent that I go as I didn&#39;t have the other regular symptoms of a DVT (swelling, redness, warm to the touch) and I was too young and healthy to be at risk for one. My doctor said that if the pain didn&#39;t subside by the end of the week I should go for the ultrasound. The pain got worse and so I went for an ultrasound on Saturday (05/22/2021). I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH A BLOOD CLOT (DVT), and sent to the emergency department.

They gave him a choice of hospital or going home. He chose home. About 20 minutes later he had the chills and developed a headache. He then developed diarrhea.  He went to bed. When he woke up in the middle of the night he felt like he went into a GrandMal seizure. He had memory loss and confusion. He could not get up. His entire body was hurting. He went to the hospital. They gave him anti-nausea medicine. Put him on an IV (UNKNOWN NAME).  They prescribed him on a medicine for cluster headaches (can not remember name). Gave him 2 or different meds for his migraines. Dr. said he would call him in a week. The hospital gave him Ondansetron 8mg as needed.

Was discharged and told to continue medication. The next day (Saturday) I woke with a swollen penis and went back to the ER where I was given a steroid shot and told to ice and watch for any additional swelling. Fever has stayed down but have had aches and pains throughout the day

                                                The patient received his 2nd dose of Moderna (LOT#, site, time unavailable) at an outside clinic the morning of 2/10/21 and presented to the ED with coughing and hypoxia (sp02 occasionally dropping into 70&#39;s) at 8 PM that day.  He had quadriplegic spinal paralysis as a result of a remote MVA and has been hospitalized and critically ill in the past due to recurrent UTI&#39;s and pneumonia with associated sepsis.   CT negative for pulmonary embolism and showed bilateral infiltrates.  Clinical presentation consistent with bilateral pneumonia and started on Rocephin/azithromycin.  He was initially stable in the hospital on 1-2 LPM 02.  The following evening he became febrile and acutely developed asystole without any pre-existing arrhythmia.  Resuscitation was attempted for 45 minutes but unsuccessful.  Overall, I suspect his death was related to bacterial pneumonia and resulting acute respiratory failure, complicated by his quadriplegia and autonomic dysreflexia but reported this event as it did occur within 2 days of receiving his 2nd Moderna vaccination.

                                                34 YO male patient with no past medical history presents with sudden stroke-like symptoms including right sided arm and leg weakness, numbness, slurred speech and facial droop.  Symptoms lasted for roughly 45 minutes.  Suspected CVA.  MRI done in hospital was found to be consistent with microinfarcts in the left hemisphere of the brain, mostly along the cortical ribbon with a single lesion in the left parasagittal/lateral pons.  Full neuro and cardio workup is currently being done. ECHO w/ bubble study was weakly positive and plans are for TEE today.  Otherwise, no exact cause identified and few risk factors. Found out that the patent was taking no medications prior and had no past medical history and was otherwise a 34 YO healthy male, who received their first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 4/22.  3 days later the patient had this event.  The timing of everything makes me report this as the potential is there that this is a  vaccine ADE and plausible reason for this thrombotic event.

He was found to have an inferior STEMI with a thrombotic lesion in the proximal circumflex artery that was stented. He was also found to have a chronic right gastrocnemius deep vein thrombosis on a lower extremity ultrasound on 5/3/21. He is currently undergoing a hypercoagulable workup. There is potential concern that the thromboses may have been related to his COVID vaccine, as he received the second dose on 4/25/21.

                                                Pt was admitted for hemoptysis and a PE 6 days following the event. The PE was in the lung previously damaged by the tumor. The PE was small, the hemoptysis is due to likely a small arterial bleed. He&#39;s been bronched twice and as of 5/10 continues to bleed. The PE is small but we are unable ot anticoagulate due to ongoing hemoptysis. The CT shows ground glass opacities/bronchiectasis in the area where there is bleeding. It&#39;s mostly likely this is due to previous tumor resection and damage from his surgery and XRT and shrunken lung. However, the PE and hemoptysis DID occur within a week of the second covid vaccine so we felt it necessary to report. Pt has no history of DVT/PE. His LE u/s for DVT were negative.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Bronchoscopy (left lung filled with blood). Concomitant products included COLECALCIFEROL (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) for an unknown indication.   On 31-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 28-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 03-May-2021, the patient experienced HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). an unknown date, the patient experienced HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days). The patient was hospitalized on 03-May-2021 due to PULMONARY THROMBOSIS. The patient was treated with HEPARIN (intravenous) on 04-May-2021 for Clot blood, at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, HAEMOPTYSIS (coughing blood) and PULMONARY THROMBOSIS (blood clot in left lung, left lung filled with blood) had not resolved, CHEST DISCOMFORT (tightness of chest) and NIGHT SWEATS (night sweats) outcome was unknown and HEADACHE (slight headache for 2 days) had resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   They did some tests and found there was blood clot in his left lung and put him on blood thinner but he reported that the blood thinner made his bleeding more worse. The patient still in hospital and currently in ICU and the Doctors are unable to determine where the blood is coming from and unable to remove the clot. And he is still suffering with blood cough.

                                                After patient received his shot, while sitting during the 15 min waiting period. The patient began getting lightheaded and hot, his color went out of him and his eyes began rolling back in his head.  His eyelids turned a purple color and he appeared to momentarily stop breathing.  Myself and another pharmacist got him on the ground and supported his head with a coat.  When he &#34;came to&#34; and was talking to us.  He described feeling better on the cold floor and his color began coming back.   I was speaking with him the entire time.  While we were out with his 9-1-1 was called and paramedics arrived 15 min later.  by the time paramedics had arrived the patient had gotten up and back into the chair himself, was lucid and had color back in his face.  Paramedics arrived and took over.  He was given the green light from them and remained in the pharmacy area for a total of about 30 minutes before heading home. The patient was admittedly nervous for the shot and had not eaten or had anything to drink the whole day to that point. I believe he passed out from a variety of factors not related to the actual ingredients in the vaccine but cannot confirm this.

                                                On Sat, May 8th around 4:30 PM, while sitting and watching TV, I felt a numbing shock to the left side of my body (particularly left cheek, my entire left arm, and legs) and got up to check myself in the mirror. I got chills and my teeth began chattering, but my arm in particular felt like it was on fire. I thought I was having a stroke so I managed to drive myself to the ER where I was admitted. When the doctors performed the initial tests on me, my skin felt dull on my left side but my arm felt a burning-numbness to it. The doctors performed two MRIs, a CT scan, an Echo Cardiogram, Blood Tests, Blood Pressure readings, and a Covid-19 test and found no problems in my brain or heart, no Covid infection, and a healthy cardiovascular system. I was released May 10th with the diagnosis of a Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) of unknown cause. When I woke up today on 5/11, the burning-numbing sensation returned to my arm again (even as I type this) but this time I know it is not a stroke. I have had no medical history, exercise regularly, have a healthy diet (vegetarian/vegan for more than seven years), the only thing I&#39;ve done recently is had my first Moderna shot injected intramuscularly in my left arm, the same arm where this burning-numbness is taking place. I thought it is best proactive to report this event and if there is any correlation to the vaccine

At 5:30PM, I took medicine for gas.  By 6:30PM, the pain was worse so I went to UC and after a check up, I was sent to the ED for a CT scan and they found an inflamed appendix. I had surgery to have it removed. After surgery, I developed asthmatic pneumonia which led to a 7 day hospitalization.

                                                This morning I gave a patient a moderna vaccine. During administration the patient expressed his fear of needles. After the vaccine I asked the patient to have a seat and wait in the waiting area for 15 minutes. He went and sat down for just a couple minutes and stood up to look for his spouse and when he stood up he passed out and hit the floor face first. I ran out there to check on him and he was unresponsive and bleeding a lot. My team immediately called 911. I started tapping him and slightly shaking him and after a few minutes he woke up. He told me the only thing he remembers is feeling dizzy then woke up on the floor. EMS showed up a few minutes later and took the patient to the hospital.

                                                Within five minutes of the vaccination, the patient expressed distress.  Patient was slumped over in his seat, extremely labored breathing and his eyes were rolling to the back of his head.  The Pharmacist spoke to the patient to see how he was feeling but he wasn&#39;t very responsive so we administered an Epipen and immediaetly called 911.  The paramedics came at around 6:20pm and checked the patients vitals. EMT said the patients vitals were normal and have the patient the option to go to the ER.  Patient was alert and able to drink water.   Patient refused hospitalization.  We advised the patient to go directly to the emergency room if he was developing any symptoms once home and to follow up with his primary care provider.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) in a 37-year-old male patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 045A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No reported medical history).    On 19-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 21-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and THYROID HORMONES DECREASED (Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down). At the time of the report, ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (Atrial fibrillation) and THYROID HORMONES DECREASED (Thyroid hormone (TSH) goes down) outcome was unknown. Not Provided    DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 21-Mar-2021, Blood thyroid stimulating hormone: low (Low) Low. On 21-Mar-2021, Electrocardiogram: atrial fibrillation (abnormal) Atrial fibrillation. On 21-Mar-2021, Stress echocardiogram: atrial fibrillation (abnormal) Atrial fibrillation.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Concomitant medications were not provided. The patient was in emergency room for few hours and was given 3 doses of apixaban (Eliquis) for treatment for the events. The patient was on holter monitor for 3 days.  The patient reported, his thyroid level comes near normal after one and half weeks.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. He is pilot and kept off the duty for Atrial fibrillation.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Nurse/doctor hit blood vessel during vaccine injection. I bled afterwards but did not feel it.  Immediately that evening I began to feel symptoms of fatigue. This grew into an overall feeling of sickness and 3 days later, I had major brain fog. This then developed into high anxiety.  However after about day 6 I felt normal again. Then 20 days later, I am feeling the same symptoms again. My armpit is swollen and having brain fog and anxiety.

                                                Severe middle back pain beginning February 21. Initially thought it was a kidney stone, but a visit to a urologist on February 25, determined it wasn&#39;t a kidney stone. The urologist ordered some blood work and that indicated that I most likely had blood clots. Went to the ER on the 25th and had further tests that determined that I indeed did have blood clots in my lungs.

Then this past Monday (15 Mar 2021), patient started developing shortness of breath and a resting heart rate of 135bmp. That day, the patient was taken to urgent care.  There he was administered diphenhydramine and the patient&#39;s heart was checked. Urgent care agreed that his heart was acting up and his blood pressure was acting up for an unknown reason. Reporter states that the patient had been developing tachycardia for no reason for a week now. Since the tachycardia had occurred, reporter would check patient&#39;s oxygen (O2) levels. When the tachycardia had started, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation (O2 sat ) would drop as well. O2 levels were reported to be 88% and resting heart rate of 103bmp. The reporter would let 5 minutes pass, recheck, and everything would return to normal. On Monday (22 Mar 2021), patient is scheduled to see a cardiologist who will place the patient on a machine to check his heart rate for 3 days to see what is going on. Follow-up with various health care providers was scheduled for the rest of the week. Nephrologist will be seen on Monday, Neurologist will be seen on Tuesday, and Kaiser will be visited on Wednesday. Reporter stated that even though asked to run bloodwork and images, the emergency room did not do it.  Lab work was performed on Monday (15 Mar 021) which came back normal.

                                                1 week after the second dose, I was exercising in the early morning when suddenly my vision and hand-eye coordination were flashing, my hand appeared in a different position than where I thought it was. I tried to tell my sons to get help, but I couldn&#39;t say any words, just some repetitive mumbling. I was able to walk upstairs but couldn&#39;t speak for about 10 mins, and then everything was coming out slowly. It was about an hour before I could resume normal talking. I went to the hospital, where they gave me a CT scan, MRI, heart echo, and eventually a TEE. They said that I had a Transient Ischemic Attack, and they found a PFO in my heart that probably allowed a blood clot to travel to my brain.  They also did an ultrasound of my legs when I mentioned the timing of the vaccine, to make sure there were no other clots. I am taking baby asprin and crestor, and have an heart event monitor now for 30 days. I am also scheduled for more bloodwork and a pelvic scan. They say it is likely that they will want to close my PFO, but want to see all the test results first to rule out any other possible causes.

                                                Patient has no clotting history. He developed body aches, left arm pain, and fevers immediately after immunization, but improved. Two days later on 6/2, he developed left flank pain and fevers.  On 6/4, he was evaluated in the ED, with CT scan showing partially occlusive thrombosis of left renal artery with areas of renal infarction. Cr remained stably at baseline. Initial workup was otherwise notable for WBC 17 and negative infectious workup. He was initiated on therapeutic Lovenox.  On 6/5, CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis was performed to evaluate for other clots. Left renal artery was complete thromboses with evolving foci of renal infarction. No other clots were detected. He continued to have fevers. By 6/8, his leukocytosis, fever, and flank pain resolved.  Renal ultrasound with doppler showed restoration of some flow in the left renal artery. He is to be discharged 6/9 on Lovenox 1mg/kg BID without patient Hematology follow-up.  His coagulability workup was notable for positive LAC, FVII deficiency, and PET/CT without evidence of occult malignancy.
