The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included coronary artery disease.  Concomitant medications included carvedilol.  On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Dec 2020, the patient experienced chest pain that got worse when he took a deep breath.  He also felt warm, and his temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The patient visited the emergency room where an electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal and his COVID-19 test were negative.  Because of his history of coronary artery disease, he stayed in the hospital overnight.  On 01 Jan 2021, the hospital cardiologist called it a reaction the vaccine, and he was discharged.  On 05 Jan 2021, on a follow-up visit with another cardiologist, another EKG was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.  The cardiologist increased his carvedilol dose to 6.25 milligram from 3.125 milligram and added apixaban, 5 milligram, twice daily.  At the time of the report, he felt fine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, chest pain and fever, was considered recovered/resolved on 01 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76-year-old male patient with medical history of coronary artery disease, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation and the non-serious listed event of fever.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. However, the events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation may be explained by the patient&#39;s history of coronary artery disease.

Nurses at the facility reported that he was responsive and showed no signs of any adverse effects until 1/2/2021 when he was observed slightly unresponsive and staring at the ceiling and trembling. He had a fever of 101F at this time. The facility ordered labs and a rapid COVID test (all of which came back normal) and started IV antibiotics. A few hours later, patient began bleeding from his eyes, nose, and mouth and was sent to the local ER. The patient refused being admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis/hemorrhage and died the following day on 1/3/2021. All healthcare professionals involved agreed that this was not likely due to the vaccine, but needed to be reported nonetheless.

He was scheduled to receive 2nd dose on March 11 and I was concerned about having a cough at the time of 2nd vaccine.  He went to walk-in clinic and got a covid test was negative, he said his exam was normal, they gave him prescription of Benzonatate 100mg he took one and it did not help so he never took any more.  On March 5 while working in the yard he collapsed, paramedics arrived and he was in cardiac arrest, they started CPR,  they used AED was in vfib, he was taken to Hospital then transferred to second hospital.  I was told he had blood clots in both lungs, one in his leg, and possible clots in the mesenteric area of abdomen.  His heart stopped due to the blood clots in his lungs.   He remains in the hospital in the Intermediate Coronary Care Unit.  He has not yet gained full consciousness.

                                                cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient received dose 2 series of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. First dose was received on 1/17/21 and second dose received 2/14/21. After both doses patient was observed for 15 minutes and did not have any adverse reaction per administering RN. No data in database or database as to any other adverse events occurring 15 minutes post-vaccination. On 3/20/21, EMS was called to patient&#39;s home who was discovered on the floor with an unknown breathing status and pulse. AED was attached to the patient. A very weak pulse was found and patient had agonal respirations. Cardiac monitor was attached to patient with a HR of 32. 1mg of atropine was administered and patient&#39;s rhythm changed to PEA with no respirations or pulse. Per patient&#39;s wife and son, he was a DNR, therefore all resuscitation attempts were stopped (patient was never admitted to the hospital). Patient was never known to be previously positive to COVID. PMH that may have predisposed patient to this adverse event leading to death include h/o DVT on chronic anticoagulation, COPD, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is insufficient information to determine the exact cause of death or what led to the cardiac arrest given that the time from last vaccination to the adverse event was almost a month apart.

                                                Narrative: Patient with severe aphasia and only able to say &#34;hey, hey, hey&#34; or &#34;uh huh&#34; or shake his head no as a way to communicate. Patient previously able to ambulate with significant limp and hyperextension of right knee, but mostly wheelchair bound over last several years as he had had a slow and steady decline in overall health and mobility. Patient developed aggressive behavior of shouting &#34;hey&#34; and grabbing of groin in 2016. This was worked up with CT scans, labs, referral to urology, neurology, and referrals to psychiatry. The exact etiology of this action was never able to be affirmed, but thought to be more psychiatrically related. It improved significantly with addition of antipsychotics, worsened when antipsychotics were reduced, and improved again with addition of injectable antipsychotic on 12-10-2020.Patient suffered from falls on occasion given his significantly impaired physical mobility. His last documented fall was 8-31-2019. Patient began utilizing wheelchair most of time following that fall. No significant injuries noted in documentation of the falls. In the last 3 months, patient would often refuse medications. He would sometimes indicate that they would cause dizziness, and other times he would simply refuse. We attempted to hide medications in his food/fluid (with wife&#39;s blessing) and when he detected this he would occasionally refuse to eat. Patient previously on DOAC. After pharmacy review in 12/2020 it was recommended to discontinue this as no clear indication to continue use. He was high fall risk and would often refuse this medication as well since 10/2020. Noted to be in NSR on EKGs and decision made to discontinue the DOAC. Patient had no evidence of adverse effects noted after vaccination on December 28th. Patient seen by provider on the morning of his death (1/4/2021) with no noticeable significant change in health condition. Temperature 36.8Con January 4th at 19:45. During routine bedtime cares, patient suddenly collapsed and death was pronounced January 4, 2021 at 20:05. Autopsy was requested from next of kin and no autopsy was granted.

                                                Feeling normal before the vaccine, with exception of slight cough that Dr said was due to allergies. But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

                                                Pneumonia; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 78 years-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and who experienced pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol trifenatate, irbesartan, amlodipine besilate, metoprolol, glipizide, metformin, omeprazole, magnesium, and omega 3.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly on 22 Jan 2021 for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Jan 2021 within a few hours of first dose, the patient developed fever, chills, weakness, and productive cough. On 24 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted to hospital due to oxygen levels in the 60s with productive cough, yellow sputum, and short of breath. He was diagnosed with pneumonia. During hospitalization, the patient had two negative PCR COVID-19 tests.  Treatment information was not provided.  The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the events.  The outcome of event pneumonia  was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s medical history of COPD and pulmonary fibrosis may have been contributory.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included chronic cough, acid reflux, minor allergies, hypercholesterolemia and a penicillin allergy.  Concomitant product use included esomeprazole, atorvastatin, famotidine, cetirizine, Montelukast, Vitamin D, zinc, fiber pills and antacids.   On 10 Feb 2021, several hours prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot #:030M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  After the injection in the evening on 10 Feb 2021, the patient reported experiencing a sore arm. During the night, he became cold, sweaty and achy.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient stated he &#34;felt like crud&#34; and was still achy and his left arm hurt more.  The patient sat down at the table and again became &#34;hot&#34; and &#34;sweaty.&#34; His left hand suddenly started jerking and having spasms, and the patient&#39;s head went back and then forward and he became unresponsive for approximately 2 to 3 minutes. After the episode, he went to a sofa chair and fell asleep for 1 to 1.5 hours.  The patient&#39;s wife called a nurse at the Hospital to report the events, and the nurse suggested to take him to the emergency room (ER) immediately.  At the ER, a series of tests/labs were performed including complete blood count (CBC) differential with platelets, COVID-19 test, cardiac panel-acute, comprehensive metabolic panel, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest x-ray.  All test results were normal.  The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative.  Treatment for the event included IV fluids (sodium chloride IV). The patient was discharged from the ER 2 to 3 hours after treatment with a discharge diagnosis of &#34;vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction.&#34;  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.  The event, vasovagal syncope, post immunization reaction, was considered recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

He denied any symptoms of illness, including COVID-19, on the vaccination date. He was educated re: possible side effects and adverse effects and was asked to report any such effects; no interim contact received.

This provider spoke to the existing client, who reported that the cause of death is unknown.  The existing client did not believe that her spouse&#39;s death and the vaccination were related. She was asked to notify this provider if any further information is discovered and agreed to do so.

Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

On way back to bed he passed out and I tried to help ease him down. Came back almost immediately. Got on hands and knees and crawled to bed. Ran a fever of 100.3 all Wednesday and stayed in bed because of dizziness. By Thursday he was fine again and started doing his normal activities.

He did not have the core strength to even help him sit up. Sometime after he was assisted back on the couch around 4:30 am  he must of got back up and attempted to go to restroom because he was found on the floor with his arm and face resting on the love seat which looked as if he was trying to pull himself up. His wife found him in the morning around 11:00 am and he had been died for some time according to EMS. His death was unexpected. Even when contacting his doctors they were confused as to why he had passed away.  No autopsy was done but as of this moment he has not been cremated yet and is at Funeral Home.

                                                He developed very labored breathing on Tuesday night.  By Wednesday morning , upon waking it was severly worse.  I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

                                                pneumonia Narrative: On 11/9/20, Patient had a presumptive positive COVID (COBAS) screen as part of routine CLC screening and then on 11/13/20, he had a repeat COVID (CEPHID) that was negative. Then on 12/22/20, he received his first COVID vaccine. On 12/26/20, he began to have c/o hurting all over. Noted history of aspiration and COPD. On 12/29/20, he began to have coughing, increased shortness of breath and runny nose with course breath sounds in his bilateral lower lobes. A chest xray was done and he was initiated on oral azithromycin and cefepime for a bilateral pneumonia. On 1/3/21, he continued to decline with increasing shortness of breath and was subsequently transferred to acute care medicine. All COVID tests have been negative since the presumptive positive on 11/9/20. He did have a CTA that ruled out PE but did show bilateral pneumonia. His antibiotics have been changed to meropenem, vancomycin and IV azithromycin. He remains on acute care at time and has not required ICU care.

                                                Client developed a mild covid infection 12/8/21 and recovered. He was admitted 12/25 with hypogycemia and mild weakness and sent home He was given his first dose of the Moderna vaccine 1/4/21 at approximately 9AM covid vaccine clinic He developed weakness the next day  (1/5) prompting admission to a hospital and then transition to subacute rehabilitation briefly  Work up at hospital revealed progressive respiratory failure and pneumonia requiring intubation and progressive ascending weakness and sensory loss without upper motor neuron changes.  MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

We are devastated. The time frame so close to his second moderna shot can not be ignored. We want no one to suffer a loss such as this if the vaccine was a catalyst. Full autopsy is ongoing, no know cause with initial results.

                                                Severe hives accompanied by shivering, significant itching,  three fainting  episodes close together about 8 hours after the onset of the hives and very low blood pressure following the fainting episode.  At home treatment taken on phone advise from Doctorr with Benadryl and Fomantadine with no effect.  Prednisone now prescribed.  Doctor had suggested a visit to ER but this was taken as the patient was more stable at this time.  Potential life threatening event due to the fainiting and low blood pressure/heart rate.  These symptoms have occured on previous occassions  as a result of virus and other infections.

So, patient&#39;s spouse made them down sleep for too long. On Friday, 12 Feb 2021 she tried to pick him up, but he was tired, exhausted, and sick.   On Saturday, 13 Feb 2021, she brought him a coffee and he couldn&#39;t hold it because his hands were shaking, so she gave him the coffee and then made him pee on the bed because he couldn&#39;t get up. At lunch time she made him eat something and he fell sleep again. His wife was hanging around him all day and around 7:30pm she realized that he was cold, and his neck was sweating, she couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat. So, she called emergency services and when they arrived, her husband&#39;s blood pressure went down until he died. Treatment for the events were not provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not applicable.  Patient was pronounced dead on 13 Feb 2021 20:00. The cause of death was not provided. The plans for an autopsy were not provided.  The events of blood pressure went down until he died and couldn&#39;t hear his heartbeat were fatal. The outcome for the remaining events were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns an 81 year old, male patient, who experienced a serious event of death among others, 2 days after receiving mRNA- 1273 (Lot# 007M20A).

                                                Per neurology consult: &#34;Patient was at his baseline until when he received his 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.  He complained of dyspnea and fear of impending doom after waking up the following morning with some disorientation.  He was found to be in AFib with RVR after it was brought to ER  the following morning  and the rhythm was converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient continues to have confusion after admission yesterday that seem to get worse today to the point where he did not know his own name or birthdate, and seemed to have global amnesia.  Patient has been more drowsy this afternoon after receiving lorazepam 1 mg IV for potential seizure activity so no reliable neurologic exam was obtained.  Patient remains afebrile with pulse ox in the low 90s on 4 L of supplemental nasal oxygen in the hospital.  He had moderate decrease in kidney function upon admission that has improved.  He has baseline anemia with hemoglobin at around 10. Incidentally patient had shingles in the right thoracic dermatome week ago for which he received valacyclovir.

                                                My dad got the Moderna Vaccine on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 in his left arm at the Mall injection site for the Health Department. He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

Per documentation by the MD, the patient had COVID19 &#34;several weeks ago&#34; and the nursing facility felt like he had recovered. A rapid test done in the ED was negative. When the patient worsened and seemed to be following the same path as other COVID patients, a send out PCR test was done, which was positive. The patient worsened and passed away that same day (02/05/2021) I was not made aware that the patient had the vaccine on 01/21/2021 until Monday 02/08/2021.

                                                Stroke.  I do not know if the vaccine was related or not, but the patient had a stroke and falls on 2/17/2021 and 2/18/2021 and was found to have two strokes.  He does have atrial fibrillation, but with the proximity to the second vaccine, I cannot tell if they are just related temporally or if there is a true risk.  Another patient at this facility had a stroke within same time frame post second Moderna vaccine, but not my patient, so I do not know if that was reported.  Due to new nature of this vaccine, I felt it important to report this event for further investigation.   Again, I am not sure if it is a true adverse reaction of the vaccine or not.

He came out of the bathroom and proceeded to the living room, she stated dad are you ok?  He said he couldn&#39;t breath.  Giving his history of COPD and being short of breath sometimes, she didn&#39;t think anything of it.   She proceeded to follow him to his chair and was checking his oxygen tank that he had been using with ambulation.   It still had some in the tank.  She raised her head to tell him he still had some in the tank and saw that he had started &#34;agonal breathing&#34;.  Daughter is a nurse and knew he needed help.   She phone for an ambulance and with the help of her mother got patient to the floor and started CPR.   Paramedics arrived on scene, continued CPR and administered meds and also intubated, but were unsuccessful in their efforts.

                                                Admission Note: ? Weakness - Generalized     Patient reports feeling weak prior to dialysis, but demanded clinic to perform dialysis. Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.

                                                My father passed away on February 10th, 2021. On Monday, January 25th 2021, he said he is feeling very uncomfortable in his chest area. He thought it was severe acid reflux. He took Gas X for Acid Reflux and told us that he does not want to go to the hospital. On Tuyesday, January 26th, he felt that his Acid Reflux symptoms got worse, he still did not want to go to the hospital. He took Tums. On that evening, he started having shortness of breath. We took his BP at home and it was very low. We begged him to go to the hospital, he still did not want to go. On Wednesday, January 27th, his shortness of breath got worse and we convinced him that he has to go to the hospital. We took him to ER. Doctor said that he had a heart attack on Monday morning and that is why he was not feeling well since Monday morning. While at the hospital, while the cardiologists were monitoring him, his heart condition got worse.  By Friday, February 5th, cardiologists said that he is very fragile, his heart condition is very fragile and he won&#39;t survive any procedure. They said that something triggered the heart attack. We told them about the vaccination on 1/13/2021. They sent him home on hospice on Friday, Feburary 5th, 2021. He was on supplemental oxygen when he came home. He passed away due to a heart attack on February 10th, 2021 around 9pm.

Instead of him using the rollater to come from his bedroom I got the wheel chair out of the care and got him to the table where I fed him a little breakfast.  His blood pressure was low then high (I don&#39;t now have the readings) By 5 pm I called the ambulance.  He was in the hospital until I transferred him to hospice 6 days later.  He died in hospice 4 days after that.

                                                2 days after receiving the second moderna vaccine my father experienced a stroke. He was transported to the emergency room  medical center where he went thru a procedure to remove a clot in his left side brain. Prior to this vaccine my father was in good health and was very active and still works and owns and operates a restaurant. He has never had any problems like this before the vaccine. One day after the vaccine he was complaining about a pain on the left side of his neck area. He was doing paperwork at approx 7:40pm when he experienced the stroke. I had to call 911.  My father is currently at the medical center recovering from the incident.

                                                after receiving his initial dose the next day he seemed to have suffered a TIA that took almost a week for him to recovery from. He was confused, no appetite, weak, and generally not himself.  Prior to receiving his second dose he was alert, eating, no complaints of any discomfort or issues. The next day following his second dose he passed away from what we think was a massive heart attack.   As a family we feel his weakened state contributed to this and not the fault of the vaccine but felt it important to notify you in case individuals such as patient should be monitored in a different way or use a different vaccine.

The patient&#39;s significant other reported neither of them were feeling well on 2/21/2021.  Approximately 28 hours after vaccination, the patient was found unresponsive in the bathtub.  EMS arrived within 5 minutes, resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, CPR terminated at 1503 and the patient pronounced dead.  The Medical examiner refused the case on the basis of lack of jurisdiction, and the remains were moved to a local funeral home.  No autopsy was performed.  This event is not thought to be related to the vaccination event or the vaccine, the death is thought to be from natural causes.

He started having symptoms a week before with fatigue, emesis, decreased p.o. intake, shortness of breath, vomiting and diarrhea. The two previous takes before death required increasing oxygen and family wanted everything done including intubation. He was transferred to ICU.

She states he was &#34;more fatigued than normal&#34; leading up to this event. Labs were drawn and it yielded throbocytapenia. She states the oncologists states he does not believe it was from the medication but feels it was the vaccine that produced this. The patient is in the hospital receiving blood and platelet transfusions.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not included. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 06 Feb 2021, approximately 10 days after the patient received the vaccine, he experienced a fast heart rate, dizziness, cold body temperature, and atrial fibrillation. (The wife reports that they purchased an EKG machine, and this is what the machine showed them. Unaware if he had this before the vaccine or not.)  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cold body temperature, dizziness and atrial fibrillation, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the event occurred 9 days after vaccine administration and very limited information regarding this patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Further information has been requested.

Daughter was home with pt and after he went to the bathroom she reports pt was out of breath, however that has been chronic/ongoing for him due to his diagnosis of COPD, pulmonary HTN and metastatic lung cancer. After sitting and resting in a chair, she states patient became unresponsive. She called 911 who told her he had no pulse and was not breathing. She states that they were not able to resuscitate him. Pt had been suspected to be positive for COVID as he had symptoms of increased cough, congestion and rhinitis. Daughter (that is primary caregiver and lives in home with patient) tested positive for COVID on 1/31/21. She started having symptoms on 1/25/21. Patient started having symptoms on 1/31/21. No COVID test confirmed prior to pt&#39;s death. Patient had a definitive diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma in October 2020. History of multimorbidity. He did have a 60 pack year history of smoking. Most likely cause of death from available records is metastatic lung cancer, with other serious diagnoses contributing.
