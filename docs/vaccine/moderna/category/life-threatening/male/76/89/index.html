The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included coronary artery disease.  Concomitant medications included carvedilol.  On 30 Dec 2020, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 in the right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 31 Dec 2020, the patient experienced chest pain that got worse when he took a deep breath.  He also felt warm, and his temperature was 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  The patient visited the emergency room where an electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal and his COVID-19 test were negative.  Because of his history of coronary artery disease, he stayed in the hospital overnight.  On 01 Jan 2021, the hospital cardiologist called it a reaction the vaccine, and he was discharged.  On 05 Jan 2021, on a follow-up visit with another cardiologist, another EKG was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.  The cardiologist increased his carvedilol dose to 6.25 milligram from 3.125 milligram and added apixaban, 5 milligram, twice daily.  At the time of the report, he felt fine.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, chest pain and fever, was considered recovered/resolved on 01 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation, was considered recovering/resolving.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 76-year-old male patient with medical history of coronary artery disease, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot unknown), and who experienced the serious unlisted events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation and the non-serious listed event of fever.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine. However, the events of chest pain and atrial fibrillation may be explained by the patient&#39;s history of coronary artery disease.

                                                Patient received Moderna COVID vaccine on 12/30/2020 at a Pharmacy clinic where he was a resident. Nurses at the facility reported that he was responsive and showed no signs of any adverse effects until 1/2/2021 when he was observed slightly unresponsive and staring at the ceiling and trembling. He had a fever of 101F at this time. The facility ordered labs and a rapid COVID test (all of which came back normal) and started IV antibiotics. A few hours later, patient began bleeding from his eyes, nose, and mouth and was sent to the local ER. The patient refused being admitted to the ICU for possible sepsis/hemorrhage and died the following day on 1/3/2021. All healthcare professionals involved agreed that this was not likely due to the vaccine, but needed to be reported nonetheless.

Medical history included being mentally challenged. Concomitant medication included unspecified cholesterol medication, two unspecified blood pressure medications, baby aspirin, vitamin D, and lorazepam.  On 04 Feb 2020, the patient received the first of their first planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 05 Feb 2021, the patient experienced bleeding from a pencil eraser red looking spot on the right ankle, had lost a lot of blood.  The bleeding had stopped and no treatment was reported.  Action taken with the mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event of hemorrhage was considered resolved. The outcome of the event erythema was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient has no history of seizures. It is unclear if this had anything to do with the Moderna vaccine,  but I am reporting it due to the timing of the episode in conjunction with the vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant medications were not reported.   On 15JAN2021, prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received his first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly (Lot number: 026L20A). On 16JAN2021, the patient noted a start date for Pneumonia.  On 10FEB2021, the patient called the medical information call center and reported, &#34;he is on antibiotics for pneumonia. His 2nd question is can he delay the 2nd dose since he is suffering from pneumonia. Patient was administered 1st dose of vaccine on 15/Jan/2021 in his left non dominant arm. The lot# was provided, but expiration date is unknown. Patient experienced some expected side effects, which he is not concerned about&#34;.  The event(s) were arm swollen, tired, achy, lingering shortness of breath, muscle weakness in the injection arm, and tested positive for pneumonia 1 day after receiving the vaccine.  The action taken for Moderna COVID-19 (mRNA-1273) Vaccine was reported by the patient as Tylenol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event(s) was not provided/unknown.  The outcome of the events was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start of the events of fatigue, arm swelling, myalgia, muscle weakness, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on the current available information and the mechanism of action of mRNA-1237 vaccine, the event of Pneumonia is assessed as unlikely related. Further information has been requested.

Patient is consistently in A-Fib post PaceMaker insertion (June 2020). He is paced at 70 bpm when in A-Fib.  His hearth rhythm went into sinus ~2.5 days post vaccine, and has remained so since.  Change is quite unusual and has only occurred once since pacemaker insertion (October 2020) when he had a significant flu/cold event.   More relevant is the increase in systolic blood pressure by over 20 pts.

He was scheduled to receive 2nd dose on March 11 and I was concerned about having a cough at the time of 2nd vaccine.  He went to walk-in clinic and got a covid test was negative, he said his exam was normal, they gave him prescription of Benzonatate 100mg he took one and it did not help so he never took any more.  On March 5 while working in the yard he collapsed, paramedics arrived and he was in cardiac arrest, they started CPR,  they used AED was in vfib, he was taken to Hospital then transferred to second hospital.  I was told he had blood clots in both lungs, one in his leg, and possible clots in the mesenteric area of abdomen.  His heart stopped due to the blood clots in his lungs.   He remains in the hospital in the Intermediate Coronary Care Unit.  He has not yet gained full consciousness.

                                                cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient received dose 2 series of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. First dose was received on 1/17/21 and second dose received 2/14/21. After both doses patient was observed for 15 minutes and did not have any adverse reaction per administering RN. No data in database or database as to any other adverse events occurring 15 minutes post-vaccination. On 3/20/21, EMS was called to patient&#39;s home who was discovered on the floor with an unknown breathing status and pulse. AED was attached to the patient. A very weak pulse was found and patient had agonal respirations. Cardiac monitor was attached to patient with a HR of 32. 1mg of atropine was administered and patient&#39;s rhythm changed to PEA with no respirations or pulse. Per patient&#39;s wife and son, he was a DNR, therefore all resuscitation attempts were stopped (patient was never admitted to the hospital). Patient was never known to be previously positive to COVID. PMH that may have predisposed patient to this adverse event leading to death include h/o DVT on chronic anticoagulation, COPD, and abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is insufficient information to determine the exact cause of death or what led to the cardiac arrest given that the time from last vaccination to the adverse event was almost a month apart.

                                                respiratory and cardiac arrest Narrative:  Patient with PMH of esophageal cancer, larynx cancer, liver cancer, PTSD, A. fib, and alcohol abuse. He received his COVID-19 vaccines on 2/14/21 and 3/14/21. Both vaccines were administered without complications and patient was observed for 15 minutes post-vaccination without adverse effects. No other adverse events noted between time of last COVID-19 vaccinations and death. On 4/11/21, patient&#39;s wife called 911 in which EMS found patient unresponsive with abnormal breathing. Wife reported that patient was breathing up until 5 minutes prior to EMA arrival, but had been unresponsive. Wife reports that patient suffered from multiple forms of cancer, PTSD, and alcohol abuse. Wife believed that patient quit smoking and drinking but the morning of death found vodka and cigarettes in his coat. Wife reports that patient asked for help getting up from the stairs and then laid down in the bed, and went unresponsive afterwards. EMS attempted to revive the patient with CPR but were unsuccessful. Per EMS note patient suffered from respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, then cardiac death. Patient was not brought to the hospital prior to death. It is very unlikely that the COVID-19 vaccinations contributed to this patient&#39;s death due to his extensive PMH with substance use disorder and cancer.

Treatment for the event included paracetamol.  Pneumonia is of an infective origin, hence assessed as not causally associated with mRNA-1273 administration based on the known profile of the product.  However, based on the information provided which includes a temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 vaccine and onset of the other reported events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and chills are consistent with the product known safety profile.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-031492 (Patient Link).   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 29-Apr-2021: Medically confirmed changed.

                                                Narrative: Patient with severe aphasia and only able to say &#34;hey, hey, hey&#34; or &#34;uh huh&#34; or shake his head no as a way to communicate. Patient previously able to ambulate with significant limp and hyperextension of right knee, but mostly wheelchair bound over last several years as he had had a slow and steady decline in overall health and mobility. Patient developed aggressive behavior of shouting &#34;hey&#34; and grabbing of groin in 2016. This was worked up with CT scans, labs, referral to urology, neurology, and referrals to psychiatry. The exact etiology of this action was never able to be affirmed, but thought to be more psychiatrically related. It improved significantly with addition of antipsychotics, worsened when antipsychotics were reduced, and improved again with addition of injectable antipsychotic on 12-10-2020.Patient suffered from falls on occasion given his significantly impaired physical mobility. His last documented fall was 8-31-2019. Patient began utilizing wheelchair most of time following that fall. No significant injuries noted in documentation of the falls. In the last 3 months, patient would often refuse medications. He would sometimes indicate that they would cause dizziness, and other times he would simply refuse. We attempted to hide medications in his food/fluid (with wife&#39;s blessing) and when he detected this he would occasionally refuse to eat. Patient previously on DOAC. After pharmacy review in 12/2020 it was recommended to discontinue this as no clear indication to continue use. He was high fall risk and would often refuse this medication as well since 10/2020. Noted to be in NSR on EKGs and decision made to discontinue the DOAC. Patient had no evidence of adverse effects noted after vaccination on December 28th. Patient seen by provider on the morning of his death (1/4/2021) with no noticeable significant change in health condition. Temperature 36.8Con January 4th at 19:45. During routine bedtime cares, patient suddenly collapsed and death was pronounced January 4, 2021 at 20:05. Autopsy was requested from next of kin and no autopsy was granted.

But then a fever, chills and aches the day after vaccine. Two days after, still febrile and feeling worse and experiencing shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Fatigue, fever and lightheadedness continue for three more days. On the 6th day post-vaccine, taken to ER and admitted to hospital with a pneumonia and blood counts dangerously low. Received 3 blood transfusions and is receiving 2 different IV antibiotics to treat pneumonia. Still in hospital and waiting to see how blood counts go. I can?t say the vaccine CAUSED this, but it all happened rapidly, immediately following the vaccine.

                                                Pneumonia; A spontaneous report was received from a physician concerning a 78 years-old, male patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine and who experienced pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol trifenatate, irbesartan, amlodipine besilate, metoprolol, glipizide, metformin, omeprazole, magnesium, and omega 3.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly on 22 Jan 2021 for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 22 Jan 2021 within a few hours of first dose, the patient developed fever, chills, weakness, and productive cough. On 24 Jan 2021, the patient was admitted to hospital due to oxygen levels in the 60s with productive cough, yellow sputum, and short of breath. He was diagnosed with pneumonia. During hospitalization, the patient had two negative PCR COVID-19 tests.  Treatment information was not provided.  The second dose of mRNA-1273 was discontinued in response to the events.  The outcome of event pneumonia  was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s medical history of COPD and pulmonary fibrosis may have been contributory.

He denied any symptoms of illness, including COVID-19, on the vaccination date. He was educated re: possible side effects and adverse effects and was asked to report any such effects; no interim contact received. This provider&#39;s office called the existing client on 03/15/21 with a routine matter and was advised that this individual had passed away the preceding day. This provider spoke to the existing client, who reported that the cause of death is unknown.  The existing client did not believe that her spouse&#39;s death and the vaccination were related. She was asked to notify this provider if any further information is discovered and agreed to do so.

                                                Not sure if covid vaccine caused this, but this is what happened - Received covid vaccine.  two days later had violent shakes in the night.  Immediately went to get a covid test out of precaution.  Tested negative for covid, but positive for &#34;flu b&#34;.  Went home to treat flu with fluids and rest.  Got no better.  Went to heart doctor out of precaution, full work up...everything checked out great.  Went home, got no better.  Went to primary care physician, full work up...found a &#34;spot&#34; on left lung.  Was given antibiotics and steroids, go home and in a few days will be getting better.  3 days later became incapacitated and had to be rushed to ER.  Was admitted into hospital for 6 days to treat &#34;pneumonia&#34;.  Also possible UTI and sepsis.  Also while in hospital found out that a mini stroke had happened.  Treatment went well, oxygen levels were good.  Was released with glowing reports.  24 hours later at home had to be rushed to ER again after becoming incapacitated..  Was admitted again  7 more days.  During this time everything took a nose dive in succession.  Lungs were failing, multiple unexplained strokes were happening (while on blood thinners, had been on blood thinner 15 years...after first stroke they changed to another blood thinner...only more strokes).  After so many strokes and compounding of strokes, his neuro function started failing.  He was put on life support.  While on life support his organs started failing.  He had to be put on comfort mode and was dead within 8 hours.  A perfectly healthy 77 year old man who had never been sick a day in his life (literally)  got his 2nd covid shot,  two days later he fell ill.  From that point on his health spiraled out of control until his death on March 19th.  Every doctor (pulmonologist, cardiologist, neurologist, and all attending doctors said that it was &#34;atypical and abnormal&#34; what was happening.  It should not have happened.  180 degrees from normal.

He called his doctor and she told him to go to the ER, which he did at  Hospital.  They did a CAT scan of his brain.  They tried to do an MRI and they pushed his head against the machine as his back is curved and he stopped breathing.  They had given him 2 narcotics for anxiety before the scan.   He was then transferred to   Hospital in .  He saw Cardiophysiologist/IM and he found that he had a blood clot (? where), and they inserted a pacemaker through his groin as his pulse dropped to 40 BPM.   He was hospitalized for 7 days, and discharged him with instructions on what he is able to do.  They started him on new blood pressure medicines for his kidney&#39;s.    On 3/26/21, lot# 028A21A.  He subsequently had the 2nd vaccine, and all liquids emptied from his body (vomiting and diarrhea), at the same time, and then he was fine once everything settled down which lasted for about 3-4 minutes and then he was fine.

                                                On Tuesday, February 16, I received my 1st Moderna Covid vaccine. On Tuesday, March 16, I received my 2nd Moderna Covid vaccine at 11AM and Eylea shots (one in each eye) at 2PM. I have been receiving Eylea every 3 months for about 3 years in one or both eyes.   On Saturday, March 20 at about 11:30AM, while sitting at traffic light, I saw what appeared to be a translucent sheet of plastic cover the left driver&#39;s window and the left half of the windshield. This was only visible in the left eye. Twenty seconds later, a yellow opaqueness developed in the left eye, which eventually cleared, but vision was still blurry. When I got home, I called my retinologist. He recommended I go into a dark room and close my eyes. At this time, I had white translucent vision in the lower left quadrant of vision in both eyes. My retinologist sent me to Eye Hospital Emergency Department, which is part of Hospital. After being assess at Eye Emergency Room, I was admitted to Hospital for a right occipital lobe stroke that was confirmed by multiple MRIs of the head. I was told that I was experiencing an ocular migraine (although I had no pain.) I was discharged on Monday, March 22, on Eliquis. As of April 15, all of the yellow opaque and white translucent visions are gone. However my left eye vision remains blurred and hazy. I have since been diagnosed with age-related cataracts in both eyes and a fast-moving cataract in top portion of left lens. I will also report this occurrence to the reporting system.

He did not have the core strength to even help him sit up. Sometime after he was assisted back on the couch around 4:30 am  he must of got back up and attempted to go to restroom because he was found on the floor with his arm and face resting on the love seat which looked as if he was trying to pull himself up. His wife found him in the morning around 11:00 am and he had been died for some time according to EMS. His death was unexpected. Even when contacting his doctors they were confused as to why he had passed away.  No autopsy was done but as of this moment he has not been cremated yet and is at Funeral Home.

At first, he looked like he was having a vasovagal/ syncopal episode: he became non-responsive, stared straight ahead.  then shortly thereafter he started to take be gasps for air, his lips turned blue.  It soon became clear that he was having an anaphylactic reaction. we called for an ambulance,  we administered one dose of an Epipen, and administered oxygen. His pulse ox was in the low 80&#39;s.   within a minute or two, he started to react and started to moan, breathe more normally, then began to speak to us.  His BP was checked and was 118/83.  His oxygen sat went up to 100%. after a few minutes,  We took the oxygen off and his sats dropped into the 80&#39;s so we restarted the oxygen.  We are rural, so it took the ambulance 30 minutes to arrive. He was very stable at the time that he was  taken to an emergency room for further evaluation.

                                                78 year old man without prior DVT/PE history, who had first Moderna vaccine dose on 12/29/20 (lot 011J20A) and second Moderna vaccine dose on 02/02/21 (030L20A) (information from patient provided vaccination card) who presented to the ER on 02/20/21 with one week of subjective dyspnea and palpitations. Chest CT with bilateral pulmonary emboli. There were also groundglass opacities in the right upper lobe. Rapid test for COVID 19 on 02/20/21 was negative. Subsequent antibody testing for COVID19 on 03/01/20 (IgG, IgA. IgM) also interpreted as negative. The pulmonary embolus was considered to be unprovoked and an association with prior COVID19 vaccination is interpreted as possible but unproven. The patient was initiated on anticoagulation. Further workup for underlying thrombophilia hematological disorders is pending at this time however the current assessment remains as an unprovoked pulmonary embolus occurring 18 days after second Moderna vaccine dose. Current CT imaging without evidence of recurrent malignancy and there are no identifiable risk factors for pulmonary embolus. The physician submitting this report is a Hematologist Oncologist.

I would have taken him to the ER had I been home.  When I returned home around 11am, he was having a very hard time breathing.  I got him a rescue inhaler to use.  He had a dailysis treatment that day, during the treatment they kept him on oxygen.  I called Dr office to inform them, they ordered a new inhaler and told me if the symptoms did not decrease by 72 hours to inform them.  His breathing did get somewhat better but he did not have his enegry levels that he had previously or his appeatite.  12 days after his 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine he went into cardiac arrest in the home with myself and husband present.

He was initially tachycardic, febrile and had leukocytosis 18K, with admission labs with creatinine 1.8, lactate 2.4. He had need for supplemental oxygen and was placed on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. Respiratory viral panel including SARS COV2 PCR was neg. Blood cultures from 2/24, 2/27, 3/3 were negative. CT chest showed some prominent mediastinal adenopathy which was increased from prior CT 2017. Also had axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2/27 he had a code blue called for bradycardia in context of receiving ativan for a CT study. Antibiotics  were changed to Vancomycin, ceftriaxone and ampicillin, acyclovir on 2/28. Multiple attempts by multiple providers at doing a lumbar puncture have been unsuccessful.  Bronchoscopy 3/2 with left lower lobe secretions. Cultures negative. He has stayed incessantly febrile and working diagnosis is probable underlying lymphoproliferative neoplasm immunostimulated by vaccine. At this time a bone marrow and lymph node excisional biopsy is planned. Patient is unstable to proceed for MRI imaging at this time due to hypotension.

                                                pneumonia Narrative: On 11/9/20, Patient had a presumptive positive COVID (COBAS) screen as part of routine CLC screening and then on 11/13/20, he had a repeat COVID (CEPHID) that was negative. Then on 12/22/20, he received his first COVID vaccine. On 12/26/20, he began to have c/o hurting all over. Noted history of aspiration and COPD. On 12/29/20, he began to have coughing, increased shortness of breath and runny nose with course breath sounds in his bilateral lower lobes. A chest xray was done and he was initiated on oral azithromycin and cefepime for a bilateral pneumonia. On 1/3/21, he continued to decline with increasing shortness of breath and was subsequently transferred to acute care medicine. All COVID tests have been negative since the presumptive positive on 11/9/20. He did have a CTA that ruled out PE but did show bilateral pneumonia. His antibiotics have been changed to meropenem, vancomycin and IV azithromycin. He remains on acute care at time and has not required ICU care.

                                                Client developed a mild covid infection 12/8/21 and recovered. He was admitted 12/25 with hypogycemia and mild weakness and sent home He was given his first dose of the Moderna vaccine 1/4/21 at approximately 9AM covid vaccine clinic He developed weakness the next day  (1/5) prompting admission to a hospital and then transition to subacute rehabilitation briefly  Work up at hospital revealed progressive respiratory failure and pneumonia requiring intubation and progressive ascending weakness and sensory loss without upper motor neuron changes.  MRI : nerve root enhancement LP : protein 40, &#43;/- 80 lymphocytes, cultures negative B 12 and B6 normal extensive CSF testing still pending campylobacter and Musk antibodies negative Neurology diagnosed likely AIDP (Guillain-Barre) and an EMG is planned for the near future.  Neurology felt the cause of his GBS was likely his covid infection verses his Moderna vaccination He was treated with plasmapheresis.  Client received dexamethasone, remdesivir, and zosyn and doxycycline when progressive leukocytosis and procalcitonin elevation was noted. Candida was cultured from tracheal aspirates but felt most likely d/t colonization with an option to treat further if he did not continue to improve. He is now extubated, unable to swallow and has profound weakness and distal sensory loss. He will transition to Acute rehab in the near future.  Comorbidities:as described in the above section and... DM2, CKD3, HTN, DJD, BPH ( h/o prostate surgery), h/o Lumbar surgery and hernia repair, GERD, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia.  Possible etiologies of his AIDP ( GBS)  would include his recent covid infection, the Moderna Vaccine, or other undiagnosed infection. He got his flu shot 9/25 ( fluzone sanofi) so this is not likely to be the culprit

                                                Patient admitted for fatigue, dry throat, generalized weakness, dyspnea on exertion. Durion hospitalization was identified to have an acute ischemic CVA -- unclear time of symptom onset, possibly evening of 2/9 or morning of 2/10. Time course suspicious for possible COVID vaccine adverse event. He received his first Moderna COVID vaccine on 2/2/21 per WIR.   Per PCP note on 2/9/21:   Patient is here today accompanied by his wife with concerns for fatigue, headaches, head pressure and tremors. Received vaccine last Tuesday. Around 10 PM that evening he developed pressured in the head.  On Wednesday morning, he states he got out of bed and was in a cold sweat - he states he pajamas were soaked in sweat and he felt chilled. He experienced brief numbness of the left arm down to his fingers.  On Thursday, he felt fine - he went out to snow blow.  Friday he developed headaches and head pressure. At night, he felt his breathing was labored as he was &#34;gasping for air.&#34;  On Saturday and Sunday, he sat and laid around all day.  On Monday, he wakes up at 125 AM and his blood pressure was 165/104 and it remained elevated for 3 separate readings.    Patient was then admitted on 2/10/21 with weakness and confusion, then on 2/11 MD noted ?word finding difficulty, slurred speech, possible subtle right upper lip droop, and possibly some mild right hemineglect? with MRI showing likely embolic source of infarcts and cerebral MRA with possible acute thrombus. His symptoms the day after the vaccine seem a bit suspicious for TIA. Per Drug Policy Manager call to Moderna, no current reports of TIA/stroke secondary to COVID vaccine, so time course may be incidental. Patient had echocardiogram without right to left shunt or clot identified, no known history of atrial fibrillation. Was monitored on telemetry for the duration of his hospitalization without any noted arrhythmias, discharged on e patch for 14-day outpatient monitoring.

                                                Per neurology consult: &#34;Patient was at his baseline until when he received his 2nd dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.  He complained of dyspnea and fear of impending doom after waking up the following morning with some disorientation.  He was found to be in AFib with RVR after it was brought to ER  the following morning  and the rhythm was converted to normal sinus rhythm.  Patient continues to have confusion after admission yesterday that seem to get worse today to the point where he did not know his own name or birthdate, and seemed to have global amnesia.  Patient has been more drowsy this afternoon after receiving lorazepam 1 mg IV for potential seizure activity so no reliable neurologic exam was obtained.  Patient remains afebrile with pulse ox in the low 90s on 4 L of supplemental nasal oxygen in the hospital.  He had moderate decrease in kidney function upon admission that has improved.  He has baseline anemia with hemoglobin at around 10. Incidentally patient had shingles in the right thoracic dermatome week ago for which he received valacyclovir.

                                                Patient received the Moderna covid vaccine on 3/11/2021. Starting the day after that, the patient&#39;s wife reported that the patient began to display confusion, weakness, and fatigue. The patient also presented to the clinic on 4/2/2021 with complaint of &#34;sinus pressure&#34; and was prescribed an antibiotic. He progressively worsened to the point where he was only able to speak a few words, and presented to hospital on 4/7/2021. Given extremely low platelet count on presentation, a diagnostic workup for TTP vs. ITP was commenced. It was determined by the inpatient hematology/oncology service that the patient was likely experiencing alterations in mental status and weakness and thrombocytopenia due to TTP.  Fresh frozen plasma was administered. Plasma exchange daily x 5 days and corticosteroids were initiated.

                                                My dad got the Moderna Vaccine on Tuesday, January 12, 2021 in his left arm at the Mall injection site for the Health Department. He was told that the side effects could mean his arm hurting, tiredness, headache, and even a low grade fever. Additionally, the site informed us both (as I was with him to get the injection) that this was all normal and not to seek medical attention unless these symptoms last longer than 72 hours. That evening, my dad was experiencing all of those symptoms, and went to bed at 7pm. A little after 10am on Wednesday, January 13, 2021, when he awoke, my dad went to the bathroom vomiting. This was where he collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Fire/Rescue was dispatched about 10:30am after my mom started CPR. County Fire Rescue EMTs and Paramedics continued CPR and other attempts at reviving him all the way to Hospital Emergency Department. He was pronounced dead at 12:14pm on Wednesday, January 13, 2021. We have no doubt my dad, following the instructions of the injection facility, thought he was just experiencing the side effects of the vaccine. He had no chance. Had this injection been done in the RIGHT arm, perhaps he could have recognized the arm numbness being that of an impending heart attack. We really miss Dad. He served this country with distinction for over 50 years, and we believe his country failed him.

Went to ED - &#34;Patient is an 82yo male with a history of chronic Afib on Eliquis, HTN, and bradykinesia (thought to be PD) who presented to the ED with a CC of weakness after receiving 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. He also had low-grade fever and difficulties ambulating. In the ED he was febrile at 38.5C and HR 159bpm. EKG revealed Afib RVR. BP was stable. He was given Cardizem 10mg IV x1. Basic labs were unremarkable. COVID negative. CXR negative. He was given Tylenol for fever and admitted under observation. He remained afebrile and heart rate remained controlled with home Cardizem dosing. Cardiology was consulted who will refer him to their clinic to establish routine care with their service. PT/OT recommended home with home PT/OT. The patient overall felt much improved compared to admission and felt ready for discharge. He was discharged home in stable condition.

On 16 Feb 2021, the patient developed a severe UTI. Close to urea sepsis. Took antibiotics.  Treatment medication included antibiotics.  No lab tests were mentioned.  The events severe UTI and close to urea sepsis were considered to be serious with criteria of important medical event.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events severe UTI and close to urea sepsis was considered unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

PTA bowel obstruction led to a syncopal episode following use of laxative, and several episodes of vomiting in the days prior . Upon admission Patient was receiving conservative therapy for a partial obstruction when he developed increasing shortness of breath.  The patient was transferred to the ICU for worsening respiratory status and eventually developed significant hypercapnic and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation.  Neurology was consulted for altered mentation in the setting of respiratory failure. Patient with ascending paralysis. MRI of the head and neck as well as CTA were obtained x2. Patient was ultimately diagnosed with Guillain-Barre, variant and received 5 days of Intravenous Immune Globulin therapy.  Patient&#39;s small bowel obstruction resolved and ultimately patient required percutaneous tracheostomy tube and gastrostomy tube placement for prolonged respiratory failure and neurologic compromise.  The patient had uneventful ventilatory requirements and ultimately was performing intermittent spontaneous breathing trials; however, still had episodes of apnea, but improved.  He was tolerating tube feeds at goal with resolution of his small bowel obstruction, which was thought secondary to his Guillain-Barre.  The patient did develop abnormal LFTs which were thought secondary to cholecystitis not requiring operative intervention, with improving LFT findings on antibiotics.  The patient had a nonobstructive cholecystitis.  The patient&#39;s mentation was improving to the point where he was able to communicate and open his eyes upon discharge, as well as was working with Physical Therapy for strengthening.  He was able to move his upper extremities and followed commands and lower extremities were improving in strength as well. Patient was discharged via private air flight to acute care ICU facility.

                                                Stroke.  I do not know if the vaccine was related or not, but the patient had a stroke and falls on 2/17/2021 and 2/18/2021 and was found to have two strokes.  He does have atrial fibrillation, but with the proximity to the second vaccine, I cannot tell if they are just related temporally or if there is a true risk.  Another patient at this facility had a stroke within same time frame post second Moderna vaccine, but not my patient, so I do not know if that was reported.  Due to new nature of this vaccine, I felt it important to report this event for further investigation.   Again, I am not sure if it is a true adverse reaction of the vaccine or not.

He came out of the bathroom and proceeded to the living room, she stated dad are you ok?  He said he couldn&#39;t breath.  Giving his history of COPD and being short of breath sometimes, she didn&#39;t think anything of it.   She proceeded to follow him to his chair and was checking his oxygen tank that he had been using with ambulation.   It still had some in the tank.  She raised her head to tell him he still had some in the tank and saw that he had started &#34;agonal breathing&#34;.  Daughter is a nurse and knew he needed help.   She phone for an ambulance and with the help of her mother got patient to the floor and started CPR.   Paramedics arrived on scene, continued CPR and administered meds and also intubated, but were unsuccessful in their efforts.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 11 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 031620A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient experienced little bruising in the arm. On 12 Feb 2021, the patient was a bit off. On Sunday, 28 Feb 2021, in the evening, the patient got cold, and within minutes his entire whole body was in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe were in pain. It felt like it was invaded with COVID. He went to hospital and got tested for COVID, Strep throat and Flu, and all three test results were negative. On an unknown date, the patient experienced tightening in his throat muscle and he went to the hospital where he was admitted.  While there, they did every possible test, chest MRI, Neck MRI, all possible viral tests, and rapid and full COVID test.  The rapid and full COVID tests came back negative.  Results for chest MRI, neck MRI and viral tests were not provided.  The hospital also performed a blood culture for bacteria. Results were not provided.  The patient was unable to move much, his blood pressure and oxygen were a little unstable.

The patient was still taking prednisone at a tapering dose.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown.   The events of weak in terms of walking, coughing were unresolved, while the outcome of the events of tightening in his throat muscle, unable to move much, unstable blood pressure, unstable oxygen, bled due to blood thinner, Bruising in arm, cold, entire body in excruciating pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain, every joint and muscle from neck to toe in pain was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on a strong temporal association between the reported events and administration of mRNA-1273 vaccine, a causal association cannot be excluded.  Myalgia and arthralgia are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine

By the next evening, he started vomiting violently, trembling and sweating. He lived in country and his caregiver didn&#39;t think to take him to the hospital. The symptoms calmed down after a while, but he was not able to hold any food or liquids down. Eventually, he fell asleep and his caregiver left for the night. He returned on Easter Sunday at 9:30 am and found my uncle deceased.

Had full tx done and brought to ER. Reports still feels weak after dialysis.    84 year old male comes in today after completing dialysis for evaluation of generalized weakness x 5 days. He has also lost his voice. He tells me he received his COVID vaccine yesterday, but he is concerned he may have COVID. He denies any fevers, cough, sore throat, NVD, abd pain.  Transfer Note:  HOSPITAL COURSE: Patient is a 84 y.o. male who presented with shaking chills and was found to have Gram-negative rods in the blood.  The source of infection was unclear.  Initially it was thought that it could possibly be cholecystitis but imaging was negative for that.  There was concern that it could be UTI but the patient is on dialysis and is an uric and therefore no urinalysis could be got.  Early this morning when I saw the patient the patient did have significant pain and tenderness in the right knee and is not able to put weight on that.  I.e. Consulted Dr. Today with per lumbar from Orthopedics who said that it would be in the best interest of the patient for him to be transferred to hospital where he could decide on aspiration and or washout of the right knee.   Transfer center has been called and we are trying to finalize a transfer of the patient hospital at this point of time   Please see problem list listed below.

They did a C-Scan of my chest and saw a blood clot in each lung.  While hooked to the monitors, they found I had Afib.  They also did an ultra-sound of my legs and found a small clot in each leg below the knees in a small vein.  I have never had any record of clots or Afib.  They transferred me to  Medical Center early on 3/17/2021.  They started a heparin drip to soften the clots.  In the afternoon of 3/17/2021, they performed a Suction Thrombectomy to remove the clots from my lungs.  On 3/19/2021, they put me on Eliquis Tab.  I was released from the hospital in the evening of 3/20/2021.

En route while in ambulance, he experienced a convulsion with rhythmic shaking in all limbs lasting several seconds.  He had a second episode requiring midazolam and levetiracetam. On arrival to MGH ED, the patient was afebrile, heart rate 133, blood pressure 173/93, oxygen saturation 99% on a nonrebreather.  He was found to be severely encephalopathic, mute, and not answering questions or following commands.  He was admitted to the neuroICU and intubated for airway protection given his poor mental status. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric treatment of meningoencephalitis, but these were discontinued after his CSF was not concerning for a bacterial infection herpes simplex encephalitis.  Antibiotics were discontinued. He was extubated on hospital day 2.  After extubation he had persistent mixed receptive-expressive aphasia that was slowly improving over time. At discharge from the hospital, he was able to occasionally say a simple sentence, could repeat simple phrases, and could follow simple commands. He was discharged to Rehab

                                                Patient has long standing COPD and asthma. He has been stable on his home medications for years. No hospitalizations for these issues in the past. During Covid times he has been very restricted to his home with no visitors. Approximately 5 days after receiving the 2nd Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, he started having increased difficulty with breathing. Over the next few weeks he continued to get worse and required home oxygen and an adjustment with his medications. He was started on steroids and antibiotics about 3 weeks after the vaccine and then hospitalized on 3/16/2021 with COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. He tested negative for Covid at that time. He was in the hospital for 9 days and discharged home on steroid taper and home oxygen. A few days after being at home, he had gradual onset of subacute dementia/delirium. All workup has been negative. MRI/MRA normal. He is currently continuing on oxygen and again on steroids and mental status may be starting to improve.     The concern here is that patient was stable and had been stable on his medication regimen for years. He was doing well until approx 5 days after his second Covid vaccine when he started having worsening pulmonary complaints and eventually ended up in the hospital. He continues to be on oxygen at home and was recently started back on steroids. There has been no explanation for his subacute onset of Dementia/Delirium. MRI/MRA normal. This has been discussed with both Pulmonology and Neurology specialists.

                                                My father passed away on February 10th, 2021. On Monday, January 25th 2021, he said he is feeling very uncomfortable in his chest area. He thought it was severe acid reflux. He took Gas X for Acid Reflux and told us that he does not want to go to the hospital. On Tuyesday, January 26th, he felt that his Acid Reflux symptoms got worse, he still did not want to go to the hospital. He took Tums. On that evening, he started having shortness of breath. We took his BP at home and it was very low. We begged him to go to the hospital, he still did not want to go. On Wednesday, January 27th, his shortness of breath got worse and we convinced him that he has to go to the hospital. We took him to ER. Doctor said that he had a heart attack on Monday morning and that is why he was not feeling well since Monday morning. While at the hospital, while the cardiologists were monitoring him, his heart condition got worse.  By Friday, February 5th, cardiologists said that he is very fragile, his heart condition is very fragile and he won&#39;t survive any procedure. They said that something triggered the heart attack. We told them about the vaccination on 1/13/2021. They sent him home on hospice on Friday, Feburary 5th, 2021. He was on supplemental oxygen when he came home. He passed away due to a heart attack on February 10th, 2021 around 9pm.

Instead of him using the rollater to come from his bedroom I got the wheel chair out of the care and got him to the table where I fed him a little breakfast.  His blood pressure was low then high (I don&#39;t now have the readings) By 5 pm I called the ambulance.  He was in the hospital until I transferred him to hospice 6 days later.  He died in hospice 4 days after that.

                                                2 days after receiving the second moderna vaccine my father experienced a stroke. He was transported to the emergency room  medical center where he went thru a procedure to remove a clot in his left side brain. Prior to this vaccine my father was in good health and was very active and still works and owns and operates a restaurant. He has never had any problems like this before the vaccine. One day after the vaccine he was complaining about a pain on the left side of his neck area. He was doing paperwork at approx 7:40pm when he experienced the stroke. I had to call 911.  My father is currently at the medical center recovering from the incident.

He was confused, no appetite, weak, and generally not himself.  Prior to receiving his second dose he was alert, eating, no complaints of any discomfort or issues. The next day following his second dose he passed away from what we think was a massive heart attack.   As a family we feel his weakened state contributed to this and not the fault of the vaccine but felt it important to notify you in case individuals such as patient should be monitored in a different way or use a different vaccine.

                                                death Narrative:  Patient received Moderna covid #1 on 1/9/21 and #2 on 2/8/21. On 2/24/21, he was sent to the ER at a facility from a nursing home where he was admitted for skilled nursing care. He was sent to the ER due to fever, decreased mental status, renal failure, possible UTI and possible pneumonia. He was admitted and received IV fluids, Zosyn and Solu Medrol. On 2/26/21, a consult was placed for hospice care and he was accepted for hospice care at a contract nursing home. Upon review of scanned records, it appears he had a stroke/intercranial hemorrhage on 2/10/21 and that is why he was admitted to the nursing home for skilled nursing services. A date of death of 3/18/21 is recorded. No autopsy results recorded. 38 days from vaccine #2 and date of death.

The patient&#39;s significant other reported neither of them were feeling well on 2/21/2021.  Approximately 28 hours after vaccination, the patient was found unresponsive in the bathtub.  EMS arrived within 5 minutes, resuscitation attempt was unsuccessful, CPR terminated at 1503 and the patient pronounced dead.  The Medical examiner refused the case on the basis of lack of jurisdiction, and the remains were moved to a local funeral home.  No autopsy was performed.  This event is not thought to be related to the vaccination event or the vaccine, the death is thought to be from natural causes.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Cold body temperature especially in the feet; fast heart rate; dizziness; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer regarding her husband, an 86-year-old male patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) experienced fast heart rate/heart rate increased, cold body temperature/coldness, dizziness and atrial fibrillation.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not included. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 27 Jan 2021, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: unknown) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 06 Feb 2021, approximately 10 days after the patient received the vaccine, he experienced a fast heart rate, dizziness, cold body temperature, and atrial fibrillation. (The wife reports that they purchased an EKG machine, and this is what the machine showed them. Unaware if he had this before the vaccine or not.)  Treatment information was not provided.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 was unknown.  The outcome of the events, fast heart rate, cold body temperature, dizziness and atrial fibrillation, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Although a temporal association exist, the event occurred 9 days after vaccine administration and very limited information regarding this patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were event is also confounded by the patient&#39;s advanced age.  Further information has been requested.

She did not specify how he died. She gave us his vaccine card in case we needed to do anything with it. This RN is reporting as the client died roughly two weeks after administration of the 1st dose and it was reported directly to the facility, although the death is not COVID related according to the patient&#39;s wife.

                                                Patient was in usual state of health when received first Covid Moderna vaccine on 2/2/21 and did fine until about 2/17.  He started c/o discomfort and appetite decreased.  2/18/21 had low grade fever.  2/22  fever and generalized weakness and abnormal labs (elevated potassium).  2/22 hydration was started.  2/25 antibiotic started for UTI for 7 days.  Patient seem to improve except appetite.  Since vaccine, patient remained on frequent IV hydration and had poor appetite through February into March.  On 3/2/21, patient received 2nd dose of  Moderna Vaccine while on Augmentin for UTI, issue with dehydration and appetite.  By 3/4/21, patient was noticed to have trouble chewing and swallowing.  Speech was ordered.   On 3/5/21, it was noted patient had continued poor appetite, weakness, dehydration risk, debility.  On 3/8/21, it was noted patient had intermittent confusion.  By 3/10/21, patient was more alert.   Patient remained fairly consistent from that time with poor appetite, dehydration issue, weakness and dysphagia management.  Then on 3/27/21 he became disoriented, wheezing, labored breathing,   Vitals were 92% oxygen on room air, Temp 97.5, 158/62, pulse 94.  Oxygen started and sent to ER.  Family reported patient is admitted to hospital with mild stroke and UTI.   The vaccine seemed to change patient&#39;s state of health about 2 weeks post first dose with multiple sequelae.  This seems similar to timing of actual COVID infection pattern when it is the actual virus.

                                                My father died, 20 days after his 2nd vaccination. Not sure if it is related to the vaccine, but a sister reported Arthritis pain, 3 times as bad, after the 2nd vaccination and recommended I report this. My father started having severe back pain, 3 days after the second immunization. I took him for an XRay and the hospital said he had Compression Fractures of the vertebrae, but they could not tell if they were new or old, so needed to do an MRI. Said it also looked like he had a Bowel Obstruction, but I told them he had been having normal BM&#39;s up to the previous day. He lived until the 17th of April and never had another BM. They said bring him to the ER. The ER decided to do a CAT Scan, but Dad was not interested in any further treatment. He just wanted to go, so we put him on palliative care and he passed away, 20 days after the 2nd vaccination.

Daughter was home with pt and after he went to the bathroom she reports pt was out of breath, however that has been chronic/ongoing for him due to his diagnosis of COPD, pulmonary HTN and metastatic lung cancer. After sitting and resting in a chair, she states patient became unresponsive. She called 911 who told her he had no pulse and was not breathing. She states that they were not able to resuscitate him. Pt had been suspected to be positive for COVID as he had symptoms of increased cough, congestion and rhinitis. Daughter (that is primary caregiver and lives in home with patient) tested positive for COVID on 1/31/21. She started having symptoms on 1/25/21. Patient started having symptoms on 1/31/21. No COVID test confirmed prior to pt&#39;s death. Patient had a definitive diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma in October 2020. History of multimorbidity. He did have a 60 pack year history of smoking. Most likely cause of death from available records is metastatic lung cancer, with other serious diagnoses contributing.
