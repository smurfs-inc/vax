The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history was reported).    On 19-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura/Hematoma on thigh that was softball size/rash everywhere on body) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening). The patient was hospitalized on 28-Apr-2021 due to IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA. At the time of the report, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura/Hematoma on thigh that was softball size/rash everywhere on body) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 28-Apr-2021, Platelet count: 3 (Inconclusive) diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). On 30-Apr-2021, Platelet count: 0 (Inconclusive) 0. On an unknown date, HIV test negative: (Negative) Negative/Condition was ruled out. On an unknown date, Hepatitis viral test: (Negative) Negative/Condition was ruled out.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Patient experienced a rash on 28 Apr 2021 everywhere on her body that kept getting worse. She also had a hematoma on her thigh that was softball size and she did not remember bumping it. She went to the emergency room at Hospital at about 5 PM. They did bloodwork and her platelet count was 3 she was diagnosed with ITP idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. She was perfectly healthy before this. This condition leads to bleeding and bruising her rash was actually very small bruises. That hospital felt she needed to be seen by a hematologist and oncologist so they transferred her to their main campus. Where she was admitted around midnight to the Hospital. They ruled out HIV and Hepatitis. They started her on a five day prednisone taper and did a 10% Privigen IV IG transfusion to try to increase her platelet count. In morning 30 Apr 2021, her platelet count was down to zero. Now they are going to do a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a platelet transfusion.

I had tightness in my throat, it was pretty much like an anaphylactic  shock is how the doctors described it. I had white bumps, like welts,   on the back of my throat and tongue. And the roof of my mouth and my tongue, my lips everything in my mouth was swollen. My eyes were almost swollen shut. On 12/27/2021,  I had a doctor video visit. He advised me to take Benadryl, and Tylenol,  I used my albuterol  inhaler several times because I couldn&#39;t breath. So around 3:00 pm I went to the Emergency Room because I was still having a hard time breathing and the swelling wasn&#39;t going down.  The doctor immediately gave me an Epi pen. and told me i had an allergic reaction to the vaccination. The doctor advised me that it was up to me to take the 2nd vaccination . He said it was up to me.

                                                About 6-7 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started to develop hives around my body, including on feet, stomach, ears, face, back, and legs. I had fever and chills, muscle aches, joint pain,  headaches,  and nausea later that night as well. The next morning, my left eye was swollen, left side of tongue completely swollen, lips swollen, and left side of throat closed (anaphylaxis). I took prednisone, Benadryl, and Tylenol to relieve the symptoms, and the swelling around my left eye, tongue, throat, and lips went away. Throughout the day, more hives have developed around my body and face, including my right eye.  I am continuing to take Benadryl and Tylenol and finish doses of prednisone. The fever and chills, muscles aches, joint pains, hives, headache, and nausea are still present.

                                                I developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of platelets) and menorrhagia due to the vaccine according to my doctor. I believe there have been about 30 cases of this occurring so far.   In my case, I took the vaccine and felt relatively tired for two days. There were no other symptoms. About a week later, I got my period after not having it for a couple months. The blooding was light for a few days, but then got extremely heavy. After about a week of very heavy bleeding, I went to urgent care. They took blood tests, and found that I had a critically low level of platelets (6 platelets when the normal range is 150-400). I was admitted to the ER for multiple days, and they gave a platelet transfusion and IVIG  fluids, which has helped considerably. I also had to take steroids to suppress my immune system so that my platelets could increase.

                                                By the evening of April 16th, I was experiencing a fever of 103.5 after already medicating an hour prior. On the 17th, my fever continued and I noticed vaginal bleeding. On the morning of April 18th, I went to the emergency room because I was still experiencing this bleeding, as well as bleeding from my nose. We came to the conclusion that I had an ovarian cyst rupture.

She was unconscious for a very short period of time (Only long enough for the immunizer to call the RPh for assistance). 911 was called when Madison regained consciousness she asked what had happened, explained her anxiety and then vomited twice . The paramedics arrived and evaluated her and a ride was called so she would not have to drive. She waiting in the pharmacy for around 40-45mins after the vaccination before leaving with her parents.

                                                A few days after vaccination I had a high fever and began coughing so hard that I was throwing up. This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

Felt chills. This lasted from the morning after the first dose, and has gotten better due to receiving medical attention in the emergency room, I needed two IV?s and Tylenol with codine. They did blood work and a CT scan on my head and chest, and I received Azithromycin to treat the chest pain. I am feeling slightly better, however there have been occasional pangs of pain on my head (right side), and a persistent dull chest pain that is on and off. I also had some break outs on my back, and my back still aches and my bones crack more often than usual. I am also dealing with drowsiness and some nausea. On 05/02/2021 they kept me in the emergency room until nearly 10pm.

She was crying and immediately knew she was having a stroke. She had been trying to clasp some jewelry while getting ready for Mother&#39;s Day. She was able to walk down to the car with me no problem (no extremity involvement other than right hand/fingers). We arrived at the hospital within 10 minutes and she was a Code Stroke. A CT scan showed the clots as well as a tiny Subarachnoid bleed and she was admitted to NeuroICU. The symptoms waxed and waned for a few hours and at one point she developed the droop again, had headache and heartburn and vomited. A CT scan was repeated after some Heparin had entered her system and it was stable/not worse; subarach bleed was not changed and Heparin was continued.   She  has now been admitted for 3 days and the Heparin is complete. She is now being transitioned to oral Xaralto. She has no deficits whatsoever and has made a full recovery so far. We are still pending the results of her coagulation studies to see if she has a hereditary condition.   The doctors believe the clot is due to her Nuvaring Estrogen, which is most likely. However, I would still like to report this event just in case.

                                                About one week after vaccination, the patient developed symptoms of enlarged cervical LN, sinus pressure, fevers. This progressed to develop rash and eventually SIRS. She was admitted several times over the course of April and May to determine a diagnosis and had extensive workup for infectious, autoimmune and hematologic malignancy. The ultimate diagnosis was macrophage activation syndrome/HLH but it is unclear if this was triggered by the COVID vaccine or not.  She is responding to steroids in taper and Anakinra and still recovering in the hospital at this point.

Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

                                                I was pregnant at the time of my first and second dose of the vaccine. My estimated due date was February 15th 2022. A half hour after my second dose I had a little bit of spotting and moderate to severe cramping. This was dismissed as gas pains. Later that night I went to the bathroom to find a substantial amount of blood in my underwear at which point I called a nurse line and was directed to go to the ER. They gave an ultrasound and ran blood work. Miscarriage was strongly suspected but not totally confirmed. I was also running a low fever and experiencing severe chills, muscle and joint pain and a severe headache. I was sent home and told to follow up with my doctor for more blood work to confirm the miscarriage. I continued to get severe cramping, bleeding and loss of uterine tissue vaginally. On Monday I saw my doctor had blood work and confirmed the miscarriage. I am still bleeding today.

                                                I had pain in my left arm, and within an hour or two I was pretty exhausted and out of it. I figured it would go away, it got worse the next day, and finally on Saturday when I woke up it was hard for me to breathe and I had pain/tightness in my chest. I went into the ER on Sunday morning and after a day of testing was diagnosed with: - Deep vein thrombosis of bilateral lower extremities - Pulmonary embolism, bilateral - DVT, bilateral lower limbs  I had at least 5 clots in my legs and several more in my lungs but they said there was no way to know the full amount. I had been on HRT for over two and a half years and had no problems, then 4 days after I received my first shot I was informed that I had almost died several times due to the clots. When I explained to my doctor that I thought the clots were related to my shot he shrugged it off, said it was impossible, told it was just my hormones, and said that &#34;Covid is no big deal and we&#39;re overexaggerating how bad it is compared to other things...&#34;. So I don&#39;t think any of this was reported.   Later I saw a blood specialist who told me it was impossible for hormones to do this much damage in the span of a few days without something else effecting it, and told me to cancel my next shot even after we learned I had APS. All and all I would really appreciate someone looking into this to at least make sure there isn&#39;t something else going on, as the timing of this is was too close and I know Covid shots have had the rare chance of causing the exact kind of thing I went through.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included gluten allergy. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included ethinylestradiol/ ferrous fumarate/ norethindrone acetate.   On 06 Jan 2021 at 10:30am, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 06 Jan 2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient became very nauseous through 08 Jan 2021.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient started having neurological symptoms. She started having headaches, dizziness, difficulty with coordination and balance, and vision changes in the left eye (not specified). She reported that she had a &#34;drift&#34; in the left arm and described it as &#34;when you try to manipulate the arm, but it does not go where you want it to go&#34;.   On 11 Jan 2021, the patient still had neurological symptoms, issues moving left arm, colliding with objects all day, and issues going through daily routine.  On 12 Jan 2021, the patient was seen by a neurologist and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) was scheduled. The MRI revealed inflammation, and brain bleed and swelling. The patient was sent to the emergency room and admitted on 19 Jan 2021.  Treatment for the events included calcium carbonate for nausea, ibuprofen for headaches and diphenhydramine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The event, very nauseous, was considered resolved on 08 Jan 2021. The events, neurological symptoms, headaches, dizziness, difficulty with coordination, difficulty with balance, vision changes in left eye, drift in left arm and issues going through daily routine, confusion, and brain bleed were considered not resolved.   Follow-up received on 23 Jan 2021 included patient details, medical history, lab tests, concomitant medications, hospitalization, and updated events.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a female patient, who experienced a non-serious unexpected event of dizziness, coordination abnormal, balance disorder, visual impairment, movement disorder, loss of personal independence in daily activities, and neurological symptom, and non-serious expected event of nausea, and headaches. The events of nausea occurred 1 day (same day) after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown. The event of neurological symptoms, dizziness, coordination abnormal, balance disorder, visual impairment, loss of personal independence in daily activities, and movement disorder occurred 3 days after first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # unknown. Treatment for the events included, Tums, nauseam, ibuprofen and Benadryl. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and onset of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

On 12-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on an unknown date and the estimated date of delivery was 15-Nov-2021. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant). 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache). On 22-Mar-2021, the patient experienced VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding). On 01-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown). On 09-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried) (seriousness criterion medically significant), FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) and HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue). On 12-Mar-2021, EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (Pregnant) had resolved. On 09-Apr-2021, ABORTION SPONTANEOUS (Miscarried), FOETAL GROWTH ABNORMALITY (Baby had not grown) and FOETAL HEART RATE ABNORMAL (No fetal heartbeat.) had resolved. At the time of the report, VAGINAL HAEMORRHAGE (Menstrual bleeding), MALAISE (General sick and tired feeling), FEELING ABNORMAL (Did not want to get out of bed), HEREDITARY DISORDER (Genetic issue), FATIGUE (Pretty tired) and HEADACHE (Headache) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 25-Mar-2021, Ultrasound foetal abnormal: abnormal (abnormal) Had some bleeding and found out it was subchorionic hemorrhage. Bleeding is in another part of the uterus where is baby is not. On 01-Apr-2021, Ultrasound scan: abnormal (abnormal) Saw baby heartbeat but was informed baby had not grown.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information provided mentioned ultrasound and cytotec.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable as patient took both doses of the vaccine. Patient reported that she does not blame Moderna, as her OB feels the miscarriage was related to a &#34;genetic issue.   This case was linked to MOD-2021-060699 (Patient Link).   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 13-Apr-2021: Patient updated AE and mentions fetal complications resulting in miscarriage. Events and outcome of case thus updated with new information.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the temporal association between the product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I was nauseous and threw up twice. I had a low grade fever of around 99 degrees but at one point it did go up to 101.3. My entire body hurt including my head and Tylenol and ibuprofen did not help. On February 5 I was feeling a little better, I still had body aches but could eat a little.   On February 6 at around 0500 I woke up with chest pain. I waited a little while to see if it would go away but it had gotten more intense. I am a cardiac ICU nurse so I knew what chest pain could mean. I got out of bed and at that time my chest pain was a 10/10 and I was having shortness of breath. I woke my fiancé up and told him I needed to go to the ER.  At the ER they ran test and admitted me to the hospital. They later diagnosed with myopericarditis with a small pericardial effusion.

On Wednesday morning, around 8:30, April 28, I collapsed at at kickboxing class and was sent by ambulance to Hospital Emergency Room as my heart rate was very high and my oxygen was low.  In the ER I was diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs, pulmonary embolism, and was sent by ambulance to another facility where I had a procedure to try to break up the clots (catheter directed thrombolysis).  I spent 24 hours in the ICU, and another 24 hours in Cardiac Care.  I was released on Friday, April 30 at around 2:30 pm.  I am now prescribed Eliquis, have a follow up with my PCP on Monday, , May 10, a follow up with cardiology on May 24, and a follow up on June 14 with the Pulmonary Embolism group.

After 2 months of bleeding, I have seen a primary physician and a gynecologist. I was told to take birth control, i took it for a month  but the bleeding didn&#39;t stop. The bleeding would occasionally stop only if I take 3 birth control pills. On top of that, I would randomly get a excruciating sharp pain in the lower abdomen area.
