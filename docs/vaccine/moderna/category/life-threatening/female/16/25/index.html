On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura/Hematoma on thigh that was softball size/rash everywhere on body) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, medically significant and life threatening). The patient was hospitalized on 28-Apr-2021 due to IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA. At the time of the report, IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura/Hematoma on thigh that was softball size/rash everywhere on body) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 28-Apr-2021, Platelet count: 3 (Inconclusive) diagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). On 30-Apr-2021, Platelet count: 0 (Inconclusive) 0. On an unknown date, HIV test negative: (Negative) Negative/Condition was ruled out. On an unknown date, Hepatitis viral test: (Negative) Negative/Condition was ruled out.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Patient experienced a rash on 28 Apr 2021 everywhere on her body that kept getting worse. She also had a hematoma on her thigh that was softball size and she did not remember bumping it. She went to the emergency room at Hospital at about 5 PM. They did bloodwork and her platelet count was 3 she was diagnosed with ITP idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. She was perfectly healthy before this. This condition leads to bleeding and bruising her rash was actually very small bruises. That hospital felt she needed to be seen by a hematologist and oncologist so they transferred her to their main campus. Where she was admitted around midnight to the Hospital. They ruled out HIV and Hepatitis. They started her on a five day prednisone taper and did a 10% Privigen IV IG transfusion to try to increase her platelet count. In morning 30 Apr 2021, her platelet count was down to zero. Now they are going to do a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a platelet transfusion.

I had fever and chills, muscle aches, joint pain,  headaches,  and nausea later that night as well. The next morning, my left eye was swollen, left side of tongue completely swollen, lips swollen, and left side of throat closed (anaphylaxis). I took prednisone, Benadryl, and Tylenol to relieve the symptoms, and the swelling around my left eye, tongue, throat, and lips went away. Throughout the day, more hives have developed around my body and face, including my right eye.  I am continuing to take Benadryl and Tylenol and finish doses of prednisone. The fever and chills, muscles aches, joint pains, hives, headache, and nausea are still present.

                                                I developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of platelets) and menorrhagia due to the vaccine according to my doctor. I believe there have been about 30 cases of this occurring so far.   In my case, I took the vaccine and felt relatively tired for two days. There were no other symptoms. About a week later, I got my period after not having it for a couple months. The blooding was light for a few days, but then got extremely heavy. After about a week of very heavy bleeding, I went to urgent care. They took blood tests, and found that I had a critically low level of platelets (6 platelets when the normal range is 150-400). I was admitted to the ER for multiple days, and they gave a platelet transfusion and IVIG  fluids, which has helped considerably. I also had to take steroids to suppress my immune system so that my platelets could increase.

                                                A few days after vaccination I had a high fever and began coughing so hard that I was throwing up. This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.  Suspect anaphalxis reaction given rapid decline in status while talking with her. epic pen at bedside immediately and then due to increasing heart rate and complaints of chest discomfort gave her epipen times one. Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

It?s not a lot that I need a pad. It?s enough whenever I wipe after peeing, I see a little spot of blood. After the second dose, the spotting continues but start to become heavier. A week later after second dose, the spotting is a bit heavier that I need to wear a panty liner.  This spotting been going for a month now since my first dose.

                                                Initial reaction was severe nausea and within hours developed into excruciating headache, coordination issues and depth perception loss. As patient is employee, she first contacted Health multiple times in the days immediately following the vaccine and no major concern. As symptoms continued over the weekend, she was take to an urgent care on Monday and referred to neurologist, Dr.  Patient (who has emergency room scribe work experience) expressed to all 3 providers that she was concerned about stroke but was told she was too young &amp; healthy and it was likely inflammation due to a vaccine reaction.  Dr scheduled her for a brain MRI one week later, on Jan.19th (2 weeks after vaccine).  Bilateral occipital brain hemorrahges. was immediately seen on the MRI and patient was rushed to emergency and then admitted for very thorough testing and scanning over the course of 5 days, including cerebral angiogram and lumbar puncture. No abnormal vascular nor blood issues were found, nor clots. Patient discharged on 1/23 w/severe headache thought to be due to lumbar puncture, continued feeling very poorly for next 2 days at home then collapsed on 1/25 and readmitted with new, massive brain bleed and multiple clots detected.  I&#39;m running out of time so you&#39;ll have to read the reports but the conclusion now is hemorrhages due to the vaccine.
