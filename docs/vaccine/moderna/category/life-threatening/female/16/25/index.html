                                                Vasovagal Syncope; unauthorized age patient, 17 years of age; This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse and describes the occurrence of SYNCOPE (Vasovagal Syncope) in a 17-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 012A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Congenital heart disease NOS since 22-May-2003.    On 01-Mar-2021 at 2:30 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 01-Mar-2021 at 2:30 PM, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Vasovagal Syncope) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and PRODUCT ADMINISTERED TO PATIENT OF INAPPROPRIATE AGE (unauthorized age patient, 17 years of age). On 01-Mar-2021, SYNCOPE (Vasovagal Syncope) had resolved. On 01-Mar-2021 at 2:30 PM, PRODUCT ADMINISTERED TO PATIENT OF INAPPROPRIATE AGE (unauthorized age patient, 17 years of age) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered SYNCOPE (Vasovagal Syncope) to be unlikely related. No further causality assessment was provided for PRODUCT ADMINISTERED TO PATIENT OF INAPPROPRIATE AGE (unauthorized age patient, 17 years of age).    No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   The patient did not receive any treatment. The event, SYNCOPE (vasovagal syncope) was an acute episode and recovered quickly within minutes.  Follow-up received on 06-APR-2021 included additional reporter information, date of vaccine administration, patient&#39;s race, ethnicity and other relevant medical history, start and dates of product administered and the events, anatomical location, and reporter causality.  This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered for mRNA-1273 (lot #unknown) with no associated syncope reported. The reporter considered SYNCOPE to be unlikely related.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 06-Apr-2021: additional reporter information, date of vaccine administration, patient&#39;s race, ethnicity and concurrent condition, additional event - Syncope, onset and stop dates of the event, - Product administered to patient of inappropriate age, injection site, and reporter causality.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This report refers to a case of inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered for mRNA-1273 (lot #unknown) with no associated syncope reported.The reporter considered SYNCOPE to be unlikely related.

She was breathing rapidly. She whispered that she was scared. I told her to take deep breaths to try and calm her. I asked if she felt hurt or if she has any trouble breathing. After about 3-5 minutes of lying on their ground, she became more alert and asked me if she fell from her chair. She didn&#39;t recall falling or that she said she was scared. I had her sit up and asked how she felt and if she had any symptoms of an allergic reaction--she said no. after another minute or 2, she was able to stand up on her own with no lightheadedness nor dizziness. I walked alongside her to another seat and she sat for another 25 to 30 minutes--she said she was completely fine before leaving with her sister

While returning to bed (to rest &amp; eat the small container of applesause) she felt as though she were going to pass out again &amp; quickly sat down on the steps.

                                                Minutes after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, patient complained of difficulty breathing.  I asked if she was wheezing and she said no.  A doctor in the clinic came over and even though it wasn&#39;t time for patient and her sister to leave (based on 15-minutes after receiving the vaccine) he initially suggested that they might be fine to go, but after patient told him of her symptoms and at my urging he decided to have her stay a little longer.   I think it was at this time that he had someone check her pulse.  I don&#39;t know what the pulse reading was.  He stepped away and shortly afterwards patient started complaining that her throat felt strange and was making it hard to breathe.  The doctor immediately came back over, found patient was having difficulty breathing and holding herself upright in the chair.  I held her by the shoulders to keep her from falling while the doctor also steadied her and asked a worker in the room for an epi-pen.  The worker didn&#39;t seem to react much to the request so he told her louder that he needed an epi-pen.  She started searching her area and the doctor started yelling across the room to others that he needed an epi-pen.  It seemed like others initially took the demand less urgently than they should, but eventually someone came with an epi-pen.  By this time I don&#39;t think patient was very conscious, if at all.  Sometime during this time the doctor also instructed someone to call 911.  The doctor tried using the epi-pen but at first he had some kind of cap on it that prevented it from working.  He removed the cap and not finding an easy way to have a sterilized injection site he injected the epi-pen through patient&#39;s jeans.  Soon afterwards a cot was brought out and workers had me step aside as they took patient and put her on the cot.  Patient seemed to gradually become more aware of her surroundings and it wasn&#39;t long before she appeared to me to be fully conscious once again.  They checked her blood pressure and pulse and maybe did other tests during this time.  Eventually the ambulance arrived and patient was very clear with everyone that she did not want to incur the expenses of riding in the ambulance and I offered to bring her wherever they suggested that she should go.  They watched and evaluated her for a while and eventually had her sign the form declining the ambulance transportation.  They suggested that she make an appointment with her doctor but did not suggest that we take patient to an emergency room.  We departed and patient did not afterward  seem to experience any symptoms from the vaccine other than some of the general feelings of being sick, soreness at the injection site, etc. that others report with the Moderna vaccine.

The patient&#39;s medical history included vasovagal condition that cause heart rate and blood pressure to drop due to stress on body and dehydration resulting in fainting. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 09 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 013M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 09 Feb 2021, the patient was fine until about 11 pm after which she experienced arm soreness on the injection site and felt nauseous.   On 10 Feb 2021, at 5 am in the morning, the patient fainted. The patient assumed that shot might have added stress to her body which most likely caused her to faint.   No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown. There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the event as patient would be receiving second dose on 09 Mar 2021.  The outcome of events, fainted (syncope), injection site soreness in arm (vaccination site pain), and nauseous (nausea), were considered as unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the reported events of syncope, vaccination site pain, and nausea, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s prior medical history of vasovagal reactions is considered a contributing factor to syncope.

                                                I developed Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (low levels of platelets) and menorrhagia due to the vaccine according to my doctor. I believe there have been about 30 cases of this occurring so far.   In my case, I took the vaccine and felt relatively tired for two days. There were no other symptoms. About a week later, I got my period after not having it for a couple months. The blooding was light for a few days, but then got extremely heavy. After about a week of very heavy bleeding, I went to urgent care. They took blood tests, and found that I had a critically low level of platelets (6 platelets when the normal range is 150-400). I was admitted to the ER for multiple days, and they gave a platelet transfusion and IVIG  fluids, which has helped considerably. I also had to take steroids to suppress my immune system so that my platelets could increase.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.   On 06 Jan 2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in her right deltoid for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 06 Jan 2021, the patient experienced a sore arm, fever, chills, itching and burning.   On 07 Jan 2021, on the site where the patient received the injection, she felt numbness and weak. Her whole right-side body would jerk uncontrollably. The patient went to two emergency rooms where they stated they did not know what was wrong and gave her a steroid injection that temporarily helped calm her down.   On 08 Jan 2021, the patient stared at the door and everything went blank. She could not talk and when she tried to talk, she felt like she had the hiccups. She experienced her whole chest hurting when she had a hiccup.   On 25 Jan 2021 and 26 Jan 2021, the patient saw two neurologists, who did testing. The patient&#39;s jerking was random, there were no triggers for it, and she did not know how to control or stop it. These adverse reactions made the patient become aggravated very quickly, which was not like her.   On an unknown date, the patient stated it was the first day in the past month she had been able to talk all day.  Treatment for the events included a steroid shot.   Action taken with the second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.   The outcome for the events, sore arm/ burning, fever, chills, itching, numbness, weak, whole right side would jerk uncontrollably, everything went blank, couldn&#39;t talk and when she tried to talk she felt like she had the hiccups and her whole chest hurt, and quickly became aggravated, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which indicates a strong temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the reported events a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Chills, fever, injection site pruritus and injection site pain are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.     On an unknown date, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    About 10 minutes after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, the patient passed out on the ground having a severe anaphylaxis allergic reaction.  Treatment for the event included two doses of epinephrine IM in addition to diphenhydramine, ondansetron, and steroids to prevent a rebound reaction. 911 was called and after epinephrine and diphenhydramine were administered, the patient was immediately transported to the hospital where she stayed for 6 more hours for observation, fluids, and further medications.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.

Once we left the consultation room, after about 2 minutes, the patient got my attention and complained of feeling dizzy. I went to her side, and she told me that she felt like she was going to pass out. The patient then proceeded to lose consciousness while sitting in a chair in the waiting area. She then exhibited seizure-like movements (muscles contracted, groaning sounds) for about 10 seconds, and she then regained consciousness. I administered no treatment, since this did not exhibit the signs of an anaphylactic reaction. 911 was called, and emergency medical services arrived. The patient was then taken to the hospital. The patient stated that she has had a similar reaction in the past to getting a vaccine, she thinks it is from the stress of getting injected with a needle.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a 23-year-old, female consumer who was also a patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced anaphylactic reaction.   The patient&#39;s medical history included allergy to amoxicillin. Concomitant medications reported included gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate, and montelukast sodium.  On 04 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 05 Jan 2021, within 24 hours of vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction. Treatment for the event included Diphenhydramine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not provided.  The outcome of the event, anaphylactic reaction, was considered resolved on 06 Jan 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 23 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction. Event occurred apparently within 24 hrs. after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# 011L20A) vaccine administration. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Did not throw up.  Did not eat anything rest of day until around 11:30 pm . Felt much more nauseated and stomach cramping. Said she felt light headed and then had what appears to be vasovagal with brief passing out and then revived and with sweats.  Was not confused . Did not loose continence.  Was completely coherent after event. Went to ER to be checked out. In ER was found to have UTI and given some Rochephin . Had severe face and body swelling reaction requiring benadryl.  Was observed and sent home after several hours. It was assumed that ER had reported this although it was felt by ER and us that this was vasovagal from not eating and nausea and UTI on top of that.  Did not feel was secondary to vaccine  . ER did not feel it was either. However while probably unrelated we felt should document it.

                                                I stay at my parents the night before work because their home is located much closer to work--my fiance and I live much farther away.   I received the vaccination around 10AM Sunday morning.  Sunday night I went to bed around 8:30PM and experienced severe chills throughout the night.  I awoke around 12AM and got up to get a drink.  I got a drink of water and checked my temperature, temp was 100.7.  I felt yucky but not horrible.  I walked back to my parents&#39; room to tell them I would be staying home from work.  As I got to their room and began to speak, I began to feel nauseous and weak and suddenly collapsed.  My dad leaped up and helped me stand up so I could get to the restroom.  I walked a few steps and then collapsed again and lost complete consciousness--I do not recall collapsing again or what happened shortly after.  Per my dad, I was unresponsive, and he drug my limp body from his bedroom to the bathroom.  My mom called 911.  After several minutes, I regained consciousness and was leaning against my dad in the bathroom.  I felt my fever break and was sweating profusely.  EMS arrived at my home and checked vitals--everything was stable.  I was A&amp;O x3 and was able to drink water.   I declined being transported to the hospital.  I felt the loss of consciousness was likely due to dehydration or fever (although my fever really wasn&#39;t that high).

This lasted for about a week, I then became short of breath and tacchychardic. I went to the ER and was admitted for 5 days where they said I had acute bronchitis that triggered reactive asthma. I?m now on steroids and a bunch of medication. This all followed my first dose of Moderna as I?ve never had breathing issues before hand. I?ve never had bronchitis or asthma in my life so this is all new. I am now experiencing nerve pain on my left side which is where I received the vaccine.

Immunizing pharmacist yelled out for Rapid Response from the ER.  Emergency room staff was on scene within 1 minute.  They measured patients pulse and BP and took her to the emergency room for monitoring.  Patient was gone from immunizing area for 30 minutes.  She came back to see us, looking much better and said that she faints all the time.  She remarked she was glad she was seated because when she faints when she stands and hits her head she has a sore head for days.  She proceeded to schedule her second vaccination utilizing the QR reader we had provided to all patients.  Although she didn&#39;t tell us beforehand, afterward she told us she faints all the time, that it isn&#39;t unusual, and that she had deliberately eaten food and drank plenty of liquids before she came so that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem.  Patient stated that she was fine and fit to drive and unconcerned about the reaction.

Family member reports my eyes were open with absent stare however I lost consciousness, &lt;60s. My right calf was in a severe muscle spasm as soon as I became conscious which leads me to believe I had some convulsions. Nausea chills and generalized pain persisted throughout the rest of the morning. Stopped around 10 am and turned into pounding headache and fatigue.  Additionally my left arm is in moderate to severe pain (not like the typical soreness I get with the flu shot). I am in  significant  pain  moving my arm, but also changing body positions while keeping my shoulder still and close to my body (bending over, scooting over in bed).

No history of anaphylaxis. She received vaccine at 5:42. Felt lightheaded and dizzy about 5 to 10 minutes after the vaccine. She noted chest tightness and tachycardia symptoms. We transported her via gurney to our observation area. She looked sleepy and had trouble arousing her. Blood pressure is 140/80, heart rate was in the 90s to 100s. Breath sound decreased bilaterally. No lip swelling. No rash. She noted throat felt uncomfortable.  Suspect anaphalxis reaction given rapid decline in status while talking with her. epic pen at bedside immediately and then due to increasing heart rate and complaints of chest discomfort gave her epipen times one. Paramedics were called prior to decision for Epipen.  She noted after a minute or two her chest felt better. Monitored her and blood pressure remains stable 140/80&#39;s, heart rate initially increase to 110 and then back down to 100 about 5 minutes after the first dose. Second dose of EPI readied as Paramedics not on site yet. At about 8 minutes from EPipen dose her heart rate increase to 160 and she noted additional symptoms of chest tightness again and re-gave a second Epinephrine pen. She was more somnolent but protecting airway. Oxygen was added 2 liters after second epi pen. Her sats dropped right around second epi pen to 94% but about 2-3 minutes later back to 98%. Paramedics arrived 5 minutes after 2nd epi dose and care was transferred to them. She was transported in stable condition.   Once paramedics arrived it was determined that they got a level 3 request which was not as urgent and this should have been a level 1.  We reviewed how this happened and they note that our site was listed as a level 3 site due to having staff on hand.  We were advised to ask for LEVEL 1 paramedics in futures.  This was communicated to all Medical staff as well as the Physician of the day orientation.

                                                On January 21 I received my first dose of Moderna vaccine on my left arm. After the vaccine I had a red lump that was hot and a bruise that only lasted 2 days. Everything was fine until the January 28th when I developed a large red lump during the day while at work that was severely itchy and hot. When I got home from work I had a low grade fever. I made an appointment with my primary care for the next day which was Friday the 29th. My doctor told me she believes I had cellulitis. I was given an antibiotic 2x a day for 7 days. She drew a purple circle around the area and told me that if it goes outside the marked area or I feel any new symptoms, to go to the emergency room. Saturday morning on the 30th  i woke up to my entire arm red and hot. I felt like I had a huge sunburn. I couldn?t put my sweatshirt on because it was so hot. The emergency room doctor told me I was fine and to keep taking the antibiotics that were given to me yesterday from my primary care doctor. After the emergency room I went to work and started to feel dizzy and nauseous. My hands became sweaty but the rest of my body was cold. I started having a butterfly feeling in my chest. My Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was over 100 bpm. That night before bed I had another low grade fever. On Sunday the 31st I noticed the red area was gone but instead it was a dark purple. I felt okay Sunday besides a rapid pulse. Monday February 1st I woke up out of a dead sleep sweating, butterfly feeling in my chest and dizzy. I tried to take my pulse while laying down but it was so fast I couldn?t keep up with it. I put my Apple Watch on which alerted me immediately that my pulse was 152 bpm. I slowly got up but then I passed out falling off of my bed. I couldn?t get any words out because my heart was beating so fast that I couldn?t breathe. I was sweating horribly and had a hard time walking. Had absolutely no strength in my left hand, my arm was purple/red, cold and numb. My arm felt like someone punched me repeatedly and gave me a dead arm. I called my primary doctors office and they were able to get me in that afternoon. All morning my pulse was spiking and then drastically dropping. About an hour and a half before I went to the doctor everything was fine. I was able to talk but still struggled with breathing while talking. The doctor ordered an EKG which came back clear. My pulse and blood pressure was also fine. The doctor told me she believed all of the symptoms I had were from the medication I take at night (doxazosin-to relax my muscles and help with sleep.) She also told me she believed some of it was my mental health issues taking over. She told me the cellulitis looked fine and sent me home. Later that day I felt exhausted and when I woke up from a nap, I had a fever of 100.5. Took Tylenol and it dropped to 99.5 but wouldn?t go any lower. February 2nd  I woke up to a large red ring outside of the purple marker, numb finger tips and butterfly feeling in my chest. All day I received alerts that my pulse was falling and spiking. I sent my primary doctor an email and she told me she didn?t think it was cellulitis anymore, maybe a hematoma but she wasn?t sure. Since January 28th I still struggle everyday with the butterfly feeling in my chest, blurry vision, low grade temps, alerts of pulse, dizziness and breathing difficulties. My arm is always hot, my finger tips are numb and sometimes the strength in my hand is gone. The top of my arm is always a dark purple with red blotches and other times my entire arm is red and hot. When my pulse is very fast, I have a hard time talking, remembering what I was going to say and focusing. I?ve had multiple coworkers ask me if I?m okay because I?ll randomly stop talking and stare off and then I?m alerted that my pulse has either spiked or dropped drastically after spiking. My pulse is never consistent. It is always ranging from 57-155bpm. I realized at first I may have what they call ?COVID arm? but my symptoms haven?t gotten any better. No answers have been given to me or a diagnosis. The first diagnosis that they thought was cellulitis. Then it was ?in my head and behavioral.? Then it was a hematoma. Now it?s an ?I don?t know.? I have tried Benadryl for the itching, ice packs for the days that I?m swollen, Tylenol for the fevers and pain but I never have any relief.

                                                I had on-and-off insomnia starting around 10pm. I woke up every thirty minutes on the minute with a feeling like there was a fifty pound vest on my body.  At 3:30, I felt nauseous. I walked from my bedroom to downstairs to the kitchen. My knees buckled several times en route. When I ate one bite of a protein bar, my nausea increased tenfold. I ask drank water at the time.   I walked back upstairs to my room to sleep where remained awake until ~five am. I slept from ~five am until approximately 8:10am. I felt faint as I walked into the bathroom where I felt my faintness increase by the second. My knees buckled and I passed out on the bathroom floor tile for ~five - ten seconds. I payed there for a few minutes until I felt stable to stand.   This morning, 45 hours after the injection and 22 hours after blacking out, I felt a goose egg on the back of my head. It has hurt all day at a level 4/10 on the pain scale.

When I was at the counter to grab the medication (about 5 min after getting out of bed), I felt suddenly nauseous and saw stars. I woke up on the floor (syncope), ran to the bathroom and started vomiting. I do not know how long I was unconscious for.

                                                Patient  came to the center for a Moderna vaccine at 5pm. The patient expressed that she felt dizzy shortly after immunization (before leaving the immunization chair). Her head began to fall backwards so I quickly supported the patient&#39;s head and neck area and was able to keep her from falling out of her chair. The patient fainted but regained consciousness approximately 3 seconds later. The patient came back alert but nauseous. The patient vomited in a trashcan and then felt fine. The patient blamed the reaction on her severe anxiety and said the exact same thing happened after a nose piercing. I observed the patient for 30 minutes and sent her on her way. The patient left healthy and happy. I told the patient to warn the pharmacist prior to receiving her second dose. No drugs were administered. Written up in SCRT and VAERS. I followed up with the patient at 7 pm and she was home safe.

She was immediately assisted by a pharmacist onsite, who helped the patient to lie on the ground with her legs elevated.  The patient immediately regained consciousness and was speaking normally. The patient was monitored closely for approximately 45 minutes. At that time, the patient reported feeling no symptoms or side effects, and was allowed to leave with instructions to seek appropriate medical attention if needed for further symptoms.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No Medical History information was reported.    On 17-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 17-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SYNCOPE (Fainted), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)). On 18-Apr-2021, the patient experienced FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol). On 19-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work). On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) and FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug). On 28-Apr-2021, the patient experienced SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period) and PALLOR (Pale as a ghost). At the time of the report, SYNCOPE (Fainted) had resolved, SOMNOLENCE (Cannot keep eyes open at work), SKIN TIGHTNESS (face feels like it&#39;s tightening), ANXIETY (Anxiety high), GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH DETERIORATION (general health bad), FAECES DISCOLOURED (diarrhea has been all kinds of colors(now orange)/black when she was taking Pepto-Bismol), FOREIGN BODY IN GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT (little stomach bug), DYSMENORRHOEA (painful menstrual period), PALLOR (Pale as a ghost), NAUSEA (Nausea) and PYREXIA (consistent low grade fever (100F to 100.4F)) outcome was unknown and DIARRHOEA (severe non-stop diarrhea since the day she got her vaccine) had not resolved. Not Provided      The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       No concomitant medications were reported. Treatment medications include Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate) for diarrhea for 1.5 days (unknown dose/frequency).  Patient waited out 20 minutes post-vaccination and then went to the bathroom. When she came out of bathroom she fainted, paramedics were summoned. Mother took patient to Emergency Room(ER) 20 April 2021, after taking her first to urgent care (who directed mother to take patient to the ER), ER sent her home saying it was just a little stomach bug, but no one else in the family got this &#34;bug&#34;.  Patient&#39;s last test for Covid-19 was on Monday (26-Apr-2021) and results came back negative on 28-Apr-2021. Company comment: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the other events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Pyrexia and nausea are consistent with the product established safety profile.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event of faeces discolored is assessed as unlikely due to mRNA-1273 administration but due ingesting Pepto-Bismol.

The vaccine was administered to my left arm without complication at approximately 1:00pm (my scheduled appointment). I proceeded to the area designated for patients to be observed after receiving the vaccine and was asked to wait 15 minutes. I recall getting to the observation area then telling my spouse I felt unwell - after the event he notified me that I told him I was about to pass out and asked him to get medical help. I lost consciousness approximately 5-10 minutes following the vaccine. My husband reported that after losing consciousness I seemed to have a minor seizure, as evidenced by my head jerking and my arms and fingers &#34;tensing and curling up&#34;.  I was sitting in the passenger seat of my car at this time, so I suffered no fall or fall related injury. Public health officials and EMT responded. They indicated to my spouse that I had experienced a vasovagal syncope episode and that I had &#34;gone tonic&#34;/ had a &#34;tonic seizure&#34;.  They took my blood pressure, which was very low (I don&#39;t recall exactly but it was 80 over something). They also took my blood sugar among other things that I do not recall.  I was given oxygen and put into an ambulance. I was shaking, so they wrapped me in blankets. I believe they may have done an EKG and placed a blood pressure cuff while I was in the ambulance, but I do not recall any specifics about this. The EMT also drew my blood, placed an IV, and administered IV fluids while I was in the ambulance. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency department

I went to get a snack so I could take more pain reliever and I passed out and briefly blacked out my vision. When I came to, all the lights in my apartment were on but I had to use my hands to feel where my bed was so I could get back in. My TV was on but I realized that I couldn?t hear it. All I could hear was a buzzing/wooshing sound and realized my hearing was gone and when I scratched my head and I couldn?t hear the sound on my scalp. It came back about 30 minutes later but happened again the next time I stood up. By around 4am I was in so much joint pain I couldn?t lie down anymore and had to run a bath so I could relieve some of the pain.  I?m still in a lot of pain but I don?t have the nausea anymore as strongly.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after the patient got her second moderna vaccine she became faint and dizzy. The patient was sitting at the time. A law enforcement officer witnessed her becoming faint and ran over to attend her. I was called over to assess her as well. The law enforcement officer called EMS. The patient stated that she felt faint, dizzy, she said she had a headache, blurry vision, and was nauseous. The patient appeared sweaty and she appeared to loose consciousness briefly twice. She did not show any signs of redness, rash, or swelling. After sitting for a few minutes, and before EMS arrived, the patient said she was improving. She did not lose consciousness anymore but she still had a headache, nausea, and blurry vision. When EMS arrived they recommended that she get checked out at the emergency room, but the patient refused stating that she did not want to go to the hospital and that she was feeling better. The patient called her parents and they came and picked her up.
