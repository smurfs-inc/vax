                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at her place of employment as a phase 1A essential frontline healthcare worker in a skilled nursing LTC facility on January 6 2021. The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

                                                It bled a little, right away I felt jittery. Later that night I got chills, and I had to change my shirt twice because I was drenched in sweat.  The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

They removed the tube in the hospital, (she remained in the hospital) First she was hospitalized and then she was transferred to the Medical Center Hospital to auscultate bleeding in the stool and to be evaluated by the Gastroenterologist. This specialist performs the necessary studies, they do not give a diagnosis and in the process she dies. The hospital indicated that she had a blood drain and heart failure.

                                                Had my first Moderna vaccine on 3/3/2021 and have been diagnosed  with pneumonia in left lung on 3/15/2021. Visited my surgeon who follows up with me every 6 months. She listened to my lungs and said she heard crackles in my left lung. Sent me for a chest x-ray immediately after visit on 3/15/2021.  I am having no symptoms such as coughing, fever, etc.  I?m concerned this could be a side effect of the vaccine. Was also tested for Covid on 3/17/2021. Test result was NEGATIVE.

                                                She got her vaccine and had no reactions at all.  On 3/12/21 she was in her car and started having stabbing pain in the left side of her chest under the rib.  She thought it was gas pains and dismissed it, and then it started radiating towards the front and the stomach.  On 3/16/21 she went to the ER and they did a CT scan that showed that she had a blood clot on her spleen.  With that they gave her the diagnosis of idiopathic splenic infarction.  She was then sent by ambulance to another hospital to be admitted in case she was needing surgery.  She was given heparin and on that for 2 1/2 days.  They determined that 60% of her spleen is dead, blood supply cut off to it, and the other 40% is nonfunctional.  On 3/19/21 they gave her vaccines of Prevnar 13, HIB, meningococcal, meningococcal B, and a flu vaccine.  She was discharged on the 3/20/21 with Plavix.  She saw her regular doctor yesterday and he diagnosed her with functional asplenia and to continue the Plavix.   She is no longer having any symptoms after dissolving the blood clot.

                                                On February 5th, I received my second Moderna vaccine.  Monday the 8th, I was working from home and wasn?t feeling well.  I went to lay down and was not able to.  It was hard to breath.  I got up, went to another room where there was a recliner and sat in it trying to catch my breath.  It got harder to breathe.  I had my husband call 911. I went to the ER, had a CT scan of my chest and was found to have ?extensive PE?s?, ground glass and signs of pneumonitis.   I was admitted to the CICU for two days and was transferred for two days.  I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that there was a high unlikelihood of PE?s developing from my ankle fracture 3 months later.  I had home health care for approximately one month.

At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

I spent 4 days in the PPC ward and now home trying to recover from this... I was told my condition was very serious and was lucky I came in... Of course the doctors will not say this was a direct link to the shot ... i never had any problems before and never any blood clots.  The doctor who did the procedure told me to make sure I REPORTED IT.... I was released from the hospital on the afternoon of the 21st.. 4 days!

The patient&#39;s medical history, as reported, included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome.  On 24 Jan 2021, about 15 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24 Jan 2021, 30 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient took prednisone (dose unknown), per instructions from her doctor due to her history of anaphylactic reactions. She did notify the vaccinators of her history and there was an ambulance present. About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient started coughing, had heavy chest pain, trouble breathing, and felt like her throat was constricting more than usual. No rash developed. She approached the ambulance and asked if she could take diphenhydramine. She took one dose, followed by 3 other doses, and felt a bit better. Consent given for Safety to follow up with patient.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event, anaphylactic reaction was resolving at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62 year old female patient with medical history of included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome. She experienced a serious unexpected event of Anaphylactic reaction that needed treatment diphenhydramine. The event occurred approximately 15 minutes after first dose of the study medication administration even thought the patient took prednisone prior to receiving the vaccine. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient reported the following: I went to the ER last Thursday because my left leg was red and swollen.  They did a sonogram and the results came back as tendentious and a superficial blood clot.   The ER physician at Health suggested that I report the blood clot because it is of unknown origin and I did receive both vaccines.

On 03/27/2021, her nausea continued and she complained of shortness of breath while walking. On 03/28/2021, she was short of breath before vomiting a small amount. She then became unresponsive. Death was pronounced a short time later.  Per her treating physician who signed the death certificate, the cause of death is felt to be probable myocardial infarction due to electrolyte abnormalities due to complications of her diabetes mellitus.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                She was transferred from one ER to another for intraparenchymal bleed and subarachnoid hemorrhage with midline shift. On the week of April 11th she was seen by her periodontist of a bone graft in preparation for a tooth implant. She took minimal ibuprofen and norco after this procedure. However, she also began to feel very nauseated which led to anorexia and worsening malaise. This prompted the pt to present to ER on 4/16 evening, where was given Phenergan, and discharged to home. Symptoms worsened and she re-presented to ED where she was admitted and diagnosed with UTI and colitis. She was started on ciprofloxacin. She denied having had any dysuria or diarrhea. Patient&#39;s son says that at 0130 on 4/19 his mother was using both sides of her extremities equally. She had been complaining of headache and leg pain, but by 0130 on 4/19 family did not notice any other obvious changes in patient&#39;s movements or behavior. However, at 0730 on 4/19 nurses noticed that patient was unable to move her L arm or leg. She had a CT scan done, which revealed multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages bilaterally as well as subarachnoid hemorrhage with midline shift. The transferring physician told me that patient had not been on any anticoagulation. Patient and her family deny any history of falls or trauma, denied family history of coagulopathies, and use of blood thinners (including aspirin). No records, labs, or inpatient med list was sent with patient upon transfer. Family says that patient had her first Moderna COVID19 vaccine 3 weeks ago and was due for her second vaccine on 4/23. Labs on admit here are significant for leukocytosis with WBC of 21.9, Hgb of 12.1, platelets of 306, sodium of 140, potassium of 3.1, Bicarb of 22, creatinine of 0.7, glucose of 126, magnesium of 1.8, INR of 1.2. Patient is normotensive, afebrile, and satting well on room air.  Angiogram showed multiple cortical vein thromboses.  Will send hypercoagulable work up, HIT antibody given COVID vaccine 3 weeks ago (Moderna).

When I arrived by car at my destination, I checked into a motel, looked into the mirror and noticed my left side of my face was drooping.   I knew this was sign of stroke.  I called 911 right away.  I was taken to hospital.  They did a CBC the night I arrived and the next day as well.  They did 2 cat scans with and without contrast.  Dr. in the ER determined that I had suffered a Transient Ischemic Attack which was brought on in less than 24hours of the 2nd Modern vaccine shot, and that the TIA was from the vaccine.  THe cat scans did not reveal any blood clots at the time of the scans.  Dr. concluded that they had broken up quickly and that was why  he diagnosed me with TIA.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

So that night, I checked my temperature and had a low grade fever. I took a COVID test on 1/6 and was positive and I got treatment on 1/7. I ended up being out of work for two months due to a sinus infection and pneumonia. I&#39;m still experiencing symptoms such as lung inflammation and SOB, so I&#39;m on an inhaler, nasal spray, allergy meds and I did a sputum test today. I&#39;m also scheduled to see a pulmonologist, who I also saw prior to COVID for breathing issues. I&#39;ve had to do 3 rounds of antibiotics to resolve my pneumonia.

                                                Very hard to breath for few minutes; Swollen arm; Nausea; Headaches; Blood clogging; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 63 years old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced events very hard to breath for few minutes/dyspnoea, blood clogging/thrombosis, headaches, nausea, swollen arm/peripheral swelling.  The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 15 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 027L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 08 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 0101M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The first dose of vaccine was taken in non dominant arm and second dose was taken in right dominant arm.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced swollen arm. In between the two doses she felt very hard to breath for few minutes and when she took a deep breath it was fine. She had tylenol for the headaches after the second dose on 08 February 2021. She also had nausea along with headaches. She had blood clogging when she was in a blood donation camp. The event very hard to breath for few minutes and blood clogging were considered as medically significant. Thiamine was provided as medication  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  Follow-up received on 17 Mar 2021 included updated date for first dose of vaccine, and the events very hard to breath for few minutes/dyspnoea, blood clogging/thrombosis.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a strong temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Nausea and headache are consistent with the safety profile of the product

Patient is not an established patient and did not receive care for her symptoms at our facility:  On March 18th I received my 2nd Moderna vaccination. On Friday the 19th at approximately 4 pm I began to have the symptoms of an immune response in my body. Sat the 20th was spent in bed with chills, body aches, fever, stiff neck, and bad headache. On Sunday I was having pain on inhalation along with everything else.  Monday the pain resolved into left side lung pain on inhalation. Tuesday the 23rd I called my provider who directed me to go to the Emergency Dept. I drove to Superior Hospital. After being accessed I was transported; with pericarditis and the additional mentioned immune response symptoms, and a pronounced heart murmur. On Wednesday the 24 I shook uncontrollably with chills for 4 hours and 2 min and went into atrial fib for about 12 minutes, resolved with medication.  Thursday the 25th I woke to all symptoms being gone. I was released on Friday the 26th with the statement my issues had resolved themselves. I was told to report this to where I got my vaccine so it could be passed along.

Concurrent medical conditions included Rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant products included METHOTREXATE for Rheumatoid arthritis, FOLIC ACID, ALENDRONATE SODIUM (FOSAMAX), VITAMIN B12 [VITAMIN B12 NOS] and CALCIUM for an unknown indication.   On 02-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 30-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DELIRIUM (Sounded delirious) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), APHASIA (Could not form words) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTOLIC INCREASED (My blood pressure was 250 over something) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Apr-2021 to 05-Apr-2021 due to APHASIA, BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTOLIC INCREASED, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT and DELIRIUM. On 05-Apr-2021, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) had resolved. At the time of the report, DELIRIUM (Sounded delirious), APHASIA (Could not form words) and BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTOLIC INCREASED (My blood pressure was 250 over something) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In 2021, Blood pressure systolic: 250 (High) 250. In 2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) confirmed that Patient had a stroke.         Patient stated that on 3APR2021, 4 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, she experienced a stroke. She says that she was with her daughter and per her daughter, the patient starting sounding delirious and not making any sense. She could not form words. The patient&#39;s daughter called 911. When the paramedics checked her blood pressure, the systolic number was 250. Patient does not remember the diastolic blood pressure. She was told to go to the ER. When she reached there, she says that she was having difficulty forming words. This was happening randomly and not all the time. She was admitted to the hospital for 2 days. An MRI done at the hospital confirmed that the patient had suffered a stroke. She was put on Lipitor and Plavix at the hospital and told to continue those medications for a month. She was discharged from the hospital and sent back home on 5APR2021. She states that with all the tests that were done at the hospital, the doctors are unsure what could have caused the stroke.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA adverse event.   Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.  Patient then transferred to another hospital that could provide neurosurgical intervention.

                                                On April 13th, patient noted a black spot in her vision with her right eye. As the day progressed, she began experiencing a headache which worsened in severity despite treating with medication. She started treating with Tramadol; when that didn&#39;t help, she took her prescription oxycodone (5mg/325mg) 3 hours later, q6 hours x 2. That evening, patient experienced 1 episode of emesis and thought she may not be feeling well, so went to bed. When she woke the next morning, she felt better, but still noted the black spot in her vision. She sought care with her Ophthalmologist, who evaluated her, and he did not believe it was related to her vision.  He referred her for an MRI, immediately. MRI revealed a stroke in the occipital region. She was admitted and given IV fluid along with another panel of testing. She was seen by Neurologist and Hospitalist; more testing was completed on Friday, including bloodwork which revealed high potassium levels which was treated. She was also given 1 unit of blood. She discharged on Friday and was started on Clopidogrel (75 mg). Follow up appointments are scheduled with eye doctor, neurology, internist.  Right eye was affected and vision will not likely return, per her doctors.

                                                Patient had the first Moderna Covid vaccine on Thursday 1/21/2021.  She had a bit of sore arm on that day and the day after.  On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

                                                After my 2nd dose Moderna vaccine, I experienced chills, fever, nausea, coughing and was coughing up mucus. The day after felt very weak and ate very little, had only sprite to drink, water and crackers. The next day my legs buckled up and felt weakness to my legs. My cough started to get worse and on 02-03-2021 I went to an urgent care facility where x-rays of the chest were performed. They also performed a Covid test. The x-ray of the chest demonstrated a touch of pneumonia in my right lung. I was given steroid medication and places on antibiotics and it is when I started to slowly feel better. I do not know what cause my symptoms after my second dose.  I also received my first dose Moderna vaccine on 01-01-2021 and I only had left arm soreness but no other reaction. (Lot#: 037K20A)

It was harder to breathe and I could not even take a shower that I would be out of breath. My daughter checked my pulsox and it was 85. I couldn&#39;t really walk or do anything so my daughter  transported me to ER and lots of labs were done so since my D Dimer was too high they did a CT scan and it showed some blood clots in my lungs. They admitted me because they were concerned with the location of one of them. They did some heart tests too and put me on Eloquis and then sent me home. I stayed for 2 days. Then they scheduled me FUs with a heart doctor and a pulmonologist.

                                                Noticed bleeding in the mouth/gums. Looked inside and found bloody holes in my cheeks about 1/2&#34; big. I noticed the top of my hands we also very bruised although I did not get hurt. I went to the ER and they took me in and ran blood tests. They diagnosed me with Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura. My platelet level was at 8,000, and 6 months prior I was at 180-200,000. They began giving me platelets and were working up to giving my Immunoglobulen. After 2 doses of platelets they gave me 2 doses of benadryl intravenously and I had a scary reaction (I&#39;ve never had a reaction to benadryl prior to vaccine). My body went numb, it felt like my muscles fell asleep, I felt like I could not breath. It&#39;s as if my body attacked anything that came in. Then I was given a sedative to calm down.  As the sedative faded I began feeling immense pain in my abdomen, they thought it was internal bleeding, but after a CT scan they found 3 kidney stones. I was then put on fluids. Due to pain, my blood pressure went up and stayed up for about 8-10 hrs at around 255. I was given about 3 does of blood pressure medication throughout that time to lower it as well as morphine to help with the pain.  The next morning (Day 3) I was finally given the Immunoglobulin (3 bottles = 1 dose). platelets went up to about 60,000. Then I was given a second dose and released on day 4 (but the second dose was not completed in full, only 1 or 2 bottles of the 3 were given. I was released and came back after 2 days for a blood test. I was given steroids to take for a few months.   My platelets were at 120,000. I thought that I was getting better, but then a few days letter came in for another blood test and it showed I was back at 60,000 platelets. Thats where I am now.

Immediately felt a little lightheaded during the 15 min window afterward but was able to ambulate independently with walker just afterward.  After taking a nap, she woke with a headache, chills, a little shaky and feeling very tired.  She was able to eat and take Tylenol at the time.  For the rest of the day, she felt under the weather.  The next morning she was very weak, unable to ambulate and tachycardic prompting nursing staff to send her to the hospital for assessment.

The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Concurrent medical conditions included COPD exacerbation (On 2 liters of oxygen at baseline), Squamous cell carcinoma of lung, Schizoaffective disorder and oxygen.    On 30-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 06-Apr-2021, the patient experienced COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (COVID-19 pneumonia) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and COVID-19 (COVID-19 infection) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On 16-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). On an unknown date, the patient experienced RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Hypoxic respiratory failure) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant) and SEPSIS (sepsis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized until 21-Apr-2021 due to COVID-19, COVID-19 PNEUMONIA, DYSPNOEA, RESPIRATORY FAILURE and SEPSIS. At the time of the report, RESPIRATORY FAILURE (Hypoxic respiratory failure), SEPSIS (sepsis), COVID-19 PNEUMONIA (COVID-19 pneumonia) and COVID-19 (COVID-19 infection) had resolved and DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath) was resolving.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In April 2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) multifocal pneumonia in the setting of chronic Interstitial changes..     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment information provided included 6L O2 Nasal cannula, Remdesivir for 5 days (stop date : 20 - Apr - 2021) ,Decadron for 6 days (stop date : 21 - Apr - 2021) . The patient was discharged on 21 Apr 2021 to rehabilitation on baseline 2L O2  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                3 DAYS AFTER THE 2ND INJECTION, I DEVELOPED 2 BLOOD CLOTS AT THE BASE OF MY LUNGS - 1 ON EACH LUNG. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT, I DEVELOPED SEVER PAIN IN MY LOWER RIGHT FLANK AREA THAT RADIATED TO MY SHOULDER AS WELL AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THERE IS NO HISTORY IN MY FAMILY OF ANY CLOTTING ISSUES AND I MYSELF HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A THING OCCUR.  THE PAIN BECAME SO BAD IT FORCED ME TO GO TO A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPT.  AFTER CT SCANS CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF THE CLOTS, I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADMITTED FOR OBSERVATION ON A REGIMEN OF DRUGS, BLOOD THINNER, PAIN MED, AND A CLOT BUSTER (NOT SURE WHICH MANUFACTURER.)  I AM STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN IN MY RIGHT FLANK AREA - SOMEWHAT RADIATING TO MY RIGHT SHOULDER DAY 1 POST DISCHARGE AND AM HAVING TO RELY ON OPIOID PAIN MED AS WELL AS THE CLOT BUSTING MED AND A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MED. TO ME, IT SEEMS THAT THIS MAY NOT BE JUST COINCIDENTAL.  I WAS FEELING FINE PRIOR TO THE S 2ND DOSE OF THE MODERNA VAC AND THIS SEEMS TO ME THAT IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE 2 DOSE.

                                                Blood clots in arm; Arm was sore; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 67-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced sore arm/pain in arm and blood clot in her arm/thrombosis.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included diabetes. Concomitant medications were not included.  On 15 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of  mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031M20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 15 Feb 2021, post vaccination the patient experienced sore arm and her condition got worse. She was then taken to emergency room with blood clots in her arm.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.   The outcome of the events, sore arm and blood clot in her arm, were not known.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67-year-old, female patient, who experienced thrombosis and pain in arm. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of diabetes is a risk factor. Further information has been requested.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

After that she had numbness, tingling and itching in left side of her face, which has stayed. Then, almost immediately after shot she had an anaphylactic reaction: throat tightening and problems breathing. In the ER, they gave her Benadryl and that was enough to stop it. Now, she says the numbness is similar to being numb from going to the dentist.

                                                My mom was very ill with fever like symptoms following her first vaccination on January 26th. The symptoms were even worse after her second vaccination March 2nd and included muscle cramping in her legs. Once she was recovered she only had a persistent cough which she attributed to allergies as the pollen count had been high. In the early morning hours of March 19th she was having difficulty breathing and chest pains. She was rushed to the emergency room where she subsequently died of cardio pulmonary embolism which the coroner indicated began within three weeks of her death.

                                                I developed severe lower back/flank pain about 4 days after receiving my 2nd Moderna vaccination.  The pain was most pronounced while lying supine and , while in that position, manifested a creeping , fluid nature, i.e. migrating from my lower back to my shoulder.  I was unable to lie down comfortably.  In thinking about the nature of this pain, I determined that it was possibly/probably from a PE as it seemed as if  pain was migrating from my lower back to my shoulder.  I&#39;m &#34;not a doctor but play one on TV&#34; (LOL ) so surmised that it was something serious that  decided that this was something needing attention.  I presented to a hospital ER for care and was ultimately told I had 2 small PE blood clots - 1 in the base of each lung.  My diagnosis was confirmed by a CT scan and I was subsequently admitted for observation.  I was discharged the following day with blood thinners and blood pressure medication.

Patient used Benadryl to treat it. 2 days later the raised effect and hardness had gone away, however the redness spread over most of the shoulder area, and 2 days after that had spread halfway down her upper arm. The itch remained. Patient went to a previously scheduled appointment with our primary care physician who said that she had had a DAR (delayed anaphylactic reaction) and should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                I did experience some headache and lethargy on Sat. so laid low. I did go for a walk about 3:30 walking up hill at times as is usual. I did have an appetite and prepared dinner. I did not go to work (child play therapist). Sunday I felt more myself and did notice the soreness in my arm was surely not as bothersome as with the first shot. Had a very active day, no walk but yoga class.  Prepared a nice dinner for VD and settled in to view television later in the evening. Strangely, the memory of the exact nature of how this started eludes me, but I do recall experiencing discomfort in the very upper extremities of my chest. Sharing this with my husband he wondered if it may have had something to do with sleeping on my right side cramping the rib area due to not sleeping on my left side because of the shot. I also pondered if it might be related to my gym workout on Thursday ?  I recall feeling tired and headed to bed. I recall awakening to use the bathroom and feeling a slight brief bout of dizziness. When I did awaken the next morning the chest discomfort was still present to I called the Health Center and was advised to go to the ER. The EKG was fine. The troponin level was elevated to 0.19 so I was told I had suffered a mild myocardial infarction and I was going to the ICU.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

                                                On March 5th I experienced shortness of breath around 1:30 that lasted for 10 minutes.  I had no other symptoms and it subsided. On 3/9 around 2:30 am I had another episode of shortness of breath that lasted about 5 minutes. I was able to return to sleep. I went to work that morning and had shortness of breath, sweating, and dizziness. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed with an acute saddle pulmonary embolism.   I was admitted and started on IV heparin.  On 3/10, I was also found to have a DVT in my right leg.

By the time I sat down, I realized I had no feeling or use from the left side of my body including my face. I also had trouble communicating. Could not form complete sentences. The entire left side of my face was drooping. At that moment my husband immediately called 911.  I was taken to the hospital by ambulance where i was immediately treated and diagnosed with a stroke. They administered TPA. I spent 3 days in the ICU. I have since been treated with blood pressure medication, blood thinners and statins.

                                                The next day after vaccine was given, I got vaginal spotting/breakthrough  bleeding. I am postmenopausal and on HRT and have been for 14 years and have not had any spotting after menopause and HRT was started. This highly unusual. Today, I also got a little spotting in the afternoon, like yesterday. So this is the second day in a row. I do not have any discomfort. I contacted my doctor late today and left a message for her. I do hope she will contact me tomorrow. I have heard that there are some new symptoms  reported in the UK regarding female gynecological  side effects like changes in  menstrual cycle, which would not apply directly to me, but maybe similar symptoms?  I am hoping the spotting will stop soon.  The question is, would a 2nd dose be advised or not?

At ~9:45pm, my wife suddenly fell unconscious. Immediate CPR &amp; with Paramedic were not able to revive her. SHE PASSED AWAY at home. We believe it may be triggered by the vaccine.  Did not have a chance to go to hospital or emergency room - it was too sudden. A sad day for us.

                                                spontaneous bleed; bruise on the shin; sore arm; hives; nose bleed; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 69 years-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced sore arm, hives, nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin.    The patient&#39;s medical history included Von Willebrand Disease and breast cancer. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 JAN 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 012L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date post-vaccination, the patient experienced a sore arm and some hives. Approximately two weeks after the first dose, the patient experienced a spontaneous bleed resulting in a huge bruise on the shin the size of the palm of their hand. The patient consulted their Hematologist who performed blood work which was perfect. There were no abnormal results. The physician administered DDAVP.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced their first nose bleed described as &#34;horrific&#34;.  The patient reported they had blood gushing out of their nose and that they bled for four hours. The patient ended up in the hospital emergency department where they were sprayed with DDAVP to stop the bleeding.  Treatment details included DDAVP.  There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the events.  The events, nose bleed and spontaneous bleed were considered not recovered / not resolved.  The outcome of the events sore arm, hives, and bruise on the shin was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and the patient&#39;s history of Von Willebrand Disease, a causal association between the events nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin with mRNA-1273 use is assessed as unlikely.  However, based on temporal association, causality for the events of sore arm and hives cannot be excluded.

                                                Pain in abd and side started on Saturday, patient reported to hospital on 4/6 found on CT scan to have: Multifocal patchy occlusive and nonocclusive PE involving the  bilateral lower lobe and right upper lobe segmental and subsegmental  pulmonary arteries. Suggestion of flattening of the interventricular septum raising the  possibility of right heart strain. Peripheral airspace opacities in the bilateral lower lobes, left more  than right, which could relate to a combination of evolving pulmonary  infarcts and/or hypoventilatory changes. Small left pleural effusion.

                                                Started with intense headaches right after the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine on 03/06/2021.  Had the headache for over two weeks, and eventually went to the hospital with loss of speech and movement on her left side of her body. They at first said it was strokes, then after the CT scan results came back they found multiple abscess in her brain. She does not have a history of strokes or brain abscess. Speech and motor functions never returned, and one abscess was so large that it caused a brain shift ( the two hemispheres separated) they performed brain surgery and it was not successful. She passed away on 3/31/2021 at 431 am.

Shortness of breath got worse till I took some prednosone I had, on April 4, 2021 thinking I was having an asthma attack. Helped a few days. Shortness of breath returned on April 9, 2021. On April 10 we went to critical care thinking I was having asthma attack as extremely short of breath! They said it wasnt asthma but sent me to ER as my oxygen levels were low. In ER they took many tests including CAT scan and ultrasound, which resulted in diagnosis of several large bloodclots in both lungs

Line C ?Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder?  Received her second Moderna dose from our Mobile team on 4/14/21    Since then I spoke with Dr. (Mobile); clients PCP, several times regarding this event.  His nurse got an email from client on 4-12-21 that client had vaccination planned on 414 and may need to reschedule medical appointment planned 4-16 if she felt bad. The client was encourage to get vaccine and to keep appointment for Friday April 16th.  The client  emailed the office at approx 0300 Friday morning  April 16 to cancel appointment because she felt to poorly from vaccination shot to come in  (fevers; body aches). Dr next heard from police officer on Monday April 19th that she was found dead in her home. He requested the Medical Examiner (ME) evaluate but this request was denied. The client lived alone. Dr contacted family members but they did not have much interaction with the client and had no significant information to contribute. Dr said he speculates that the patients underlying anorexia nervosa likely put the client in a critical nutritional deficiencies / electrolyte imbalance condition and the side effects of vaccination were too much. He felt compelled to complete the death certificate as he did because the ME declined the case.   From vaccine mobile team notes:  team was there2-3:30pm. All the answers to the health screening questions for the patient were &#34;no&#34; except for &#34;have you ever had a severe allergic reaction to something?&#34; To that question the answer was &#34;yes.

I put an aspirin under my tongue, walked around and had some water. Pain kept getting worse. My husband drove me to the ED got there at 4pm. They took blood, did chest x-ray, ekgs. Blood work showed my Troponin level @ .11 and later elevated to 2.1. My blood pressure was 215/99, temp 97.  I started having pain in my right shoulder &amp; right wrist.  I was diagnosed with a slight heart attack. On Friday, 3/5/21, facility did an angiogram, which showed my arteries were clear, no blockage or plaque, no heart damage. Did show it appeared the arteries had gone into a spasm which may have caused the heart attack.  I saw my primary Dr on Monday, 3/8/21, and she said I have no history of heart problems, no high cholesterol, etc. I asked her if this could be a side effect of my vaccine. Dr. said it was a good question &amp; she didn&#39;t know the answer, since not all the research has been done. She suggested I submit my question to VAERS!

No sleep, hot and cold flashes, significant aches esp. in legs (even my eyeballs hurt!).  Pain resolved by AM.  Next day arm got a bit itchy.  3 days later arm itched like I had poison ivy and  fingers / hands had pain and joint swelling.  Used a prescription steroid cream on arm and that resolved itching.  Hands, fingers took 10 days to return to normal.  All in all 14 days to recover completely from 2nd Moderna Covid shot.

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

Her echocardiogram done while in the hospital showed a preserved ejection fraction. Her cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. She had implantation of an ICD. Hospital course has been complicated by watershed cerebral infarcts. In addition, she had an episode of C. difficile colitis. She has gradually improved over the course of the past 3 weeks. From a cardiovascular perspective, she is being discharged on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and her home atorvastatin. With regards to her etiology of cardiac arrest, I would be suspicious about the possibility of sarcoidosis. However, we were not able to get a cardiac MR while she was inpatient due to her strokes and inability to consistently follow commands and hold her breath. Would recommend consideration of an outpatient. She is ready to discharge to subacute rehab today. I have spent greater than 30 minutes in discharge planning.

She completed therapeutic hypothermia protocol. Cardiac catheterization did not show any significant obstructive coronary disease. TTE showed LVEF 55%. Patient underwent AICD placement on 3/16/2021. Had some recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia afterward, which resolved after increasing her carvedilol doses. Her course was complicated by a C. difficile infection, treated with PO Vancomycin, with significant improvement in diarrhea. She has had gradual neurologic recovery. Neurology felt she had had several watershed infarcts, but felt that she would continue to have a prolonged recovery over the next few months. Had some recovery of language/cognition prior to discharge. Due to her waxing/waning encephalopathy, she did not qualify for inpatient rehab, but will be discharged to subacute rehab. Discharged with tube feeding continued, though she can begin sips with speech therapy supervision. Patient seen and examined at bedside on the day of discharge. She stated that she had no pain, though HPI/ROS still limited due to aphasia. Discussed above information with patient&#39;s husband, who understood and was in agreement with the plan.

                                                I work at  medical center where patient is being treated for a new diagnosis of Acute monocytic leukemia.  I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

March 7th right hand went numb again and had vision problems with right eye, cleared up in about 15 minutes.  March 9th right hand and right side of face went numb.  Went to hospital and was examined and told I was having a stroke.  I was admitted to hospital for two days.  MRI showed that I had a stroke and now have some brain tissue damage.  I and now going to occupational therapy to regain use of right hand.  The Doctors thought that it was pretty coincidental that my first stroke symptom (transient numb right hand on the 6th) started just a couple days after I got the second dose of the moderna vaccine.

By Wednesday, March 10, I called my doctor and after telling them my left calf hurt , they had me come right in. After seeing dr  I was sent to get a sonogram immediately  and was told I had a blood clot  inside my  left knee. I was sent back to Dr and was given Xerelto 15 mg twice a day for 21 days and the 20 mg once a day until gone.  Today,, it is still sore. I am asking if I should take my second shot on March 29 or not.

She was reportedly in her recliner for approximately 12-18 hrs prior to being brought in via EMS. In the ED her b/l LE extremity was cold to touch and mottled. Her toes were white and nail beds blue. No pulses were found on Doppler on either extremity. She was also noted to be in a.fib with RVR. Doppler of LE showed extensive occlusive thrombus. Bedside echo showed the RV severely dilated with mobile thrombus and EF 20-25%. Given these findings there is a very high probability of massive PE, however given current situation of AKI and instability CT was unable to be performed. She was given TPA and admitted to ICU. Pt was started heparin gtt, as well as levophed and dobutamine for obstructive and cardiogenic shock as her troponin, kidney function, lactate and liver function all were elevated.  Of note pt lives in a hoarding situation and lives a sedentary lifestyle and reportedly only gets up from recliner to use the bathroom. Pt also has a 96 pack year history but was noted in her medical chart  to have quit smoking in 2017.

I looked at the browser history in her cellphone and on the night of April 4, she googled &#34;Heart attack symptoms in women&#34; and &#34;Moderna vaccination side effects.&#34; I think she didn&#39;t go to the doctor because she figured her symptoms were related to her vaccine -- even though it had been a week.   I wanted to report her death because I don&#39;t trust her doctor to do it. It took him two weeks and a call from me to complain before he signed her death certificate. He listed April 9, 2021 as the official date of death because that&#39;s when she was found, even though the deputy coroner told me she died on either the 4th or the 5th.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history was provided by the reporter.  Concurrent medical conditions included Allergic reaction to bee sting (Bees).    On 23-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (Anaphylactic Reaction/Throat began to swell and could only swallow water/chest discomfort) (seriousness criterion medically significant), the first episode of HYPOAESTHESIA ORAL (Lips and Cheeks were numb), the second episode of HYPOAESTHESIA ORAL (Lips and Cheeks were numb), CHILLS (Chills) and HEADACHE (Headache). On 25-Apr-2021, the patient experienced VACCINATION SITE WARMTH (COVID arm (painful, itchy, hot)), VACCINATION SITE PRURITUS (COVID arm (painful, itchy, hot)) and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (COVID arm (painful, itchy, hot)). The patient was treated with Physical therapy (Ice wraps) for Anaphylactic reaction. At the time of the report, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (Anaphylactic Reaction/Throat began to swell and could only swallow water/chest discomfort), the last episode of HYPOAESTHESIA ORAL (Lips and Cheeks were numb), VACCINATION SITE WARMTH (COVID arm (painful, itchy, hot)), VACCINATION SITE PRURITUS (COVID arm (painful, itchy, hot)), CHILLS (Chills), HEADACHE (Headache) and VACCINATION SITE PAIN (COVID arm (painful, itchy, hot)) had resolved.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       The patient was fine while she was at the facility, but on her way home she had an anaphylactic reaction. Her lips and cheeks became numb. Her throat began to swell and she could not swallow anything but water. She also reports her chest was tight. No breathing difficulties. She stated that she tried to call her physician to get an EpiPen, but he was gone for the day. She stated that she was allergic to bees and that is why she went to a facility who would have a doctor there if she had a reaction. The reaction lasted about 1.5 hours. She used ice wraps and eventually the reaction stopped and she did not go to the emergency room. She also reports that she also had the normal side effects like chills and a headache after receiving the shot. Two days after the vaccination she woke up with COVID arm which was painful, itchy and hot. It lasted over a week, but it finally went away.  The concomitant medications were not provided.

On 21 Jan 2021, after vaccine administration, the patient experienced injection site reaction.  On 22 Jan 2021, she was feeling achy.   On 23 Jan 2021, she had nerve pain that felt like cutting on the back, legs, and arms.  On 24 Jan 2021, the patient&#39;s muscles were weak and were not working or responsive on both sides.   On 25 Jan 2021, the patient could not control her left hand and weakness was more predominant on left side. The patient went to the doctor and was hospitalized with minor stroke for 24 hours. The patient stated that she was still experiencing terrible pain in neck and lower back.  No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.  The outcome of events, minor stroke, weak muscles, nerve pain, injection site reaction, and achy, was unknown. The outcome of event, terrible pain in neck and lower back, was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and evidence of a temporal association between mRNA-1273 use and the onset of injection site reaction and achy, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. There is limited information to asses causality for the events of injection site reaction, and achy.  Additional information has been requested.

We think she aspirated (she has a history of dsyphagia) which caused pneumonia.  However, I am reporting this because it was within 24 hours of receiving her vaccine.

Went to the bathroom, urinated, took Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke again at 2:00 a.m, still chilled, and tried to stand up and my legs wouldn&#39;t hold me. I managed to lift myself to my feet and clutching furniture get to the bathroom, with complete loss of bladder control on the way. Took more Tyleonol, drank more water, put on clean pajamas but couldn&#39;t lift my knees to step into them, had to put them on the floor and pull them up. Went to sleep eventually. When I woke at about 5 a.m., all was completely normal. No fever, legs fine, usual bladder control.

                                                Blood clot on right lung; soreness in arm; A spontaneous report was received from  a 72 year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced blood clot on right lung  (pulmonary embolism) and myalgia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25-JAN-2021, 26 hours prior to the onset of events, the patient received her second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot#: unknown) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 26-JAN-2021, the patient reported they have developed chills, fever, and muscle pain in the chest area. The reporter specified that it wasn&#39;t chest pain.  The patient took acetaminophen for the pain. On 27-JAN-2021, the patient reported her fever subsided but she was still having a little cough and chest pain.  On 28-JAN-2021, the patient had chest pain again during a nap and decided to call 911 because she was about to pass out. The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) where an EKG (electrocardiogram) was performed. A few moments after the EKG, the patient had a heart attack. The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin. At the time of this report, the patient was still feeling fatigued but other than that, she was feeling better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, heart attack, cough, muscle pain in chest area, fever, chills, and chest pain, were resolved. The outcome of the event, fatigue, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Shortness of breath, cough onset Sunday April 4th.  DATE OF SERVICE: 04.06.2021   CT ANGIOGRAPHY, CHEST (CPT=71275); PULMONARY EMBOLUS PROTOCOL; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION  CLINICAL INDICATION: SOB (shortness of breath)  COMPARISON STUDY: 10/9/2020  TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were performed during dynamic contrast enhancement for the  optimization of the opacification of the pulmonary arteries, following IV administration of 80 mL of  Isovue 370. Three-dimensional reformation into the coronal plane was performed.  Automated exposure control and ALARA manual techniques for patient specific dose reduction were  followed while maintaining the necessary diagnostic image quality.  ADVERSE REACTION: None  FINDINGS:  PULMONARY ARTERIES: There is a large filling defect within the right interlobar artery, extending  into the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe. There is expansion of  the right interlobar artery by this thrombus. Small filling defect is noted within the distal left  main pulmonary artery, with some extension to the left upper lobe and left lower lobe lobar  segments.  HEART AND VASCULATURE: The heart is normal size. No pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of  right heart strain.  MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  Heterogeneous densities are seen in the right lower lobe, new since the prior  exam. Scarring is noted in the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well as in the anterior  left lower lobe..  PLEURA: Small right pleural effusion.  CHEST WALL, LOWER NECK, AND AXILLA: Grossly unremarkable.  UPPER ABDOMEN: Grossly unremarkable.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen within the visualized spine.  IMPRESSION  1.  Bilateral PE, with extensive thrombus on the right and minimal thrombus on the left as detailed  above.  2.  Small right pleural effusion and heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation, likely reflecting  pulmonary infarction.

At the hospital they performed EKG&#39;s and stress test. The EKG was slightly off but the stress test was normal. I felt all my body flushed after the Moderna vaccine. my cardiologist I am now seeing and at the hospital I saw another Dr.  I also stayed at the  Hospital one day for monitoring.

The patient&#39;s husband states that &#34;crashed an hour and a half after she got the shot.&#34;  He defines this &#34;crash&#34; as decreased blood sugar, decreased responsiveness, and the seizures.  She presented to the Hospital for evaluation and was subsequently transferred to the Medical Center on April 4th for further workup. She was intubated on April 4th and subsequently self-extubated on April 8th. Nursing staff and documentation indicate that the patient has had no further seizures since her presentation to the medical center.  On April 14th she was found to have an acute lower extremity DVT. She was placed on a heparin drip and her platelet&#39;s dropped to 35. The heparin drip was discontinued, a HIT panel was ordered, and argatroban was started. Heamtology was consulted and the patient was found to have thrombotic thrombocytopenia. An MRI of the brain was ordered to rule out CNS thrombosis given recent seizures. The MRI has not been performed yet and the patient is still hospitalized.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                Atrial Fibrillation; Tachycardia (Double heart rate); A spontaneous report was received from a 73-year-old female consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Jan 2021, the patient reported having atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. Treatment for the events included metoprolol.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old, female patient. The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient experienced an unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. The event occurred 2 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen. The patient was seen by physician and then sent to emergency room where it was determined that the patient had DVT in the left leg. A computerized tomogram (CT) scan found clots in the left lung, or saddle PE.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital.  Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking.

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the first COVID vaccine she developed shortness of breath that was much more significant than she had previously. This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don&#39;t think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I&#39;m sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.

The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 Jan 2021, approximately five days prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Jan 2021, the patient developed a cough. The patient&#39;s temperature was recorded at 101 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient went to doctor. She was fatigued and coughing blood and was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment included azithromycin, and the patient seemed to improve.  On 05 Feb 2021, the patient developed a temperature of 101°F, coughed up blood and was very fatigued. She was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment for the event included levofloxacin.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, pneumonia, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of pneumonia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s elderly age and medical history of COPD are considered a risk factors.

She states that her symptoms 1st started out as a slight postnasal drip, which turned into a hoarse voice with a cough, which turned into a head cold, which has turned in due shortness of breath, diarrhea, and cough with associated chills. After 17 days of cold-like symptoms, pt was tested on 2/26 for COVID and tested positive. 2/27, pt worsened and presented to ED. Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient&#39;s temperature is 100.2° F, heart rate 96, respiratory rate 24, saturating 84% on room air with blood pressure 164/84.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for BUN 17, CR 1.47, lactate 2.2, D-dimer 6.79, and phosphorus 2.2.  The patient&#39;s chest x-ray showed no acute findings.  CT chest showed extensive acute bilateral pulmonary emboli involving most of the lobar and segmental branches, right greater than left with no saddle embolus.  Findings borderline for right heart strain, correlate with echocardiogram.  Peripheral ground-glass airspace opacities consistent with atypical/viral pneumonitis.  Reactive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 93 with inferior infarct-age undetermined.  The patient was administered 1 L IV NS, ceftriaxone 1 g IV, azithromycin 500 mg IV, and heparin IV bolus and drip for PE indication. Remdesivir started.  2/28/21: Pt on 3 L oxygen. Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, remdesivir continued. Vancomycin started.  3/1/21: 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. Small, nonproductive cough. Pt complains of SOB.  3/2/21: 1/2 blood cultures from 2/27 positive for CoNS. Vancomycin discontinued. Pt feeling much better. Still on 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. More alert.  3/3: 5 day remdesivir course and azithromycin, ceftriaxone course completed. Patient weaned off oxygen. Pt discharged home with oxygen as a precaution. Pt also enrolled in COVID Safe At Home telehealth program.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Cholesterol, Penicillin allergy and Allergy to animal. Concomitant products included MULTIVITAMIN [VITAMINS NOS], VITAMIN D NOS and CALCIUM ASCORBATE (VITAMIN C [CALCIUM ASCORBATE]) for an unknown indication.    On 22-Mar-2021 at 10:45 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 23-Mar-2021 at 5:30 AM, the patient experienced GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand mall seizure) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and FOAMING AT MOUTH (mouth foaming). The patient was hospitalized from 23-Mar-2021 to 24-Mar-2021 due to GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE. At the time of the report, GENERALISED TONIC-CLONIC SEIZURE (grand mall seizure) and FOAMING AT MOUTH (mouth foaming) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment of these events were not provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old female hospitalized with a serious unexpected event of generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and nonserious unexpected foaming of the mouth. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Of note, patient received her second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 3/25/2021 and felt poorly the day after with body aches and fatigue. The patient was admitted to ED with suspected stroke, but no ischemia or hemorrhage was shown on MRI. In addition, her blood pressure at the ER was 196/104 and her troponin was elevated and reached a peak of around 5. Cardiac Catheterization showed no acute disease but chronic and unsubstantial changes that did not require intervention.  An EEG from 3/29 was concerning for subacute seizure like activity and She was started on IV Keppra. MRI at the same time, also revealed a right-sided cavernoma. During her hospital stay, she had ongoing confusion and disorientation with hallucinations, concerning for an encephalitis. She also received 3 days of ceftriaoxone for a potential unseen infection, but cultures were negative and PCR for viral pathogens was also normal. She was seen to have leukocytosis but the cause was not determined. Eventually, she regained her baseline mentation with no residual deficits and was discharged on Keppra to follow up with neurology.

                                                The day before the first vaccine she was up and acting normal, laundry, housework and knew what to do.   She has severe dementia but was doing OK and knew where she was.  She got the first vaccine on 1/29/21, and the 3rd and 4th day they noticed she was having hallucinations and saying things that weren&#39;t there.  She could hear baby&#39;s crying but there were no baby&#39;s present.   Within 7 days she had what the son described as a stroke. He said that she was watching television and he was on a conference call and he noticed she walked into a wall and he asked if she was okay and starting stumbling across the room and when he touched her she felt very heavy and said that one side of her face was drooping.  He got her back into the chair and called 9-1-1.  She was so agitated at the hospital that the husband does not know what they gave her and they kept her for a week.    They finally got her under control.  They discharged her from there and she that was all that they could do with her.  They brought her home with nurses assistance and her paranoia was evident, hallucinations were very evident. They said that they tried to do a CAT Scan and an MRI and they said that she did not have a stroke.   Restless was very adamant, talking strange things and wanting to go to her son&#39;s house when she was there.  Before that vaccination she knew where she was and after that she did not know where she was thinking she was at one location and just confusion.     She then got her 2nd vaccine and then her husband went out of town and took her back home on 2/24/21 as he was able to get her in a car and travel and able to eat and knew somewhat what was going on.  On 2/25/21 when he brought her home to  a long term care facility.  She was chanting constantly, had irritability, anger, cognition completely eroded.  She was very agitated, very combative.  Drugs would not calm her down, and tried to get CAT scans or MRI&#39;s but were unsuccessful due to her combativeness.  She was screaming and yelling 24 hours a day to the top of her lungs and gave her Ativan which had the adverse effects of what they were supposed to do.  Had biting, hallucinations, paranoia.   She had a couple of falls, they had her in a wheelchair and tried to feed her and she would fall down.  They took her to the hospital a few times and she progressively got worse.  On 4/19/21 she shut down and quit eating, quit drinking, closed her eyes, and lasted a week like that and then she died on 4/24/21 @ 2:30 AM.   None of her doctors could figure out what had happened.  They were finally able to get a CAT scan and felt that she may have a stroke.      Finally they memory care facility told them to come a take her to the hospital and they had moved their hospice patient&#39;s as she was screaming and disruptive and they could not handle her anymore.     They thought she was suffering from Lewy body dementia at one point.  They were going to have her tested for that and they could not do it on Saturday when she passed for genetics and missed those timelines and could not do it.

I was transported that evening to the stroke  division that same evening for further evaluation, tests and care.  I have never had a mini stroke before this.The doctors said it may have been from the vaccination, or it may not have been precipitated by it.  They said they don&#39;t have enough information on the Moderna vaccine to make that call.

Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

                                                74 yo woman living in a group home for people with developmental disabilities. She has longstanding difficult-to-control seizure disorder, on valproate, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam. She had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in November 2020, probably discovered in the course of surveillance testing of residents/staff, perhaps in relation to an outbreak in the residence.  Sometime during the night following her vaccination earlier that morning, she developed a fever, and then was found to be having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Estimates of duration in the records range from 20 to 40 minutes. She was brought by ambulance to Hospital ED, and then admitted. Her temperature was said to be 103 F.  She received midazolam, and at least one dose of IV antibiotics. By the evening of admission on 5 February 2021, she was still unresponsive.  On arrival, her COVID-19 PCR was again/still positive. She had no prodromal symptoms suggesting COVID-19 reinfection, nor did anyone in the group home, staff or residents.  Her initial WBC was normal but with a slight left shift. UA was normal. Head CT showed her known cerebral atrophy and chronic microvascular disease.  Admitting valproate serum level was subtherapeutic; levatiracetam and lamotrigine levels were therapeutic.  Blood cultures are no growth at 2 days. Urine culture negative.  By hospital day 2, her transaminases had bumped to over 1000.

On an unspecified date in FEB 2021, the patient experienced fast heart rate, felt weakness, dizziness, and had atrial fibrillation. No treatment medication information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on current information the event was assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 vaccine, because of biological implausibility, no clear temporal association, and the patient&#39;s history of heart surgery which may promote atrial fibrillation episodes.

                                                22 hours after vaccination and one hour after taking morning pills, patient developed full body rash and itching.  Morning meds she consumed were: Losartan, amlodipine, pravastatin, escitalopram, baby aspirin, vitamin D3.  Episode of rash and itching improved with oral Benadryl 50 mg.  The next day patient took her meds same time and one hour later developed rash.  Took Benadryl and rash resolved.  Patient then stopped medications for 1 week and had no occurrences of rash.  Restarted medications morning of 3/10/21 and developed full body rash with itching and early anaphylaxis, one hour after medication consumed.  It should be noted, patient has been on these medications for several years without reaction.  Reaction started after she had received the Moderna COVID19 vaccination.  On 3/10/21 when she had full body rash with anaphylaxis, patient presented to our clinic and was given 2 rounds of IM epinephrine, IM Benadryl 50 mg, IM Solu-Medrol 125 mg, and oral Zyrtec.  Episode took 2.5 hours to resolve.  Patient prescribed tapering course of prednisone, Zyrtec once daily, famotidine 20 mg once daily for the next 7 days, outpatient.  We will be restarting one medication at a time to assess for medication reaction.

She  never had any heart issues or blood pressure issues.    Went to the ER and her cardiac enzymes were elevated, and her EKG&#39;s indicated she was having a heart attack.  She was lift flighted to the next major hospital and had a cardiac Cath which found a 25% blockage in one spot.  They are stating that they do not know what caused this.  When she informed them that she had the vaccine they told her to report this information.   Her BP was high in the hospital and did not come down much during the hospital stay.  She was put on Cardizem, and Crestor, as well as started on 81mg aspirin.   She is now under the care of a cardiologist, but has recovered from the initial reactions.

                                                Patient is a lovely 74-year-old female with a long history of PACs and hypertension.  Her blood pressure has been getting a little bit worse over the past years.  She was admitted through the ER with 1st known episode of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She reports that on 02/02 she received her 2nd COVID vaccine.  She had joint achiness and a low-grade temperature.  She rested the following day but then on 02/04 went for her usual hour long runs/hike.  She did not feel very well during exercise and started have a headache and some increasing palpitations.  Later that evening she was watching TV and started to have significant tachycardia that was irregular. Symptoms persisted and she presented to the ER which sound to be in AFib with rapid ventricular response with a blood pressure of 215/158. She was started on a diltiazem drip and has converted to sinus rhythm with PACs.  Blood pressure has improved significantly.  Troponin negative x2.   Her last evaluation at a Heart facility was  in 2017.  She had an echocardiogram in 2014 with normal EF, mild MR and mild TR with normal estimated PA systolic pressure.   She denies chest pain or dyspnea.  No history of syncope.  Sometimes with palpitation she does get lightheaded.  She gets occasional lower extremity edema that seems dependent in nature.  She is still having palpitations but recognizes that she is no longer in atrial fibrillation as that was more severe in terms of symptoms of tachycardia.

                                                Internal brain bleeding; Bad headaaches; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 74-year-old, elderly female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced bad headaches/headache and internal brain bleeding/cerebral haemorrhage.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Past medication included unspecified blood thinner. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On an unspecified date, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number unknown) via unknown route for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis. On 18 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number unknown) via unknown route for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On an unspecified date, after second dose of vaccine, the patient bad headaches due to which patient had an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) which showed internal brain bleeding. The event led to hospitalization. She had been in and out of the hospital two more times before since getting a shot. No treatment medication was reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, bad headaches and internal brain bleeding was not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

PT&#39;s PCP was contacted, and agreed to certify DC based on known medical history.  PCP also agreed that the death did not sound related to the vaccine based on lack of symptoms as reported by the administering clinic and family.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included urinary tract infection (UTI).Medications included levofloxacin and nitrofurantoin to treat urinary tract infection.  On 19 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: 010M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 16 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 05 Mar 2021, the patient took levofloxacin 500mg to treat urinary tract infection (UTI). Soon thereafter patient had a severe allergic reaction to levofloxacin.   Treatment included Emergency Room drug-induced anaphylaxis treatment.Later Patient took nitrofurantoin for 5 days for the UTI and developed events sluggish, and light-headed hives,felt awful and difficult breathing.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, allergy (anaphylaxis) to levofloxacin was resolved on 05 Mar 2021. The outcome of the event, hives, difficult breathing, felt awful, sluggish, and light-headed, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 75 Y/O F who had NS unexpected urinary tract infection and serious unexpected anaphylactic reaction with NS unexpected urticaria, dyspnea, dizziness, feeling abnormal, sluggish.  Anaphylaxis on Day 18 after first dose mRNA-1273 was considered possibly related to levofloxacin for UTI. Anaphylaxis resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Smoker (at least 45 pack years) in January 2020, Anemia, Spinal operation (thoracic upper lumbar spine) and Cholecystectomy. Concurrent medical conditions included Penicillin allergy, Pulmonary fibrosis since 2016, Hypertension, GERD (without esophagitis), Chronic kidney disease stage 3 (stage 3b), Interstitial pneumonitis (idiopathic), Centrilobular emphysema, Bronchiectasis and Pancreatic atrophy (fatty atrophy on CT scan chest 04 Mar 2021).

On 17-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 27-Jan-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening) and CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening). In February 2021, the patient experienced ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening) and INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening). On 18-Feb-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps). On 24-Feb-2021, the patient experienced INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening). On 04-Mar-2021, the patient experienced BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and life threatening). The patient was hospitalized from 31-Mar-2021 to 06-Apr-2021 due to ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE, BRONCHIECTASIS, CONDITION AGGRAVATED, INFLAMMATION, INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE, PULMONARY FIBROSIS and RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. At the time of the report, PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis), INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere), BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion), INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease) and CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) had not resolved and MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 27-Jan-2021, Computerised tomogram: no sign change (Inconclusive) stable findings of pulmonary fibrosis/chronic interstitial lung disease. On 27-Jan-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 % (normal) 99 room air. On 27-Jan-2021, Pulmonary function test: abnormal (abnormal) moderate reduction in diffusion capacity; forced vital, total lung, and diffusion capacities diminished. On 03-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 95 % (normal) room air. On 04-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) no PE, dramatic worsening of diffuse infiltrates much c/w UIP pattern; bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced. On 05-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 80 % (abnormal) 94 at rest, 80 when ambulating, then 96 when ambulating with O2. On 08-Mar-2021, Echocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) EF 60-65%, RVSP moderately elevated- 45 mmHg, mild MV regurgitation. On 21-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) low lung volumes with reticular opacities both lungs-uncertain if acute pneumonia or chronic fibrotic chnage. On 22-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) increased small pleural effusion and evidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy; overall fibrosis increased. On 23-Mar-2021, Bronchoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) neutrophilic lavage with negative cultures. On 09-Apr-2021, Oxygen saturation: 78 % (Low) 78% Room air 88% on 4L/min O2; 91% on 8L/min. On 14-Apr-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) diffuse interstitial infiltrates, no pleural effusion.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis), INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere), BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease), CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) and MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps).    Patient was seen by physician (MD) (the reporter, a pulmonary specialist) on 27 Jan 2021 with complaint of short of breath with heavy exertion; was chronically breathless going up stairs.  Her pulmonary physiology had been relatively stable over last couple of years.  Impression: Appeared to have worsening restrictive physiology (also reported as slight worsening) in the setting of stable pulmonary fibrosis on imaging.  Then, on 04 Mar 2021, the patient presented with worsened breathlessness of rather acute onset, starting approximately 24 Feb 2021.  Repeat CT scan showed no pulmonary embolism but showed dramatic worsening of her pulmonary parenchyma and then findings suggesting exacerbation of underlying IPF like picture.  The was also a significant change in spirometry.  She was placed on large dose prednisone with transient stabilization but then presented to the emergency room on 21 Mar 2021 very breathless.  No obvious infectious like picture.  She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids.  One more CT scan showed continued abnormalities with again increased ground-glass opacification.  She showed desaturation with limited activity.  The patient was hospitalized for 7 days, then discharged to inpatient rehab for 10 days on prednisone 60 mg.  She improved slightly and was discharged home on 6L of O2 with exertion and 4L at rest.  On 14 Apr 2021, the patient saw MD for follow-up at which time she was breathless with any significant activities and had difficulty getting around.  She was approved for nintedanib therapy for progressive pulmonary fibrosis.  Assessment included acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The events are probably related to the patient&#39;s comorbidities.
