                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at her place of employment as a phase 1A essential frontline healthcare worker in a skilled nursing LTC facility on January 6 2021. The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

                                                It bled a little, right away I felt jittery. Later that night I got chills, and I had to change my shirt twice because I was drenched in sweat.  The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

They removed the tube in the hospital, (she remained in the hospital) First she was hospitalized and then she was transferred to the Medical Center Hospital to auscultate bleeding in the stool and to be evaluated by the Gastroenterologist. This specialist performs the necessary studies, they do not give a diagnosis and in the process she dies. The hospital indicated that she had a blood drain and heart failure.

Visited my surgeon who follows up with me every 6 months. She listened to my lungs and said she heard crackles in my left lung. Sent me for a chest x-ray immediately after visit on 3/15/2021.  I am having no symptoms such as coughing, fever, etc.  I?m concerned this could be a side effect of the vaccine. Was also tested for Covid on 3/17/2021. Test result was NEGATIVE.

The medical examiner has declined 2x for an autopsy to be done.  My mother was healthy and was absolutely fine besides the rash (dr diagnosed her with cellulitis week of March 14). I do not agree with the rule of death being  ?natural causes? neither does her doctor.

                                                She got her vaccine and had no reactions at all.  On 3/12/21 she was in her car and started having stabbing pain in the left side of her chest under the rib.  She thought it was gas pains and dismissed it, and then it started radiating towards the front and the stomach.  On 3/16/21 she went to the ER and they did a CT scan that showed that she had a blood clot on her spleen.  With that they gave her the diagnosis of idiopathic splenic infarction.  She was then sent by ambulance to another hospital to be admitted in case she was needing surgery.  She was given heparin and on that for 2 1/2 days.  They determined that 60% of her spleen is dead, blood supply cut off to it, and the other 40% is nonfunctional.  On 3/19/21 they gave her vaccines of Prevnar 13, HIB, meningococcal, meningococcal B, and a flu vaccine.  She was discharged on the 3/20/21 with Plavix.  She saw her regular doctor yesterday and he diagnosed her with functional asplenia and to continue the Plavix.   She is no longer having any symptoms after dissolving the blood clot.

I went to lay down and was not able to.  It was hard to breath.  I got up, went to another room where there was a recliner and sat in it trying to catch my breath.  It got harder to breathe.  I had my husband call 911. I went to the ER, had a CT scan of my chest and was found to have ?extensive PE?s?, ground glass and signs of pneumonitis.   I was admitted to the CICU for two days and was transferred for two days.  I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that there was a high unlikelihood of PE?s developing from my ankle fracture 3 months later.  I had home health care for approximately one month.

                                                2/4/21 slight headache during day, tired. Cold on and off, cold feet throughout the day. 5:30pm got home from work had shaking chills, unable to get warm for 2 hours. Finally got warm but it was a hot warmth. No fever. Took Tylenol 500mg. The warmth continued and had mild headache. Took 500mg Tylenol at bedtime 11pm. I was hot throughout the night ( no sweats ) woke at 6am feeling light headed and dizzy, body aches, still hot. Felt like I had the flu. I went into the bathroom to void. I remember thinking  - I am too sick to go to work.  My husband said I was standing holding onto the door, white in color, said &#34;i&#39;m sick&#34; he came to stand beside me to help me walk and I passed out. I had loss of consciousness. I do not know how long - he said he tried to shake me to wake me up about 30 seconds. He yelled to my son sleeping upstairs a few times, they got the phone and called 911. He said I vomited a few times and would not wake up.  I remember coming to - sitting on the floor with him talking to 911 .  I woke up enough to get up and walk to the living room couch with assist and gradually starting feeling better. The paramedics came and took my vital signs. Blood pressure (120/69 ), heart rate (84) oxygen saturations were all good. Blood glucose 116.  I declined ER transport.  I had continued light headedness, dizziness 2/6, 2/7/21.  Arm soreness gone at injection site on 2/7/21. I believe the dizziness is a mild concussion. I have a provider appointment 2/9/21.

                                                About 9PM after the receiving the vaccine I started had riggers which lasted for about an hour. I couldn&#39;t reach for my phone or call for help. I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

Woke up at 1am Friday morning drenched from sweat through to the mattress but migraine was better. Ran fever up to 102 and down and up all day Friday. Saturday fever was only 100 but came back after each sweat. Sunday I had almost no fever and just a regular head ache. Monday exhausted but okay.

On 06 Mar 2021, the patient experienced severe diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. At 4 AM she had lost consciousness and fell after urinating and hit her head on the curb of the shower. Her husband found her and when he saw her, she was cold, clammy and very sweaty. Her husband reported that the patient had low blood pressure that caused syncope and caused her to fall. The patient was in a semi-delirious state and was confused, tremulous. The cramps were intermittent for 1-2 hours. The patient was in a borderline shock or in shock as she was very dizzy when she stood up. The events were resolved after four hours. On the next day her temperature was at 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit.   Treatment information was not provided.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The outcome of the events, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, loss of consciousness, fall, cold sweats, hyperhidrosis, hypotension, syncope, confusional state, tremors, muscle spasms, shock and dizziness were recovered.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

                                                I was achy and my arm was sore that night. I was fine until I started experiencing symptoms on the 1/5. So that night, I checked my temperature and had a low grade fever. I took a COVID test on 1/6 and was positive and I got treatment on 1/7. I ended up being out of work for two months due to a sinus infection and pneumonia. I&#39;m still experiencing symptoms such as lung inflammation and SOB, so I&#39;m on an inhaler, nasal spray, allergy meds and I did a sputum test today. I&#39;m also scheduled to see a pulmonologist, who I also saw prior to COVID for breathing issues. I&#39;ve had to do 3 rounds of antibiotics to resolve my pneumonia.

Ten seconds later, her husband said that she felt like she was going to pass out. Upon getting to the patient, I felt for a pulse and observed mild breathing. The patient was unconscious and did not awaken with a sternum rub. The patient&#39;s husband helped me lower her to the ground, and I administered one dose of Epipen to the patient&#39;s lateral left thigh. She awakened and was able to state where she was, the year, and the president. EMT arrived later, and the patient refused further medical treatment.

The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 15 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 027L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 08 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 0101M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The first dose of vaccine was taken in non dominant arm and second dose was taken in right dominant arm.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced swollen arm. In between the two doses she felt very hard to breath for few minutes and when she took a deep breath it was fine. She had tylenol for the headaches after the second dose on 08 February 2021. She also had nausea along with headaches. She had blood clogging when she was in a blood donation camp. The event very hard to breath for few minutes and blood clogging were considered as medically significant. Thiamine was provided as medication  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  Follow-up received on 17 Mar 2021 included updated date for first dose of vaccine, and the events very hard to breath for few minutes/dyspnoea, blood clogging/thrombosis.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a strong temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Nausea and headache are consistent with the safety profile of the product

Patient is not an established patient and did not receive care for her symptoms at our facility:  On March 18th I received my 2nd Moderna vaccination. On Friday the 19th at approximately 4 pm I began to have the symptoms of an immune response in my body. Sat the 20th was spent in bed with chills, body aches, fever, stiff neck, and bad headache. On Sunday I was having pain on inhalation along with everything else.  Monday the pain resolved into left side lung pain on inhalation. Tuesday the 23rd I called my provider who directed me to go to the Emergency Dept. I drove to Superior Hospital. After being accessed I was transported; with pericarditis and the additional mentioned immune response symptoms, and a pronounced heart murmur. On Wednesday the 24 I shook uncontrollably with chills for 4 hours and 2 min and went into atrial fib for about 12 minutes, resolved with medication.  Thursday the 25th I woke to all symptoms being gone. I was released on Friday the 26th with the statement my issues had resolved themselves. I was told to report this to where I got my vaccine so it could be passed along.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA adverse event.   Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.  Patient then transferred to another hospital that could provide neurosurgical intervention.

Potentially a side effect of elliquis; but her cardiologist does not believe ellipsis was the cause.  Heart attack at similar time due to blood clot and blocked artery and possibly reaction of body  to hematoma.

Overall body pain, skin, muscle joint, Fever up to 101.6 for 36 hours, now running 99.5 on day 2 post injection, nausea, diarrhea, gas, bloating, dizziness, weakness, fainting, fatigue. Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

The left muscle in my left side of my neck stiffened.  As we left the area and headed down the street I was getting anaphalactic:  numb jaw, swelling tongue, closed throat, eyes closing, inner cheeks numb - as if I was severely novacained from the dentist.  I was able to breathe ok to  get home hoping it would pass and drank wanter to keep things fluid.  I was there for one hour.  On advice, I went to the ER to get checked out.

                                                Patient had the first Moderna Covid vaccine on Thursday 1/21/2021.  She had a bit of sore arm on that day and the day after.  On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

                                                The morning after receiving Covid-19 vaccination I fainted.  I was sitting, working on an i-pad and got up to go to another room. I walked through the house to another room. I noticed my arms and legs felt kind of rubbery and that I didn&#39;t seem to have control of them. I fell to the bed and lost consciousness for 5-10 seconds. This was all observed by my spouse. I  recovered quickly. The remainder of the day I had a slight headache and felt slightly nauseous. I took acetaminophen before going to bed and woke up the following morning with no complaints .

                                                After my 2nd dose Moderna vaccine, I experienced chills, fever, nausea, coughing and was coughing up mucus. The day after felt very weak and ate very little, had only sprite to drink, water and crackers. The next day my legs buckled up and felt weakness to my legs. My cough started to get worse and on 02-03-2021 I went to an urgent care facility where x-rays of the chest were performed. They also performed a Covid test. The x-ray of the chest demonstrated a touch of pneumonia in my right lung. I was given steroid medication and places on antibiotics and it is when I started to slowly feel better. I do not know what cause my symptoms after my second dose.  I also received my first dose Moderna vaccine on 01-01-2021 and I only had left arm soreness but no other reaction. (Lot#: 037K20A)

It was harder to breathe and I could not even take a shower that I would be out of breath. My daughter checked my pulsox and it was 85. I couldn&#39;t really walk or do anything so my daughter  transported me to ER and lots of labs were done so since my D Dimer was too high they did a CT scan and it showed some blood clots in my lungs. They admitted me because they were concerned with the location of one of them. They did some heart tests too and put me on Eloquis and then sent me home. I stayed for 2 days. Then they scheduled me FUs with a heart doctor and a pulmonologist.

                                                She got her vaccine, and started out with the sore arm, but she was sitting in the bathroom sometime after 11:00 preparing to do a peritoneal dialysis exchange and blacked out.  She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

                                                7:00 PM onset of chills and fairly severe body aches - concentrated in lower back and hips. Went to bed early - slept to 8:00 PM. Woke up so got up to take evening meds and brush teeth. Had vertigo and moderate nausea. While brushing teeth, I fainted. Came around quickly - was on bathroom floor. Took only one of my medications - the one to prevent migraines and went back to bed. Continued with body aches and chills on and off through the night. In the morning I had worsened vertigo and nausea, but this is typical of my vestibular migraines and I think that was what was going on. I called in sick to work, took one of my  pills for treating migraines and basically slept all day. I do not get migraines often - usually

Immediately felt a little lightheaded during the 15 min window afterward but was able to ambulate independently with walker just afterward.  After taking a nap, she woke with a headache, chills, a little shaky and feeling very tired.  She was able to eat and take Tylenol at the time.  For the rest of the day, she felt under the weather.  The next morning she was very weak, unable to ambulate and tachycardic prompting nursing staff to send her to the hospital for assessment.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

                                                fainted at 5 am following her second Moderna Covid vaccine taken the day prior.  This is the second time this occurred in that she fainted the next day when she took the first Covid shot30 days  ago.  Paramedics were called, her vitals were normal and it was recommended that we do not transport her to the hospital.    When this occurred the first time, she was taken to her neurologist who diagnose a syncope for the incident.

The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

After the 2:00 bathroom visit I found myself on the floor of the bathroom between the toilet and the shower. I tried to get up but couldn&#39;t and managed to get out of the spot I was in but unable to get up. I continued to try but was unable to. after two hours of moving, trying to get up and resting where I was I managed to get to my bedroom (a distance of under 12feet).  I felt like my muscles weren&#39;t working properly. I called 911 to help me get off the floor and was taken to the closest ER. By 7am on March 12th I was able to get up and walk on my own. Although my arms and legs are bruised I feel much better today.

Went to bathroom for bowel movement, had trash can in front of me in case of vomiting.  Apparently passed out and fell off toilet.  Woke up on floor, on my right side, with very cold chills and sweating.  Finished going to bathroom.  Noticed small cut on forehead, with dried blood, probably from hitting my head on trash can I was holding.  Went back to bed.  Still dizzy, chills, sweating, stomach cramps, nausea, sore arm, and aching all over.  These symptoms persisted for hours.  Finally fell asleep, woke up around 7:30 am, still dizzy, stomach cramps.  Took temperature, normal, took blood Additional information for Item 18: pressure, also normal.  Called office of primary care doctor, not open on Friday, declined appointment with another doctor, left detailed message, and was told they would contact me on Monday.  Went back to sleep, woke around 11:15 am, still nauseous and stomach cramps and dizzy.  Went back to sleep until around 2:30 pm.  Woke up feeling better, still sore left arm, sore stomach, achy and very tired.

                                                On 01/26/21, 67 yo F with anemia, asthma, Afib (on rivaroxaban), fibromyalgia, DM2, HLD, and osteoarthritis was administered COVID-19 Moderna vaccine 0.5 mL in left deltoid (Lot #011J20A, Exp: 05/11/21). Pt has numerous documented allergies including iodine (hives, facial swelling), Shellfish Containing Products (Hives, facial swelling) and penicillin (edema). Pt initially tolerated injection without incident and was sent for post-injection observation. Within 10 minutes, pt developed acute SOB, increased WOB, wheezing, and cough. Pt also reported itching skin and scratchy throat. Provider notified and exam found pt in respiratory distress with increased work of breathing, bronchospasm and wheezing. Pt had no rash, lip swelling or vomiting. Vitals assessed as O2 sats &gt;96%, BP 140-150s/60s, HR 70-80s. Pt was administered albuterol 2.5 mg via nebulization x 2, diphenhydramine 50 mg IM and epinephrine 0.3 mg IM. Pt was subsequently transported to ED. By time of arrival, pt&#39;s symptoms had significantly improved. Pt administered famotidine 20 mg IV and prednisone 60 mg PO and placed on continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring. After complete symptom resolution, pt was discharged in stable condition. Pt&#39;s allergy profile was updated to include Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine (eua) (rxn: Anaphylaxis; severity: High).

The patient was discovered to have a large saddle pulmonary embolism, went into cardiac arrest and expired. Of note, the patient received her second Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/23, which would place her first one approximately 12/25 if she received them at the appropriate interval. This information is from the patient&#39;s daughter and the ED record, the information is not available in CAIR. Per the daughter, the patient started feeling ill on 1/21, improved on 1/25, and then acutely worsened on 1/27, resulting in the ED visit.

                                                The day after my injection, at 5:00 a.m. I got up to try to go to the bathroom but felt very dizzy - I had help to get to commode but had to lie on floor to stop from passing out, was sweating profusely.  Did not feel well between 5 and 8 am. I think I had 2 vasovagal episodes during this time brought on by needing to do a bowel movement but I had difficulty not passing out.  After second bowel movement - the dizziness and nausea and sweating subsided.  The rest of the day, I just had minor fever and minor headache.  By the next day I was normal.  I have had 2 or 3 vasovagal episodes in the last 15 years and so that is what I think it was but I assume possibly brought on by the vaccine.  My average sleeping heart rate that first night was 10 beats per minute higher than normal (I wear a Fitbit with a sleep app).

IN CONNECTION WITH THAT, I DEVELOPED SEVER PAIN IN MY LOWER RIGHT FLANK AREA THAT RADIATED TO MY SHOULDER AS WELL AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THERE IS NO HISTORY IN MY FAMILY OF ANY CLOTTING ISSUES AND I MYSELF HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A THING OCCUR.  THE PAIN BECAME SO BAD IT FORCED ME TO GO TO A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPT.  AFTER CT SCANS CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF THE CLOTS, I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADMITTED FOR OBSERVATION ON A REGIMEN OF DRUGS, BLOOD THINNER, PAIN MED, AND A CLOT BUSTER (NOT SURE WHICH MANUFACTURER.)  I AM STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN IN MY RIGHT FLANK AREA - SOMEWHAT RADIATING TO MY RIGHT SHOULDER DAY 1 POST DISCHARGE AND AM HAVING TO RELY ON OPIOID PAIN MED AS WELL AS THE CLOT BUSTING MED AND A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MED. TO ME, IT SEEMS THAT THIS MAY NOT BE JUST COINCIDENTAL.  I WAS FEELING FINE PRIOR TO THE S 2ND DOSE OF THE MODERNA VAC AND THIS SEEMS TO ME THAT IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE 2 DOSE.

Had walked into kitchen to get the thermometer.  My temp was 99. I got very dizzy and passed out for a second or two.  When I hit my head on a cabinet handle I came to.  At first I though I was in my bed and couldn&#39;t figure out what I had hit my head on.  There was blood coming from the wound. My husband came to help me.  We stopped the bleeding after a few minutes and I began icing my head.   I was still very dizzy and had an urge to use the bathroom.  I was afraid to get up. With my husband&#39;s help, I crawled to bathroom and he helped my onto toilet.  I had diarrhea.   At that point I was able to walk with help to my bed. I have had a mild to moderate headache since I had the vaccine.

                                                I got up around 8:30 , went to the toilet, and as I was washing my hands, I blacked out.  I slipped to the floor and then vomited several times.  Fortunately,  I had not eaten since about 7 pm the night before, but I still expelled material.    Stayed in bed all day.  Drank lots of water and slept.    FEEL MUCH BETTER today....eating and vertical.  PS   After the first shot, I slept most of the next day, felt very achy, sweated, and had a headache.  Those symptoms disappeared after about 24 hrs.  BUT about a week after the first shot, I developed a large rash not on, but rather near the injection site.  It was itchy for a day or two, as well.    As I said, I feel much better today, but just thought you should know, especially because the fainting and vomiting are not listed as common reactions.    THANKS

                                                I was walking out of my apartment building to my car inside the garage on Friday at 6:00 pm. As I was walking, my arms &amp; legs began to feel heavy. By the time I reached the garage I was feeling extremely fatigued. I got inside of my car and thought to myself that I&#39;ve never felt this tired in all of my life. I then felt very cold and decided it was best to go back upstairs.  When I into my apartment unit - my cats greeted me as if I was gone for an extremely long time - and I noticed the sun coming in through my windows when the sun should have been on the other side of the building at 6:00 pm. Both the cats &amp; the sunshine told me something was very wrong. I looked at the clock - it said 8:08. I put on the tv and discovered it was 8:08 A.M. on Saturday morning. I had fallen asleep (or passed out) in my car from 6pm Friday evening until 8am Saturday morning.  I have no sleeping disorders &amp; do not require naps during the day. Today I still feel fatigued, but only slightly.  From the time I entered my car at 6pm Friday - until the time I exited my car at 8am Saturday - it felt as though only moments had passed. I had no idea I had fallen asleep or passed out.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

                                                My mom was very ill with fever like symptoms following her first vaccination on January 26th. The symptoms were even worse after her second vaccination March 2nd and included muscle cramping in her legs. Once she was recovered she only had a persistent cough which she attributed to allergies as the pollen count had been high. In the early morning hours of March 19th she was having difficulty breathing and chest pains. She was rushed to the emergency room where she subsequently died of cardio pulmonary embolism which the coroner indicated began within three weeks of her death.

                                                I developed severe lower back/flank pain about 4 days after receiving my 2nd Moderna vaccination.  The pain was most pronounced while lying supine and , while in that position, manifested a creeping , fluid nature, i.e. migrating from my lower back to my shoulder.  I was unable to lie down comfortably.  In thinking about the nature of this pain, I determined that it was possibly/probably from a PE as it seemed as if  pain was migrating from my lower back to my shoulder.  I&#39;m &#34;not a doctor but play one on TV&#34; (LOL ) so surmised that it was something serious that  decided that this was something needing attention.  I presented to a hospital ER for care and was ultimately told I had 2 small PE blood clots - 1 in the base of each lung.  My diagnosis was confirmed by a CT scan and I was subsequently admitted for observation.  I was discharged the following day with blood thinners and blood pressure medication.

I went over and rolled patient over having her lay face up and then proceeded to ask her questions. We had a staff member called 911 while I was helping her.  I asked her how she felt and she responded and said she felt &#34;hot all over and dizzy.&#34; Her pulse was low (~40 bpm). 911 informed us to lie her down on the floor until EMS arrived which we already had been doing at the time. After getting off the phone with 911, she started feeling better and her pulse returned to a normal rate (~80 bpm). EMS still took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

Patient used Benadryl to treat it. 2 days later the raised effect and hardness had gone away, however the redness spread over most of the shoulder area, and 2 days after that had spread halfway down her upper arm. The itch remained. Patient went to a previously scheduled appointment with our primary care physician who said that she had had a DAR (delayed anaphylactic reaction) and should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

                                                about 24 hours after my shot  I was in AFIB. I haven&#39;t had this problem since my ablation about 5 years ago.  I do not know if the vaccine had anything to do with it or if a coincidence, but pharmacist said I should report it. I am still in AFIB and very short of breath.

Once conscious, patient seemed like they were going to fall in and out of consciousness, so we kept speaking to her and asking her questions to keep her conscious.  Patient began grabbing right upper abdominal quadrant and complaining of pain. She requested ice because she was feeling hot and her abdomen was hurting, ice was provided. AED was connected and 911 was called, no shock was suggested by AED.  EMT arrived and took vitals and blood sugar.  They found no issues with vitals, but suggested that she go to Hospital  for further assessment.  She was taken out on a stretcher, but it is unknown to me what resulted after she left the building.

                                                On March 5th I experienced shortness of breath around 1:30 that lasted for 10 minutes.  I had no other symptoms and it subsided. On 3/9 around 2:30 am I had another episode of shortness of breath that lasted about 5 minutes. I was able to return to sleep. I went to work that morning and had shortness of breath, sweating, and dizziness. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed with an acute saddle pulmonary embolism.   I was admitted and started on IV heparin.  On 3/10, I was also found to have a DVT in my right leg.

I monitored the patient closely, checked  her vital signs and everything was normal. Medical history revealed patient has type 2 DM and HTN. I asked patient if she had taken her meds and eaten breakfast (time was 11:15am at this point). She said she took her meds but hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast. I bought her orange juice and a few snacks. In less than 5 minutes after eating/snacking. She mentioned that she was feeling remarkably better. I monitored her for 15 minutes more to make sure she was fully recovered. She was very grateful and felt at ease leaving the pharmacy. I will check on her later.

                                                On the morning February 22nd I was outside with my family in our backyard. I was checking our plant when I started to feel that I needed to sit down. By the time I sat down, I realized I had no feeling or use from the left side of my body including my face. I also had trouble communicating. Could not form complete sentences. The entire left side of my face was drooping. At that moment my husband immediately called 911.  I was taken to the hospital by ambulance where i was immediately treated and diagnosed with a stroke. They administered TPA. I spent 3 days in the ICU. I have since been treated with blood pressure medication, blood thinners and statins.

                                                The next day after vaccine was given, I got vaginal spotting/breakthrough  bleeding. I am postmenopausal and on HRT and have been for 14 years and have not had any spotting after menopause and HRT was started. This highly unusual. Today, I also got a little spotting in the afternoon, like yesterday. So this is the second day in a row. I do not have any discomfort. I contacted my doctor late today and left a message for her. I do hope she will contact me tomorrow. I have heard that there are some new symptoms  reported in the UK regarding female gynecological  side effects like changes in  menstrual cycle, which would not apply directly to me, but maybe similar symptoms?  I am hoping the spotting will stop soon.  The question is, would a 2nd dose be advised or not?

                                                spontaneous bleed; bruise on the shin; sore arm; hives; nose bleed; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 69 years-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced sore arm, hives, nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin.    The patient&#39;s medical history included Von Willebrand Disease and breast cancer. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 JAN 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 012L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date post-vaccination, the patient experienced a sore arm and some hives. Approximately two weeks after the first dose, the patient experienced a spontaneous bleed resulting in a huge bruise on the shin the size of the palm of their hand. The patient consulted their Hematologist who performed blood work which was perfect. There were no abnormal results. The physician administered DDAVP.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced their first nose bleed described as &#34;horrific&#34;.  The patient reported they had blood gushing out of their nose and that they bled for four hours. The patient ended up in the hospital emergency department where they were sprayed with DDAVP to stop the bleeding.  Treatment details included DDAVP.  There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the events.  The events, nose bleed and spontaneous bleed were considered not recovered / not resolved.  The outcome of the events sore arm, hives, and bruise on the shin was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and the patient&#39;s history of Von Willebrand Disease, a causal association between the events nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin with mRNA-1273 use is assessed as unlikely.  However, based on temporal association, causality for the events of sore arm and hives cannot be excluded.

Had the headache for over two weeks, and eventually went to the hospital with loss of speech and movement on her left side of her body. They at first said it was strokes, then after the CT scan results came back they found multiple abscess in her brain. She does not have a history of strokes or brain abscess. Speech and motor functions never returned, and one abscess was so large that it caused a brain shift ( the two hemispheres separated) they performed brain surgery and it was not successful. She passed away on 3/31/2021 at 431 am.

On April 10 we went to critical care thinking I was having asthma attack as extremely short of breath! They said it wasnt asthma but sent me to ER as my oxygen levels were low. In ER they took many tests including CAT scan and ultrasound, which resulted in diagnosis of several large bloodclots in both lungs

                                                Woke up at my usual time the day after vaccine. Felt a little warm but not feverish and did not take my temperature. After walking to kitchen to let cat in from garage I stopped at the nearby kitchen sink and began to shake ( I believe just my upper body). I had to grab onto sink to steady myself. Shaking was only seconds long.  Then I must have fainted as I awoke (quickly) on the floor  alongside the cupboards and sliding glass door.  I laid there conscious about 15 minutes till I felt confident I could get up on my own.  As result of fall I bit upper and lower lip on right (no blood just skin injured), must have clenched my teeth because my left posterior teeth were sensitive to cold and I injured my right ankle. After I got up and realized my ankle hurt with pressure I put on a support knee high to control swelling.  Injury seemed to be focused on the ankle bone. I applied ice for recommended 20 on 20 off protocol for most of both 2/25 and 2/26, elevated and took OTC Aleve as directed on package.  Bruising observed from heel, behind ankle bone and front of ankle.   Called PCP, she recommended continue as I have and she will contact me tomorrow, March 1

Pharmacist let me stay until I felt I could drive.  I came home and took Tylenol for headache.  5 hrs later I felt extremely ill with joint pain , fever , dizziness.  Vomiting occured during the night along with fainting.  Next morning drank tea, no food. Slept all day until 5pm.  Slept through night.  Sun. still had extreme joint pain and headache.  Was able to eat a light meal. Today I ate normally, went to physical therapy with a reduced routine.  I still have a headache as of Mon. night. I know these seem like Normal side effects, but these were like having the worst Flu ever.

After a few more minutes we tried to sit her up again, she had another syncopal episode, again non-responsive.  We called for EMT transport to the hospital.

Did show it appeared the arteries had gone into a spasm which may have caused the heart attack.  I saw my primary Dr on Monday, 3/8/21, and she said I have no history of heart problems, no high cholesterol, etc. I asked her if this could be a side effect of my vaccine. Dr. said it was a good question &amp; she didn&#39;t know the answer, since not all the research has been done. She suggested I submit my question to VAERS!

No sleep, hot and cold flashes, significant aches esp. in legs (even my eyeballs hurt!).  Pain resolved by AM.  Next day arm got a bit itchy.  3 days later arm itched like I had poison ivy and  fingers / hands had pain and joint swelling.  Used a prescription steroid cream on arm and that resolved itching.  Hands, fingers took 10 days to return to normal.  All in all 14 days to recover completely from 2nd Moderna Covid shot.

                                                I  awoke this morning  feeling feverish.  I walked to the kitchen to take tea  and a  Curamin tablet since I had run out of Advil.. I began to feel as though I was going to vomit so walked slowly to the toilet, knelt in front, then made a quarter turn,, thinking  this would not happen, and I fainted/blacked out.  I found myself face down in front of toilet and a good bump on my right eyebrow....face turned inward. I stayed still long enough to feel safe to rise and so did.  No  more sense of vomiting, thank goodness.  Just  very very tired.  I did make oatmeal with blueberies for breakfast and ate this slowly.  Just wanted to ask if this is to be expected.  It is now four hours fifteen minutes since this happened.  As I walk carefully ,  I am trusting all will be well ...but when?

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

                                                Pt developed severe hypotension and two episodes of syncope at onset of hypotension.  Since that date we have struggled to maintain her blood pressure over a systolic of 100.  She frequently runs 75/55 sitting down.  She is not orthostatic.  Resting P has increased from 80 to 95.  She is currently taking Droxidopa 400mg tid prn and Midodrine 10mg prn.  Additionally, when these do not raise her systolic to 100, she takes 100 Hydrocortisone.  The presumed diagnosis is dysautonomia, and she has been referred to a specialty center.

                                                Patient suffered cardiac arrest two days  (on 3/5) following first dose Moderna Vaccine at Rite Aid Pharmacy (3/3).  The following is the Discharge Summary From 3/26.    Resident Attestation: I personally saw and examined the patient on rounds with my cariology resident team on the day of the resident&#39;s note. Management was discussed with the cardiology resident and I supervised the plan of care. I have reviewed and agree with the key parts of the resident evaluation including:  Subjective information Objective findings on physical exam Impression and plan Gen: appears comfortable, sitting in bed Resp: clear. no wheezes, rhonchi, rales CV: normal rate, regular, no m/r/g Abd: soft, nt/nd Ext: warm, no edema. Pressure ulcer boots on. Pleasant 70-year-old woman who had a history of PVCs, left bundle branch block, and a mild nonischemic cardiomyopathy, came into the hospital following a VT/VF cardiac arrest. Her echocardiogram done while in the hospital showed a preserved ejection fraction. Her cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. She had implantation of an ICD. Hospital course has been complicated by watershed cerebral infarcts. In addition, she had an episode of C. difficile colitis. She has gradually improved over the course of the past 3 weeks. From a cardiovascular perspective, she is being discharged on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and her home atorvastatin. With regards to her etiology of cardiac arrest, I would be suspicious about the possibility of sarcoidosis. However, we were not able to get a cardiac MR while she was inpatient due to her strokes and inability to consistently follow commands and hold her breath. Would recommend consideration of an outpatient PET. She is ready to discharge to subacute rehab today. I have spent greater than 30 minutes in discharge planning.  Primary Discharge Diagnosis VT/VF cardiac arrest, s/p therapeutic hypothermia S/p AICD placement 3/16/2021 Secondary Discharge Diagnoses Anoxic brain injury, recovering, with persistent aphasia and dysphagia C. difficile colitis Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, resolved DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness 70 y.o. female, with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted on 3/5/2021 after out of hospital VT/VF cardiac arrest. She completed therapeutic hypothermia protocol. Cardiac catheterization did not show any significant obstructive coronary disease. TTE showed LVEF 55%. Patient underwent AICD placement on 3/16/2021. Had some recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia afterward, which resolved after increasing her carvedilol doses. Her course was complicated by a C. difficile infection, treated with PO Vancomycin, with significant improvement in diarrhea. She has had gradual neurologic recovery. Neurology felt she had had several watershed infarcts, but felt that she would continue to have a prolonged recovery over the next few months. Had some recovery of language/cognition prior to discharge. Due to her waxing/waning encephalopathy, she did not qualify for inpatient rehab, but will be discharged to subacute rehab. Discharged with tube feeding continued, though she can begin sips with speech therapy supervision. Patient seen and examined at bedside on the day of discharge. She stated that she had no pain, though HPI/ROS still limited due to aphasia. Discussed above information with patient&#39;s husband, who understood and was in agreement with the plan.  Problem-Based Hospital Course NEURO Acute metabolic encephalopathy, with gradual recovery -Due to neurologic injury from cardiac arrest. -Neurology consult: concern for anoxic brain injury with watershed infarcts, anticipate very gradual recovery over the coming months. No acute process on imaging. -Patient extubated on 3/11, following some commands. Continuing to regain conversational ability and motor function gradually each day. Has some waxing and waning of mental status, but overall her encephalopathy  continues to improve. -Limit centrally acting/sedating medications -Speech following for language/cognition as well as dysphagia requiring tube feeding. Can begin some sips in addition to tube feeds. -Continue tube feeds via Dobbhoff tube per instructions provided on after visit summary INFECTIOUS DISEASE C. Difficile Colitis: -C.Diff Positive 3/18. Continue 125 mg PO Vancomycin Q6H for 10 days (3/18 - 3/27), confirmed with infectious disease -Frequency of diarrhea has decreased significantly, was stable after rectal tube removed 2-3 days prior to discharge Pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, resolved -s/p 5 day course ceftriaxone (3/5 - 3/9 ) -CTA on admission showed significant RUL and RLL consolidation with air bronchograms, as well as some patchy airspace disease in LUL -Had copious tan sputum on suctioning 3/7 - respiratory culture negative CARDIOLOGY Out of hospital cardiac arrest, likely VT/VF -Pt&#39;s husband initiated chest compressions x 10 minutes, until police/fire dept arrival, when AED showed a shockable rhythm. Likely VT/VF arrest. -S/p therapeutic hypothermia protocol. -Troponin peaked at 1.09 -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), resolved Chronic left bundle branch block -Has had multiple episodes of NSVT noted on telemetry 3/19 - 3/20 -s/p ICD as above -Increased dose of Carvedilol to 25 mg BID with resolution of NSVT  History of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 55% -Echo in 11/2019 demonstrated EF 42% (nadir). -TTE on admission showed recovered EF to 55%, mild concentric LVH, normal RV systolic function, no valvular abnormalities -Was initially started on aspirin/statin due to high suspicion for CAD, but as cardiac cath 3/15 was unremarkable, these medications were discontinued. -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Hypertension -Blood pressure now improved after restarting home lisinopril and initiating carvedilol -HCTZ discontinued as BP now well controlled on above regimen  RENAL Oliguria, resolved -Pt initially had low urine output since admission, improved to 0.5 cc/kg/hr on 3/9. Continue fluids with free water flushes through tube feeds -Has had normal electrolytes, renal function, and urine output since initial renal recovery. RESPIRATORY Acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to cardiac arrest, s/p mechanical ventilation, extubated 3/11 -Patient successfully extubated 3/11, stable respiratory status. Protecting airway well. -Encourage incentive spirometry HEMATOLOGY Acute normocytic anemia, improving -Pt had Hgb drop from baseline around 13-14 at admission to 10.9, now around 10-11. -Has iron saturation of 11%. Normal LDH/bilirubin, ruling out hemolysis. -Started oral iron supplements -Consider outpatient screening for colon cancer ENDOCRINE Osteoporosis - on alendronate at home Discharge Disposition Discharge to skilled nursing facility Active Issues Requiring Follow-up Cardiology -follow-up for AICD placement PCP -post hospital follow-up Test Results Pending at Discharge -none

                                                Amnesia; Cardiac disorder; Thrombosis; Transient ischaemic attack; This case was received via another Manufacturer (Reference number: vsafe) on 27-Apr-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 27-Apr-2021.    This regulatory authority case was reported by an other health care professional and describes the occurrence of AMNESIA (Amnesia), CARDIAC DISORDER (Cardiac disorder), THROMBOSIS (Thrombosis) and TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK (Transient ischaemic attack) in a 70-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 027L20A) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Glaucoma and Hypothyroidism. Concurrent medical conditions included Stroke. Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE, BRIMONIDINE, LATANOPROST and TIMOLOL for an unknown indication.

The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

                                                8 am the following morning after the vaccine, I became very flushed and hot and don&#39;t remember leaving my seat at the breakfast table. I found myself on the floor on the other side of the table.  I had fainted which has never happened  to me in my lifetime.  I was drenched in sweat, and nauseous, and a headache began and lasted the day.  I spent the day resting and was fine the following day.  I do have an occasional hot flash, even at 71 years old.   I was alert, oriented, and had a bruise on my shoulder.  I had now reoccurring issues .

Took Tylenol which did not improve any symptoms.  Got headache and had that with the arm in the pain all night long.  Woke up totally drenched by sweating, and went to the bathroom and felt dizzy yelled for her husband and passed out, and her husband caught her while passing out and woke up on the floor.  On the Thursday she was in her recliner the entire day, had nausea, fever, chills, headache, continued with the pain of the arm in a vice, which lasted all day long.  Her husband forced crackers and water down her as she had no appetite either for 3 days.   She felt so fatigued and her head was not clear.  She slowly gradually improved, and yesterday 3/18/21 she feels her head fogginess has improved, and her arm is gone as she has been exercising with a band.  It is a little sore but otherwise fine.  The excruciating pain lasted for 2 full days.   She put some Lidocaine and it possibly helped.  She called her doctor and they told her to exercise the arm, and to take more Tylenol, which she had tried which did not improve anything.

March 7th right hand went numb again and had vision problems with right eye, cleared up in about 15 minutes.  March 9th right hand and right side of face went numb.  Went to hospital and was examined and told I was having a stroke.  I was admitted to hospital for two days.  MRI showed that I had a stroke and now have some brain tissue damage.  I and now going to occupational therapy to regain use of right hand.  The Doctors thought that it was pretty coincidental that my first stroke symptom (transient numb right hand on the 6th) started just a couple days after I got the second dose of the moderna vaccine.

                                                On March 6, I woke up feeling like I had a Charlie horse in my left calf. I tried to walk and it was sore but I felt it would go away in a day or two. By Wednesday, March 10, I called my doctor and after telling them my left calf hurt , they had me come right in. After seeing dr  I was sent to get a sonogram immediately  and was told I had a blood clot  inside my  left knee. I was sent back to Dr and was given Xerelto 15 mg twice a day for 21 days and the 20 mg once a day until gone.  Today,, it is still sore. I am asking if I should take my second shot on March 29 or not.

Within a  week she started haveing swings in her Blood pressure some times associated with numbness sensation left face, arm and  left lower extremity.   I saw  her on  March 27 with the same.   Neg CT work up, including neg CT angio gram of head and neck.  I transfered pt for insurance reasons.  I called and spoke with  her daughter on April 2.   Pt was having same symptoms, although improved.   I ask about MRI. She was told that there may or may not have been a stroke on that study. .   My impression was CVA with subjective left sided parestesia or TIA.

I looked at the browser history in her cellphone and on the night of April 4, she googled &#34;Heart attack symptoms in women&#34; and &#34;Moderna vaccination side effects.&#34; I think she didn&#39;t go to the doctor because she figured her symptoms were related to her vaccine -- even though it had been a week.   I wanted to report her death because I don&#39;t trust her doctor to do it. It took him two weeks and a call from me to complain before he signed her death certificate. He listed April 9, 2021 as the official date of death because that&#39;s when she was found, even though the deputy coroner told me she died on either the 4th or the 5th.

I called 911. while waiting I placed ice on the back of her neck and she began to respond, as she began to become more responsive she defecate all over herself. I checked her blood sugar it was 159.  The ambulance arrived, they checked her vitals said they were ok, they gave me the option of monitoring her at home or going to the ER. I chose to monitor her at home. Monday all day she still had a fever complaining of headache, joint pain and pain in the arm she received the vaccine, at times she became very delirious, nothing she said made sense. . Her doctor said she had a seizure and offer to place her on seizure medication. I gave her two  500mg Tylenol   she has an appointment on March 7th for the second dose but I am afraid to give her the second dose.

We think she aspirated (she has a history of dsyphagia) which caused pneumonia.  However, I am reporting this because it was within 24 hours of receiving her vaccine.

Shortly after she checked her blood sugar she passed out.  Her daughter is a nurse and when she arrived, she checked the patient&#39;s blood pressure which was noted to be in the 90s systolic.  Shortly after that a re-check of her blood pressure improved to 117/60 .  Patient was scheduled to be seen with her primary care provider on the 26th to verify that patient was stable.

                                                On Monday night, Day 4, I woke at 11 p.m. with chills and shaking, temperature of 99.9 F. Went to the bathroom, urinated, took Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke again at 2:00 a.m, still chilled, and tried to stand up and my legs wouldn&#39;t hold me. I managed to lift myself to my feet and clutching furniture get to the bathroom, with complete loss of bladder control on the way. Took more Tyleonol, drank more water, put on clean pajamas but couldn&#39;t lift my knees to step into them, had to put them on the floor and pull them up. Went to sleep eventually. When I woke at about 5 a.m., all was completely normal. No fever, legs fine, usual bladder control.

                                                Blood clot on right lung; soreness in arm; A spontaneous report was received from  a 72 year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced blood clot on right lung  (pulmonary embolism) and myalgia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Heart attack; Fatigue; Chest Pain; Cough; Fever; Muscle pain in chest area; Chills; A spontaneous report  was received from a 72 year-old female patient who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and developed heart attack (myocardial infarction), fever (pyrexia), cough, fatigue, muscle pain in chest area (myalgia), chills, and chest pain.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25-JAN-2021, 26 hours prior to the onset of events, the patient received her second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot#: unknown) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 26-JAN-2021, the patient reported they have developed chills, fever, and muscle pain in the chest area. The reporter specified that it wasn&#39;t chest pain.  The patient took acetaminophen for the pain. On 27-JAN-2021, the patient reported her fever subsided but she was still having a little cough and chest pain.  On 28-JAN-2021, the patient had chest pain again during a nap and decided to call 911 because she was about to pass out. The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) where an EKG (electrocardiogram) was performed. A few moments after the EKG, the patient had a heart attack. The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin. At the time of this report, the patient was still feeling fatigued but other than that, she was feeling better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, heart attack, cough, muscle pain in chest area, fever, chills, and chest pain, were resolved. The outcome of the event, fatigue, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Shortness of breath, cough onset Sunday April 4th.  DATE OF SERVICE: 04.06.2021   CT ANGIOGRAPHY, CHEST (CPT=71275); PULMONARY EMBOLUS PROTOCOL; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION  CLINICAL INDICATION: SOB (shortness of breath)  COMPARISON STUDY: 10/9/2020  TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were performed during dynamic contrast enhancement for the  optimization of the opacification of the pulmonary arteries, following IV administration of 80 mL of  Isovue 370. Three-dimensional reformation into the coronal plane was performed.  Automated exposure control and ALARA manual techniques for patient specific dose reduction were  followed while maintaining the necessary diagnostic image quality.  ADVERSE REACTION: None  FINDINGS:  PULMONARY ARTERIES: There is a large filling defect within the right interlobar artery, extending  into the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe. There is expansion of  the right interlobar artery by this thrombus. Small filling defect is noted within the distal left  main pulmonary artery, with some extension to the left upper lobe and left lower lobe lobar  segments.  HEART AND VASCULATURE: The heart is normal size. No pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of  right heart strain.  MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  Heterogeneous densities are seen in the right lower lobe, new since the prior  exam. Scarring is noted in the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well as in the anterior  left lower lobe..  PLEURA: Small right pleural effusion.  CHEST WALL, LOWER NECK, AND AXILLA: Grossly unremarkable.  UPPER ABDOMEN: Grossly unremarkable.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen within the visualized spine.  IMPRESSION  1.  Bilateral PE, with extensive thrombus on the right and minimal thrombus on the left as detailed  above.  2.  Small right pleural effusion and heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation, likely reflecting  pulmonary infarction.

The patient&#39;s husband states that &#34;crashed an hour and a half after she got the shot.&#34;  He defines this &#34;crash&#34; as decreased blood sugar, decreased responsiveness, and the seizures.  She presented to the Hospital for evaluation and was subsequently transferred to the Medical Center on April 4th for further workup. She was intubated on April 4th and subsequently self-extubated on April 8th. Nursing staff and documentation indicate that the patient has had no further seizures since her presentation to the medical center.  On April 14th she was found to have an acute lower extremity DVT. She was placed on a heparin drip and her platelet&#39;s dropped to 35. The heparin drip was discontinued, a HIT panel was ordered, and argatroban was started. Heamtology was consulted and the patient was found to have thrombotic thrombocytopenia. An MRI of the brain was ordered to rule out CNS thrombosis given recent seizures. The MRI has not been performed yet and the patient is still hospitalized.

By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                Atrial Fibrillation; Tachycardia (Double heart rate); A spontaneous report was received from a 73-year-old female consumer who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced atrial fibrillation and tachycardia.   The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 09 Jan 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 10 Jan 2021, the patient reported having atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. Treatment for the events included metoprolol.    Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, were considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 73-year-old, female patient. The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient experienced an unexpected event of Atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. The event occurred 2 days after the first dose of mRNA-1273. Very limited information regarding this event has been provided at this time.  Based on temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

In early a.m. hours, felt dizzy, feeling of sick stomach, and fainted in the bathroom.  Paramedics were called by my spouse and they worked with me, then was transported by  Ambulance to emergency room where they ran tests and released me the same day.  I was told by the doctor that apparently my blood pressure decreased too fast causing me to faint.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen. The patient was seen by physician and then sent to emergency room where it was determined that the patient had DVT in the left leg. A computerized tomogram (CT) scan found clots in the left lung, or saddle PE.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital.  Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking. Main field defaults to possibly related&#39;

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the first COVID vaccine she developed shortness of breath that was much more significant than she had previously. This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don&#39;t think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I&#39;m sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.

                                                Pneumonia; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer  concerning his mother, a 73-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.

She was fatigued and coughing blood and was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment included azithromycin, and the patient seemed to improve.  On 05 Feb 2021, the patient developed a temperature of 101°F, coughed up blood and was very fatigued. She was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment for the event included levofloxacin.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, pneumonia, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of pneumonia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 13 Feb 2021, the patient received the first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch# 007M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).  The outcome of the events was resolved on 15 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Additional information has been requested.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded

                                                The day before the first vaccine she was up and acting normal, laundry, housework and knew what to do.   She has severe dementia but was doing OK and knew where she was.  She got the first vaccine on 1/29/21, and the 3rd and 4th day they noticed she was having hallucinations and saying things that weren&#39;t there.  She could hear baby&#39;s crying but there were no baby&#39;s present.   Within 7 days she had what the son described as a stroke. He said that she was watching television and he was on a conference call and he noticed she walked into a wall and he asked if she was okay and starting stumbling across the room and when he touched her she felt very heavy and said that one side of her face was drooping.  He got her back into the chair and called 9-1-1.  She was so agitated at the hospital that the husband does not know what they gave her and they kept her for a week.    They finally got her under control.  They discharged her from there and she that was all that they could do with her.  They brought her home with nurses assistance and her paranoia was evident, hallucinations were very evident. They said that they tried to do a CAT Scan and an MRI and they said that she did not have a stroke.   Restless was very adamant, talking strange things and wanting to go to her son&#39;s house when she was there.  Before that vaccination she knew where she was and after that she did not know where she was thinking she was at one location and just confusion.     She then got her 2nd vaccine and then her husband went out of town and took her back home on 2/24/21 as he was able to get her in a car and travel and able to eat and knew somewhat what was going on.  On 2/25/21 when he brought her home to  a long term care facility.  She was chanting constantly, had irritability, anger, cognition completely eroded.  She was very agitated, very combative.  Drugs would not calm her down, and tried to get CAT scans or MRI&#39;s but were unsuccessful due to her combativeness.  She was screaming and yelling 24 hours a day to the top of her lungs and gave her Ativan which had the adverse effects of what they were supposed to do.  Had biting, hallucinations, paranoia.   She had a couple of falls, they had her in a wheelchair and tried to feed her and she would fall down.  They took her to the hospital a few times and she progressively got worse.  On 4/19/21 she shut down and quit eating, quit drinking, closed her eyes, and lasted a week like that and then she died on 4/24/21 @ 2:30 AM.   None of her doctors could figure out what had happened.  They were finally able to get a CAT scan and felt that she may have a stroke.      Finally they memory care facility told them to come a take her to the hospital and they had moved their hospice patient&#39;s as she was screaming and disruptive and they could not handle her anymore.     They thought she was suffering from Lewy body dementia at one point.  They were going to have her tested for that and they could not do it on Saturday when she passed for genetics and missed those timelines and could not do it.

I was transported that evening to the stroke  division that same evening for further evaluation, tests and care.  I have never had a mini stroke before this.The doctors said it may have been from the vaccination, or it may not have been precipitated by it.  They said they don&#39;t have enough information on the Moderna vaccine to make that call.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

This included a strange sensation of my head floating and an odd sense of loosing consciousness.  The vertigo was awful, and I could barely stand.  This lasted each evening for about 6 night.  It subsided in the morning, after I felt more stabilized in walking.

The patient&#39;s medical history included back problems with osteoarthritis in the spinal column neck and lower back. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included celecoxib and nortriptyline.   On 20 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient reported she got very dizzy and passed out. Her husband relays that she was totally out for a couple of seconds. She went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a vasovagal reaction and urinary tract infection. Premature ventricular contractions were also discovered and was not known prior to this event. Patient reports a normal blood pressure of 114-120/75. Patient also stated her arm was sore the day after vaccine but not hurting much during her usual four mile walk.   Treatment for the event included intravenous medications in the emergency room, cephalexin, and a heart monitor.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events passed out, dizziness, vasovagal reaction and arm pain were resolved. The outcome of the events, urinary tract infection and premature ventricular contractions were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.  The events occurred the next day after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  Further information have been requested.

                                                74 yo woman living in a group home for people with developmental disabilities. She has longstanding difficult-to-control seizure disorder, on valproate, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam. She had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in November 2020, probably discovered in the course of surveillance testing of residents/staff, perhaps in relation to an outbreak in the residence.  Sometime during the night following her vaccination earlier that morning, she developed a fever, and then was found to be having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Estimates of duration in the records range from 20 to 40 minutes. She was brought by ambulance to Hospital ED, and then admitted. Her temperature was said to be 103 F.  She received midazolam, and at least one dose of IV antibiotics. By the evening of admission on 5 February 2021, she was still unresponsive.  On arrival, her COVID-19 PCR was again/still positive. She had no prodromal symptoms suggesting COVID-19 reinfection, nor did anyone in the group home, staff or residents.  Her initial WBC was normal but with a slight left shift. UA was normal. Head CT showed her known cerebral atrophy and chronic microvascular disease.  Admitting valproate serum level was subtherapeutic; levatiracetam and lamotrigine levels were therapeutic.  Blood cultures are no growth at 2 days. Urine culture negative.  By hospital day 2, her transaminases had bumped to over 1000.

She felt weak and tired  after this episode and so went back to bed for several hours.  Later that day she had another episode of feeling lightheaded as if she might pass out, while sitting at a hair salon waiting for her appointment, but did not actually pass out, just felt a wave of heat and slight nausea, but did not faint.  She had one further near syncopal episode at home later that night when she also noticed she was a little &#34;jittery&#34; and noted a strange smell that the rest of her family did not notice.    She also reports that she has had near syncopal episodes in the past and thinks she may have been a little dehydrated the day these incidents occurred.

Then came back to consciousness on the floor with a definite knot on my head from a fall.  Crash was enough to wake my husband who said I was out about 5 minutes.

About 10 minutes later, stood up and walked about 4 meters to the refrigerator, grabbed onto handles and my husband rushed over and grabbed me as ir seemed I was going to fall. Sat me down in sofa, where after short? while  I recovered. After getting up to go to refrigerator, no recollection of anything that followed. My internist?s diagnosis - síncope.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning herself, a 74-year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced medically important event of atrial fibrillation.  The patient&#39;s medical history included heart surgery on an unspecified date in 2017. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 015L20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date in FEB 2021, the patient experienced fast heart rate, felt weakness, dizziness, and had atrial fibrillation. No treatment medication information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on current information the event was assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 vaccine, because of biological implausibility, no clear temporal association, and the patient&#39;s history of heart surgery which may promote atrial fibrillation episodes.

                                                22 hours after vaccination and one hour after taking morning pills, patient developed full body rash and itching.  Morning meds she consumed were: Losartan, amlodipine, pravastatin, escitalopram, baby aspirin, vitamin D3.  Episode of rash and itching improved with oral Benadryl 50 mg.  The next day patient took her meds same time and one hour later developed rash.  Took Benadryl and rash resolved.  Patient then stopped medications for 1 week and had no occurrences of rash.  Restarted medications morning of 3/10/21 and developed full body rash with itching and early anaphylaxis, one hour after medication consumed.  It should be noted, patient has been on these medications for several years without reaction.  Reaction started after she had received the Moderna COVID19 vaccination.  On 3/10/21 when she had full body rash with anaphylaxis, patient presented to our clinic and was given 2 rounds of IM epinephrine, IM Benadryl 50 mg, IM Solu-Medrol 125 mg, and oral Zyrtec.  Episode took 2.5 hours to resolve.  Patient prescribed tapering course of prednisone, Zyrtec once daily, famotidine 20 mg once daily for the next 7 days, outpatient.  We will be restarting one medication at a time to assess for medication reaction.

                                                Faint; Dizzy; Slight reaction; Very tired; A spontaneous report, was received from a consumer (patient), a 74 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced faint (syncope), dizzy (dizziness), slight reaction (vaccination complication) and very tired (fatigue).  The patient&#39;s current conditions included atrial fibrillation, back trouble and peripheral neuropathy (diagnosed years ago). The patient had medication allergies to pain medications and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Concomitant products included digoxin, carisoprodol, metamizole sodium and warfarin sodium.  On 09-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09FEB--2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had a slight reaction and became very tired, faint and dizzy. The patient&#39;s husband helped her to bed. The next morning on 10-FEB-2021, the events were resolved. The patient was scheduled for next Moderna vaccine (second dose) on 09-MAR-2021. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, faint, dizzy, slight reaction and very tired was recovered/resolved on 10-FEB-2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Patient is a lovely 74-year-old female with a long history of PACs and hypertension.  Her blood pressure has been getting a little bit worse over the past years.  She was admitted through the ER with 1st known episode of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She reports that on 02/02 she received her 2nd COVID vaccine.  She had joint achiness and a low-grade temperature.  She rested the following day but then on 02/04 went for her usual hour long runs/hike.  She did not feel very well during exercise and started have a headache and some increasing palpitations.  Later that evening she was watching TV and started to have significant tachycardia that was irregular. Symptoms persisted and she presented to the ER which sound to be in AFib with rapid ventricular response with a blood pressure of 215/158. She was started on a diltiazem drip and has converted to sinus rhythm with PACs.  Blood pressure has improved significantly.  Troponin negative x2.   Her last evaluation at a Heart facility was  in 2017.  She had an echocardiogram in 2014 with normal EF, mild MR and mild TR with normal estimated PA systolic pressure.   She denies chest pain or dyspnea.  No history of syncope.  Sometimes with palpitation she does get lightheaded.  She gets occasional lower extremity edema that seems dependent in nature.  She is still having palpitations but recognizes that she is no longer in atrial fibrillation as that was more severe in terms of symptoms of tachycardia.

                                                Adverse reaction began around midnight with chills, continued throughout the night alternating chills and hot flashes, severe backache, muscle aches in thighs and general malaise.  Got up around 8 to try to take a warm shower to ease muscle aches but as soon as I got into the bathroom I felt very hot, very nauseated and lightheaded.  I suspected hypotension but of course I wasn&#39;t able to prove it at the time. I attempted to get back to my bed but had syncopal episode a few feet from the bed where I collapsed onto the floor.  I just stayed on the floor and rested because it actually felt better lying down. I am a retired RN and suspect this adverse event was related to orthostatic hypotension.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

                                                By 9:00pm I was feeling a  little sick, like the flu. By morning I had a temp of 100.1 and felt very sick but did not get out of bed.  At 1;00PM  I woke up and stood up out of bed and collapses onto the floor.  I was unable to get up.  I found my phone which had fallen onto the floor.  I was shaking so bad I kept dropping it.  I looked and my phone and was  unable to figure out how to make a call.  The screen did not make sense.  Eventually I was able to call my daughter who decided to call 911.  The paramedics came, picked me up  off of the floor and helped me walk to the living room.  My legs kept giving out like I was going to fall again.  They were asking questions but I was unable  to answer coherently. I was so confused.  My brain was not working.  They took me to the hospital where I was admitted and many tests were done.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the vaccine, began feeling different with headache, body ache and chills.  Upon arising in the morning  at about 7:45 AM was not feeling well.  Set down at the dining room table with my husband to take my temperature.  While still sitting at the table my husband caught me as I was passing out/fainting.  Bellevue paramedics were  called and transported my to the hospital.  I was alert during this time.  i was transported to the Bellevue Nebraska Medical Center emergency room.  After being checked out in the ER, I was admitted to the hospital for overnight observation.  Released from the hospital about noon the next day.  There were no adverse findings.

The patient&#39;s medical history included three-year history of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion. No concomitant medication were provided.  On 21 Jan 2021, patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number 042L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 18 Feb 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the events, patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number 03/L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 19 Feb 2021, the patient&#39;s heart beats per minute went up and down from 73 bpm to 128 bpm. The patient stayed in atrial fibrillation for four days and on an unknown date the patient went to the Emergency Room (ER). On 24 Feb 2021, Wednesday the patient was admitted to the hospital. Cardioversion was performed to return heartbeat to a normal rhythm as patient&#39;s heart rhythm was not stable with intravenous (IV) medication. The patient was buildup of body fluid.  Laboratory details included cardioversion.  Treatment information for events could not stabilize her heart rhythm (arrhythmias) include Flecainide.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events heart beats per minute went up and down (atrial fibrillation) and could not stabilize her heart rhythm (arrhythmias) was not reported.

Because I very rarely drink alcohol, a little bit makes me sleepy.  After about 4 sips, I broke into a cold sweat, could barely manage to stand up and call out to my husband.  I then lost consciousness  (and wet myself).  (My husband caught me).  I have never fainted or passed out in my entire life!  I regained consciousness about 2 minutes later and then had the shakes for quite a while.  For the next day and a half I felt as if a truck had run over me.

On an unknown date, over the weekend, the patient had difficulty breathing. On 08 Mar 2021, in the morning, the patient was hospitalized for chest pains and difficulty breathing. On the same day lab data revealed that she had blood clots in both of her lungs. On an unknown date, the patient had clots in both legs as well. She was hospitalized for a week and was in rehabilitation being monitored. The reporter also informed that the patient will be hospitalized until 18 Mar 2021 for the clots in both legs. The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the event, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the event is not applicable.

At the time of the report, PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis), INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere), BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion), INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease) and CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) had not resolved and MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 27-Jan-2021, Computerised tomogram: no sign change (Inconclusive) stable findings of pulmonary fibrosis/chronic interstitial lung disease. On 27-Jan-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 % (normal) 99 room air. On 27-Jan-2021, Pulmonary function test: abnormal (abnormal) moderate reduction in diffusion capacity; forced vital, total lung, and diffusion capacities diminished. On 03-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 95 % (normal) room air. On 04-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) no PE, dramatic worsening of diffuse infiltrates much c/w UIP pattern; bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced. On 05-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 80 % (abnormal) 94 at rest, 80 when ambulating, then 96 when ambulating with O2. On 08-Mar-2021, Echocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) EF 60-65%, RVSP moderately elevated- 45 mmHg, mild MV regurgitation. On 21-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) low lung volumes with reticular opacities both lungs-uncertain if acute pneumonia or chronic fibrotic chnage. On 22-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) increased small pleural effusion and evidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy; overall fibrosis increased. On 23-Mar-2021, Bronchoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) neutrophilic lavage with negative cultures. On 09-Apr-2021, Oxygen saturation: 78 % (Low) 78% Room air 88% on 4L/min O2; 91% on 8L/min. On 14-Apr-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) diffuse interstitial infiltrates, no pleural effusion.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis), INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere), BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease), CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) and MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps).    Patient was seen by physician (MD) (the reporter, a pulmonary specialist) on 27 Jan 2021 with complaint of short of breath with heavy exertion; was chronically breathless going up stairs.  Her pulmonary physiology had been relatively stable over last couple of years.  Impression: Appeared to have worsening restrictive physiology (also reported as slight worsening) in the setting of stable pulmonary fibrosis on imaging.  Then, on 04 Mar 2021, the patient presented with worsened breathlessness of rather acute onset, starting approximately 24 Feb 2021.  Repeat CT scan showed no pulmonary embolism but showed dramatic worsening of her pulmonary parenchyma and then findings suggesting exacerbation of underlying IPF like picture.  The was also a significant change in spirometry.  She was placed on large dose prednisone with transient stabilization but then presented to the emergency room on 21 Mar 2021 very breathless.  No obvious infectious like picture.  She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids.  One more CT scan showed continued abnormalities with again increased ground-glass opacification.  She showed desaturation with limited activity.  The patient was hospitalized for 7 days, then discharged to inpatient rehab for 10 days on prednisone 60 mg.  She improved slightly and was discharged home on 6L of O2 with exertion and 4L at rest.  On 14 Apr 2021, the patient saw MD for follow-up at which time she was breathless with any significant activities and had difficulty getting around.  She was approved for nintedanib therapy for progressive pulmonary fibrosis.  Assessment included acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The events are probably related to the patient&#39;s comorbidities.
