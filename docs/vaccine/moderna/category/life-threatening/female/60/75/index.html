The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine my arm was very sore, it felt like someone punched me in my arm. That night I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I took Tylenol and put on ice on it.  The next morning, I was going to the bathroom and I almost passed out. I was able to catch myself before I passed out. I felt nauseous and dizzy, I felt like I was going to throw up but I couldn&#39;t. I had chills. I went downstairs to try and drink some orange juice, I seat here and was gasping to catch my breathe. I kept thinking it was just my anxiety and kept trying to catch my breathe. I kept drinking the orange juice and the dizziness seemed to go away. I went to work, I was tired, chills and this lasted for 2 days. on Friday the 12th the rash (the rash which I developed from the 1st dose) seemed to get worse, when I took a shower, the heat from the water seemed to make the rash redder. I continued Hydrocortisone cream and then switched to Lubiderm. Neither seemed to help much so I kept switching  between the two, eventually the rash did get lighter, it went away under my breast area but it is still there on my stomach. I filed a VAERS report for the first dose as well.  About 8 days after receiving the vaccine, I have a tattoo on my right thigh and a red bump appeared on my tattoo, it was hurt. It was a bump and the next day the bump burst, it was hard and crusty. Then a rash developed around the tattoo. I have also had on and off fluttering of my eyelid since receiving the vaccine. I had made a dermatology appointment but I canceled it  because it seems like the rash is going away and my deductible is to high. 2/26/2021 My right arm from the shoulder from down to fingers, is numb and hurting. Yesterday 02/28/2021, I got up in the morning and felt like I was going to pass out, I came downstairs and I got some orange juice. I got dizzy and couldn&#39;t catch my breathe, I told my husband to call 911,because I thought I was having a stroke. My husband said I passed out, my eye and my mouth were open, he shook my shoulders and called my name no response this lasted for about 3-5 seconds, then I take a deep gasp and came back. I was sweating profusely and pale. EMS arrived, transported me to hospital. My blood pressure was high while I was sitting and it was low when I tried to stand. I went to hospital 02/28/2021. The  ER diagnosed with my syncope and wanted me to follow with a cardiologist. They believe since it was 2 weeks out since the vaccine, they do not believe it was the vaccine.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful. I provided you guys with my cell but if you want to follow up, I use my phone for work so if you text first I cant tell you availability.

                                                She got her vaccine and had no reactions at all.  On 3/12/21 she was in her car and started having stabbing pain in the left side of her chest under the rib.  She thought it was gas pains and dismissed it, and then it started radiating towards the front and the stomach.  On 3/16/21 she went to the ER and they did a CT scan that showed that she had a blood clot on her spleen.  With that they gave her the diagnosis of idiopathic splenic infarction.  She was then sent by ambulance to another hospital to be admitted in case she was needing surgery.  She was given heparin and on that for 2 1/2 days.  They determined that 60% of her spleen is dead, blood supply cut off to it, and the other 40% is nonfunctional.  On 3/19/21 they gave her vaccines of Prevnar 13, HIB, meningococcal, meningococcal B, and a flu vaccine.  She was discharged on the 3/20/21 with Plavix.  She saw her regular doctor yesterday and he diagnosed her with functional asplenia and to continue the Plavix.   She is no longer having any symptoms after dissolving the blood clot.

I went to lay down and was not able to.  It was hard to breath.  I got up, went to another room where there was a recliner and sat in it trying to catch my breath.  It got harder to breathe.  I had my husband call 911. I went to the ER, had a CT scan of my chest and was found to have ?extensive PE?s?, ground glass and signs of pneumonitis.   I was admitted to the CICU for two days and was transferred for two days.  I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that there was a high unlikelihood of PE?s developing from my ankle fracture 3 months later.  I had home health care for approximately one month.

I either passed out or fell asleep. Around 1AM I woke up and checked my temperature 102.7.  Some point after I took some Tylenol but don&#39;t remember when. I finally had to call for help from my family in the morning because I was not able to pee or drink. Tuesday was my fever was still 102.7 with taking Tylenol and Advil it would just go back up.  Tuesday I had Riggers again about 5:30 it only lasted 3-5 minutes. Wednesday my fever went down to 101.4-101.5. Have had difficulty swallowing when the fever is high, did not feel as if I had a allergic reaction or that my throat was sore it was just hard to swallow.  I have a weird bruise on my arm I have clue where I got it. I didn&#39;t urinate for 9 hours. Headache. Pulse OX was at 93-94 for Monday and Tuesday but then it came it up 95-98 yesterday.  As of today I still pretty weak no fever when I woke up.

                                                On 1/23/21 the patient had a single-car accident, slid off icy road into snowbank. She was seen in our ER, diagnosed w/ trauma and L4 compression fracture. She was transported to Hospital for further trauma workup. We believe she was treated and released. On 1/31/21 the patient had a headache but  did not seek medical attention. In the morning of 2/1 she became unresponsive and was pronounced dead on the scene when EMS arrived. Autopsy showed a left temporal subdural hematoma.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

Ten seconds later, her husband said that she felt like she was going to pass out. Upon getting to the patient, I felt for a pulse and observed mild breathing. The patient was unconscious and did not awaken with a sternum rub. The patient&#39;s husband helped me lower her to the ground, and I administered one dose of Epipen to the patient&#39;s lateral left thigh. She awakened and was able to state where she was, the year, and the president. EMT arrived later, and the patient refused further medical treatment.

The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 15 Jan 2021, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 027L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. On 08 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot: 0101M20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection. The first dose of vaccine was taken in non dominant arm and second dose was taken in right dominant arm.  On an unknown date, the patient experienced swollen arm. In between the two doses she felt very hard to breath for few minutes and when she took a deep breath it was fine. She had tylenol for the headaches after the second dose on 08 February 2021. She also had nausea along with headaches. She had blood clogging when she was in a blood donation camp. The event very hard to breath for few minutes and blood clogging were considered as medically significant. Thiamine was provided as medication  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events is not applicable.  Follow-up received on 17 Mar 2021 included updated date for first dose of vaccine, and the events very hard to breath for few minutes/dyspnoea, blood clogging/thrombosis.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information which shows a strong temporal association between the use of the mRNA-1273 and the reported events and excluding all other etiology, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Nausea and headache are consistent with the safety profile of the product

Patient is not an established patient and did not receive care for her symptoms at our facility:  On March 18th I received my 2nd Moderna vaccination. On Friday the 19th at approximately 4 pm I began to have the symptoms of an immune response in my body. Sat the 20th was spent in bed with chills, body aches, fever, stiff neck, and bad headache. On Sunday I was having pain on inhalation along with everything else.  Monday the pain resolved into left side lung pain on inhalation. Tuesday the 23rd I called my provider who directed me to go to the Emergency Dept. I drove to Superior Hospital. After being accessed I was transported; with pericarditis and the additional mentioned immune response symptoms, and a pronounced heart murmur. On Wednesday the 24 I shook uncontrollably with chills for 4 hours and 2 min and went into atrial fib for about 12 minutes, resolved with medication.  Thursday the 25th I woke to all symptoms being gone. I was released on Friday the 26th with the statement my issues had resolved themselves. I was told to report this to where I got my vaccine so it could be passed along.

Potentially a side effect of elliquis; but her cardiologist does not believe ellipsis was the cause.  Heart attack at similar time due to blood clot and blocked artery and possibly reaction of body  to hematoma.

Unable to function or to work.   Symptoms are again substantially worse than 10 other individuals vaccinated at the same time for dose 2.   I suspect my reactions may be dose to weight dependent. I am a very small adult, 4&#39;9&#34;, 123 pounds. There may be cause to consider smaller doses for smaller people. That would also allow more doses to be available for the population.   I am a healthcare professional. Many lay people would probably not have been willing to take a second dose at this level of reaction.

She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

I walked through the house to another room. I noticed my arms and legs felt kind of rubbery and that I didn&#39;t seem to have control of them. I fell to the bed and lost consciousness for 5-10 seconds. This was all observed by my spouse. I  recovered quickly. The remainder of the day I had a slight headache and felt slightly nauseous. I took acetaminophen before going to bed and woke up the following morning with no complaints .

                                                She got her vaccine, and started out with the sore arm, but she was sitting in the bathroom sometime after 11:00 preparing to do a peritoneal dialysis exchange and blacked out.  She grabbed onto the towel bar on the wall and fell hitting her left hip, left ankle and left upper arm.  She does not remember too much after that, but that she was in and out of consciousness until about 12:30 PM Saturday when she remembered being alert but nothing made any sense to her.  Her son came in and found her on the floor, she could not get up, she had a skin tear on her right elbow and she had been incontinent of bowel and bladder.  He started to ask her the orientation questions and got them all wrong, but she knew that she was confused and disoriented.  She could not get up on her own, called the paramedics and they took her to the hospital.  The confusion and disorientation lasted into early Sunday morning 3/28/2021 at about 3:00 AM when she started to answer questions appropriately.  As the day went on things got better, but still exist to this point today 4/6/21.  It was more severe as she came out of the confusion.  She has brain fog, inability to sequence thoughts, a little bit of expressive aphasia.  She had two CAT scans and an MRI that were negative for subdural or CVA&#39;s.  I had urine specimen and blood cultures to rule out a UTI or sepsis and those were negative.  Her kidney labs were normal.  She ABG&#39;s drawn and those were normal.  They placed her on oxygen and she sat for 3 days and then they released her to home.     Today, she is still having the brain fog, still the not able to sequence thoughts, general fatigue.  She is black and blue from shoulder to elbow due to the fall.

                                                My mother came home after receiving the Moderna vaccine shot and did not feel well. She had confusion, pain in her left arm near the injection site. She attempted to relax for a while and then became very nauseous, faint, and vomited. She claimed she tried to lay down in her bed and then attempted to get up to vomit and could not physically move.   On Tuesday, I found her at 2:30 PM unconscious in her bed. Vomit/blood all over the floor by the bed side, her face was very warm, her breathing was very short. I could not get her to respond to me through feel or communication so I called 911. She was taken to the ER by ambulance at this time.   She was taken the hospital where she was placed on IVs (I think one for antibiotic and the other was a steroid). Hospital performed blood work, CT scan, chest x-ray, and lumbar tap. They did not find any issues with my mother other than she had an &#34;elevated white blood counter&#34;. Lumbar tap did not yield any signs of infection or foreign bacteria. She was discharged on Wednesday (02/10/2021) evening and went home to rest. She has been very fatigue since her return home and reported to me today (02/19/2021) that she had symptoms of being faint, cold sweats, and overall weakness. I checked her blood pressure and temperature and did not see a concern.

This is the second time this occurred in that she fainted the next day when she took the first Covid shot30 days  ago.  Paramedics were called, her vitals were normal and it was recommended that we do not transport her to the hospital.    When this occurred the first time, she was taken to her neurologist who diagnose a syncope for the incident.

The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

                                                ?Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA? I got up at approximately 9:45 am on 2/28/2021 and went in to use the bathroom, After I finished I was washing my hands and suddenly felt a wave of nausea. I gripped the sink and next I knew I woke up on the floor.  I suffered severe bruising from the fall. Only other side effects I had were a slight headache and chills a few hours after this incident.

                                                Blood clots in arm; Arm was sore; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 67-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced sore arm/pain in arm and blood clot in her arm/thrombosis.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included diabetes. Concomitant medications were not included.  On 15 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of  mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031M20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 15 Feb 2021, post vaccination the patient experienced sore arm and her condition got worse. She was then taken to emergency room with blood clots in her arm.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.   The outcome of the events, sore arm and blood clot in her arm, were not known.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67-year-old, female patient, who experienced thrombosis and pain in arm. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of diabetes is a risk factor. Further information has been requested.

Pt states she got her vaccine on Thursday and then developed severe GERD sx that night. She states she normally does not have GERD and she tried antacids and PPI for her sx. She states she tried to sleep but awoke with projective vomiting and was unable to stop this. She also had myalgias and fatigue. She went to ER and hospital notes indicate supportive care was given and sx resolved quickly. Pt never developed any CP or SOB.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

The symptoms were even worse after her second vaccination March 2nd and included muscle cramping in her legs. Once she was recovered she only had a persistent cough which she attributed to allergies as the pollen count had been high. In the early morning hours of March 19th she was having difficulty breathing and chest pains. She was rushed to the emergency room where she subsequently died of cardio pulmonary embolism which the coroner indicated began within three weeks of her death.

After getting off the phone with 911, she started feeling better and her pulse returned to a normal rate (~80 bpm). EMS still took her to the hospital for further evaluation.

Patient used Benadryl to treat it. 2 days later the raised effect and hardness had gone away, however the redness spread over most of the shoulder area, and 2 days after that had spread halfway down her upper arm. The itch remained. Patient went to a previously scheduled appointment with our primary care physician who said that she had had a DAR (delayed anaphylactic reaction) and should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Monday, 2-15-21. 11:45 am. ? Received first dose of Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  12:30 pm. ? Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

                                                On the morning February 22nd I was outside with my family in our backyard. I was checking our plant when I started to feel that I needed to sit down. By the time I sat down, I realized I had no feeling or use from the left side of my body including my face. I also had trouble communicating. Could not form complete sentences. The entire left side of my face was drooping. At that moment my husband immediately called 911.  I was taken to the hospital by ambulance where i was immediately treated and diagnosed with a stroke. They administered TPA. I spent 3 days in the ICU. I have since been treated with blood pressure medication, blood thinners and statins.

                                                spontaneous bleed; bruise on the shin; sore arm; hives; nose bleed; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 69 years-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced sore arm, hives, nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin.    The patient&#39;s medical history included Von Willebrand Disease and breast cancer. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 JAN 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 012L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date post-vaccination, the patient experienced a sore arm and some hives. Approximately two weeks after the first dose, the patient experienced a spontaneous bleed resulting in a huge bruise on the shin the size of the palm of their hand. The patient consulted their Hematologist who performed blood work which was perfect. There were no abnormal results. The physician administered DDAVP.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced their first nose bleed described as &#34;horrific&#34;.  The patient reported they had blood gushing out of their nose and that they bled for four hours. The patient ended up in the hospital emergency department where they were sprayed with DDAVP to stop the bleeding.  Treatment details included DDAVP.  There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the events.  The events, nose bleed and spontaneous bleed were considered not recovered / not resolved.  The outcome of the events sore arm, hives, and bruise on the shin was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and the patient&#39;s history of Von Willebrand Disease, a causal association between the events nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin with mRNA-1273 use is assessed as unlikely.  However, based on temporal association, causality for the events of sore arm and hives cannot be excluded.

                                                Started with intense headaches right after the 2nd dose of the Moderna vaccine on 03/06/2021.  Had the headache for over two weeks, and eventually went to the hospital with loss of speech and movement on her left side of her body. They at first said it was strokes, then after the CT scan results came back they found multiple abscess in her brain. She does not have a history of strokes or brain abscess. Speech and motor functions never returned, and one abscess was so large that it caused a brain shift ( the two hemispheres separated) they performed brain surgery and it was not successful. She passed away on 3/31/2021 at 431 am.

                                                Woke up at my usual time the day after vaccine. Felt a little warm but not feverish and did not take my temperature. After walking to kitchen to let cat in from garage I stopped at the nearby kitchen sink and began to shake ( I believe just my upper body). I had to grab onto sink to steady myself. Shaking was only seconds long.  Then I must have fainted as I awoke (quickly) on the floor  alongside the cupboards and sliding glass door.  I laid there conscious about 15 minutes till I felt confident I could get up on my own.  As result of fall I bit upper and lower lip on right (no blood just skin injured), must have clenched my teeth because my left posterior teeth were sensitive to cold and I injured my right ankle. After I got up and realized my ankle hurt with pressure I put on a support knee high to control swelling.  Injury seemed to be focused on the ankle bone. I applied ice for recommended 20 on 20 off protocol for most of both 2/25 and 2/26, elevated and took OTC Aleve as directed on package.  Bruising observed from heel, behind ankle bone and front of ankle.   Called PCP, she recommended continue as I have and she will contact me tomorrow, March 1

Pharmacist let me stay until I felt I could drive.  I came home and took Tylenol for headache.  5 hrs later I felt extremely ill with joint pain , fever , dizziness.  Vomiting occured during the night along with fainting.  Next morning drank tea, no food. Slept all day until 5pm.  Slept through night.  Sun. still had extreme joint pain and headache.  Was able to eat a light meal. Today I ate normally, went to physical therapy with a reduced routine.  I still have a headache as of Mon. night. I know these seem like Normal side effects, but these were like having the worst Flu ever.

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

Since that date we have struggled to maintain her blood pressure over a systolic of 100.  She frequently runs 75/55 sitting down.  She is not orthostatic.  Resting P has increased from 80 to 95.  She is currently taking Droxidopa 400mg tid prn and Midodrine 10mg prn.  Additionally, when these do not raise her systolic to 100, she takes 100 Hydrocortisone.  The presumed diagnosis is dysautonomia, and she has been referred to a specialty center.

The next day around 5:38 someone called me to say she was found on the floor in the bathroom between the toilet and the wall.  I believe she passed out because she has no recollection of what happened at that time.   She was also reported as having a very dry mouth and sweating by the staff.   She was taken to  ER after they found her in the bathroom. She is currently having trouble getting around, has pain and is very tired.  She seems to be improving though.

I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

I looked at the browser history in her cellphone and on the night of April 4, she googled &#34;Heart attack symptoms in women&#34; and &#34;Moderna vaccination side effects.&#34; I think she didn&#39;t go to the doctor because she figured her symptoms were related to her vaccine -- even though it had been a week.   I wanted to report her death because I don&#39;t trust her doctor to do it. It took him two weeks and a call from me to complain before he signed her death certificate. He listed April 9, 2021 as the official date of death because that&#39;s when she was found, even though the deputy coroner told me she died on either the 4th or the 5th.

                                                Blood clot on right lung; soreness in arm; A spontaneous report was received from  a 72 year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced blood clot on right lung  (pulmonary embolism) and myalgia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25-JAN-2021, 26 hours prior to the onset of events, the patient received her second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot#: unknown) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 26-JAN-2021, the patient reported they have developed chills, fever, and muscle pain in the chest area. The reporter specified that it wasn&#39;t chest pain.  The patient took acetaminophen for the pain. On 27-JAN-2021, the patient reported her fever subsided but she was still having a little cough and chest pain.  On 28-JAN-2021, the patient had chest pain again during a nap and decided to call 911 because she was about to pass out. The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) where an EKG (electrocardiogram) was performed. A few moments after the EKG, the patient had a heart attack. The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin. At the time of this report, the patient was still feeling fatigued but other than that, she was feeling better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, heart attack, cough, muscle pain in chest area, fever, chills, and chest pain, were resolved. The outcome of the event, fatigue, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Shortness of breath, cough onset Sunday April 4th.  DATE OF SERVICE: 04.06.2021   CT ANGIOGRAPHY, CHEST (CPT=71275); PULMONARY EMBOLUS PROTOCOL; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION  CLINICAL INDICATION: SOB (shortness of breath)  COMPARISON STUDY: 10/9/2020  TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were performed during dynamic contrast enhancement for the  optimization of the opacification of the pulmonary arteries, following IV administration of 80 mL of  Isovue 370. Three-dimensional reformation into the coronal plane was performed.  Automated exposure control and ALARA manual techniques for patient specific dose reduction were  followed while maintaining the necessary diagnostic image quality.  ADVERSE REACTION: None  FINDINGS:  PULMONARY ARTERIES: There is a large filling defect within the right interlobar artery, extending  into the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe. There is expansion of  the right interlobar artery by this thrombus. Small filling defect is noted within the distal left  main pulmonary artery, with some extension to the left upper lobe and left lower lobe lobar  segments.  HEART AND VASCULATURE: The heart is normal size. No pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of  right heart strain.  MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  Heterogeneous densities are seen in the right lower lobe, new since the prior  exam. Scarring is noted in the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well as in the anterior  left lower lobe..  PLEURA: Small right pleural effusion.  CHEST WALL, LOWER NECK, AND AXILLA: Grossly unremarkable.  UPPER ABDOMEN: Grossly unremarkable.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen within the visualized spine.  IMPRESSION  1.  Bilateral PE, with extensive thrombus on the right and minimal thrombus on the left as detailed  above.  2.  Small right pleural effusion and heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation, likely reflecting  pulmonary infarction.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen.

A computerized tomogram (CT) scan found clots in the left lung, or saddle PE.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital.  Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking.

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the first COVID vaccine she developed shortness of breath that was much more significant than she had previously. This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don&#39;t think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I&#39;m sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.

I am not sure how long I was unconscious,. but when I came to I was on the floor and unable to move.  I called out to my husband and he got me up, but I could not walk. He got me back into bed. Several hours later he assisted me in walking  and I am walking ok now.

                                                Pneumonia; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer  concerning his mother, a 73-year-old, female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced pneumonia.  The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 Jan 2021, approximately five days prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Jan 2021, the patient developed a cough. The patient&#39;s temperature was recorded at 101 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient went to doctor. She was fatigued and coughing blood and was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment included azithromycin, and the patient seemed to improve.  On 05 Feb 2021, the patient developed a temperature of 101°F, coughed up blood and was very fatigued. She was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment for the event included levofloxacin.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, pneumonia, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of pneumonia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s elderly age and medical history of COPD are considered a risk factors.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On 13 Feb 2021, the patient received the first of the two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch# 007M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On the night of 13 Feb 20212, the patient experienced arm hurt a little bit and she felt fatigued.  In the early morning of 14 Feb 2021, the patient went to the bathroom.  On her way to the bathroom,  she felt confused and had overwhelming nausea.  She lost consciousness and banged her head on the cabinet.  Within second, she regained consciousness but felt extremely weak.  She could not recall how she got back to her bed.  The patient said she was cold and clammy at that time and she never got back to sleep.  During the day on 14 Feb 2021, the patient felt a throbbing pain on the arm where she got the injection.  She was not sure whether that was due to the injection or due to her fall when she lost consciousness.  She could barely move the arm.  Then she took a nap in the afternoon and was able to recover from her lack of sleep that night.    Treatment for the events included paracetamol.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was unknown (although her doctor advised her not to get the second dose given the reaction she had).  The outcome of the events was resolved on 15 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding the events has been provided at this time.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                My mom received her vaccine at her assisted loving facility. I talked to her that evening and she felt good. No pain. No complaints of anything. Overnight she had respiratory distress. Per EMS her O2 seats were in the 60s  . She stoped breathing en route. Currently on a vent, pressers. COVID test at the hospital is negative.

                                                Approximately  84 hours after administration, I had severe vertigo when prone.  This included a strange sensation of my head floating and an odd sense of loosing consciousness.  The vertigo was awful, and I could barely stand.  This lasted each evening for about 6 night.  It subsided in the morning, after I felt more stabilized in walking.

The patient&#39;s medical history included back problems with osteoarthritis in the spinal column neck and lower back. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included celecoxib and nortriptyline.   On 20 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 028L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 21 Jan 2021, the patient reported she got very dizzy and passed out. Her husband relays that she was totally out for a couple of seconds. She went to the emergency room and was diagnosed with a vasovagal reaction and urinary tract infection. Premature ventricular contractions were also discovered and was not known prior to this event. Patient reports a normal blood pressure of 114-120/75. Patient also stated her arm was sore the day after vaccine but not hurting much during her usual four mile walk.   Treatment for the event included intravenous medications in the emergency room, cephalexin, and a heart monitor.   Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events passed out, dizziness, vasovagal reaction and arm pain were resolved. The outcome of the events, urinary tract infection and premature ventricular contractions were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 74 year-old, female patient, who experienced events of dizziness, passed out, vasovagal reaction, urinary tract infection, premature ventricular contractions and arm pain.  The events occurred the next day after the first and last dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine administration. Based on the current limited available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are assessed as possibly related.  Further information have been requested.

The patient&#39;s medical history included heart surgery on an unspecified date in 2017. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 015L20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date in FEB 2021, the patient experienced fast heart rate, felt weakness, dizziness, and had atrial fibrillation. No treatment medication information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on current information the event was assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 vaccine, because of biological implausibility, no clear temporal association, and the patient&#39;s history of heart surgery which may promote atrial fibrillation episodes.

                                                Faint; Dizzy; Slight reaction; Very tired; A spontaneous report, was received from a consumer (patient), a 74 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who was administered Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced faint (syncope), dizzy (dizziness), slight reaction (vaccination complication) and very tired (fatigue).  The patient&#39;s current conditions included atrial fibrillation, back trouble and peripheral neuropathy (diagnosed years ago). The patient had medication allergies to pain medications and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Concomitant products included digoxin, carisoprodol, metamizole sodium and warfarin sodium.  On 09-FEB-2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012M20A) intramuscularly in left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 09FEB--2021, after receiving the vaccine, the patient had a slight reaction and became very tired, faint and dizzy. The patient&#39;s husband helped her to bed. The next morning on 10-FEB-2021, the events were resolved. The patient was scheduled for next Moderna vaccine (second dose) on 09-MAR-2021. No treatment information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to events was unknown.  The outcome of the events, faint, dizzy, slight reaction and very tired was recovered/resolved on 10-FEB-2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Adverse reaction began around midnight with chills, continued throughout the night alternating chills and hot flashes, severe backache, muscle aches in thighs and general malaise.  Got up around 8 to try to take a warm shower to ease muscle aches but as soon as I got into the bathroom I felt very hot, very nauseated and lightheaded.  I suspected hypotension but of course I wasn&#39;t able to prove it at the time. I attempted to get back to my bed but had syncopal episode a few feet from the bed where I collapsed onto the floor.  I just stayed on the floor and rested because it actually felt better lying down. I am a retired RN and suspect this adverse event was related to orthostatic hypotension.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

At 1;00PM  I woke up and stood up out of bed and collapses onto the floor.  I was unable to get up.  I found my phone which had fallen onto the floor.  I was shaking so bad I kept dropping it.  I looked and my phone and was  unable to figure out how to make a call.  The screen did not make sense.  Eventually I was able to call my daughter who decided to call 911.  The paramedics came, picked me up  off of the floor and helped me walk to the living room.  My legs kept giving out like I was going to fall again.  They were asking questions but I was unable  to answer coherently. I was so confused.  My brain was not working.  They took me to the hospital where I was admitted and many tests were done.
