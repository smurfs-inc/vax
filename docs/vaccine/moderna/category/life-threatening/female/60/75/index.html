                                                Patient received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at her place of employment as a phase 1A essential frontline healthcare worker in a skilled nursing LTC facility on January 6 2021. The day after receiving the vaccine (1-7-21), she started to feel increased shortness of breath (she has shortness of breath at baseline due to chronic health conditions- CHF, asthma), a heavy feeling in her chest/lungs, sweating and fatigue. She contacted the pharmacy on January 8th, as we were the entity that vaccinated her to ask about vaccine reaction. Due to her medical history of MI and CHF, pharmacist did not want to dismiss this as a reaction to the vaccine, and recommended that she contact her doctor for further guidance. She did reach out to her care team, and ended up going to the emergency room for testing due to cardiac history and presentation of symptoms. She had diagnostic testing done (see item 19) and the ER doctor attributed her symptoms to an exacerbation of CHF and asthma, noting that vaccine involvement in the worsening of her symptoms can not be ruled out. Treatment/discharge instructions include: follow up with cardiology/pulmonology, furosemide dose was increased, potassium supplement restarted, and instructed to use inhalers already on hand when needed. As of time of report on January 9 2021, the patient was resting at home, doing well except still having symptoms upon exertion.

                                                It bled a little, right away I felt jittery. Later that night I got chills, and I had to change my shirt twice because I was drenched in sweat.  The morning I had a head ache and just felt achy, my arm was very painful. I was able to sit down and run some errands. I was feeling sick like when you have flu. The 26th I felt the same, the 27th I felt the same and my arm was hurting and the injections site was red and very big. On the 28th I decided to go to the Urgent Care. The Dr told me I had an infection on my arm, he gave me an antibiotic shot for the infection and another shot for the pain. I continued taking antibiotics and Benadryl and was feeling much better by Wednesday and my arm swelling went away. I had Covid in October and Urgent care saved my life, I love going there.

                                                No rxn to dose 1. Dose 2: @10 min had tingling of lips; at 12 min had tingling of tongue [and anxiety from the tingling]; @ 15 min had some SOB and knew this was not just anxiety. Had zero intention of being taken to ER as I could easily tx myself. Took inhalers, extra cetirizine.  Did not take epi, though have several pens.  @4 hour started feeling weak, severe arm pain.  At 6 hours, unbearable arm pain, extreme weakness [did not take BP or pulse ox--though I can and wish I had]. Exceeding thirst, could not get water down fast enough. Reactivation of arachnoiditis symptoms. Started unusual muscle fasciculations in arms, leg, and face [face not normal for me]-took valium and baclofen. Next 36 hours  unable  Additional information for Item 18:  next 48 hours, unable to get out of bed other than to get water. Severe HA upon waking  [@16 H post injection].  Severe myalgias, but in areas of known arachnoiditis that have been quiescent for quite some time.  Forgot to mention, as I find this strange: prior to going to sleep I had left eye conjunctivitis.  Left eye only that still is slightly persistent and doesn&#39;t require any care [for me at least]  I am currently 72 hours post. Still with HA and some fatigue, though worked today [I WAH for a population health company].   L arm is not as painful as the excruciating pain @ hour  4-16, and no need for additional acetaminophen. I have an exceedingly high pain tolerance due to the arachnoiditis,  but this was the first time I took a narcotic in 5 years. 2 .5 mg oxycodone x1, then 600 mg ibuprofen x1, then 1 gm acetaminophen  2 over next 24 hours and nothing since, but it is still quite painful today. Different today than yesterday is the development of what feels like left shoulder bursitis.  We&#39;ll have to see how this goes over time.  There is extensive edema at the site, but not clear erythema [I&#39;m dark skinned].  Still just can&#39;t seem to get enough water.  Had my first meal last night [made chicken soup].    It&#39;s still pretty early on. I&#39;m not even at the 72 hour mark yet, so hopefully things will settle down over the next weeks.  I checked the box as life threatening because that was likely early anaphylaxis -- though at first I seriously thought at first I was just anxious because of the lip tingling.  This is in defense of the fact I did not self administer epi when I became SOB.  I likely should have, but know myself well and did fine without it and with asthma and allergy care. I didn&#39;t need extra albuterol after the first 24 hours [though writing this makes me feel SOB just from reliving it].   This second dose is a doozy.  Hope this was helpful.

They removed the tube in the hospital, (she remained in the hospital) First she was hospitalized and then she was transferred to the Medical Center Hospital to auscultate bleeding in the stool and to be evaluated by the Gastroenterologist. This specialist performs the necessary studies, they do not give a diagnosis and in the process she dies. The hospital indicated that she had a blood drain and heart failure.

Visited my surgeon who follows up with me every 6 months. She listened to my lungs and said she heard crackles in my left lung. Sent me for a chest x-ray immediately after visit on 3/15/2021.  I am having no symptoms such as coughing, fever, etc.  I?m concerned this could be a side effect of the vaccine. Was also tested for Covid on 3/17/2021. Test result was NEGATIVE.

                                                She got her vaccine and had no reactions at all.  On 3/12/21 she was in her car and started having stabbing pain in the left side of her chest under the rib.  She thought it was gas pains and dismissed it, and then it started radiating towards the front and the stomach.  On 3/16/21 she went to the ER and they did a CT scan that showed that she had a blood clot on her spleen.  With that they gave her the diagnosis of idiopathic splenic infarction.  She was then sent by ambulance to another hospital to be admitted in case she was needing surgery.  She was given heparin and on that for 2 1/2 days.  They determined that 60% of her spleen is dead, blood supply cut off to it, and the other 40% is nonfunctional.  On 3/19/21 they gave her vaccines of Prevnar 13, HIB, meningococcal, meningococcal B, and a flu vaccine.  She was discharged on the 3/20/21 with Plavix.  She saw her regular doctor yesterday and he diagnosed her with functional asplenia and to continue the Plavix.   She is no longer having any symptoms after dissolving the blood clot.

I went to lay down and was not able to.  It was hard to breath.  I got up, went to another room where there was a recliner and sat in it trying to catch my breath.  It got harder to breathe.  I had my husband call 911. I went to the ER, had a CT scan of my chest and was found to have ?extensive PE?s?, ground glass and signs of pneumonitis.   I was admitted to the CICU for two days and was transferred for two days.  I was told by my orthopedic surgeon that there was a high unlikelihood of PE?s developing from my ankle fracture 3 months later.  I had home health care for approximately one month.

                                                Only nine days after my second Moderna shot, I broke my ankle. I then had to wear an immobilizing boot for 5-6 weeks. Despite taking one baby aspirin a day during the immobilization period, I developed a blood clot in my paroneal calf vein 5 weeks into the immobilization. I am wondering if the proximity of my immobilization to my Moderna vaccination put me at an increased risk of developing a blood clot.

                                                She got her vaccine, she wasn&#39;t feeling good right there and didn&#39;t know what it was going to progress to. She then at 2:00 AM the next morning she rolled out of the bed and fell to the floor and got stuck between the bed and was not able to stand up, and crawled down 14 stairs and then couldn&#39;t move.  She could not tell him why she couldn&#39;t and she was not able to stand up (large women).  Her husband did not see any signs of stroke.  They called his son and noticed that her face was sagging and he said that it looked like a stroke.  They called the paramedics and they sent her to hospital and she was flown to Clinic and diagnosed with a stroke.  She had surgery and they tried to remove the blood clot and her blood pressure went high and they cut a huge part of her skull to remove the pressure, but not able to remove the clot that he is aware of.  She is in rehab right now, and it&#39;s not really showing any signs of promise. She has a lot of stroke symptoms of being combative and she has a blood clot that has moved to her arm as well. She had 6 blood clots on her brain when they went into it, and now has blood clots in each arm. She is aware of her surroundings to some degree and thinks that she is somewhere else and feels like she has wet herself.  Her husband said that the rehab does not look promising.    She is still in the hospital and they are having a meeting tomorrow regarding how long they feel she may be there.  She  has very little headway in rehab.  She cannot move her left side, hand or leg.  She is able to move her right side though. Husband feels it has destroyed her life and it will be a miracle if she comes out of it.

                                                After the first dose of the vaccine I was very tired. After the second dose I was extremely tired. I started to have trouble breathing at night and I developed a cough one week after the second dose. After two weeks I went to an Urgent Care and they did not find anything on X-Ray. Two weeks later I was not improving so I went back because my breathing was worse. X-Ray showed Pneumonia in both lower lungs. I recovered a little over two weeks after antibiotics. I had Covid-19 in July of 2020 and I had not felt well since then. I was only working two days a week up until the time of the first dose of the vaccine. I was originally given a Benzoate capsules but those did not help. My breathing seems to better than it was for the time period since I got the Covid-19 last year. I still have a dry cough and I get short of breath on occasion. I use Flonase currently and I am able to work more now.

On 21-May-2021, the patient experienced HYPERHIDROSIS (Sweaty), GLOSSODYNIA (tongue feel raw and sore) and PYREXIA (feels feverish). The patient was treated with DIPHENHYDRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (BENADRYL [DIPHENHYDRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) at an unspecified dose and frequency; EPINEPHRINE (EPIPEN) at an unspecified dose and frequency; ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE, DIMETICONE, MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE (ANTACID [ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE;DIMETICONE;MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE]) at an unspecified dose and frequency and DULOXETINE HYDROCHLORIDE (CYMBALTA) ongoing from 29-Jan-2021 for Pain, at a dose of 60 mg twice a day. On 20-May-2021, BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTOLIC DECREASED (Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg) had resolved. On 20-May-2021 at 8:00 PM, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (Anaphylactic reaction) had resolved. On 21-May-2021, GLOSSODYNIA (tongue feel raw and sore) and ORAL PAIN (Mouth pain) had resolved with sequelae. At the time of the report, HEART RATE INCREASED (Heart rate more than 100 beats per min), BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED (Blood pressure which was 188/143.), PHARYNGEAL SWELLING (throat started to swell), ABDOMINAL PAIN (Abdominal cramping), FEELING HOT (Feeling hot), FLUSHING (Flushing), DYSPNOEA (couldn&#39;t breathe), VOMITING (vomiting) and NAUSEA (nausea) had resolved and ERYTHEMA (her face became red and than blue), RETCHING (Started to gag/gagging sensation), TONGUE DISORDER (tongue felt huge), HYPERHIDROSIS (Sweaty) and PYREXIA (feels feverish) outcome was unknown.

On 20-May-2021, Blood pressure systolic: less than 90 mmhg (abnormal) abnormal. On 20-May-2021, Heart rate: 100 breaths per minute (High) high.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter considered ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (Anaphylactic reaction) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for HEART RATE INCREASED (Heart rate more than 100 beats per min), BLOOD PRESSURE INCREASED (Blood pressure which was 188/143.), BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTOLIC DECREASED (Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg), PHARYNGEAL SWELLING (throat started to swell), ABDOMINAL PAIN (Abdominal cramping), FEELING HOT (Feeling hot), ERYTHEMA (her face became red and than blue), RETCHING (Started to gag/gagging sensation), FLUSHING (Flushing), TONGUE DISORDER (tongue felt huge), HYPERHIDROSIS (Sweaty), GLOSSODYNIA (tongue feel raw and sore), DYSPNOEA (couldn&#39;t breathe), ORAL PAIN (Mouth pain), VOMITING (vomiting), PYREXIA (feels feverish) and NAUSEA (nausea).    It was reported that patient called in after receiving her 2nd dose of the Moderna covid vaccine on 20-May-2021. After receiving her vaccine approximately within 2 minutes, she started to gag, throat started to swell, and she was told by the staff members that her face became red and than blue. The pharmacist immediately administered an epi-pen and she slowly was able to stop gagging. The pharmacy dialed 9-1-1 and the EMS came. They took her blood pressure which was 188/143. They took her to the hospital and about 10 minutes in the ambulance she experienced the gagging sensation  and her tongue felt huge. They administered the epi-pen again along with Benadryl and an antacid. She was monitored at the hospital for four hours and discharged. While at the hospital she had the gagging experience again and tongue felt huge. They administered the epi-pen again and she remained on IV which she believes contained Benadryl and an antacid. She is contacting the hospital to find out exactly what she was prescribed there. Today, 21may2021 she has to clear her throat a lot, feels feverish, sweaty, tongue feel raw and sore. She is highly allergic to sulfa. She wanted to know if these symptoms have been reported before and if the medications, she was administered at the hospital are going to effect the vaccine efficiency. She was wondering if Moderna could provide any compensation for her medical costs.

On March 19, 2021 she was on the floor laying beside of the bed and my father noticed blood looking stuff on her shirt and bed covers. She was really confused and lethargic. She was really weak and could not stand. She was extremely fatigued. At around 10:30 she fell again on the floor and my father and sister in law was able to get her back up and put her in a chair and she went to sleep. At 12:55 my father noticed she was not breathing and called 911. When they did CPR blood was coming from her mouth and nose. When the ambulance arrived they immediately took her to the hospital where she was pronounced dead at around 3:30 pm.

Patient developed spontaneous wet purpura, petechiae and vaginal bleeding on 3/19/2021. CBC showed undetectable platelet count. Normal hemoglobin and platelets. Did not respond to dexamethasone 40md daily x 4 or multiple IVIG doses. Started romiplostim on 3/25/21 and is currently on dose escalations with platelets persisting undetectable.  On 3/28 developed acute anemia with a 2 to 3 g/dL hemoglobin drop and was found to have a spontaneous hemoperitoneum . Treated with tranexamic acid, multiple platelet transfusions and an additional dose of romiplostim. Bleeding has since resolved but platelets remain undetectable.

I spent 4 days in the PPC ward and now home trying to recover from this... I was told my condition was very serious and was lucky I came in... Of course the doctors will not say this was a direct link to the shot ... i never had any problems before and never any blood clots.  The doctor who did the procedure told me to make sure I REPORTED IT.... I was released from the hospital on the afternoon of the 21st.. 4 days!

                                                Had right chest and lower back pain and sweating during night of April 15, 2021. Also had unexplained cough for one month prior to vaccine. Pain was gone by morning. Did regular exercise of walking 4 miles in morning. Same pains came back afternoon of April 16. Went to ER at 4pm on 4/16. D-Dimer and Troponin were elevated and CT scan showed pulmonary embolism in right lung.  Was given Lovenox and was admitted to hospital for 2 days. Was released on Eliquis 2x per day for at least 3 months. Had two plane rides lasting for 2 hours each on 3/21 and 3/31 where I walked to bathroom once so it is unlikely these plane rides caused embolism. I am active and walk about 20 miles per week. Doctors so far have not found likely cause for this event.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; A spontaneous report was received from a 62-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced an anaphylactic reaction.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as reported, included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings. Concomitant medications reported included thyroid medication (not specified), blood pressure medication (not specified), gabapentin, sleep medicine (not specified) and curcuma longa rhizome.  On 24 Jan 2021, about 15 minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 24 Jan 2021, 30 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient took prednisone (dose unknown), per instructions from her doctor due to her history of anaphylactic reactions. She did notify the vaccinators of her history and there was an ambulance present. About 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient started coughing, had heavy chest pain, trouble breathing, and felt like her throat was constricting more than usual. No rash developed. She approached the ambulance and asked if she could take diphenhydramine. She took one dose, followed by 3 other doses, and felt a bit better. Consent given for Safety to follow up with patient.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of event, anaphylactic reaction was resolving at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 62 year old female patient with medical history of included 4 previous anaphylactic reactions since she was 9 years old, history of throat problems and swelling, bronchitis, and her brother died in 1997 due to an anaphylactic reaction to poison ivy and bee stings.

This occurred prior to receiving the vaccine.   Patient recovered on her own and later received the vaccine.   She then went back into rapid Afib and was transferred to the Emergency Department.      Patient has a long history of A fib.  Does not appear to  be vaccine related.

                                                Received  her first COVID vaccine on Thursday, March 18.  On 3/23/21 she started to have new onset of generalized muscles aches and weakness.  She started feeling some pain in her back, which then spread to arms and legs. She is now beginning to feel weakness in her core and extremities. Having difficulty lifting arms above head. She is still able to walk without difficulty but legs do feel weak. Increase in SOB as well. Myalgias and chest pain resolved within a week, however she continued to feel weak, tired, and had DOE. She developed &#34;brain fog&#34; and talked to her boss about taking short-term disability as it had been hard to work.  No appetite. On 4/1/21, she presented to the ED with 2 weeks of worsening generalized weakness, SOB, lightheadedness, dizziness and found to have acute anemia. Was admitted for further workup.  Hgb at admission was 5.4.   This admission diagnosed her with a new warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia. This is new since the COVID vaccine was administered.  Upon admission there was no thrombocytopenia, so there was low suspicion for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, TTP/HUS, or DIC. Peripheral blood smear at that time suggested a leukoerythroblastic blood picture (could be Bone Marrow recovery post chemo) but with marked normocytic, normochromic anemia, and with increased circulating erythroid precursors and increased red blood cell regeneration; spherocytes and fragments are present supporting hemolysis.  DAT positive (both IgG and C3) along with other hemolysis lab including elevated LDH, Bilirubin, haptoglobin 3, and PBS c/w hemolysis; no evidence of MAHA. So warm autoantibody hemolytic anemia is the most likely explanation. She had negative cold agglutinin antibodies &lt;1:32 on 4/9. Started on methylprednisolone on 4/2/21, but Hgb continued to steadily decline despite treatment. Continued on methylprednisolone 87.5mg daily. Rituxan 375mg/m2 was started on 4/6/21 with plans for weekly infusions for a total of 4 weeks.  there was concern for a GI bleed on 4/10-4/11 due to bright red fluid appearing like blood in the toilet after a stool. This led to her receiving roughly 5 units of pRBCs. After these 5 units she started urinating red urine and we became highly concerned for hyperhemolysis. She did not have any further stools so we did not think a GI bleed was likely.    She was given 1 dose of Eculizumab (Soliris) (4/12). This treatment is for complement mediated intravascular hyperhemolysis. Unfortunately it did not appear to help her.   On 4/14, we were thinking TTP could be contributory with numerous schistocytes on peripheral smear. Her T bili was up to 7.8, and her hemoglobin plasma was trending up, in the 380 -- &gt; 610 and in the 800s today. Cr was worsening. Platelet count was dropping.  With her worsening condition and concern for both hyperhemolysis and possible TTP, we decided to start her plasma exchange followed by her second dose of Rituximab.  Unfortunately she became disoriented/confused following line placement and while receiving plasmaphoresis. CT head returned without acute findings. She then had an allergic reaction with a rash during PLEX which was stopped (4L completed with a goal of 5L). Improved with benadryl.  She was then administered rituximab. Then she developed worsening sinus tachycardia and HTN.   Her respiratory status deteriorated and she eventually required high-flow oxygen to maintain saturations &gt; 90%. CXR showed bilateral opacities, not drastically changed from previous films. Rituximab was stopped halfway through its infusion in case this was an adverse effect to the drug. She was given 20 mg IV Lasix per the nighttime sign-out. She was initially given ceftriaxone and azithromycin IV to cover CAP but later ABx were broadened to vanc and Zosyn with rising lactate of unknown source.   Ultimately she had acute respiratory failure with hypoxia and need BiPAP. She was eventually intubated and a code blue was called.  She unfortunately died shortly after intubation.

                                                She was transferred from one ER to another for intraparenchymal bleed and subarachnoid hemorrhage with midline shift. On the week of April 11th she was seen by her periodontist of a bone graft in preparation for a tooth implant. She took minimal ibuprofen and norco after this procedure. However, she also began to feel very nauseated which led to anorexia and worsening malaise. This prompted the pt to present to ER on 4/16 evening, where was given Phenergan, and discharged to home. Symptoms worsened and she re-presented to ED where she was admitted and diagnosed with UTI and colitis. She was started on ciprofloxacin. She denied having had any dysuria or diarrhea. Patient&#39;s son says that at 0130 on 4/19 his mother was using both sides of her extremities equally. She had been complaining of headache and leg pain, but by 0130 on 4/19 family did not notice any other obvious changes in patient&#39;s movements or behavior. However, at 0730 on 4/19 nurses noticed that patient was unable to move her L arm or leg. She had a CT scan done, which revealed multiple intraparenchymal hemorrhages bilaterally as well as subarachnoid hemorrhage with midline shift. The transferring physician told me that patient had not been on any anticoagulation. Patient and her family deny any history of falls or trauma, denied family history of coagulopathies, and use of blood thinners (including aspirin). No records, labs, or inpatient med list was sent with patient upon transfer. Family says that patient had her first Moderna COVID19 vaccine 3 weeks ago and was due for her second vaccine on 4/23. Labs on admit here are significant for leukocytosis with WBC of 21.9, Hgb of 12.1, platelets of 306, sodium of 140, potassium of 3.1, Bicarb of 22, creatinine of 0.7, glucose of 126, magnesium of 1.8, INR of 1.2. Patient is normotensive, afebrile, and satting well on room air.  Angiogram showed multiple cortical vein thromboses.  Will send hypercoagulable work up, HIT antibody given COVID vaccine 3 weeks ago (Moderna).

                                                18 hours after my 2nd moderna vaccine, I experienced slurred speech.   When I arrived by car at my destination, I checked into a motel, looked into the mirror and noticed my left side of my face was drooping.   I knew this was sign of stroke.  I called 911 right away.  I was taken to hospital.  They did a CBC the night I arrived and the next day as well.  They did 2 cat scans with and without contrast.  Dr. in the ER determined that I had suffered a Transient Ischemic Attack which was brought on in less than 24hours of the 2nd Modern vaccine shot, and that the TIA was from the vaccine.  THe cat scans did not reveal any blood clots at the time of the scans.  Dr. concluded that they had broken up quickly and that was why  he diagnosed me with TIA.

                                                At the time of first vaccination shot, I experienced an anaphylaxis reaction including constriction of throat, difficulty swallowing, inside of cheeks swelling, lips numb and inability to take a deep breath.  I waited at the vaccination site for 30 minutes.  No treatment was requested since I began to feel a little bit better after 30 minutes.  It took approximately 4-1/2 hours to 5 hours to completely be able to swallow without difficulty and feel that I could actually take a deep breath.  I contacted my Primary Care Physician and she advised that she is &#34;not comfortable with my receiving the second shot&#34; and told me to cancel my second shot.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (No medical history reported.). Concomitant products included APIXABAN (ELIQUIS) for an unknown indication.    On 02-Apr-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (difficulty breathing). On 05-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CONDITION AGGRAVATED (it (difficulty breathing) became worse). On 07-Apr-2021, the patient experienced PULMONARY EMBOLISM (found several blood clots in her lungs) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 07-Apr-2021 to 11-Apr-2021 due to PULMONARY EMBOLISM. On 15-Apr-2021, DYSPNOEA (difficulty breathing) and CONDITION AGGRAVATED (it (difficulty breathing) became worse) had resolved. At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (found several blood clots in her lungs) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 05-Apr-2021, COVID-19: negative (Negative) Test results came back negative on 06Apr2021. On 07-Apr-2021, X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) Blood clots in lungs.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       After x-ray at urgent care on 07-Apr-2021 showed several blood clots in lungs, the patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) and was subsequently admitted to the hospital.  Treatment information was not provided.  On 12-Apr-2021 the patient went to their PCP (primary care physician) who stated that the clots most likely were not due to the vaccination and that the 2nd dose was safe for her to receive. At the time of this report on 15-Apr-2021, the patient reported feeling fine.

                                                stroke at vision site; partial sight lost in left eye; feeling weak; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (stroke at vision site) and BLINDNESS (partial sight lost in left eye) in a 62-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 036B21A and 012A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Implantable cardioverter defibrillator insertion.   On 22-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 19-Apr-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 20-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (stroke at vision site) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant), BLINDNESS (partial sight lost in left eye) (seriousness criteria hospitalization, disability and medically significant) and ASTHENIA (feeling weak). The patient was hospitalized from 20-Apr-2021 to 21-Apr-2021 due to BLINDNESS and CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT. At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (stroke at vision site), BLINDNESS (partial sight lost in left eye) and ASTHENIA (feeling weak) had not resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 20-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram: (abnormal) Stroke at vision site. On 20-Apr-2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: (abnormal) Stroke at vision site.         No concomitant medication were reported.  The reporter stated that the patient was taking medicines but doctor changed her medication and she did not want to talk so she did not give names.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                She got her vaccine, she came home and started noticing some pain and burning.  She looked down and she had a big red bump the size of a nickel or a little large, flat.  Then about an hour later it started to raise, and every 4 days they started going away and then come back with more of them.   They are hot, red and raised and itchy when they come on.  She is still getting them, popping up on her while I was talking to her.     She subsequently got the 2nd vaccine on 3/26/21, LOT#028A21A.  She said that now when they come since the 2nd vaccine they come in bunches 3-5 of them come up at a time.    She did call her doctor and saw Dr.  who gave her Triamcinolone cream to use.   She then saw her provider and gave her some stronger cream to use.  The one that she got from him last relieves the itching and pain and also takes hydroxyzine and he&#39;s also given her betamethasone diproprionate cream which again relieves the pain but does not get rid of anything according to her, they still continue to come back.  They are now popping up every day.  When it first started it was every 4 days, and then they would go away and then they would pop up again.  Now, they are popping up every day.    Her left side of her face swelled on one side and went numb on 4/25/21.  She then went to the doctor on 4/27/21 and he told her that it came from the vaccine.  Her face is still swollen on the left side.  He did not give her anything for that.     She went and had an echocardiogram on 5/19/21 and they called with the results yesterday and told her that she had a myocardial infarction, but she did not know when.   Her PCP told her to just continue taking the medications that she is already taking.   She is supposed to go back for a FU on 7/29/21.    She cannot sleep and is getting aggravated that these bumps will not go away.  They look bad and she has pictures of what they look like.  She would like somebody to tell her doctor what to do to treat her symptoms so that they will go away and not come back.

                                                Very dizzy; Threw up; Episode of afib; Light headache; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient), 63 years-old female patient, unknown race and ethnicity, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), and experienced, episode of A-fib (atrial fibrillation), very dizzy (dizziness), threw up (vomiting), and light headache (headache).  The patient&#39;s medical history included episode of A-fib. Current conditions included diabetic and high blood pressure. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03 FEB 2021, seven days prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 038K20A), intramuscular in the left arm for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  It was reported that two days ago, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation on 10 FEB 2021. The patient doesn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine or something else. The patient usually has 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year. She didn&#39;t have any other side effects at all right after the vaccine. The patient was a diabetic and didn&#39;t call her doctor about this, because it went away. The patient described the atrial fibrillation episode as uncomfortableness and beating of the heart. The patient has an appointment with her cardiologist 2 days before her second shot, and she&#39;d ask him about it. The patient was also wondering that the side effects occurred 8 or 9 days after the shot. She has high blood pressure and took a measurement, and it was normal at 93 (unknown units). The patient had the injection on her left arm because she has a diabetic monitor on right arm. The patient didn&#39;t take any treatment for the side effect except one time she took acetaminophen about three days ago when she had a light headache. On 12 FEB 2021, at about 10 am in the morning, the patient got very dizzy and had to sit down on the floor, and she threw up. After that, the patient was feeling fine. The patient gave consent to follow up from safety and to her doctor. No further treatment medications were reported.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not reported.   The outcome of the events, episode of A-fib, and light headache were unknown and that of events very dizzy, and vomiting was recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of having 2-3 times of atrial fibrillation a year, diabetic and high blood pressure are the risk factors and confounds to the causality.

She began to feel feverish, achy, nauseous, weak.  All symptoms lasted through Sunday when she passed out early in the morning.  We found her on the kitchen floor, having hit her head and bleeding.  She was conscious and alert but a little disoriented and very weak.  We called for an ambulance which took her to the same facility where she had been vaccinated.  She was diagnosed with a concussion and low blood pressure (62/49).   Today she still feels weak and dizzy and nauseous.  She has not returned to work yet, pending recommendation from her cardiologist and PCP.

So that night, I checked my temperature and had a low grade fever. I took a COVID test on 1/6 and was positive and I got treatment on 1/7. I ended up being out of work for two months due to a sinus infection and pneumonia. I&#39;m still experiencing symptoms such as lung inflammation and SOB, so I&#39;m on an inhaler, nasal spray, allergy meds and I did a sputum test today. I&#39;m also scheduled to see a pulmonologist, who I also saw prior to COVID for breathing issues. I&#39;ve had to do 3 rounds of antibiotics to resolve my pneumonia.

Patient is not an established patient and did not receive care for her symptoms at our facility:  On March 18th I received my 2nd Moderna vaccination. On Friday the 19th at approximately 4 pm I began to have the symptoms of an immune response in my body. Sat the 20th was spent in bed with chills, body aches, fever, stiff neck, and bad headache. On Sunday I was having pain on inhalation along with everything else.  Monday the pain resolved into left side lung pain on inhalation. Tuesday the 23rd I called my provider who directed me to go to the Emergency Dept. I drove to Superior Hospital. After being accessed I was transported; with pericarditis and the additional mentioned immune response symptoms, and a pronounced heart murmur. On Wednesday the 24 I shook uncontrollably with chills for 4 hours and 2 min and went into atrial fib for about 12 minutes, resolved with medication.  Thursday the 25th I woke to all symptoms being gone. I was released on Friday the 26th with the statement my issues had resolved themselves. I was told to report this to where I got my vaccine so it could be passed along.

Day 3 woke with bright red rash, itchy,  swollen and lumpy on inside upper arm. Could not get answers, lived on Benydril  for 3 days. Day 4 called CDC, FDA,  Health Dept &amp; Moderna. Moderna was only person that I was able to talk to someone, had no clue. Had to google to find out I had Covid Arm since no one knew anything. Day 5 ..The lump moved or maybe different one to inside my inner elbow and was painful. Did not read pain as a symptom of Covid Arm and went to ER

Shakes and shivers lasted 4 hours. Headache and back ache lasted 48 hours. Severe fatigue for first 24 hours, last 24 hours moderate fatigue. After 48 hours, I was back to 100% health. I took aspirin to begin with for the headache, then switched to ibuprofen when aspirin didn?t work for headache.  Ibuprofen helped back ache immensely. Also, when pharmacist gave me the 2nd shot when I got home and changed clothes I realized I had bled a lot. Blood had oozed out from the bandage and down to my elbow. Arm sore for 2 days, and still swollen on 4th day a bit larger than golf ball size.

                                                Herpes in genital area. This spot is where i generally have a herpes outbreak, but it was different this time.  The lesion bleeds. Feels just like other herpes lesions. I am not sexually active, and have not had a herpes outbreak for a long time. When i had the first shot, which was 3/19/21, Moderna through, lot #037A21B, about a week after the first immunization, i developed a rash on my right abdomen, just below the rib cage. It was fine, closely spaced red bumps, very itchy. I thought at first it was  chiggers, but the weather is cool and seems in the wrong place for chiggers. It seemed to become tiny blisters, and i started wondering if it was  shingles. It stung and hung on for several days, weeping a little blood.  but it cleared up quickly. While it was scabbing over, i had a larger blister on my right wrist. It looked almost like a fire ant blister, but  again no ants.  Felt very itchy, tingly, like the rash below my ribs. Within a day, the blister burst and bled. It took three or four days to heal. I thought these were weird at the time, but did not connect them to the vaccination, until i had the second dose, and my genital herpes blister bled.  This is not yellowish pus, it is bright, arterial style blood, thin, but definitely blood.

Concurrent medical conditions included Rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant products included METHOTREXATE for Rheumatoid arthritis, FOLIC ACID, ALENDRONATE SODIUM (FOSAMAX), VITAMIN B12 [VITAMIN B12 NOS] and CALCIUM for an unknown indication.   On 02-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 30-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 03-Apr-2021, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), DELIRIUM (Sounded delirious) (seriousness criterion hospitalization), APHASIA (Could not form words) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTOLIC INCREASED (My blood pressure was 250 over something) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 03-Apr-2021 to 05-Apr-2021 due to APHASIA, BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTOLIC INCREASED, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT and DELIRIUM. On 05-Apr-2021, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (Stroke) had resolved. At the time of the report, DELIRIUM (Sounded delirious), APHASIA (Could not form words) and BLOOD PRESSURE SYSTOLIC INCREASED (My blood pressure was 250 over something) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In 2021, Blood pressure systolic: 250 (High) 250. In 2021, Magnetic resonance imaging: abnormal (abnormal) confirmed that Patient had a stroke.         Patient stated that on 3APR2021, 4 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, she experienced a stroke. She says that she was with her daughter and per her daughter, the patient starting sounding delirious and not making any sense. She could not form words. The patient&#39;s daughter called 911. When the paramedics checked her blood pressure, the systolic number was 250. Patient does not remember the diastolic blood pressure. She was told to go to the ER. When she reached there, she says that she was having difficulty forming words. This was happening randomly and not all the time. She was admitted to the hospital for 2 days. An MRI done at the hospital confirmed that the patient had suffered a stroke. She was put on Lipitor and Plavix at the hospital and told to continue those medications for a month. She was discharged from the hospital and sent back home on 5APR2021. She states that with all the tests that were done at the hospital, the doctors are unsure what could have caused the stroke.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events, therefore action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

She also went to the hospital because she had a platelet count of 28,000.   Treatment of these events was not provided.    The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the events, platelet count of 28,000, generalized body pain all over, weakness, on and off chills, low grade fever, and vaccination site soreness, was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA adverse event.   Approximately 7 hours after the 1st COVID vaccination on 2/22/2021, patient developed symptoms of fatigue, aches, chills &amp; fever. Her symptoms worsened into 2/23/21 with increasing shortness of breath. On arrival in the emergency center on 2/23/21,  she was hypoxic with  SpO2 81% on room air.  Oxygen supplement via nasal cannula was given which improved her oxygenation. Covid 19 test negative. Chest Xray shows pulmonary edema and CTA chest shows no PE.  She was admitted to the hospital and provided supportive care.   Pulmonary Edema and inflammatory process is likely associated with the vaccine. Patient appeared to be improving, however, on 2/26/21, she was working with Physical Therapy/Occupational Therapy and had a pulse ox reading of 75% on room air. She was on 10 Liters of oxygen via nasal cannula by the time she make it back to bed and her pulse ox was 89%. Neurology exam shortly afterward the above event demonstrated an NIHSS of 21.  Patient became non-verbal and stat imaging revealed an acute hemorrhage in the left occipatal lobe likely representing a SAH.  Patient then transferred to another hospital that could provide neurosurgical intervention.

We do not have any hard data that either are related to the vaccine; but are reporting  them under the advice of a doctor to give information for science.

She received the Moderna Vaccine at clinic on 2/26 and on 3/26 (Lot# 014M20A and 031A21A  respectively). She had not received any device therapy for at least one year and had not been hospitalized in over one year.  She presented to  ED on 3/27 after her defibrillator fired. She was transferred to hospital and evaluated by EP there who felt that ventricular fibrillation prompting defibrillator therapy was triggered by COVID vaccine.  After discharge on 3/31, she had another VF episode. On 4/2 admitted awaiting EP consultation. 4/5/21 DISCHARGE SUMMARY STATES: #Recurrent defibrillator therapy in setting of Recurrent VF :   AICD interrogation showed underlying rhythm to be Vfib.  Possible adverse event associate with vaccine reported to VAERS. Interrogation at emergency department on 3/27 revealed 14 beats of polymorphic V. tach, possible lead misplacement.  S per hospital showed lead appropriately positioned.  Repeat echocardiogram done at hospital demonstrated an EF of 45 to 49%, device was reinterrogated there.  She was seen by EP at that time with recommendations to continue home beta-blocker and follow-up.  Upon return to emergency department, cardiology was reconsulted and communicated with EP with recommendation for stopping metoprolol and starting Nadolol 40mg BID and Mexiletine 150 BID.  She did not have any further ventricular tachycardia for over 48 hours after this change and was felt safe for discharge home on these two medications.

Patient with history asthma, controlled on symbicort and PRN albuterol, now with progressive worsening SOB since the day prior to admission, patient received 2nd dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 03/10/21. Also, with chest tightness, body aches, headache and chills. Was up last night with fever 101F, took ibuprofen. She had worsening wheezing and SOB while bring dog to dog groomer and had groomer call ambulance. EMS called, received albuterol nebs in route with some improvement in symptoms. Chest tightness has improved. SOB improved now at rest but still winded when up to bathroom. Vitals on arrival notable for BP 144/55, HR 125 (sinus tach on EKG), temp 102.1F, RR 22, 92% on RA. Labs notable for WBC 8.6, CR 0.54. Normal LFTs. Lactate 3.3. D-dimer 0.9. pBNP 56, troponin &lt;0.012. COVID-19 PCR panel negative. CXR with Chronic linear atelectasis or scarring at the lung bases, unchanged. CT PE study negative for PE, possibly some mild pulm congestion, increased interstitial markings. Patient given 2L NS in ED as well as ceftriaxone 2g and doxycycline 100mg. Patient will be admitted to inpatient for further evaluation and management of sepsis. Met sepsis criteria given fever, tachycardia, elevated lactate. Infectious source most likely pneumonia (though only slight increase interstitial markings on CT). Could be atypical or viral pneumonia. However, timing of symptoms could also fit with reaction to COVID-19 vaccine and asthma exacerbation.  COVID-19 negative and influenza negative. Was treated with abx for CAP and prednisone &#43; albuterol for asthma exacerbation. Lactate normalized with IVFs, fevers and tachycardia resolved. Patient able to wean to RA, dyspnea and wheezing slowly improved. Abx narrowed to cefzil, doxycycline. 1/2 admission blood cultures positive for streptococcuss. Patient was febrile and septic on admission. Subsequent blood culture without growth to date. Abx returned to IV ceftriaxone given strep &#43; BCx.. Low blood cultures x2 were negative at 48 hours.  Dr. was consulted over the phone and he recommended 5 days of oral amoxicillin on discharge. Chronic medical conditions were stable while hospitalized.  No medication changes were made.

As the day progressed, she began experiencing a headache which worsened in severity despite treating with medication. She started treating with Tramadol; when that didn&#39;t help, she took her prescription oxycodone (5mg/325mg) 3 hours later, q6 hours x 2. That evening, patient experienced 1 episode of emesis and thought she may not be feeling well, so went to bed. When she woke the next morning, she felt better, but still noted the black spot in her vision. She sought care with her Ophthalmologist, who evaluated her, and he did not believe it was related to her vision.  He referred her for an MRI, immediately. MRI revealed a stroke in the occipital region. She was admitted and given IV fluid along with another panel of testing. She was seen by Neurologist and Hospitalist; more testing was completed on Friday, including bloodwork which revealed high potassium levels which was treated. She was also given 1 unit of blood. She discharged on Friday and was started on Clopidogrel (75 mg). Follow up appointments are scheduled with eye doctor, neurology, internist.  Right eye was affected and vision will not likely return, per her doctors.

                                                I had the same sore arm, head ache, body aches, fatigue after the second dose as I did after the first dose.  However on day 5 I developed the worst fever blister on my lower lip.  On day 13 I experienced an anaphylactic episode. I noticed my hands started itching about 30 mintues after eating breakfast (coffee, oatmeal, blueberries, almonds).  I took my dog for a walk and started to feel nausaus and extremely tired.  I went to bed. Hives started.   Had abdominal cramps,  loose stool.  Took benadryl 25 mg. then another 25 mg.  Initially felt better after taking the benadryl.  About 30 minutes later, more nausea and cramps.  I went to the bathroom and while sitting on the toilet I could tell I was going to pass out.  I lay down on the floor and was competely weak.  I was aware that my bowels were moving, but I could do nothing about it.  I was able to call for my husband (approximately 20 minutes later).  He called an ambulance.  Blood work from ER was normal except for WBC 15.4,  Neutrophils 88.9%, Lymphocytes 6.6%, Eosinophils 0.1%,  ANC 13.8,  absolute granulocytes 13.7, glucose 152, and MPV 9.2,  I saw an allergist because they thought I had developed a food allergy but that was ruled out.  I have an epi pen now.

Developed blood clot in right calf &amp; pulmonary embolism in right lung the week of Feb 15th. May have been post op problem but I had no issue until after the 2nd vaccine. Surgeon felt that post op pts usually get a blood clot within 2 weeks after surgery- that&#39;s why I feel it was from the 2nd vaccine.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Kidney stone (More than once) and Shingles (More than once). Concurrent medical conditions included Multiple allergies (had a lot of allergies) and Chronic pain. Concomitant products included ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID] for an unknown indication.    On 29-Apr-2021 at 3:30 PM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 29-Apr-2021, the patient experienced HAEMORRHAGE (Arm bleed) (seriousness criterion medically significant), PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION ERROR (I think this happened because the person that administered the vaccine did it wrong), INCORRECT DOSE ADMINISTERED (I don&#39;t think I received a full dose vaccine from first dose.) and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (sore arm). On 01-May-2021, the patient experienced LIMB DISCOMFORT (Trouble raising her arm), VACCINATION SITE WARMTH (The huge sore became hot to touch), VACCINATION SITE BRUISING (Blue bruises in the injection site) and VACCINATION SITE SWELLING (Swollen with circular black and blue bruises in the injection site). On an unknown date, the patient experienced LIMB DISCOMFORT (After first dose for two days I couldn&#39;t move my arm). On 29-Apr-2021, PRODUCT ADMINISTRATION ERROR (I think this happened because the person that administered the vaccine did it wrong) and INCORRECT DOSE ADMINISTERED (I don&#39;t think I received a full dose vaccine from first dose.) had resolved. At the time of the report, HAEMORRHAGE (Arm bleed), VACCINATION SITE WARMTH (The huge sore became hot to touch), PAIN IN EXTREMITY (sore arm) and VACCINATION SITE SWELLING (Swollen with circular black and blue bruises in the injection site) outcome was unknown and LIMB DISCOMFORT (Trouble raising her arm), VACCINATION SITE BRUISING (Blue bruises in the injection site) and LIMB DISCOMFORT (After first dose for two days I couldn&#39;t move my arm) had resolved.        mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosing remained unchanged.       The patient wanted to report the side effects they experienced post receiving their first shot of Moderna vaccine. After a few hours their arm developed a huge sore 1 and ½ inches in size and the patient had trouble raising their arm. The patient day before reporting woke up and had a problem lifting their arm. The patient reported that the huge sore became hot to touch, was swollen with circular black and had blue bruises in the injection site. The patient mentioned that they had a lot of allergies. On 02-Jun-2021, the patient reported adverse reaction patient had from dose one and reported huge adverse reaction to dose two.  The patient post first dose for two days was not able to move their arm and had a bruise that lasted for two weeks. The patient stated that now they think this happened because the person that administered the vaccine did it wrong and vaccine went into wrong place. Post receiving their first dose the patient said one of their arms was bleeding.  The patient went back to the vaccination site and had been complaining so much because the registered nurse let the patient know that the Nurse didn&#39;t wore gloves nor shield and was anti-vaccinated.  The patient also stated that they don&#39;t think that they received a full dose vaccine from first dose. The patient also reported that they were a chronic pain patient and had kidney stone and shingles more than once and understood pain.  The patient wanted antibody test done because the patient think they didn&#39;t receive a full active first dose and wanted to have it after first dose but couldn&#39;t get it and still wanted to do this post second dose. Concomitant medication reported also included over the counter medicine but didn&#39;t specified the name. No treatment medication was reported. The patient informed that they slept and drunk a lot. No specific treatment was taken.   Based on the current available information which includes a temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the reported events, a causal relationship with the event cannot be excluded. Vaccination site swelling are consistent with the known safety profile of the vaccine.  This case was linked to MOD-2021-201885 (Patient Link).

                                                After receiving the vaccine, on 4/14, I had a hysterectomy and came home. I began feeling a dull pain in my back. It started getting worse. I contacted my doctor who sent me to the emergency. They took my blood and from there i began falling to pieces. I couldn&#39;t breathe, My upper back around my lungs was hurting so bad. They gave me many different pain medications but nothing was helping the pain. They determined I had 2 blood clots in my right lung. I started going downhill from there. They told me my blood was contaminated. I was put on many different machines. All COVID tests came back negative. Nothing hurt from the hysterectomy. My blood pressure wouldn&#39;t stay up. I was on pain medications every 2 hours. Currently, it has still not been determined whether this was a result of the vaccine or not.  I am now taking Eliquis which I will be taking for 6 months.

                                                I had been on weekly diflucan for toe fungus starting in late March.  I got the first Moderna shot April 13. On April 22 I had some chest tightness which I attributed to the Diflucan as it listed chest tightness as a side effect. On May 2nd the pain extended from the chest, neck, headache and all my teeth hurt and I ended up in the hospital for the first of 3 hospitalizations  Below is the summary of doctor?s notes on my hospitalizations.  They ran several tests to eliminate lupus, sjogrens, cancer, kidney issues, bacterial or fungus issues, etc.  It was not caused by the Diflucan side effect. They decided it might be viral.  Given the current report of some people getting pericarditis after the vaccine, my doctor and I felt we should report this incident.  Given the timing, it could have been the vaccine that caused the reaction.  I&#39;m currently on prednisone for another month and colchicine for several more months and remain under the care of cardiology.   SUMMARY OF DOCTOR?S NOTES:   She presented to the ER 5/2/2021 with chest pain. When she presented, she had tachycardia with interior ST changes. CT showed no PE but there was a large pericardial effusion. Subsequently her blood pressure began dropping with narrowing pulse pressure and she was thought to have early tamponade physiology so was taken to the cath lab and pericardiocentesis was performed. She did well and was started on colchicine and ibuprofen.   5/14 When I saw her back, she was doing well. Since then, she has had back to back admissions:   5/24/2021-5/27/2021-CAP of LLL with bilateral pleural effusions and pericarditis treated with antibiotics but afterwards, felt to be viral. She was seen by Pulmonary at this hospital stay. Rheumatologist work up was started. ECHO was stable.  5/29 Second Moderna shot (was delayed 2 weeks due to concern about confusing the potential normal side effects with the pericarditis issues).    6/13/2021-6/15/2021-Serositis with tachycardia, cough and fever. Rheumatology did not see but was curb sided and recommended Prednisone (long taper) with clinic visit in the next 2 weeks. Limited ECHO was stable.     6/16 Patient is doing well. No chest pain. She is taking the Prednisone without issues. No GI upset and no loose stools.

The left muscle in my left side of my neck stiffened.  As we left the area and headed down the street I was getting anaphalactic:  numb jaw, swelling tongue, closed throat, eyes closing, inner cheeks numb - as if I was severely novacained from the dentist.  I was able to breathe ok to  get home hoping it would pass and drank wanter to keep things fluid.  I was there for one hour.  On advice, I went to the ER to get checked out.

On Saturday 1/23/2021, she had a fever of 100.5 F (11AM), nausea, light headache and chills. The temperature went down after she took ibuprofen.  Patient&#39;s husband enrolled her to V-Safe to report all the adverse effects she experienced. On Sunday 1/24/2021, her temperature was 98.3F. She still had nausea and no appetite.  She and her husband watched a football game in their bedroom upstairs.  Husband noticed that his wife was pacing around the room many times. At 7Pm, Husband went downstairs for dinner but she refused to come down to eat. He went upstairs around 8pm, TV was still on. He turned off TV and went down stairs again thinking his wife felt as sleep while watching TV. He went back upstairs for bed around 10:30 PM. Husband said his wife had a deviated septum so she would snore very loudly when asleep.  He didn?t hear her snoring so he went to check on her and found her not responsive.  Husband called emergency services. Paramedic came at 10:45 and said patient was passed. Husband sent many texts to V-safe after that to report the incident. No response was received from V-safe. Patient?s doctor told her husband that she died due to cardiac arrest.

                                                After my 2nd dose Moderna vaccine, I experienced chills, fever, nausea, coughing and was coughing up mucus. The day after felt very weak and ate very little, had only sprite to drink, water and crackers. The next day my legs buckled up and felt weakness to my legs. My cough started to get worse and on 02-03-2021 I went to an urgent care facility where x-rays of the chest were performed. They also performed a Covid test. The x-ray of the chest demonstrated a touch of pneumonia in my right lung. I was given steroid medication and places on antibiotics and it is when I started to slowly feel better. I do not know what cause my symptoms after my second dose.  I also received my first dose Moderna vaccine on 01-01-2021 and I only had left arm soreness but no other reaction. (Lot#: 037K20A)

It was harder to breathe and I could not even take a shower that I would be out of breath. My daughter checked my pulsox and it was 85. I couldn&#39;t really walk or do anything so my daughter  transported me to ER and lots of labs were done so since my D Dimer was too high they did a CT scan and it showed some blood clots in my lungs. They admitted me because they were concerned with the location of one of them. They did some heart tests too and put me on Eloquis and then sent me home. I stayed for 2 days. Then they scheduled me FUs with a heart doctor and a pulmonologist.

                                                Bilateral pulmonary embolisms requiring ICU admission. Patient presented to Emergency Room on 4/13/21 with presented to the ED with shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient notes that she developed shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, about 1 week prior to presentation. 2-3 days prior to presentation, she developed pleuritic chest pain on the right anterior chest. She denies any recent fevers, chills, weight changes, palpitations, cough, sputum production, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, lower extremity edema. She does note that she received her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 3/16/2021 and was due for dose#2 on the day of admission. She denies a personal history of blood clots and denies current smoking, estrogen use, or recent surgery. She does note a history of blood clots in her sister, but she is unsure whether they were provoked or unprovoked. Patient required BiPAP on admission and was initiated on a heparin drip. Initial CT w/ some concern for R heart strain, however, echocardiogram showed no signs of R heart strain and she was hemodynamically stable. She was weaned from the BiPAP to Non-rebreather, and eventually nasal cannula. The heparin drip was transitioned to lovenox with plans to go home on a DOAC. Still hospitalized at time of event report.

                                                March 31, I woke up with very stiff joints, making walking and doing household chores exceedingly difficult. This lasted for 5 days.  Beginning on April 5th I felt like I could not catch my breath, so I called my doctor?s office for an appointment; I saw the PA and she felt I needed to have an EKG. I called them and the earliest I could see them was the 20th. I contacted my Doctor?s office, and they sent an order for the testing ASAP, I never received a call from them to reschedule. As the week continued, I got worse and went to the ER. After numerous tests and blood draws, I was admitted to the hospital. I spent 2 days in the hospital, 24 hours on oxygen.

Found out I had numerous pulmonary embolisms in all 5 lobes of my lungs. They did a COVID test and it was negative. They did an EKG and sonogram on my heart and it was fine. They checked for blood clots in my legs. There were none. They checked for signs of cancer. There were none. They started a heparin drip through my IV and the dissolved the largest clot with an embolectomy. I&#39;ll be on blood thinners for 6 months.

                                                Noticed bleeding in the mouth/gums. Looked inside and found bloody holes in my cheeks about 1/2&#34; big. I noticed the top of my hands we also very bruised although I did not get hurt. I went to the ER and they took me in and ran blood tests. They diagnosed me with Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura. My platelet level was at 8,000, and 6 months prior I was at 180-200,000. They began giving me platelets and were working up to giving my Immunoglobulen. After 2 doses of platelets they gave me 2 doses of benadryl intravenously and I had a scary reaction (I&#39;ve never had a reaction to benadryl prior to vaccine). My body went numb, it felt like my muscles fell asleep, I felt like I could not breath. It&#39;s as if my body attacked anything that came in. Then I was given a sedative to calm down.  As the sedative faded I began feeling immense pain in my abdomen, they thought it was internal bleeding, but after a CT scan they found 3 kidney stones. I was then put on fluids. Due to pain, my blood pressure went up and stayed up for about 8-10 hrs at around 255. I was given about 3 does of blood pressure medication throughout that time to lower it as well as morphine to help with the pain.  The next morning (Day 3) I was finally given the Immunoglobulin (3 bottles = 1 dose). platelets went up to about 60,000. Then I was given a second dose and released on day 4 (but the second dose was not completed in full, only 1 or 2 bottles of the 3 were given. I was released and came back after 2 days for a blood test. I was given steroids to take for a few months.   My platelets were at 120,000. I thought that I was getting better, but then a few days letter came in for another blood test and it showed I was back at 60,000 platelets. Thats where I am now.

                                                Dose 1 - 1/19/21 - On 1/26/21, I got developed a bad case of SOB. I called my cardiologist and she told me to get tested for COVID. I went to the county facility to get tested and it took 3 days for results, which finally came back negative. During my wait, I went to a Urgent care and they did a Chest Xray, EKG and another COVID test, which was negative and the other tests were normal. I was sent back to cardiologist. She scheduled a stress text on 2/11 and everything was fine. I was also feeling fine by then.  Dose 2 - 2/16/21 - The next day, I had a headache, aches, pain, fever and basically felt like I had the flu. I took Tylenol and that lasted about 36 hours. On 2/25, I was doing my 2 mile walk and I start experiencing the SOB again. So, I relaxed and figured it would go away. On 3/1, we drove to a park and back home 3 days later. On 3/3, I was really exhausted, so I took a nap for 3 hours and awakened with calf pain and a low grade fever. That lasted for 3 days, so I went to the ER on 3/6. They did an ultrasound on my leg and found a DVT in my right leg. They did CT Scan of my lung and found several clots (pulmonary emboli). I was in the hospital overnight and put me on a blood thinner, Eliquis 5mg, twice a day. Since then, I&#39;ve continued to take the Eliquis and I&#39;m following up with a hematologist on June 21. The hematologist has already tested me for two factors came negative and he will test me for the third one at my next visit.

                                                I experienced menstrual like cramps and minor lower back aches. Later during the day the cramps started to calm down, At nighttime I experienced flu like symptoms, I started to feel a sore throat that was by my tonsils. I also had aches under my eyes The next day I still had a sore throat and I also experienced earaches. A couple days later the eye aching got worse. I also started to have sharp pains in my stomach. I  also wasn&#39;t able to eat anything , when I did eat one snack I felt very stuffed. I experienced a minor headache. At night a couple days later I still had experienced some more stomach aches that became very painful. When I start going to the bathroom I saw some blood. Couple weeks later I felt a little bit better , I by chance pushed on my lower stomach area close by my pelvis and it felt very sore. After all this I felt better and gained my energy back. Then that&#39;s when I felt the stomach pains  by my kidney again and the menstrual like cramps. Not until May did all of my cramps and pains come to a stop.

                                                I started to get a rash around the injection area and a stiff neck. Both resolved after about 5 days. On the 29th, I couldn&#39;t see after I got out of the shower. I went to the hospital and they gave me the TPA drug. I told them I had the vaccine and they said they weren&#39;t sure if it could be the cause. I was hospitalized for 3 days. Doctor thought it was a Cerebellum Stroke in the back of my head and think the drug broke up the clot. My vision did return after the drug. They didn&#39;t have any ICU beds and weren&#39;t equipped to handle my case, so they did telemed appt with Neurological ICU, where they did more testing. I have to follow up with their stroke clinic next week. They put me on new meds, to include Norvas, baby aspirin and Crestor.

Immediately felt a little lightheaded during the 15 min window afterward but was able to ambulate independently with walker just afterward.  After taking a nap, she woke with a headache, chills, a little shaky and feeling very tired.  She was able to eat and take Tylenol at the time.  For the rest of the day, she felt under the weather.  The next morning she was very weak, unable to ambulate and tachycardic prompting nursing staff to send her to the hospital for assessment.

                                                The day following the vaccine I was fine until approximately 1:30 p.m. when I suddenly got very, very dizzy, had disequilibrium and began to feel nauseous, and had diarrhea.  The dizziness increased from mild to so bad I had to hold onto the wall to walk to the bathroom.  I took half a Benadryl but it continued to escalate and I took another half a Benadryl at which time it stopped escalating but did not dissipate until approximately 4:45 p.m.  I called my physician who was unavailable so I just depended on the Benadryl.  There were no breathing difficulties but I had a scratchy throat in the middle of the attack and my tongue went numb and tingly.

After her second dose of the medication, she tested positive for covid 3 days later. She was hospitalized on May 8th and was not able to recover. She passed away on May 20th.  The Drs at the Hospital in told me the rituxan essentially wiped the vaccine from her body.  The reason I&#39;m reporting this is to warn others in her position about the possible side effects. My mom had a very false sense of security.

He reports that after the vaccine was given she bled a lot and is concerned if this has contributed to her adverse reaction. She has had headache, cloudy vision, dizziness, brain fog, muscle fatigue, body aches and chills. She is still experiencing most of these side effects even though it&#39;s been about 6 days since her shot. Some of this are listed as common side effects to the vaccine but the cloudy vision, dizziness and brain fog were concerning to me - I recommended that she follow up with provider, especially if side effects have not improved by end of the day. It sounds like she&#39;s already been to the urgent care about this but did not receive much help there.

Her outpatient workup included positive ANA and anti-SSA.  She was then referred to Rheumatology for new diagnosis of Lupus.  6/11/2021 she was referred to the hospital for management of acute lupus flair.  On admission she was found to have acute kidney injury and thrombocytopenia. AIR team was consulted given concern for active lupus, she was started prednisone as well as Plaquenil.   On 6/17/2021, she brought emergently to MICU for lethargy, WOB, hypoxia, and new onset A-Fib. She was intubated and continued to clinically deteriorate with persistent lactic acidosis.  An ECHO showed severely depressed EF and right heart dysfunction.  On 6/17/2021 she experienced PEA arrest with 6 minutes of CPR.  She was placed on VA ECMO with Impella.   Patient was extubated on 6/19/2021 and was reintubated on 6/20/201 for hemoptysis.  A CT on that day showed RP bleed on the left with extension into the left thigh and ground glass opacities throughout suggestive of ARDS.  She tolerated a slow ECMO wean and was explanted successfully on 06/23. She was extubated on 06/25.    Over the next several days she was able to be successfully weaned from HFNC and was transitioned to NC. On 6/28 she passed her swallow evaluation and was okayed for a PO diet. Plan is to transition patient to the floor in the next few days

Pt has numerous documented allergies including iodine (hives, facial swelling), Shellfish Containing Products (Hives, facial swelling) and penicillin (edema). Pt initially tolerated injection without incident and was sent for post-injection observation. Within 10 minutes, pt developed acute SOB, increased WOB, wheezing, and cough. Pt also reported itching skin and scratchy throat. Provider notified and exam found pt in respiratory distress with increased work of breathing, bronchospasm and wheezing. Pt had no rash, lip swelling or vomiting. Vitals assessed as O2 sats &gt;96%, BP 140-150s/60s, HR 70-80s. Pt was administered albuterol 2.5 mg via nebulization x 2, diphenhydramine 50 mg IM and epinephrine 0.3 mg IM. Pt was subsequently transported to ED. By time of arrival, pt&#39;s symptoms had significantly improved. Pt administered famotidine 20 mg IV and prednisone 60 mg PO and placed on continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring. After complete symptom resolution, pt was discharged in stable condition. Pt&#39;s allergy profile was updated to include Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine (eua) (rxn: Anaphylaxis; severity: High).

The patient was discovered to have a large saddle pulmonary embolism, went into cardiac arrest and expired. Of note, the patient received her second Moderna COVID vaccine on 1/23, which would place her first one approximately 12/25 if she received them at the appropriate interval. This information is from the patient&#39;s daughter and the ED record, the information is not available in CAIR. Per the daughter, the patient started feeling ill on 1/21, improved on 1/25, and then acutely worsened on 1/27, resulting in the ED visit.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Concomitant products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included Pentasa, metformin, insulin, Zoloft and atorvastatin.  The patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 028L20A) on 20 Jan 2021 in the right arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  The patient developed a fever on 25 Jan 2021, and it got up to 101 degrees Fahrenheit on 26 Jan 2021.  On 26 Jan 2021 she felt must worse, couldn&#39;t take food, and couldn&#39;t get up from bed. On 27 Jan 2021, she was taken to the emergency room where her oxygen saturation was low, but the fever was gone.  She was placed on oxygen, and blood work had elevated troponin. The patient was diagnosed with pericarditis and she was kept overnight. On 28 Jan 2021 she had atrial fibrillation and the medical team couldn&#39;t convert her chemically.  She was stabilized on 30 Jan 2021 and she was feeling much better.   Treatments of these events included oxygen and ibuprofen.    The events, fever of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, feeling much worse, couldn&#39;t take food, couldn&#39;t get up from bed, bloodwork with elevated troponin, pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation were considered Recovering.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67 year old female who experienced serious unexpected events of feeling abnormal, decreased appetite, bedridden, elevated troponin, pericarditis, and atrial fibrillation, and a serious expected event of fever. The events began 6 days after first dose of mRNA-1273. Treatment with ibuprofen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I also became very flushed and very hot and fatigued with any excercise despite not having fever except for second day. I have pictures of these red hive like spots

IN CONNECTION WITH THAT, I DEVELOPED SEVER PAIN IN MY LOWER RIGHT FLANK AREA THAT RADIATED TO MY SHOULDER AS WELL AS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THERE IS NO HISTORY IN MY FAMILY OF ANY CLOTTING ISSUES AND I MYSELF HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A THING OCCUR.  THE PAIN BECAME SO BAD IT FORCED ME TO GO TO A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPT.  AFTER CT SCANS CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF THE CLOTS, I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ADMITTED FOR OBSERVATION ON A REGIMEN OF DRUGS, BLOOD THINNER, PAIN MED, AND A CLOT BUSTER (NOT SURE WHICH MANUFACTURER.)  I AM STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN IN MY RIGHT FLANK AREA - SOMEWHAT RADIATING TO MY RIGHT SHOULDER DAY 1 POST DISCHARGE AND AM HAVING TO RELY ON OPIOID PAIN MED AS WELL AS THE CLOT BUSTING MED AND A HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE MED. TO ME, IT SEEMS THAT THIS MAY NOT BE JUST COINCIDENTAL.  I WAS FEELING FINE PRIOR TO THE S 2ND DOSE OF THE MODERNA VAC AND THIS SEEMS TO ME THAT IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE 2 DOSE.

                                                Blood clots in arm; Arm was sore; A spontaneous report was received from a healthcare professional concerning a 67-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced sore arm/pain in arm and blood clot in her arm/thrombosis.  The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included diabetes. Concomitant medications were not included.  On 15 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of  mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 031M20A) in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 15 Feb 2021, post vaccination the patient experienced sore arm and her condition got worse. She was then taken to emergency room with blood clots in her arm.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.   The outcome of the events, sore arm and blood clot in her arm, were not known.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 67-year-old, female patient, who experienced thrombosis and pain in arm. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  The patient&#39;s medical history of diabetes is a risk factor. Further information has been requested.

Once again, spouse and patient observed the post vaccination waiting period and reported no issues.  On 3-11-21,  I was notified that patient had passed away at home.  In speaking to spouse, he stated that they both went to bed that evening with with a mild headache and fatigue. Spouse stated that he woke up early that morning with a more pronounced headache and had difficulty sleeping.  He noted that at approximately 5:18 AM  patient seemed to breathing heavily and may have gasped a bit.  He checked on her again around 6:40 and determined that she had passed away.  He contacted EMS and the technician confirmed that she had passed away.  Spouse reports that the state will perform and autopsy in the next few days at the direction of Medical staff.

Pt states she got her vaccine on Thursday and then developed severe GERD sx that night. She states she normally does not have GERD and she tried antacids and PPI for her sx. She states she tried to sleep but awoke with projective vomiting and was unable to stop this. She also had myalgias and fatigue. She went to ER and hospital notes indicate supportive care was given and sx resolved quickly. Pt never developed any CP or SOB.

                                                Post vaccine 2/9/21, I experienced drop in O2 Sat over a period of several weeks as I log my daily vitals (blood sugar, BP, Temp, Pulse rate and O2 Sat in percent).  I have O2 concentrator that I use as needed via nasal cannula.  I do have SOB with exertion due to Sarcoidosis of the Lung.  I notified my PCP on 2/19 of a morning sat of 89 which came up with O2 and breathing exercises, I also took a 20mg. Lasix and Mucinex chewable which usually helps with congestion.  With O2 and rest, my O2 Sat improved and extra O2 was stopped.  Then again my O2 steadily dropped over a period of a week, I coughed more (always have come cough), SOB. On March 7th, getting ready for bed, I became severely SOB, O2 Sat now 82, I called 911.  Was alert, oriented when Paramedics arrived, but needed 100% O2 and transported to Hospital, SOB was severe, gasping/drowning, loss of awareness, apparently resp. arrested, was intubated.  STAT CT with Contrast, and Echocardiogram, R/O PE, Lung collapse, etc.  (No PE/or collapse). MY supposition is that I had a slow moving allergic response to Moderna Vaccine (I am a former healthcare worker of 20 years) and currently work in healthcare medical devices in Ultrasound.  I closely watch vaccine development and read research articles on Sarcoidosis, vaccines and COVID. I participated and continue with a Sarcoidosis Study). I think I experienced cytokine storm with my ultrasensitive immune system. I use oral steroid (QVAR 40mics inhaled daily) which I doubled after taking the vaccine for a few weeks. I have had a MMR vaccine last June 2020 and Quadvalent Flu vaccine last August 2020.

After that she had numbness, tingling and itching in left side of her face, which has stayed. Then, almost immediately after shot she had an anaphylactic reaction: throat tightening and problems breathing. In the ER, they gave her Benadryl and that was enough to stop it. Now, she says the numbness is similar to being numb from going to the dentist.

She did not think she was going to make it back to her apartment. Upon returning to her home, she had numbness in her lower extremity. She felt terrible and contacted her healthcare provider.  She was seen and it was noted that she may have had a mild TIA but her blood pressure was significantly elevated and she was placed on hypertension medication. The weakness has resolved.

                                                My mom was very ill with fever like symptoms following her first vaccination on January 26th. The symptoms were even worse after her second vaccination March 2nd and included muscle cramping in her legs. Once she was recovered she only had a persistent cough which she attributed to allergies as the pollen count had been high. In the early morning hours of March 19th she was having difficulty breathing and chest pains. She was rushed to the emergency room where she subsequently died of cardio pulmonary embolism which the coroner indicated began within three weeks of her death.

                                                I developed severe lower back/flank pain about 4 days after receiving my 2nd Moderna vaccination.  The pain was most pronounced while lying supine and , while in that position, manifested a creeping , fluid nature, i.e. migrating from my lower back to my shoulder.  I was unable to lie down comfortably.  In thinking about the nature of this pain, I determined that it was possibly/probably from a PE as it seemed as if  pain was migrating from my lower back to my shoulder.  I&#39;m &#34;not a doctor but play one on TV&#34; (LOL ) so surmised that it was something serious that  decided that this was something needing attention.  I presented to a hospital ER for care and was ultimately told I had 2 small PE blood clots - 1 in the base of each lung.  My diagnosis was confirmed by a CT scan and I was subsequently admitted for observation.  I was discharged the following day with blood thinners and blood pressure medication.

No Medical History information was reported.   On 26-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On 26-Mar-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 2 dosage form. On 02-Apr-2021, the patient experienced THROMBOSIS (Blood clot in leg) (seriousness criteria hospitalization and medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 02-Apr-2021 to 06-Apr-2021 due to THROMBOSIS. The patient was treated with Surgery (Angioplasty) for Thrombosis. On 06-Apr-2021, THROMBOSIS (Blood clot in leg) had resolved. Not Provided          Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current available information and the temporal association between product use and the stat date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Hospitalized on 3/31 following episode of unresponsiveness and confusion that started roughly 18hrs after vaccination. Patient had similar presentation requiring hospitalization after first vaccine dose as well  Initially presented to Hospital.  Workup there included empiric antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy did not result in improvement, MRI brain and lumbar punctures non-significant, required intubation early in admission for a brief period, then likely developed HAP/VAP and ARDS requiring re-intubation and was transferred to higher level of care our main campus  facility from which I am reporting this.   Here,  rheum/neuro workup largely negative. Her course has been c/b multiple DVTs and Aflutter that has resolved. So far, workup for AMS and fevers have been extensive -- BEM, LP, MRI, thora, bronch w BAL were unremarkable. The patient has been monitored off abx without hemodynamic changes. She did not improve despite various abx administered and did not really respond to seroquel for her delirium. At one point, the husband was considering hospice because nothing had improved her clinical status. Given her rheumatologic hx and declining mental status after the vaccine, the patient was treated with methylpred 1 daily x3 and this dramatically improved her clinical course. She began to wake up and per the ICU, was AOx2-3 at one point, whereas she had not responded even to painful stimuli at one point. She still did have some hypoactive delirium. At this point, she was deemed stable enough to be transferred. Our phsyicians were following her through the admission, was not aware and speaking again until 5/5/21.   Currently she is undergoing epilepsy workup and is still hospitalized.

                                                Rhabdomyolysis with associated transaminitis from skeletal muscle breakdown; This spontaneous case was reported by an other health professional (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of RHABDOMYOLYSIS (Rhabdomyolysis with associated transaminitis from skeletal muscle breakdown) in a 67-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 vaccination.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Photopheresis (monthly) since an unknown date. Concurrent medical conditions included Graft versus host disease since 04-Oct-2019 and Weakness (frequently since 2018) since 2010. Concomitant products included RUXOLITINIB from 13-Jan-2021 to an unknown date for Graft versus host disease, PREDNISONE, BUDESONIDE and TACROLIMUS for an unknown indication.   On 28-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 25-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 05-Mar-2021, the patient experienced RHABDOMYOLYSIS (Rhabdomyolysis with associated transaminitis from skeletal muscle breakdown) (seriousness criterion hospitalization). The patient was hospitalized from 05-Mar-2021 to 23-Mar-2021 due to RHABDOMYOLYSIS. On 23-Mar-2021, RHABDOMYOLYSIS (Rhabdomyolysis with associated transaminitis from skeletal muscle breakdown) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Aldolase: elevated (High) elevated levels consistent with myositis. In March 2021, Biopsy muscle: abnormal (abnormal) demonstrated mild myopathy, mitochondrial dysfunction, mild reinnervation and severe type 2 fiber atrophy. Microscopic analysis also demonstrated lymphocytic infiltration, along with apoptotic bodies, providing overall gestalt most consistent with a mixed nonspecific liver injury, along with some findings to support graft-versus-host-disease of the liver. In March 2021, Blood creatinine: elevated (High) elevated levels consistent with myositis. In March 2021, Electromyogram: abnormal (abnormal) consistent with myositis.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered RHABDOMYOLYSIS (Rhabdomyolysis with associated transaminitis from skeletal muscle breakdown) to be possibly related.    Extensive serologic workup was done in March 2021 which were grossly negative for new autoimmune processes. No specific treatments were reported.  Company Comment  Based on current available information and the temporal association between product use and the start date of the events a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

So I went to get something to drink and went back to bed, I thought I was dehydrated. Over the next few days I felt real tired and washed out and with more shortness of breath. They did an EKG and went to a Cardiologist and he thought my thyroid was off, he wanted to watch and change medication to see if it will help. I started to get worse and they CT Scan of my chest with my PCP and they found bilateral PE. I was hospitalized for a  day and sent home with medication and right now I&#39;m still out of work. I go back to the Dr. on the 23rd to see if they will let me go back to work.

                                                Pt was admitted from 4/7-4/8 for c/o bloody diarrhea and nausea for 1 week associated with fevers. Her hgb remained stable and she was discharged to follow up with GI on 4/8 with diarrhea resoled. CT scan at that time showed no acute abnl and minor sigmoid diverticulosis. She returned  on 6/9 with 4 days of bloody stool.  she was discharged on 6/16/21 after a protracted hospital course . Patient is a 67-year-old female with a past medical history significant for wheelchair-bound status secondary to MS and multiple left lower extremity surgeries, type 2 diabetes, CHF, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, GERD who presented to the emergency room on 6/9/2021 for evaluation of bright red blood per rectum x4 days.  She was recently admitted in April for a day and a half for diarrhea that was bloody but symptoms resolved.  In the ER she was tachycardic and hypotensive she also had lactic acidosis.  She was ultimately admitted for anemia of acute blood loss, symptomatic hypotension and lower GI bleed as well as SIRS without sepsis.  She was seen in consultation by Gastroenterology and ultimately underwent a colonoscopy on 6/11/2021 which revealed no source for the bleeding and there was no evidence of malignancy she did have diverticulosis seen.  She had red-tinged stool throughout the ascending transverse descending and sigmoid colon as well as red bloody stool in the rectum.  She was on no blood thinners prior to arrival it stated in her med rec that she was on aspirin but she was not taking aspirin.  She remained in the hospital for close monitoring she did receive 2 units of blood.  We were hoping to advance her diet and plan discharge home but unfortunately patient began bleeding again and underwent a second colonoscopy on 6/14/2021 which again revealed the same bloody stool in the transverse, descending, sigmoid and rectum.  Patient did have a tagged bleeding scan which revealed evidence of bleeding with the tracer becoming visible in the region of the splenic flexure of the colon passing proximally and distally within the lumen of the colon.  Despite the second colonoscopy the bleeding source could not be found.  Patient was given an additional unit of blood.  She was monitored further.  She had a period of time after the colonoscopy where she had severe generalized abdominal pain but this resolved by the following day where she then began to have diarrhea but no further hematochezia or bleeding was noted. she was discharged on 6/16/21 home.   Of note this is the patient&#39;s fourth ER visit and or hospitalization since receiving her COVID-19 vaccinations.   CT showing no acute abnl and again diverticulosis. She received her 1st moderna covid 19 vaccine on 3/9  and her second on 4/9/21. she has had 2 hospitalizations since her vaccinations and 2 er visits 3/13 at another er noting increased blood sugars, blurred vision and a headache since her covid vaccine on 3/9 and 3/18 for fatigue, high blood sugars

DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 06-Feb-2021, COVID-19: negative (Negative) negative. On 11-Feb-2021, Chest X-ray: inconclusive (Inconclusive) New 5 and 7 mm ill-defined nodular densities are seen in the left upper lobe compared with 2007. On 15-Feb-2021, Computerised tomogram thorax: inconclusive (Inconclusive) Chest x-ray findings correspond with mild left upper lobe ground-glass opacities, likely infectious or inflammatory in etiology. Lungs, Pleura and Airways: Mild left upper lobe stellate peribronchovascular and subpleural ground-glass opacities. No airway narrowing or obstruction. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax..     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient started taking flu shots in her 50s which did help. On Monday 08 Feb 2021, patient called her PCP, and had a zoom call. She prescribed a cough med and suggested I get a chest xray and Ct scan. The medication helped a bit with the cough (especially at night) but she still had mucus production. Patient had another call with PCP on 16Feb 2021, where she prescribed a five day course of antibiotic, but that didn&#39;t result in clearing up the mucus production either. Patient was but on an inhaler to help clear up the likely infection/mucus. Patient had little to no (new) symtoms as a result of the 2nd shot. Patient used the inhaler for about two months and gradually the mucus production and cough went away. Patient weaned myself off the inhaler over the course of the first 2-3 weeks in May and was perfectly fine until she went in to have the pneumonia vaccine (PPSV-23) on 13 Jun 2021. After the shot patient&#39;s mucus production started up again and patient started back on the inhaler but only once a day, which seems to keep my symptoms in check. Patient met PCP on 29 Feb 2021, to talk about this on-going lung issue. Patient was going to take a pulmonary Function Test some time this month (July).

Patient used Benadryl to treat it. 2 days later the raised effect and hardness had gone away, however the redness spread over most of the shoulder area, and 2 days after that had spread halfway down her upper arm. The itch remained. Patient went to a previously scheduled appointment with our primary care physician who said that she had had a DAR (delayed anaphylactic reaction) and should not get the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Within 24 hours, the inoculation site became red, swollen and itchy which I expected. After a couple of days it calmed down.  I am reporting the symptoms that began a week - 10 days later . On January  19 or 20 my joints and muscles began to feel more painful that usual. By Friday the 22nd I felt a deep dizziness momentarily and shook it off. By that evening, I developed a fever, with shakes and chills which continued into the next morning. My throat was sore. I was completely exhausted. My joints and muscles felt as though there were little bonfires burning. I decided to go to a walk in ER to at least receive a Covid 19 test to see if I could have become infected . The test was negative as well as the flu test, strep culture and multi-bacterial screening test. My blood work indicated a heightened inflammatory response.  I have gradually gotten better over the course of the last 10 days. I am reporting this as the vaccine is experimental and although the symptoms that I exhibited are outside of the normal period that a reaction would be expected to occur, perhaps there are outlier cases on the curve

Headache developed.   8:00 pm. ? Watching TV noted irregular heartbeat, and a minute later, increase in respiration rate.  That lasted 20 minutes at the most, and then went away.  Went to bed at 10 pm and slept well.  Tuesday, 2-16-21. 7:00 am. ? In kitchen. Lightheaded, increased respiration, feeling like I?m going to pass out, so I quickly sit down.  Two minutes later feel fine.  Went about making breakfast.  This happened two more times.  Realizing this might be a reaction to the vaccination, went to urgent care.  Doctor listened to my heart, ordered EKG and result showed that I was in atrial fibrillation (A-Fib).  NO previous cardiac issues, no high blook pressure, no diabetes, never a smoker, not obese.   Ambulance was called to take me to Hospital.  Another EKG confirmed still in A-Fib.  Blood drawn.  Hooked me up to a wireless/remote heart monitor.  Still in A-Fib, elevated heart rate, higher than normal blood pressure.  Kept overnight in hospital awaiting more test results, continuous monitoring, and with ECG ordered for Wednesday morning and then consultation with cardiologist.  Wednesday, 2-17-21.  11:45 am., ECG done.  Still in A-Fib. ECG shows no signs of blood pooling or clotting.  Cardiologist proposed courses of action, starting with what makes sense based on current conditions:  A cardioversion.  Having done thousands (his words) and given my great state of health otherwise, and very low risk for complications, a cardioversion is agreed to.  That would happen immediately after first doing a Tee (transesophageal echocardiography) to look at the back of my heart.  Then if all looks clear, no clotting, proceed with the cardioversion procedure.   3:00 pm., anesthesiologist asks if I have any further questions. I didn?t. He sedates me.  At 3:17 pm. I open my eyes, see the cardiologist standing at the foot of the gurney giving me thumbs up.  I returned the thumbs up and said to him, ?good job.?  Heartbeat successfully restored to normal rhythm by the cardioversion procedure.  6:00 pm. (approximately) - Discharged from hospital with prescription for Eliquis and Lopressor, and instructions for follow up appointments with primary care physician, and with cardiologist.

                                                I did experience some headache and lethargy on Sat. so laid low. I did go for a walk about 3:30 walking up hill at times as is usual. I did have an appetite and prepared dinner. I did not go to work (child play therapist). Sunday I felt more myself and did notice the soreness in my arm was surely not as bothersome as with the first shot. Had a very active day, no walk but yoga class.  Prepared a nice dinner for VD and settled in to view television later in the evening. Strangely, the memory of the exact nature of how this started eludes me, but I do recall experiencing discomfort in the very upper extremities of my chest. Sharing this with my husband he wondered if it may have had something to do with sleeping on my right side cramping the rib area due to not sleeping on my left side because of the shot. I also pondered if it might be related to my gym workout on Thursday ?  I recall feeling tired and headed to bed. I recall awakening to use the bathroom and feeling a slight brief bout of dizziness. When I did awaken the next morning the chest discomfort was still present to I called the Health Center and was advised to go to the ER. The EKG was fine. The troponin level was elevated to 0.19 so I was told I had suffered a mild myocardial infarction and I was going to the ICU.

                                                I started seeing stars after showering the morning after receiving my shot and eventually blacked out, fell, and struck my head.  When I came to, my head was bleeding where it struck the floor and I was in a cold sweat.  I crawled to my phone and called 911.  They arrived and checked me out, settled me on the couch and gave me tylenol, spoke with a doctor on the phone, and eventually told me that I could get a friend to take me to the ER if I wished.  However, my husband is disabled and could not be left alone, so I&#39;d have had to find another friend to stay with him.  Although I might have a concussion, my condition seemed OK and I have not had any other severe symptoms so I  have not sought further medical attention.

On 3/9 around 2:30 am I had another episode of shortness of breath that lasted about 5 minutes. I was able to return to sleep. I went to work that morning and had shortness of breath, sweating, and dizziness. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed with an acute saddle pulmonary embolism.   I was admitted and started on IV heparin.  On 3/10, I was also found to have a DVT in my right leg.

                                                On the morning February 22nd I was outside with my family in our backyard. I was checking our plant when I started to feel that I needed to sit down. By the time I sat down, I realized I had no feeling or use from the left side of my body including my face. I also had trouble communicating. Could not form complete sentences. The entire left side of my face was drooping. At that moment my husband immediately called 911.  I was taken to the hospital by ambulance where i was immediately treated and diagnosed with a stroke. They administered TPA. I spent 3 days in the ICU. I have since been treated with blood pressure medication, blood thinners and statins.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter, included allergies to yellow 5 (tartrazine), shellfish, and bee stings. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 Jan 2021 at 11:42 AM, approximately two minutes prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.    On 19 Jan 2021, minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced a cold and numb sensation on the upper right part of her back. The sensation extended around her shoulder and into her clavicle region. Approximately 30 minutes after vaccination she started sweating and felt like she was going into anaphylactic shock, which she had experienced in the past. The patient felt like her throat was swelling and her neck started to visibly swell. One hour after vaccination, the patients lips went numb, the clavicular numbness continued, and she started to experience chest pressure. A paramedic then evaluated the patient, her blood pressure was 223/105-110 mmHg, she was placed in an ambulance, given diphenhydramine and solumedrol, then taken to the emergency room. At the emergency room, the patient received a chest x-ray, computed tomography scan, blood tests, and an electrocardiogram. Previously, the patient had a blood test which showed a potassium of 4.3 to 3.9 &#34;or something.&#34; At the emergency room, her potassium had &#34;dropped to 1%.&#34; The patient was administered potassium in the hospital and was held for observation until approximately 10:00 PM, then discharged.   On 20 Jan 2021, the patient continued to experience chest tightness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.   The outcome of the events anaphylactic shock, potassium dropped to 1%, cold and numb sensation, sweating,blood pressure was 223/105-110 ,Neck swelling, Throat swelling, Numb lips and disability was unknown. The event, chest pressure was considered not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 69-year-old, female patient with medical history of allergies to yellow 5 (tartrazine), shellfish, and bee stings, who experienced a serious, unexpected event of anaphylactic shock, sweating, hypoaesthesia, pharyngeal swelling, neck swelling, numb lips, chest discomfort, hypertension, hypokalemia and disability NOS.

                                                The next day after vaccine was given, I got vaginal spotting/breakthrough  bleeding. I am postmenopausal and on HRT and have been for 14 years and have not had any spotting after menopause and HRT was started. This highly unusual. Today, I also got a little spotting in the afternoon, like yesterday. So this is the second day in a row. I do not have any discomfort. I contacted my doctor late today and left a message for her. I do hope she will contact me tomorrow. I have heard that there are some new symptoms  reported in the UK regarding female gynecological  side effects like changes in  menstrual cycle, which would not apply directly to me, but maybe similar symptoms?  I am hoping the spotting will stop soon.  The question is, would a 2nd dose be advised or not?

At ~9:45pm, my wife suddenly fell unconscious. Immediate CPR &amp; with Paramedic were not able to revive her. SHE PASSED AWAY at home. We believe it may be triggered by the vaccine.  Did not have a chance to go to hospital or emergency room - it was too sudden. A sad day for us.

                                                spontaneous bleed; bruise on the shin; sore arm; hives; nose bleed; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning a 69 years-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine and experienced sore arm, hives, nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin.    The patient&#39;s medical history included Von Willebrand Disease and breast cancer. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 JAN 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number 012L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On an unknown date post-vaccination, the patient experienced a sore arm and some hives. Approximately two weeks after the first dose, the patient experienced a spontaneous bleed resulting in a huge bruise on the shin the size of the palm of their hand. The patient consulted their Hematologist who performed blood work which was perfect. There were no abnormal results. The physician administered DDAVP.  On 09 Feb 2021, the patient experienced their first nose bleed described as &#34;horrific&#34;.  The patient reported they had blood gushing out of their nose and that they bled for four hours. The patient ended up in the hospital emergency department where they were sprayed with DDAVP to stop the bleeding.  Treatment details included DDAVP.  There was no change planned to the dosing schedule of mRNA-1273 in response to the events.  The events, nose bleed and spontaneous bleed were considered not recovered / not resolved.  The outcome of the events sore arm, hives, and bruise on the shin was unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and the patient&#39;s history of Von Willebrand Disease, a causal association between the events nose bleed, spontaneous bleed, and bruise on the shin with mRNA-1273 use is assessed as unlikely.  However, based on temporal association, causality for the events of sore arm and hives cannot be excluded.

Had the headache for over two weeks, and eventually went to the hospital with loss of speech and movement on her left side of her body. They at first said it was strokes, then after the CT scan results came back they found multiple abscess in her brain. She does not have a history of strokes or brain abscess. Speech and motor functions never returned, and one abscess was so large that it caused a brain shift ( the two hemispheres separated) they performed brain surgery and it was not successful. She passed away on 3/31/2021 at 431 am.

Shortness of breath got worse till I took some prednosone I had, on April 4, 2021 thinking I was having an asthma attack. Helped a few days. Shortness of breath returned on April 9, 2021. On April 10 we went to critical care thinking I was having asthma attack as extremely short of breath! They said it wasnt asthma but sent me to ER as my oxygen levels were low. In ER they took many tests including CAT scan and ultrasound, which resulted in diagnosis of several large bloodclots in both lungs

                                                On 4/3 patient developed neck pain and headache.  She had reportedly received her second dose of Moderna COVID vaccine within 1 week prior, but exact date unknown. She became acutely confused and reported tingling in her left fingers on 4/9 prompting presentation to Medical Center.  MRI was performed 4/10 reportedly showing an acute focal right corona radiata lacunar infarct. On 4/11 patient became more agitated and 4/12 developed worsening headache and global aphasia. Non-contrast head CT showed multiple areas of subarachnoid hemorrhage bilaterally. MRI brain felt to also have small areas of bilateral diffusion restriction throughout right more than left cerebral hemispheres with concern for leptomeningeal involvement.  She was transferred to another facility for higher level of care on 4/14.  LP on 4/16 with TNC 33 (95% lymphs, 3% monos, 2% macrophages), RBC 1425,  Protein 521, glucose 68. CSF gram stain/culture negative fungal culture and cryptococcal antigen negative, VZV PCR negative, HSV PCR negative, PCR meningitis/encephalitis panel negative, enterovirus culture negative. Serum VZV IgG positive but PCR negative, Lyme and treponemal antibodies negative, HIV Ab negative, ANA/ANCA/Sjogren&#39;s antibodies negative. Repeat LP 4/21 with TNC 43 (52% PMN, 35% lymphs, 11% monos, 1% baso, 1% myelos), protein 745, glucose 76). However, given high suspicion for viral encephalitis patient was recommended to complete a 10-14 day course of IV acyclovir by inpatient ID consult service (start date 4/16). She was also treated with empiric steroids. The neurology team is concerned for a possible vasculitis vs reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome as potential etiologies.   Brain biopsy performed 4/23 to help clarify diagnosis, results pending.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included Hypoxia. Concurrent medical conditions included Pulmonary hypertension (Reporter states: Pulmonologists disagree about this diagnosis) since May 2019 and Sleep apnea since March 2019. Concomitant products included LORATADINE for Allergy, VITAMIN D3 and CYANOCOBALAMIN (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]) for Deficiency vitamin.   On 05-Feb-2021 at 10:30 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 05-Mar-2021 at 10:30 AM, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 05-Mar-2021,  after starting mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine), the patient experienced PAIN IN EXTREMITY (mild arm pain). On 07-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HYPOXIA (my oxygen saturation again plummeted/getting difficult to maintain my oxygen level during the day) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (minimal pericardial effusion) (seriousness criterion medically significant). At the time of the report, HYPOXIA (my oxygen saturation again plummeted/getting difficult to maintain my oxygen level during the day) and PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (minimal pericardial effusion) had not resolved and PAIN IN EXTREMITY (mild arm pain) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 07-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: low (Low) Low. On 17-Apr-2021, Brain natriuretic peptide: 1064 (High) &#34;nearly 10 times the normal limit and is a strong indicator of heart failure&#34;. On 29-Apr-2021, Computerised tomogram thorax: abnormal (abnormal) minimal pericardial effusion.         Reporter states: I was diagnosed two years ago with sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxia and have used a CPAP device with oxygen every night since. Following the first dose of the vaccine, my oxygen level was so low that I had to go onto daytime supplemental oxygen for the first time. After the second dose of the vaccine, my oxygen saturation again plummeted. I have been on 3-4 L of daytime supplemental oxygen ever since. It is getting difficult to maintain my oxygen level during the day even with supplemental oxygen. The cardiologist has ordered an echocardiogram for May 7, 2021. That should help determine if my breathing difficulties are due to a sudden worsening of pulmonary hypertension, or if this could be related to the vaccines.

Line C ?Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder?  Received her second Moderna dose from our Mobile team on 4/14/21    Since then I spoke with Dr. (Mobile); clients PCP, several times regarding this event.  His nurse got an email from client on 4-12-21 that client had vaccination planned on 414 and may need to reschedule medical appointment planned 4-16 if she felt bad. The client was encourage to get vaccine and to keep appointment for Friday April 16th.  The client  emailed the office at approx 0300 Friday morning  April 16 to cancel appointment because she felt to poorly from vaccination shot to come in  (fevers; body aches). Dr next heard from police officer on Monday April 19th that she was found dead in her home. He requested the Medical Examiner (ME) evaluate but this request was denied. The client lived alone. Dr contacted family members but they did not have much interaction with the client and had no significant information to contribute. Dr said he speculates that the patients underlying anorexia nervosa likely put the client in a critical nutritional deficiencies / electrolyte imbalance condition and the side effects of vaccination were too much. He felt compelled to complete the death certificate as he did because the ME declined the case.   From vaccine mobile team notes:  team was there2-3:30pm. All the answers to the health screening questions for the patient were &#34;no&#34; except for &#34;have you ever had a severe allergic reaction to something?&#34; To that question the answer was &#34;yes.

                                                A large blood clot developed in my right leg.  From the top of the thigh/groin area to my ankle.  Went to the emergency room.  I was admitted and over 3days, approximately 7 hours the clot was busted with stents and balloons put in.  My hospital stay was from April 19, 2021 to April 24, 2021. I didn?t realize what was happening as my leg just keep swelling. I have never had a clotting problem.  I have had major surgery (gall bladder removal), a left hip and knee replacement and bunions removed from both feet. Never have had a blood clot problem.

                                                Late in the evening on May 12, my mother started having pain on her right side.  She also could not take a deep breath without having a stabbing-like pain.  The pain level was severe and kept her awake all night.  On May 13, she went to the urgent care department at the medical center.   An xray of her chest cavity was taken.  It showed fluid in her right lung, but the results were inconclusive because of her limited able to take a deep breath.  Extensive blood work was also performed.  The urgent care doctor suspected that she has a blood clot in her lung, and she was sent to the hospital for further testing.  She is still in the ER of the Medical Center. They are still doing tests and have not officially confirmed that she has a blood clot yet.

On 1/29/21 she called me early in the morning to say she couldn&#39;t stand or walk.  She hasn&#39;t walked since.  No idea if this was natural progression of dementia.  She did walk into and out of cardiology appointment on 1/7/2021, and was weak at that time.

                                                Rapid onset vision loss in left eye with concurrent rapid onset high blood pressure and rapid pulse.  Testing showed existing crowded optic nerve (previously undiagnosed), swelling of the optic nerve, delayed blood flow to optic nerve, and leakage around optic nerve head.  Vision loss progressed over about five days, stabilized, and may now be somewhat improved.  Diagnosis is Non-Arteric Ischemic Optic Neuritis (NAION), for which there is no treatment and uncertain prognosis.  Some extent of permanent vision loss tis epected.  Concurrent rapid onset of hypertension (systolic 150s-170s; diastolic low 100s at times) and fluctuating rapid pulse (80s-110). Currently being treated for hypertension but not yet fully controlled.  Blood tests revealed elevated inflammatory markers (high C-reactive protein and sedimentation rate and positive ANA.  Follow-up tests to determine cause of hypertension are underway.  Thus far, no heart abnormalities, no carotid artery blockage, and negative for a number of autoimmune disorders and other possible causes.  Prior to this event, blood pressure and pulse were normal and eye exams showed no vision or retina problems, glaucoma, or macular degeneration.  Cardiologist and rheumatologist have not ruled out inflammatory response to Covid vaccine, have encouraged reporting of this event to VAERS, and have advised against taking any other Covid booster.   Note that the optometrist who first saw me when the vision loss began has since told me that he saw only two cases of NAION in 38 years of practice before mine, but has seen two more besides me in the last couple of months.  Both were patients of similar age with similar rapid onset of vision loss, and both had taken the Covid vaccine about four weeks before.

                                                Patient is a 69-year-old female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, RA, GERD who presented from a rehab facility with fevers, hypotension, tachycardia and diarrhea.  This is the patient&#39;s third hospitalization in the last month.  She was initially admitted on 5/4/2021 for she suffered to syncopal episodes resulting in a motor vehicle accident x 2.  From 5/4-5/6.  During that admission her gabapentin dose was decreased and she was given 5 days of Macrobid on discharge for a possible urinary tract infection.  We also arrange follow-up with cardiology for loop recorder and to see orthopedics as an outpatient the etiology for her syncopal episode was unclear.  It was not felt to be seizure related.  She went home with home health care.  She unfortunately was readmitted on 5/29-6/3 new onset acute pancreatitis with an unknown etiology and was ultimately discharged to rehab.  During that hospitalization patient reported that she was seen by cardiology for her 2 syncopal episodes that occurred earlier in the month and a cardiac cause of her syncope was ruled out and they recommended she be referred to neurology.  She returns back again for admission on 6/8 for encephalopathy, hypotensive, septic shock, NSTEMI and was subsequently admitted to the intensive care unit on pressor support.  She was given Cipro, Flagyl, Vanco and Levophed and IV fluids.  Her septic shock was felt secondary to urinary tract infection.  The urine culture that was resulted on 5/30 grew Klebsiella pneumonia that was resistant to Macrobid.  She was not sent out on any antibiotic therapy as she was not felt to be symptomatic during her last hospital course.  She also had a CAT scan during this hospital course which showed colitis.  Urine culture from this admission was of mixed flora Greater than 100,000 colony-forming units no organisms were grown out however.  She was treated with 7 days of Cipro.  Again patient&#39;s CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis done on admission showed colitis she was seen by gastroenterology during her hospital stay and underwent an endoscopy.  It was ultimately felt that the patient&#39;s colitis was likely ischemic in nature.  Patient was also noted to be thrombocytopenic on admission which was felt to be possibly from sepsis or dilution was ultimately resolved at the point of discharge.  She also again was found to have acute blood loss anemia with no source found.  she had hematochezia noted on admission but resolved by the point of discharge.  EGD did not reveal any source of bleeding other than a tiny esophageal ulcer.  Aspirin therapy was discontinued.  She did not need transfusion during her hospital stay.  The lowest her hemoglobin went was to 7.3.  Patient&#39;s acute tubular necrosis resolved her metabolic acidosis and metabolic encephalopathy resolved and at this point she is stable for discharge to rehab.  Patient&#39;s lisinopril aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide have been discontinued at this point.  Her blood pressure is 121/61 she is afebrile respirations are normal O2 sat is 95% on room air.  Patient&#39;s hemoglobin  is 8.1.  She is no longer having an abdominal pain and is tolerating p.o.  She is not having any diarrhea.   the cause for the patient&#39;s colitis is likely ischemic in nature.  she was discharged to rehab on 6/15

                                                About 2 months after the 2nd dose vaccine, I started getting shortness of breath and tightness in my chest. Around end of May, the pressure started getting heavier. By June 5, 2021 I thought I was having a possible heart attack, so I decided to go to the Hospital. They did a bunch of tests and an ECHO and detected pericarditis, pericardio effusion and blood clots. I was on a heparin drip for 7 days for the blood clot and they started me on colchicine for the pericarditis which has now resolved. I was discharged with RX for Lovenox to prevent blood clots and to continue to take colchicine. I was in the hospital for 8 days total.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     No medical history was provided by the reporter.  Concomitant products included ATENOLOL, LEVOTHYROXINE, CHLORTHALIDONE, SIMVASTATIN, FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE (FLONASE [FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE]) and ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID, CAFFEINE, CHLORPHENAMINE MALEATE (CORICIDIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;CAFFEINE;CHLORPHENAMINE MALEATE]) for an unknown indication.    On 26-Feb-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 26-Feb-2021, the patient experienced PHOTOPSIA (Flashers in her eyes that continue) and INSOMNIA (Woke up in the middle of the night several times). On an unknown date, the patient experienced CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (stroke) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was treated with IBUPROFEN (ADVIL [IBUPROFEN]) for Migraine and Headache, at a dose of 1 dosage form four times per day. At the time of the report, CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (stroke), PHOTOPSIA (Flashers in her eyes that continue) and INSOMNIA (Woke up in the middle of the night several times) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (stroke) to be not related. No further causality assessments were provided for PHOTOPSIA (Flashers in her eyes that continue) and INSOMNIA (Woke up in the middle of the night several times).    Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events of photopsia and insomnia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on reporter&#39;s causality the event of cerebrovascular accident is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 08-Jul-2021: Significant follow received and the initial diagnosis of ocular migraine was wrong and is confirmed to be a stroke.  Reporter causality was updated to unrelated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events of photopsia and insomnia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.  Based on reporter&#39;s causality the event of cerebrovascular accident is assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273.

Then breast pain and swelling began and breast tissue changes were confirmed on May 28 via ultrasound. Two weeks later I developed a blood clot in my left calf as confirmed by an ultrasound on June 11, 2021.  I believe this blood clot was provoked my the Moderna vaccine, as there were no other factors that could have provoked the blood clot.

                                                Early in the morning Saturday, the day after the injection, patient became very nauseaus with a bad headache.  She was sick all day on Saturday with nausea and headache.  She could not sleep.  On Sunday, she felt worse and called ambulance.  They came and checked her out.  Said Oxygen level was normal and all her symptoms were normal side effects.  They did not take her to the hospital.  All day Sunday, she continued to be agitated and not able to get comfortable.  She was hot and cold, back and forth.  Her headache was very bad and she felt like she would throw up, but only threw up a little that day.  By Monday, she started not making sense and slurred her words.  We thought this was due to lack of sleep (exhaustion).  Her sugar was high, so we gave her an insulin shot.  She continued to make less and less sense so we called 911 approximately 7 PM on Monday night.  She was hallucinating.  At the hospital, they looked for infection, but could not find any source of infection.  They intubated her and soon after this, her heart stopped breathing.  They performed CPR 3 times, but not successful.  She died at 5 AM Tuesday morning.

She completed all necessary screening forms and was deemed to be at low risk for serious allergic reactions. She tolerated the vaccination well, and no complications or immediate adverse events occurred. She was observed for a full 15 mins per CDPHE/CDC guidelines and left the Clinic in stable condition after her observation period was complete. On the morning of Tuesday, January 19th, 2021, the patient was found unconscious and unresponsive by her husband. She was transferred by Ambulance to Hospital shortly thereafter. She was diagnosed with a brain bleed that was determined to be inoperable. She was transferred to other Hospital for higher level care. She was seen by neurosurgery and diagnosed with a ruptured aneurysm. She was treated in the ICU for 24 hours, at which point her team determined that the severity of her brain bleed would not respond to treatment. Supportive cares were withdrawn on Wednesday Jan 20th, and she passed away shortly thereafter.

                                                On 3/4/21, @ 2:pm, I had a very severe pain between  my shoulder blades that took my breath away, that radiating to the front of my check. I put an aspirin under my tongue, walked around and had some water. Pain kept getting worse. My husband drove me to the ED got there at 4pm. They took blood, did chest x-ray, ekgs. Blood work showed my Troponin level @ .11 and later elevated to 2.1. My blood pressure was 215/99, temp 97.  I started having pain in my right shoulder &amp; right wrist.  I was diagnosed with a slight heart attack. On Friday, 3/5/21, facility did an angiogram, which showed my arteries were clear, no blockage or plaque, no heart damage. Did show it appeared the arteries had gone into a spasm which may have caused the heart attack.  I saw my primary Dr on Monday, 3/8/21, and she said I have no history of heart problems, no high cholesterol, etc. I asked her if this could be a side effect of my vaccine. Dr. said it was a good question &amp; she didn&#39;t know the answer, since not all the research has been done. She suggested I submit my question to VAERS!  I&#39;m now taking  Aspirin 81 mg, daily, Bisoprolol 5 mg Tab, Losartan 25 mg Tab, DOK 100 mg Cap.

Hands, fingers took 10 days to return to normal.  All in all 14 days to recover completely from 2nd Moderna Covid shot.

I read possible side effects.  It said flu  like symptoms, so we thought it would pass.  Then around 4 she called for me &amp; when I got there she had an event that caused her to be unable to speak &amp; her eyes widened &amp; pupils were dilated.  I called 911. They got here quick.  She had at least three of those stiffening wide eyed events.  The emt said they thought it was her blood sugar.  When checked it was 350 even though she had taken her insulin that day.  They said she had a massive heart attack on the way to the hospital.

                                                Two days following first dose Moderna Vaccine at Pharmacy, she suffered a cardiac arrest.  Below  Discharge Summary From 3/26 hospital.   Patient PCP Information Provider PCP Type DO General Discharge Summary by DO at 3/26/2021 12:42 PM Author: DO Service: Cardiology Author Type: Resident Filed: 3/26/2021 12:57 PM Date of Service: 3/26/2021 12:42 PM Status: Attested Editor: DO (Resident) Cosigner: MD at 3/26/2021 1:17 PM  Resident Attestation: I personally saw and examined the patient on rounds with my cariology resident team on the day of the resident&#39;s note. Management was discussed with the cardiology resident and I supervised the plan of care. I have reviewed and agree with the key parts of the resident evaluation including:  Subjective information Objective findings on physical exam Impression and plan Gen: appears comfortable, sitting in bed Resp: clear. no wheezes, rhonchi, rales CV: normal rate, regular, no m/r/g Abd: soft, nt/nd Ext: warm, no edema. Pressure ulcer boots on. Pleasant 70-year-old woman who had a history of PVCs, left bundle branch block, and a mild nonischemic cardiomyopathy, came into the hospital following a VT/VF cardiac arrest. Her echocardiogram done while in the hospital showed a preserved ejection fraction. Her cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries. She had implantation of an ICD. Hospital course has been complicated by watershed cerebral infarcts. In addition, she had an episode of C. difficile colitis. She has gradually improved over the course of the past 3 weeks. From a cardiovascular perspective, she is being discharged on carvedilol 25 mg twice a day, lisinopril 10 mg daily, and her home atorvastatin. With regards to her etiology of cardiac arrest, I would be suspicious about the possibility of sarcoidosis. However, we were not able to get a cardiac MR while she was inpatient due to her strokes and inability to consistently follow commands and hold her breath. Would recommend consideration of an outpatient. She is ready to discharge to subacute rehab today. I have spent greater than 30 minutes in discharge planning.  Preferred Name: PATIENT  PCP: DO Primary Cardiologist:  MD Discharging Cardiologist: MD Admission Date: 3/5/2021 Admission Diagnosis: Cardiac arrest  Discharge Date: 03/26/21 Discharge Summary Author:  DO Primary Discharge Diagnosis VT/VF cardiac arrest, s/p therapeutic hypothermia S/p AICD placement 3/16/2021 Secondary Discharge Diagnoses Anoxic brain injury, recovering, with persistent aphasia and dysphagia C. difficile colitis Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, resolved DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness Patient is a 70 y.o. female, with history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, admitted on 3/5/2021 after out of hospital VT/VF cardiac arrest. She completed therapeutic hypothermia protocol. Cardiac catheterization did not show any significant obstructive coronary disease. TTE showed LVEF 55%. Patient underwent AICD placement on 3/16/2021. Had some recurrent nonsustained ventricular tachycardia afterward, which resolved after increasing her carvedilol doses. Her course was complicated by a C. difficile infection, treated with PO Vancomycin, with significant improvement in diarrhea. She has had gradual neurologic recovery. Neurology felt she had had several watershed infarcts, but felt that she would continue to have a prolonged recovery over the next few months. Had some recovery of language/cognition prior to discharge. Due to her waxing/waning encephalopathy, she did not qualify for inpatient rehab, but will be discharged to subacute rehab. Discharged with tube feeding continued, though she can begin sips with speech therapy supervision. Patient seen and examined at bedside on the day of discharge. She stated that she had no pain, though HPI/ROS still limited due to aphasia. Discussed above information with patient&#39;s husband, who understood and was in agreement with the plan.  Problem-Based Hospital Course NEURO Acute metabolic encephalopathy, with gradual recovery -Due to neurologic injury from cardiac arrest. -Neurology consult: concern for anoxic brain injury with watershed infarcts, anticipate very gradual recovery over the coming months. No acute process on imaging. -Patient extubated on 3/11, following some commands. Continuing to regain conversational ability and motor function gradually each day. Has some waxing and waning of mental status, but overall her encephalopathy  continues to improve. -Limit centrally acting/sedating medications -Speech following for language/cognition as well as dysphagia requiring tube feeding. Can begin some sips in addition to tube feeds. -Continue tube feeds via tube per instructions provided on after visit summary INFECTIOUS DISEASE C. Difficile Colitis: -C.Diff Positive 3/18. Continue 125 mg PO Vancomycin Q6H for 10 days (3/18 - 3/27), confirmed with infectious disease -Frequency of diarrhea has decreased significantly, was stable after rectal tube removed 2-3 days prior to discharge Pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, resolved -s/p 5 day course ceftriaxone (3/5 - 3/9 ) -CTA on admission showed significant RUL and RLL consolidation with air bronchograms, as well as some patchy airspace disease in LUL -Had copious tan sputum on suctioning 3/7 - respiratory culture negative CARDIOLOGY Out of hospital cardiac arrest, likely VT/VF -Pt&#39;s husband initiated chest compressions x 10 minutes, until police/fire dept arrival, when AED showed a shockable rhythm. Likely VT/VF arrest. -S/p therapeutic hypothermia protocol. -Troponin peaked at 1.09 -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), resolved Chronic left bundle branch block -Has had multiple episodes of NSVT noted on telemetry 3/19 - 3/20 -s/p ICD as above -Increased dose of Carvedilol to 25 mg BID with resolution of NSVT  History of nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LVEF 55% -Echo in 11/2019 demonstrated EF 42% (nadir). -TTE on admission showed recovered EF to 55%, mild concentric LVH, normal RV systolic function, no valvular abnormalities -Was initially started on aspirin/statin due to high suspicion for CAD, but as cardiac cath 3/15 was unremarkable, these medications were discontinued. -3/16 Successful single chamber ICD implantation Hypertension -Blood pressure now improved after restarting home lisinopril and initiating carvedilol -HCTZ discontinued as BP now well controlled on above regimen  RENAL Oliguria, resolved -Pt initially had low urine output since admission, improved to 0.5 cc/kg/hr on 3/9. Continue fluids with free water flushes through tube feeds -Has had normal electrolytes, renal function, and urine output since initial renal recovery. RESPIRATORY Acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to cardiac arrest, s/p mechanical ventilation, extubated 3/11 -Patient successfully extubated 3/11, stable respiratory status. Protecting airway well. -Encourage incentive spirometry HEMATOLOGY Acute normocytic anemia, improving -Pt had Hgb drop from baseline around 13-14 at admission to 10.9, now around 10-11. -Has iron saturation of 11%. Normal LDH/bilirubin, ruling out hemolysis. -Started oral iron supplements -Consider outpatient screening for colon cancer ENDOCRINE Osteoporosis - on alendronate at home Discharge Disposition Discharge to skilled nursing facility Active Issues Requiring Follow-up Cardiology -follow-up for AICD placement PCP -post hospital follow-up Test Results Pending at Discharge -none

                                                Pt returned to vaccine site today on 4/16/2021 for her second dose but wanted to speak with a provider prior to her second dose. Pt reports after her first dose of Moderna on 3/16/21 she went home after waiting for 30 minutes and noticed red lines by her nose when she got into her car but thought it was nothing and did not mention it to any staff members/providers. Per the patient, went to bed that night and her throat got tight and her tongue swelled up so she called her PCP and he advised her to take &#39;medication&#39; and she said symptoms improved. Pt notes for a few days she had to take these &#39;medications&#39; because her throat was still a bit tight. Pt denies ever going to the ER. Pt reports symptoms have resolved completely.   *I did not vaccinate this patient. This pt did not report any reactions while being monitored for 30 minutes by a provider on 3/16/21.   I am currently seeing regular office visits today and the patient asked to speak with a provider prior to her second dose she was scheduled to come have done today. This patient is brand new to me and new to clinic and has has never been seen before aside from getting her first Moderna vaccine here. I advised she cannot get her second dose of Moderna and she agreed. I also advised that she report the adverse reaction herself and she agreed. STRICT ER precautions were advised and pt was recommended to follow up with her PCP.  Pt verbalized understanding and agreed and her second dose of her Moderna COVID vaccine was cancelled and I wrote on her vaccine card she cannot receive her second dose due to anaphylaxis.

Since I was bleeding from the back of my head (behind ear) and disoriented, my husband called 911. EM personnel determined I was amnesic and needed medical care. I was taken to the emergency room. The 2.5 cm laceration on my head needed 8 staples to suture it. I spent two night at the hospital, had a series of lab tests and received X-ray chest, CT cervical spine, transthoracic echocardiogram and EEG. I suffered no broken bones.  This event occurred after I had received my second dose of the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine the day before.

                                                I woke up and 1/2 my mouth and my tongue felt numb and tingling as if I had Novocain and it was wearing off. Woke up the next day and it was still there so I called the NP. She said to go and get a CAT scan in the morning and it didn&#39;t show anything. Later in the afternoon I noticed I was dropping things and dragging my feet and got concerned it was a stroke so I drove down to a larger medical center and they did a contrast CAT scan and that showed nothing. So then they did an MRI and they found a clot. So they put me on Plavix, blood thinner and all that stuff. After a couple of days my hand and foot were fine but the numbness and tingling in my mouth is still there till now.  All of this wasn&#39;t real pronounced so I didn&#39;t think it was a stroke but it was. They sent me to a Neurologist and Cardiologist.

                                                Hospital HPI Patient is a 70 y.o. female with a PMH significant for bipolar disorder , anxiety/depression , fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, aortic stenosis status post TAVR x2 in 2001 and 2019, CAD, AFib on Eliquis, hx of CVA on ASA/plavix, HTN, DVT s/p IVC filter, chronic diastolic heart failure who initially presented to the hospital on 5/28 to SLW as a stroke alert with aphasia, confusion, repetitive speech.  Not a tPA candidate given she is on systemic anticoagulation with Eliquis for Afib.  Imaging negative for hemorrhage, ischemia, and large vessel occlusion.  Patient was admitted to the ICU, she remained confused, but alert.  The next morning, the patient was found to be unresponsive and have twitching to bilateral sides of the face and left gaze for preference.  Seizure was suspected.  Patient was given Depakote and Ativan.  Neurology was consulted.  Patient was started on Vimpat.  No significant improvement in her exam.  Patient was intubated for airway protection, and transferred to hospital  for continuous video EEG monitoring.   Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient was intubated and sedated on propofol at 40. Sedation was held the patient became agitated.  Would not open eyes spontaneously, but was moving all 4 extremities equally and pulling at restraints.  Patient purposeful, but not following commands.  Attempting to sit up in bed.  Patient was initiated on video EEG monitoring to rule out intermittent seizure activity and postictal state.  Repeat labs drawn and electrolytes repleted.  Patient hemodynamically stable.  Patient started on Precedex for sedation.   Patient&#39;s daughter was updated via the telephone.  Patient&#39;s daughter reports that she was recently started on baclofen for her hip pain.  Patient was given a prescription which she filled on 5/26 for 20 tabs of 20mg each.  Patient&#39;s daughter reports that it is possible she could have taken more than the prescribed dose in order to make her pain better faster.  Daughter states she does not think she took the whole bottle, but is unsure of how many she took.  Patient&#39;s daughter also reports that she drinks alcohol daily, 10 oz glasses of gin and vodka.&#34;   Hospital Course Brief ICU course:  Patient intubated for airway protection and transferred about plan for continuous video EEG monitoring.  EEG was negative for any seizure activity and patient&#39;s antiepileptics were stopped.  LP and MRI were negative for any etiology of encephalopathy and neurology signed off.  Patient&#39;s mental status was eventually improving and encephalopathy was thought to be secondary to polypharmacy.  Throughout course she had multiple extubations a re-intubation but finally has been extubated since 6/10 and on room air.  Course was also complicated by acute blood loss anemia secondary to left flank/abdominal wall hematoma status post empiric embolization of T8 and T9 intercostal arteries.  Initial planning to transfer out to floor on 06/11 however prior to leaving ICU patient had episode of SVT and was kept for further monitoring.  During this event her Coreg was uptitrated and her home metoprolol was added without any more recurrent tachyarrhythmias.   Transfer to the floors with SLFM team on 06/14.  Patient&#39;s mental status had returned back to baseline.  Unfortunately on morning of 6/15 patient had an episode of burning chest pain and tachycardic to 150.  Alerted and evaluated at bedside.  EKG at that time showed AFib with RVR in the 130s.  Troponins were obtained which were 0.04 then trended down to 0.03.  Cardiology was consulted.  Patient&#39;s heart rate eventually returned to normal on own and chest pain gradually resolved.  Patient should not be on 2 beta-blockers, per Cardiology Coreg was stopped and her metoprolol dose was increased.  Patient was continued on IV Lasix for 1 more dose on 06/16 then transition to p.o. Home dose 40 mg daily.  Patient remain observed on tele and arrhythmia free, stable, mental status at baseline.  On day of discharge, patient remains stable and looked well, wanting to go home.  Cardiology cleared patient for home.  PT/OT recommended home with PT services.  Case management involved for  services at home.  Plan to discharge with PCP and cardiology follow-up. Advised that her abdominal wall hematoma will slowly shrink and pain will improve appropriately.   ---When calling patient to follow up, she stated her symptoms started 4 days after vaccination with COVID vaccine. Symptoms also started day after she reportedly by daughter and patient only taking 2 doses of Baclofen to me today 6/24/21. She presented to ED on 5/28, received COVID vaccine 5/24, and took two doses of Baclofen 5/27.

                                                It is complicated because I also at the same time, had another infection. Which was a tick borne infection. This infection sent me to the hospital and that is why they were investigating further, so they noticed I had blood clots. I had a heart procedure at the hospital on June 10 2021 - a Tavr (aortic valve replacement). While I was there they gave me an injectable drug called Lovanox on the 10th and 11th. I was able to walk and do things when I went home, then I started to run a fever and went back to the hospital for 3-4 days for observation. At home I ran a fever again, I went back to the hospital and they ran tests. My platelets ran extremely low and then they did blood testing and saw I have something called HITT. HITT as I understand it is a condition where a Heparin injection attacks platelets and cause clots in the body. I still have the condition until those antibodies clear out of my body and I do not know if the vaccine of Moderna was a reasoning for this at all, but it is possible.

                                                Six weeks after my second Moderna shot, I had 10 days of a MenstruaL cycle, which I had not had for 22 years (since I  was 48).  Being 70 years old, I spoke to my doctor who was performing my colonoscopy when this occurred, and she and her nurses noted they had seen this in women over 60 recently who had the Moderna vaccine and I did bleed quite a bit from my vagina during the coloscopy; I also had bleeding hemorrhoid&#39;s which had re-engaged in bleeding about the same time.  While I am fine now, it was concerning to have a full period at age 70, and I am scheduled to go to a gynecologist this Wednesday.

                                                I work at  medical center where patient is being treated for a new diagnosis of Acute monocytic leukemia.  I was able to that the patient was vaccinated with Moderna vaccine on 1/16/2021, patient does not have the vaccination card with the Lot number so this is unknown at this time.  Here are the details I see in the chart. Patient arrived on   1/30/2021 at 2100, per History and physican patient has not been feeling well for about a week and a half, and had received the moderna vaccine approximately 2 weeks prior to this time.  Doctors note states about a week after first COVID vaccine she noted chest and back pain, dyspnea, high grade fevers and for this went to the ER on 1/28/21 and found to have anemia Hemoglobin 10 with normal LFTs.  She was thought to have a reaction to vaccination and sent home.  When her symptoms did not get better she went to ER again on 1/30 and found to have Hemoglobin down to 8 and marked LFTs elevation.  Pathology evaluated elevated WBC and showed monocytosis and possible blast cells and patient transferred for further workup.      per oncologist patient went to primary care about 6 months ago and had a normal CBC.   Patient was started on chemotherapy for diagnosis of  AML during this admission, as of 2/9/2021 patient remains inpatient, is intubated in ICU with prognosis unknown at this time.

The Doctors thought that it was pretty coincidental that my first stroke symptom (transient numb right hand on the 6th) started just a couple days after I got the second dose of the moderna vaccine.

                                                On March 6, I woke up feeling like I had a Charlie horse in my left calf. I tried to walk and it was sore but I felt it would go away in a day or two. By Wednesday, March 10, I called my doctor and after telling them my left calf hurt , they had me come right in. After seeing dr  I was sent to get a sonogram immediately  and was told I had a blood clot  inside my  left knee. I was sent back to Dr and was given Xerelto 15 mg twice a day for 21 days and the 20 mg once a day until gone.  Today,, it is still sore. I am asking if I should take my second shot on March 29 or not.

                                                On 1-27-21 my mother received her first dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (031L2A). The next day she felt something in the back of her left knee. The following day (2 days) after the injection she saw her primary care physician for the discomfort in the back of her knee. She was treated for what was believed to be a soft tissue injury. She received her second dose of the Moderna COVID-19 (14M20A) vaccine on Friday 2-26-21. The next day the back of her knee started to bother her again. She saw her doctor on Monday3-1-21 and had an x-ray. On Tuesday the doctor&#39;s office called and said her x-ray  was clear. Friday morning, 3-5-21 my father heard a loud noise (thud) and  found my mother unresponsive on the bathroom floor at approximately 8:30am. He called 911. She was transported to the hospital via ambulance. The emergency room physicians worked on her for over an hour and were unable to get her back. Her time of death was 10:12am. The primary cause of death listed on her death certificate is pulmonary embolism.

She was reportedly in her recliner for approximately 12-18 hrs prior to being brought in via EMS. In the ED her b/l LE extremity was cold to touch and mottled. Her toes were white and nail beds blue. No pulses were found on Doppler on either extremity. She was also noted to be in a.fib with RVR. Doppler of LE showed extensive occlusive thrombus. Bedside echo showed the RV severely dilated with mobile thrombus and EF 20-25%. Given these findings there is a very high probability of massive PE, however given current situation of AKI and instability CT was unable to be performed. She was given TPA and admitted to ICU. Pt was started heparin gtt, as well as levophed and dobutamine for obstructive and cardiogenic shock as her troponin, kidney function, lactate and liver function all were elevated.  Of note pt lives in a hoarding situation and lives a sedentary lifestyle and reportedly only gets up from recliner to use the bathroom. Pt also has a 96 pack year history but was noted in her medical chart  to have quit smoking in 2017.

I looked at the browser history in her cellphone and on the night of April 4, she googled &#34;Heart attack symptoms in women&#34; and &#34;Moderna vaccination side effects.&#34; I think she didn&#39;t go to the doctor because she figured her symptoms were related to her vaccine -- even though it had been a week.   I wanted to report her death because I don&#39;t trust her doctor to do it. It took him two weeks and a call from me to complain before he signed her death certificate. He listed April 9, 2021 as the official date of death because that&#39;s when she was found, even though the deputy coroner told me she died on either the 4th or the 5th.

She presented with right sided weakness, facial droop and slurred speech. LKWT 5/15/2021 at 0430. Patient reported going to bed around 2300 the night before and woke up at 0400 that morning with right sided weakness. Her daughter noticed slurred speech and right sided facial droop. Denied chest pain, HA, dizziness, no vision changes and no history of CVA. Stroke protocol was called. Teleneuro consulted and recommended a MRI. CT head was unremarkable. She takes ASA at home and received Plavix per neuro recommendations. Of note, patient tested positive for COVID but denied any respiratory symptoms and she has received her first COVID vaccination. Patient was admitted to the hospital for further treatment and evaluation for suspected CVA. Neurology consulted. Continued ASA, Plavix and Statin. Allowed for permissive HTN. Patient with history of Atrial fibrillation, currently normal sinus rhythm on telemetry. CHADS2VASC 3-would benefit from AC if no contraindication. Unsure why she has not been placed on AC and patient stated he only had one episode of Afib. Chest XR showed No acute cardiac pulmonary findings. Patient refused to have MRI brain due to anxiety. She stated that she attempted to have a MRI before and even with medication for anxiety she was not able to. Echo showed normal EF, mild MR, AR, TR, no PFO noted.CTA head and neck showed right vertebral artery ends in PICA, no acute abnormalities.  Labs noted B12 4,268 cholesterol 231 total, HDL 52, LDL 152, TAG 134, HbA1c 6.2, TSH WNL. Patient was out of the window for tPA. She was given a large dose of IV Ativan for anxiety. She continued to have elevated blood pressures with nausea that required IV labetalol to maintain blood pressure. HTN could likely be due to her significant anxiety. Cardiology planned to follow patient after discharge to discuss AC medication. Patient initially tested positive for COVID on 2/2/2021 and was able to take patient out of isolation.  Dx: CVA

                                                I was asleep and I woke up because I felt something sticky coming out of my nose. It started like water coming out of a faucet however it was blood. I went to the sink and it continued to pour. The next day I went to the ER. It would stop briefly but I could not breathe from the left side of my nose because it felt like a clot was forming. If I would touch it it would feel like the blood clot was forming again. At the ER is when this blood clot came out like pulling on a rubber band. The day after that I went into a specialist for these kinds of things. He said he could see the vessel and he was going to cauterized it.

I called my Dr. on 6/2/2021 because I started having symptoms of  Pneumonia, it&#39;s the first time I had pneumonia and it was very different from anything I had ever had.  I did not go into the office and I was prescribed Azithromycin and Prednisone.  The next 3 weeks were really bad with a unproductive cough, headaches and diarrhea off and on, nausea, body aches.  After 2 weeks I was sent to Urgent care to get a Covid test and then they sent me to the Emergency room. and they did an EKG, which showed  Pericarditis and chest pains.  that was 2 weeks ago and I was told to rest, I&#39;m still having chest pains, headaches and waiting to feel better. No Covid results reported because Urgent care thought ER was doing a test and ER did not do a test because Urgent care did, but Urgent care disposed of their test.  Still now well at all.

Went to the bathroom, urinated, took Tylenol and went back to bed. Woke again at 2:00 a.m, still chilled, and tried to stand up and my legs wouldn&#39;t hold me. I managed to lift myself to my feet and clutching furniture get to the bathroom, with complete loss of bladder control on the way. Took more Tyleonol, drank more water, put on clean pajamas but couldn&#39;t lift my knees to step into them, had to put them on the floor and pull them up. Went to sleep eventually. When I woke at about 5 a.m., all was completely normal. No fever, legs fine, usual bladder control.

                                                Blood clot on right lung; soreness in arm; A spontaneous report was received from  a 72 year old female patient who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and who experienced blood clot on right lung  (pulmonary embolism) and myalgia.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. The patient had family history of blood clot (mother and brother). No concomitant product use was reported.  On 02-Feb-2021, the patient received her first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 011M20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   The patient had soreness in the right arm which subsided couple of days later. The patient also experienced shortness of breath for a week after vaccine administration. On 17-Feb-2021, the patient went to the hospital and underwent COVID-19 virus test, the results of which were negative. On 17-Feb-2021, the computerized tomography scan on chest showed moderate size blood clot on right lung. On 18-Feb-2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital on recommendation to initiate and continue lifetime treatment with Eliquis (apixaban, 5mg every 12 hours). According to the physician, moderate size blood clot on right lung of the patient could be attributed to the genetic history (patient&#39;s mother and brother also had blood clot). The patient also followed up with primary care physician, who informed that it was genetic and not related to vaccine.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 was not reported.  The outcome of the events, pulmonary embolism was unknown. The outcome of the event, myalgia was considered as recovered/resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25-JAN-2021, 26 hours prior to the onset of events, the patient received her second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot#: unknown) intramuscularly for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 26-JAN-2021, the patient reported they have developed chills, fever, and muscle pain in the chest area. The reporter specified that it wasn&#39;t chest pain.  The patient took acetaminophen for the pain. On 27-JAN-2021, the patient reported her fever subsided but she was still having a little cough and chest pain.  On 28-JAN-2021, the patient had chest pain again during a nap and decided to call 911 because she was about to pass out. The patient was taken to the ER (emergency room) where an EKG (electrocardiogram) was performed. A few moments after the EKG, the patient had a heart attack. The cardiologist suspected the patient may have had a heart attack two days earlier because her cardiac enzymes were too high to be a result of a recent heart attack. The patient was admitted to the hospital from 28-JAN-2021 until 01-FEB-2021. Catheterization and stent placement were performed. Treatment medications included acetaminophen, clopidogrel, metoprolol, low-dose aspirin, and atorvastatin. At the time of this report, the patient was still feeling fatigued but other than that, she was feeling better.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcomes of the events, heart attack, cough, muscle pain in chest area, fever, chills, and chest pain, were resolved. The outcome of the event, fatigue, was not resolved.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Shortness of breath, cough onset Sunday April 4th.  DATE OF SERVICE: 04.06.2021   CT ANGIOGRAPHY, CHEST (CPT=71275); PULMONARY EMBOLUS PROTOCOL; 3-D RECONSTRUCTION  CLINICAL INDICATION: SOB (shortness of breath)  COMPARISON STUDY: 10/9/2020  TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the chest were performed during dynamic contrast enhancement for the  optimization of the opacification of the pulmonary arteries, following IV administration of 80 mL of  Isovue 370. Three-dimensional reformation into the coronal plane was performed.  Automated exposure control and ALARA manual techniques for patient specific dose reduction were  followed while maintaining the necessary diagnostic image quality.  ADVERSE REACTION: None  FINDINGS:  PULMONARY ARTERIES: There is a large filling defect within the right interlobar artery, extending  into the lobar, segmental, and subsegmental branches of the right lower lobe. There is expansion of  the right interlobar artery by this thrombus. Small filling defect is noted within the distal left  main pulmonary artery, with some extension to the left upper lobe and left lower lobe lobar  segments.  HEART AND VASCULATURE: The heart is normal size. No pericardial effusion. There is no evidence of  right heart strain.  MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  Heterogeneous densities are seen in the right lower lobe, new since the prior  exam. Scarring is noted in the superior segment of the right lower lobe as well as in the anterior  left lower lobe..  PLEURA: Small right pleural effusion.  CHEST WALL, LOWER NECK, AND AXILLA: Grossly unremarkable.  UPPER ABDOMEN: Grossly unremarkable.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are seen within the visualized spine.  IMPRESSION  1.  Bilateral PE, with extensive thrombus on the right and minimal thrombus on the left as detailed  above.  2.  Small right pleural effusion and heterogeneous right lower lobe consolidation, likely reflecting  pulmonary infarction.

The patient&#39;s husband states that &#34;crashed an hour and a half after she got the shot.&#34;  He defines this &#34;crash&#34; as decreased blood sugar, decreased responsiveness, and the seizures.  She presented to the Hospital for evaluation and was subsequently transferred to the Medical Center on April 4th for further workup. She was intubated on April 4th and subsequently self-extubated on April 8th. Nursing staff and documentation indicate that the patient has had no further seizures since her presentation to the medical center.  On April 14th she was found to have an acute lower extremity DVT. She was placed on a heparin drip and her platelet&#39;s dropped to 35. The heparin drip was discontinued, a HIT panel was ordered, and argatroban was started. Heamtology was consulted and the patient was found to have thrombotic thrombocytopenia. An MRI of the brain was ordered to rule out CNS thrombosis given recent seizures. The MRI has not been performed yet and the patient is still hospitalized.

                                                My mother received the vaccine on 4/17/21.  The following day she was bedridden.  Her condition did not improve over the next two days.  My wife and I were out of town and I was maintaining phone contact with her every few hours to monitor how she was feeling.  She expected she would feel bad for a few days...  On 4/21/21 she appeared to feel better in the morning when we spoke and she advised me she was going shopping with a friend.  Around 2pm on 4/21/21 I received a phone call from her friend advising she was taking my mother to the emergency room at the local hospital.  My mother was unable to answer basic questions and we believed she was suffering from a stroke.  The following day when I arrived back in the area I spoke to the neurologist on call who confirmed my mother did have a minor stroke but that it was in an area of her brain that should not effect cognitive functioning.  My mother was given a CT scan, brain MRI, spinal tap and an echocardiogram.  All of these tests came back &#34;normal&#34;.    My mother is still in the hospital and has shown no improvement.  She is agitated and confused.  She asks the same questions over and over again.  The neurologist has advised that they have no explanation as to why she is experiencing these symptoms.  The only thing that changed was her receiving the covid vaccine.

                                                The week of the injection I had headache, fatigue, and a constriction high in my chest if I breathed in deeply. The restriction in my chest continued past the first week but did not interfere with aerobic exercise even when it developed into an intermittent small cough. Seven weeks later, I felt very fatigued, sick. At urgent care, based on a chest x-ray, I was diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed an antibiotic. A week later, I returned to urgent care because I felt my lungs were not healed, and I was told that it had not been pneumonia after all. This was after a second x-ray which still showed fuzziness and cloudiness in my lungs. All lab tests were normal except for c-reactive protein, which was 43. I use an inhaler 2x a day (abuterol), which helps to open my bronchioles. I am still fatigued and must ration my activities each day to allow for hours of rest.

                                                Pt had an occipital stroke on the 13th of March. She lost half of her vision in both eyes. We went to the hospital after the eye doctor told her she had had a stroke. Eventually, after 4 trips to the hospital, 2 trips to rehab, we discovered the strokes apparently triggered non-convulsive seizures which they could never end up getting under control. She passed away on 31 May 2021.

She was subsequently found to have a pericardial effusion s/p pericardiocentesis and drain placement on 6/30. Fluid analysis was not indicative of bacterial pericarditis and blood&#43;pericardial fluid cultures are no growth (fluid 37% neutrophils, 54% monos, 5% lymphs, normal glucose. Reportedly 750 mL of straw colored fluid was removed during the pericardiocentesis. The pericardial drain was left in place. RPR is negative. Path report from 6/30 pericardial fluid indicated no malignant cells seen, &#34;by immunochemistry the epithelial cells are positive for cytokeratin 7, calretinin and WT-1, and negative for estrogen receptor, GATA-3, BerEP4, CDX-2, PAX-8, Claudin-4, TTF-1, p40, and keratin 20. Reactive mesothelial cells are favored.&#34; Unfortunately she did have subsequent reaccumulation of her pericardial fluid s/p redrain and growing Proteus on 7/8, now being treated as a suppurative pericarditis. Thought is that she did not initially present with bacterial infection, but subsequently developed Proteus infection  from drains and surgical exposures. No history of trauma nor immune disease.  She reports no history of imbedded ticks nor erythema migrans, but we are sending for Lyme serologies. We are also sending for galactomannan and enterovirus PCR.

On 12/28/20, woke up not able to breath, oxygen saturation 83%, could not walk across the room without gasping for air, which lasted for about 2 days.  Could not reach her PCP due to holidays, was convinced she had COVID.  Went to drive-thru facility and got the COVID test on 12/28/20, negative on 12/29/20.  Then made another APT, went back on 12/30/20 had negative test again.  On 12/30/20 started feeling better, was not great but her 02 SAT&#39;s were about 90.  Stayed that way until 1/8/21, had FU from lumpectomy with surgeon, when she got up her left ankle/foot were very swollen and red looking.  Saw that Dr., and discussed the postop business and showed her the foot/leg told her to have it looked at.  Her PCP was closed, she went to radiology Dept in Hospital and found DVT in her left leg.  She was then told to go to the ER and ordered a CT scan, which showed pulmonary emboli in both lungs.  Put on heparin IV right away, later transferred to another hospital where CV surgeon on staff.  By that evening they decided that she was walking , talking and checking blood levels, kept her overnight and sent her home the next day.  Needed to be on blood thinners, and saw pulmonologist.  Has APT with hematologist this week.  Pulm told her to call and report adverse reaction.   Today, 1/26/21 her 02 SAT&#39;s are in the 99%, leg is still swollen, and is able to breath better.  On Eliquis which will prevent new clots, but the others should be absorbed.  Got 2nd dose on 1/21/21 and had only the classic side-effects for about 30 hours but was then fine.  Had fever, chills, nausea, sore arm, cough, but then was fine.  Same lot # as dose 2.

                                                This is a 73 year old female that received her 1st dose with Moderna vaccine on 1/8/21 at approximately 1600.  Within one hour, the patient developed altered mental status and increasing weakness.  She was transported to the hospital by the staff at her Assisted Living Facility for concern of a vaccine reaction. On admission, oxygen saturation was found to be 89% on room air, BP=137/86, HR=94.  Labs were normal, with the exception of WBC=15 (leukocytes normal, chest xray clear, COVID test negative), and a detectable troponin=63.  Head CT negative.  Physical exam was only notable for &#39;slight superficial erythema over distal right forearm and dorsal hand. No significant edema.&#39; The patient was treated for a possible allergic reaction to vaccine with NS bolus, methylprednisolone 125mg, famotidine 20mg, and aspirin 300mg PR.  She was admitted for monitoring given continued altered mental status/weakness.  The next day, she continued to show no improvement, so a head MRI was ordered.  MRI showed &#34; 1. Numerous acute cerebral and cerebellar infarcts involving both anterior and posterior circulations consistent with a central embolic source. 2.  Minimal right parietal petechial hemorrhage. 3.  Moderate atrophy and moderate nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities compatible with chronic microvascular ischemia  &#34;  Neurology was consulted, who approved the start of aspirin and to continue DVT prophylaxis.  The patient&#39;s advanced dementia and timeline preclude other intervention.  The patient&#39;s status was DNR/DNI. The patient was discharged on hospice to her assisted living facility on 1/11/21 (with reports of continued somnolence).  It was reported that date of death was 1/24/21.

The patients&#39; medical history was not provided. No concomitant medications list was provided.   On 24 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of symptoms, patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number 011J20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID -19 infection.  On 25 Dec 2020, patient experienced shortness of breath with low oxygen saturation levels.   On 26 Dec 2020, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue.   On 27 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s energy was back to normal.   On 28 Dec 2020, the patient woke up in the morning with symptoms of almost could not breathe, could not walk across the room.  The patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation 83%.  The patient was struggling for every breath.  The patient tested negative for COVID-19.  On 30 Dec 2020, another COVID-19 test was negative.  On 31 Dec 2020, patient&#39;s vital signs included oxygen saturation closer to 90%, and she reported getting better. Symptoms remained the same for about a week.  On 08 Jan 2021, the patient experienced left ankle and foot swollen. The patient was seen by physician and then sent to emergency room where it was determined that the patient had DVT in the left leg. A computerized tomogram (CT) scan found clots in the left lung, or saddle PE.  On 09 Jan 2021, the patient was discharged from the hospital.  Treatment for the events experienced included intravenous heparin and blood thinners.   Action taken with planned second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not provided.  The event, extreme fatigue, was considered resolved on 27 Dec 2020. The outcome of the events, shortness of breath, slight fever, DVT and saddle PE were not provided.  Follow-up received on 19 Jan 2021 included updated events (DVT and saddle PE), updated event details, treatment, and hospitalization details.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This spontaneous report refers to a case of 73- year-old female patient who experienced serious event of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis and non-serious events of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue the next day after administration of the first dose of mRNA-1273, lot # 011J20A, expiration date-unknown. Based on temporal information provided and the known safety profile of the vaccine and the absence of any other etiology factors, a causal association between the vents of shortness of breath, oxygen saturation levels were down to 89% with slight fever and extreme fatigue and the administration of  mRNA-1273 vaccine cannot be excluded. Fever and fatigue are consistent with the known safety profile of mRNA-1273 vaccine.  There is no enough information t clinically assess the causal association between the events of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis as the patient&#39;s medical history and list of concomitant medications were lacking.

                                                Approximately 2 weeks after the first COVID vaccine she developed shortness of breath that was much more significant than she had previously. This was the first time she had expressed this symptom to me as being something she was concerned about and difficult for her to manage (we have spoken almost daily for many years). Within 24 hours of the second dose of the mRNA vaccine, they called an ambulance to get her and she was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.   The doctors said it was unrelated, but I found a study with a different vaccine (LAIV) that also seemed to increase the incidence of bacterial pneumonia. They hypothesized through diverting the immune system. So while I don&#39;t think the vaccine gave her the bacteria, I do think it may have caused her immune system to be temporarily compromised allowing the bacteria to grow out of control. I feel this is important to report to look for these types of patterns as perhaps it can help others avoid the death spiral that happened to my mother. There were also intervening events between her hospitalization and her death including two successful surgeries (one for a broken hip and another to put in stents in her leg). So to summarize, the first vaccine was within about 2 weeks of the onset of her breathing problems. Within 24 hours of the second vaccine she was hospitalized and diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. As she was battling bacterial pneumonia in the hospital she broke her hip and was found to have reduced peripheral circulation and had 2 surgeries to correct those. They were successful according to the surgeons, however she died within a week or so of the surgeries.  She had other comorbidities as well which I&#39;m sure predisposed her such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer for many years.

The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On 19 Jan 2021, approximately five days prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number not provided) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Jan 2021, the patient developed a cough. The patient&#39;s temperature was recorded at 101 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient went to doctor. She was fatigued and coughing blood and was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment included azithromycin, and the patient seemed to improve.  On 05 Feb 2021, the patient developed a temperature of 101°F, coughed up blood and was very fatigued. She was diagnosed with pneumonia. Treatment for the event included levofloxacin.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, pneumonia, was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset date of the event of pneumonia, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Patient&#39;s elderly age and medical history of COPD are considered a risk factors.

Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient&#39;s temperature is 100.2° F, heart rate 96, respiratory rate 24, saturating 84% on room air with blood pressure 164/84.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for BUN 17, CR 1.47, lactate 2.2, D-dimer 6.79, and phosphorus 2.2.  The patient&#39;s chest x-ray showed no acute findings.  CT chest showed extensive acute bilateral pulmonary emboli involving most of the lobar and segmental branches, right greater than left with no saddle embolus.  Findings borderline for right heart strain, correlate with echocardiogram.  Peripheral ground-glass airspace opacities consistent with atypical/viral pneumonitis.  Reactive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 93 with inferior infarct-age undetermined.  The patient was administered 1 L IV NS, ceftriaxone 1 g IV, azithromycin 500 mg IV, and heparin IV bolus and drip for PE indication. Remdesivir started.  2/28/21: Pt on 3 L oxygen. Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, remdesivir continued. Vancomycin started.  3/1/21: 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. Small, nonproductive cough. Pt complains of SOB.  3/2/21: 1/2 blood cultures from 2/27 positive for CoNS. Vancomycin discontinued. Pt feeling much better. Still on 1 L oxygen via nasal cannula. More alert.  3/3: 5 day remdesivir course and azithromycin, ceftriaxone course completed. Patient weaned off oxygen. Pt discharged home with oxygen as a precaution.

I figured I would report this, as I am seeing more and more reports about the vaccines tied to this rare brain blood clot:   &#34;Moderna?s rival mRNA shot has been linked to five CVST cases out of 4 million vaccinated.&#34; &#34;More than a dozen countries worldwide temporarily stopped administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID vaccine, notes the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), because of deaths from blood clotting disorders, with either clots or excessive bleeding. Some patients experienced the extremely rare event of clots in the veins that drain blood from the brain (venous sinus thrombosis).&#34;

Of note, patient received her second dose of the Moderna vaccine on 3/25/2021 and felt poorly the day after with body aches and fatigue. The patient was admitted to ED with suspected stroke, but no ischemia or hemorrhage was shown on MRI. In addition, her blood pressure at the ER was 196/104 and her troponin was elevated and reached a peak of around 5. Cardiac Catheterization showed no acute disease but chronic and unsubstantial changes that did not require intervention.  An EEG from 3/29 was concerning for subacute seizure like activity and She was started on IV Keppra. MRI at the same time, also revealed a right-sided cavernoma. During her hospital stay, she had ongoing confusion and disorientation with hallucinations, concerning for an encephalitis. She also received 3 days of ceftriaoxone for a potential unseen infection, but cultures were negative and PCR for viral pathogens was also normal. She was seen to have leukocytosis but the cause was not determined. Eventually, she regained her baseline mentation with no residual deficits and was discharged on Keppra to follow up with neurology.

                                                Ten days after I received the 2nd Moderna vaccination, I had a TIA stroke (double vision, right side of face and right became numb, slurred speech, could not walk).  I received a TPA shot within an hour an 15 minutes of the stroke.  I have no long term side effects from the stroke.  I will take blood thinners the rest of my life.

                                                The day before the first vaccine she was up and acting normal, laundry, housework and knew what to do.   She has severe dementia but was doing OK and knew where she was.  She got the first vaccine on 1/29/21, and the 3rd and 4th day they noticed she was having hallucinations and saying things that weren&#39;t there.  She could hear baby&#39;s crying but there were no baby&#39;s present.   Within 7 days she had what the son described as a stroke. He said that she was watching television and he was on a conference call and he noticed she walked into a wall and he asked if she was okay and starting stumbling across the room and when he touched her she felt very heavy and said that one side of her face was drooping.  He got her back into the chair and called 9-1-1.  She was so agitated at the hospital that the husband does not know what they gave her and they kept her for a week.    They finally got her under control.  They discharged her from there and she that was all that they could do with her.  They brought her home with nurses assistance and her paranoia was evident, hallucinations were very evident. They said that they tried to do a CAT Scan and an MRI and they said that she did not have a stroke.   Restless was very adamant, talking strange things and wanting to go to her son&#39;s house when she was there.  Before that vaccination she knew where she was and after that she did not know where she was thinking she was at one location and just confusion.     She then got her 2nd vaccine and then her husband went out of town and took her back home on 2/24/21 as he was able to get her in a car and travel and able to eat and knew somewhat what was going on.  On 2/25/21 when he brought her home to  a long term care facility.  She was chanting constantly, had irritability, anger, cognition completely eroded.  She was very agitated, very combative.  Drugs would not calm her down, and tried to get CAT scans or MRI&#39;s but were unsuccessful due to her combativeness.  She was screaming and yelling 24 hours a day to the top of her lungs and gave her Ativan which had the adverse effects of what they were supposed to do.  Had biting, hallucinations, paranoia.   She had a couple of falls, they had her in a wheelchair and tried to feed her and she would fall down.  They took her to the hospital a few times and she progressively got worse.  On 4/19/21 she shut down and quit eating, quit drinking, closed her eyes, and lasted a week like that and then she died on 4/24/21 @ 2:30 AM.   None of her doctors could figure out what had happened.  They were finally able to get a CAT scan and felt that she may have a stroke.      Finally they memory care facility told them to come a take her to the hospital and they had moved their hospice patient&#39;s as she was screaming and disruptive and they could not handle her anymore.     They thought she was suffering from Lewy body dementia at one point.  They were going to have her tested for that and they could not do it on Saturday when she passed for genetics and missed those timelines and could not do it.

Hospital course by dates 5/31?6/6/2021: Admitted for abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting thought to be secondary to ischemic colitis and severe constipation.  Patient was found to be anemic during that hospitalization, but did not require blood transfusion.  Patient&#39;s hospital course was complicated by aspiration pneumonia requiring PICC placement and norepinephrine.  She is no longer requiring supplemental oxygen was discharged home. 6/9: Return to hospital with increasing shortness of breath, confusion and generalized malaise.  Repeat TTE with anterior wall motion abnormalities and decreased EF.  Patient was transferred to bed for cardiology evaluation 6/10: Cardiac catheterization with moderate three-vessel coronary disease, wall motion abnormality does not correspond to coronary disease.  Cardiology thinks findings are related to stress-induced cardiomyopathy.  6/11: Patient continues have downtrending hemoglobin, started to prep for colonoscopy on 6/12. 6/12: Rapid response was called at at approximately 4:40 AM, patient ultimately expired at 7:35 AM   Patient was transferred from Hospital given new wall motion abnormalities and severe hypokinesis seen on repeat TTE.  Fortunately, cardiac catheterization on 6/10 without coronary artery disease that corresponded to these wall motion abnormalities.  Ultimately, it was thought to be stress induced cardiomyopathy.  Patient was improving, but still complained of epigastric discomfort.  Given her recent diagnosis of ischemic colitis and ongoing abdominal pain, GI was consulted for EGD/colonoscopy on 6/12   Rapid response was called at at approximately 4:40 AM.  They were mottled appearing, hypotensive and cool to touch.  Patient was found to be severely hypoglycemic and had wide-complex tachycardia.  Multiple amps of D50 were given but remained hypoglycemic. Patient was also found to be hypoxemic and did not tolerate BiPAP.  Eventually patient was transition to comfort measures only.  After discussion with patient&#39;s daughter, patient&#39;s last 10 minutes of life consisted of &#34;fluid pouring out of her mouth&#34;.   Work-up also was positive for elevated lactic acid and elevated D-dimer.  Given the abrupt change in patient&#39;s clinical status, concern for embolic thrombosis is the most likely cause.  Unclear if had pulmonary embolism or ischemia to gut.  Interestingly, patient was visiting her from Indiana for her brother&#39;s funeral.  After discussion with family, patient&#39;s brother had a similar unexplained death just a few weeks prior.  The Family going back to the fact that she had her second Maderna vaccine 3 days prior to presenting to select hospital.  Patient&#39;s brother also had a Maderna vaccine before his recent demise.   Given the unknown cause of death, an autopsy was discussed with family.  They were agreeable to this.  Highly concern for thrombotic event, but unable to confirm at this time without autopsy.  Unknown if recent vaccine was related to her death, but could explain thrombosis leading to ischemic colitis prompting her last admission.  Patient was noted to have a &#34;severe&#34; reaction to her first vaccine.

                                                I had the red swollen arm (injection site) - it was a little bit later  - about 10 days after the vaccine. It kept getting bigger. It looked like a really bad mosquito bite that got huge. It was itchy Body aches and fatigue and headaches showed up about that time, too. Those symptoms lasted to the end of March and early April.  March 17 I blew out my knee - my right knee. I ended up getting x-rays before I came to him. He called and said to go see an orthopedic surgeon and that wasn&#39;t until later on. I did see the Orthopedic Surgeon on April 8th. He injected my knee with steroids that day and took x-rays at his location. He also gave me Tylenol. Before I got to see him, March 30th - I had a TIA - Stroke. I was home alone and I called my husband and doctor (but he didn&#39;t call back right away so it was about 4 hours) and he said I needed to go to ER - Hospital ER. The treatment was cholesterol medication and referrals to cardiologists or neurologist and also an Ophthalmologist. I did see orthopedic surgeon again, again and again. I went back to Primary care doctor, too. I saw cardiologist first - April 22, 2021. I was sent to Nutritionist - on Friday, May 28th - no treatment - she said I was doing well with diet and nutrition and she would see me in 6 months. Eye exam - on June 1st - going through more tests for that - something to do with the back of the eye. June 2nd - I saw the neurologist - that was for a consultation to go over all the results from the other tests. He said there was that had happened and that nothing was very conclusive and said I should just go on with my life. In the hospital when I was admitted for my TIA - stroke - they saw that I had a thyroid issue - and so I went to thyroid doctor June 2nd. - they added - Atorvastatin and Amlodipine.  I had surgery for the loop monitor for my chest on June 9th. Also there is a New nodule on my thyroid - big enough to Biopsy - on my Thyroid. On June 15th - I got the Shingrix vaccine - same arm as COVID vaccine - wild reaction from that within 24 hours that did go away the 2nd day. It was a full body flare - similar to COVID vaccine reactions but it went away quicker. I started a new medication for me called Rinvoq  - for the Rheumatoid Arthritis  - this replaces the Xeljanz that I had been taking. My balance is off still and I&#39;m using a cane and I wasn&#39;t doing that before - possibly for my knee being weak. I&#39;m getting ready for a knee replacement eventually. Since 10 years ago, I&#39;m compromised on the right side - that is my Lymphedema side - hence all my vaccines, etc are on the left side. Otherwise, I&#39;m feeling well now at this point.

I had a slight fever on Saturday night (the night after). It was gone the next day. Then  vaginal bleeding started on the date marked on this report in April. I went to the Clinic. I was fine after taking the Nitro Furatoin. I had another bleeding episode - approximately a month later I went to ER at hospital - May 25, I think. Bleeding has stopped - it wasn&#39;t continuous. Have had several doctor visits.

I was transported that evening to the stroke  division that same evening for further evaluation, tests and care.  I have never had a mini stroke before this.The doctors said it may have been from the vaccination, or it may not have been precipitated by it.  They said they don&#39;t have enough information on the Moderna vaccine to make that call.

                                                Typical expected side effects but were very SEVERE and UNable to function normally- headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, Dizziness, Chills, Cold Sweats, Pain and soreness especially in lower back, and throat hurt when swallow.  These persisted for 7&#43; days.  The abnormal side effects included Yellow Vision that persisted for around 2 days, eyes felt hot, and heart rate shot up to 175 and then would drop to 70&#39;s.  Went to doctor on 1/14/2021 and was found to have A-fib.  had previously received a heart evaluation in 8/2020 and did not show any signs of this nor any signs on reading prior with an Apple watch.  A-Fib is persisting and heart rate continues to be elevated and shoot up often even with Metapropol.  As of this report on 1/20/2021 the heart rate is still varying from 80-150 and it normally runs around 50-60, has always been low.  Blood pressure also dropped precipitously during this event and was as low as 80/50 so blood pressure medicines were discontinued to try and stabilize.

                                                74 yo woman living in a group home for people with developmental disabilities. She has longstanding difficult-to-control seizure disorder, on valproate, lamotrigine, and levetiracetam. She had asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in November 2020, probably discovered in the course of surveillance testing of residents/staff, perhaps in relation to an outbreak in the residence.  Sometime during the night following her vaccination earlier that morning, she developed a fever, and then was found to be having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Estimates of duration in the records range from 20 to 40 minutes. She was brought by ambulance to Hospital ED, and then admitted. Her temperature was said to be 103 F.  She received midazolam, and at least one dose of IV antibiotics. By the evening of admission on 5 February 2021, she was still unresponsive.  On arrival, her COVID-19 PCR was again/still positive. She had no prodromal symptoms suggesting COVID-19 reinfection, nor did anyone in the group home, staff or residents.  Her initial WBC was normal but with a slight left shift. UA was normal. Head CT showed her known cerebral atrophy and chronic microvascular disease.  Admitting valproate serum level was subtherapeutic; levatiracetam and lamotrigine levels were therapeutic.  Blood cultures are no growth at 2 days. Urine culture negative.  By hospital day 2, her transaminases had bumped to over 1000.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer, concerning herself, a 74-year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced medically important event of atrial fibrillation.  The patient&#39;s medical history included heart surgery on an unspecified date in 2017. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05 FEB 2021, prior to the onset of event, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (batch number: 015L20A) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On an unspecified date in FEB 2021, the patient experienced fast heart rate, felt weakness, dizziness, and had atrial fibrillation. No treatment medication information was provided.  Action taken with second dose of mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, atrial fibrillation was not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on current information the event was assessed as unlikely related to mRNA-1273 vaccine, because of biological implausibility, no clear temporal association, and the patient&#39;s history of heart surgery which may promote atrial fibrillation episodes.

She was noted to be in atrial fibrillation with RVR and EKG showed no acute ischemic findings.  Troponin is negative, BNP elevated in the setting of known congestive heart failure with a EF in the 20 to 30% range. She received tylenol for fever, metoprolol x3 with adequate rate control achieved.  Fever likely r/t to immune response generated by COVID-19 vaccine which she received earlier that day, normal white count, no infiltrate on CXR, lactate normal, blood culture x2 pending. She was given Lasix 40 mg. Patient admitted for further diuresis and rate control.

                                                22 hours after vaccination and one hour after taking morning pills, patient developed full body rash and itching.  Morning meds she consumed were: Losartan, amlodipine, pravastatin, escitalopram, baby aspirin, vitamin D3.  Episode of rash and itching improved with oral Benadryl 50 mg.  The next day patient took her meds same time and one hour later developed rash.  Took Benadryl and rash resolved.  Patient then stopped medications for 1 week and had no occurrences of rash.  Restarted medications morning of 3/10/21 and developed full body rash with itching and early anaphylaxis, one hour after medication consumed.  It should be noted, patient has been on these medications for several years without reaction.  Reaction started after she had received the Moderna COVID19 vaccination.  On 3/10/21 when she had full body rash with anaphylaxis, patient presented to our clinic and was given 2 rounds of IM epinephrine, IM Benadryl 50 mg, IM Solu-Medrol 125 mg, and oral Zyrtec.  Episode took 2.5 hours to resolve.  Patient prescribed tapering course of prednisone, Zyrtec once daily, famotidine 20 mg once daily for the next 7 days, outpatient.  We will be restarting one medication at a time to assess for medication reaction.

                                                Patient is a lovely 74-year-old female with a long history of PACs and hypertension.  Her blood pressure has been getting a little bit worse over the past years.  She was admitted through the ER with 1st known episode of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She reports that on 02/02 she received her 2nd COVID vaccine.  She had joint achiness and a low-grade temperature.  She rested the following day but then on 02/04 went for her usual hour long runs/hike.  She did not feel very well during exercise and started have a headache and some increasing palpitations.  Later that evening she was watching TV and started to have significant tachycardia that was irregular. Symptoms persisted and she presented to the ER which sound to be in AFib with rapid ventricular response with a blood pressure of 215/158. She was started on a diltiazem drip and has converted to sinus rhythm with PACs.  Blood pressure has improved significantly.  Troponin negative x2.   Her last evaluation at a Heart facility was  in 2017.  She had an echocardiogram in 2014 with normal EF, mild MR and mild TR with normal estimated PA systolic pressure.   She denies chest pain or dyspnea.  No history of syncope.  Sometimes with palpitation she does get lightheaded.  She gets occasional lower extremity edema that seems dependent in nature.  She is still having palpitations but recognizes that she is no longer in atrial fibrillation as that was more severe in terms of symptoms of tachycardia.

                                                Internal brain bleeding; Bad headaaches; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer concerning a 74-year-old, elderly female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced bad headaches/headache and internal brain bleeding/cerebral haemorrhage.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. Past medication included unspecified blood thinner. Concomitant product use was not provided by the reporter.  On an unspecified date, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number unknown) via unknown route for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis. On 18 Feb 2021, prior to the onset of events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot number unknown) via unknown route for COVID-19 infection prophylaxis.  On an unspecified date, after second dose of vaccine, the patient bad headaches due to which patient had an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) which showed internal brain bleeding. The event led to hospitalization. She had been in and out of the hospital two more times before since getting a shot. No treatment medication was reported.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events, bad headaches and internal brain bleeding was not resolved at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of these events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                26 hours after the second vaccine shot, my heart rate shot up to 165 beats per minute and did not decrease.  After an hour I was admitted to the Emergency Room and  where I spent five hours in the ER receiving intervenous medications to bring my heart back back to normal.  They diagnosed my condition as &#34;atrial fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response&#34;.  I was admitted to the hospital and kept overnight before being discharged at 5:00 pm on 3/6/2021.  Sunday  morning 3/7/21 I was back in the Emergency Room at  Hospital, again with a heart rate of 165 beats per minute, where I was again treated to Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and discharged 3 hours later.   Again, on Tuesday afternoon, 3/9/2021 I was again back in the emergency room at  Hospital with a heart rate of 165 beats per minute and again treated for atrial fibrillation.  later that evening I was transported to  where I was hospitailzed for 2 days before being discharged with additional medications to control the Atrial Fibillation.  For the next week I continued to have minor bouts of higher than normal heart rate, but found the new medications were controlling the condition.

Three to four hours after the injection, the right side of her tongue began to swell and eventually swelled to the roof of her mouth. This made swallowing difficult, but breathing was OK.  Swelling persisted until 4/8 - it began to diminish and then she experienced right jaw and neck soreness along with a tender lymph node. On Monday, 4/12, she had an appointment for a regular physical with her doctor. She mentioned this experience to him and he strongly urged her not to get the second shot because this was anaphylaxis and she would likely die . Today, she is feeling pretty normal.

                                                Unknown onset of adverse events.  PT received second COVID vaccine on 3/26/21.  She was found deceased in her residence (where she lives alone) by family on 3/28/21.  She was found in bed, appropriately covered with blankets.  Son last spoke with PT around 17:30 hours on 3/26 after receiving the vaccine, and reported the PT did not complain of any symptoms, did not sound short of breath, and did not complain of any breathing difficulty.  Based on postmortem presentation, believed PT died late night of 3/26/early morning of 3/27.  Suspect death is likely due to PT&#39;s heart disease, Medical Examiner agreed with the assessment.I spoke with the clinic that administered the second dose, and was informed that the PT did not exhibit any signs/symptoms during the observation period immediately following the vaccine being given.  PT&#39;s PCP was contacted, and agreed to certify DC based on known medical history.  PCP also agreed that the death did not sound related to the vaccine based on lack of symptoms as reported by the administering clinic and family.

Pt is AAOx4 upon arrival, speech mildly delayed. VSS at this time. Pt reports drinking a bottle of liquor everyday and states a PMH of alcohol withdraw. Progress note from 3/25/21: Neurological examination at this time continues stable. Patient underwent DSA yesterday with findings of left frontal lobe cortical vein thrombosis with hemorrhagic conversion. Documented that given timing of events, a consideration should be given to possible COVID vaccine related thrombosis and may advise against second dose of vaccine. EEG with no evidence of epileptiform discharges. Continues with intermittent word finding difficulties/confusion, but continues following all commands consistently. Possible that some component is also related to longstanding ETOH abuse? Pending discussion of findings with NES, apparently patient was reported to have episodes of irregular heartbeat during DSA?

My throat tightened down slightly.  It eased back and then about 1 1/4 hour to 1 1/2 hour it happened again.  It went from my face, through my neck, both arms and midway down my chest.  It was stronger.  My throat again tightened down.  Both times the sensation lasted for about 15 minutes.  The throat tightening was less than I have experienced with hives attacks.

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 75-year-old female with a past medical history significant for COPD chronically on 2 L of oxygen, hypertension, type 2 diabetes which is diet controlled and oral Metformin controlled, hyperlipidemia, GERD, anemia, past history of PE and DVT diagnosed in January 2021 following COVID-19 infection currently on Eliquis compliant twice daily and kidney stone history who presented with worsening exertional chest tightness and shortness of breath as well as nausea for the past 2 weeks.  Patient reported she got to the point that she was hardly able to walk due to her exertional shortness of breath and chest tightness and needed to be evaluated.  She also reported some nausea as well as some headaches that have come on around a similar timeframe.  She also reported some poor dentition and mild dental pain and has been having a difficult time getting into a dentist due to her Medicaid and lack of coverage.  She has a history of hospitalization from January 30 to February 25 for sepsis secondary to healthcare associated pneumonia and UTI and at that time was treated with vancomycin, azithromycin and cefepime during that hospitalization she was noted to have a new onset left peroneal vein DVT and peripheral PE which was thought secondary to possibly her past history of Covid infection from December 28, 2020.  She was placed on Eliquis twice a day.  During her lengthy hospital from January 30 to February 25 she had bacteremia with Enterococcus and echocardiogram showed a possible pacemaker lead vegetation and therefore her pacemaker was removed on February 12 and she was discharged to rehab for 6 weeks of ampicillin and ceftriaxone which was completed on March 23, 2021.  She was then ultimately discharged home.  She had follow-up with cardiology who felt that she no longer needed to have a pacemaker and it was therefore left out.  She reports she was doing well up until about 2 weeks ago when she began to have the shortness of breath.  She received her COVID-19 vaccines on 3/18 and 4/16.  She reported after the 2nd one on4/16 she was ill with significant fatigue and fever and malaise.  She reports she completely recovered from that but again began having shortness of breath and exertional chest pain 2 weeks ago which prompted her current admission.  She was subsequently admitted to the hospital and ultimately underwent a CTA of the chest when her D-dimer was noted to be elevated at 1800.  CTA of the chest revealed a new left lower lobe pulmonary artery emboli with right heart strain.  She subsequently underwent an echocardiogram which did not reveal any evidence of acute heart strain.  She had a CT venogram of the head and subsequent MRI of the brain which revealed no cavernous vein thrombosis and no acute abnormality other than possible mastoiditis which may be chronic.  The case was reviewed with hematology and her Eliquis was discontinued and she was placed on Lovenox injections twice daily.  She was educated on administering these injections herself.  She will be following up with hematology as an outpatient for close monitoring.  She was also placed on an antibiotic for her dental caries and the mastoiditis as she did complain of the nausea and persistent headache and we arranged dental follow up on dc.  At this time she is felt stable for discharge to home.  She remains with some shortness of breath above her usual baseline but feels that it is getting better each day.  Her O2 sat is 95% on her usual 2 L of oxygen.    Reason for report:new PE of the left lower lobe -radiologist  who reviewed past cta chest from jan and reports that that old small pe is gone and this is a new much larger PE in a different location Sx&#39;s started and worsening the last few weeks pta She has been compliant with her eliquiss twice a day Venous dopplers neg and previous dvt of the L peroneal vein seen 1/30/21 and re imaged on 2/21/21 was also noted to be gone Pt had her 2nd covid 19 vaccine just last month 4/16/21 Current echo shows no R heart strain and nl ef  started on lovenox bid per hematology beta 2 glycoprotein IgG and IgM, antiphospholipid ab&#39;s are negative

                                                May 18 I received my first Covid Moderna Vaccination.  4 hours later when I went to urinate there was blood on the toilet paper. It only lasted about 3-4 minutes.  2 hours after that I went to the bathroom again to urinate and it burned really bad.  I called my doctor and was able to see her the next morning ( May 19)  She sent my urine in for a culture and it came back as a Urinary Tract Infection. She treated me with Cipro for 3 days. She felt that I should see my GYN regarding the bleeding and felt that it is Post Menopausal Bleeding. I saw my GYN on June 7. She did a Pap Smear and it came back normal but it showed that I have a Bacterial Vaginitis infection and treated me with Metronidazole Vaginal Gel for 5 days. Today June 14 is my last day for that. But when I went to the bathroom to urinate there was some blood again on the toilet paper. I don&#39;t know if all this is a coincidence or if this is a reaction to the vaccination. My doctor doesn&#39;t think it is a reaction but I want to make sure since I was fine till I was vaccinated. I am concerned because I had no sign of the bleeding or the burning before I got the vaccination. I am also concerned because my next vaccination is tomorrow June 15. If I don&#39;t get the second one then is the 1st one not going to be valid. If I do get the second one could I have a worse problem with bleeding and UTI? Due to the bleeding I have to have a vaginal ultrasound and depending on the results I might have to have an endometrial biopsy.

The patient&#39;s medical history, as provided by the reporter included urinary tract infection (UTI).Medications included levofloxacin and nitrofurantoin to treat urinary tract infection.  On 19 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: 010M20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 16 Feb 2021, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch Number: 013L20A) intramuscularly in the left arm for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 05 Mar 2021, the patient took levofloxacin 500mg to treat urinary tract infection (UTI). Soon thereafter patient had a severe allergic reaction to levofloxacin.   Treatment included Emergency Room drug-induced anaphylaxis treatment.Later Patient took nitrofurantoin for 5 days for the UTI and developed events sluggish, and light-headed hives,felt awful and difficult breathing.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events was not applicable.   The outcome of the event, allergy (anaphylaxis) to levofloxacin was resolved on 05 Mar 2021. The outcome of the event, hives, difficult breathing, felt awful, sluggish, and light-headed, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 75 Y/O F who had NS unexpected urinary tract infection and serious unexpected anaphylactic reaction with NS unexpected urticaria, dyspnea, dizziness, feeling abnormal, sluggish.  Anaphylaxis on Day 18 after first dose mRNA-1273 was considered possibly related to levofloxacin for UTI. Anaphylaxis resolved. Based on current available information and temporal association between use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

At the time of the report, PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis), INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere), BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion), INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease) and CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) had not resolved and MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): On 27-Jan-2021, Computerised tomogram: no sign change (Inconclusive) stable findings of pulmonary fibrosis/chronic interstitial lung disease. On 27-Jan-2021, Oxygen saturation: 99 % (normal) 99 room air. On 27-Jan-2021, Pulmonary function test: abnormal (abnormal) moderate reduction in diffusion capacity; forced vital, total lung, and diffusion capacities diminished. On 03-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 95 % (normal) room air. On 04-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) no PE, dramatic worsening of diffuse infiltrates much c/w UIP pattern; bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced. On 05-Mar-2021, Oxygen saturation: 80 % (abnormal) 94 at rest, 80 when ambulating, then 96 when ambulating with O2. On 08-Mar-2021, Echocardiogram: abnormal (abnormal) EF 60-65%, RVSP moderately elevated- 45 mmHg, mild MV regurgitation. On 21-Mar-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) low lung volumes with reticular opacities both lungs-uncertain if acute pneumonia or chronic fibrotic chnage. On 22-Mar-2021, Computerised tomogram: abnormal (abnormal) increased small pleural effusion and evidence of ischemic cardiomyopathy; overall fibrosis increased. On 23-Mar-2021, Bronchoscopy: abnormal (abnormal) neutrophilic lavage with negative cultures. On 09-Apr-2021, Oxygen saturation: 78 % (Low) 78% Room air 88% on 4L/min O2; 91% on 8L/min. On 14-Apr-2021, Chest X-ray: abnormal (abnormal) diffuse interstitial infiltrates, no pleural effusion.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter considered INFLAMMATION (possibility of an acute inflammatory response to her COVID-19 vaccination) to be possibly related. No further causality assessments were provided for PULMONARY FIBROSIS (pulmonary fibrosis), INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE (interstitial lung disease with progressive fibrotic phenotype in diseases classified elsewhere), BRONCHIECTASIS (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced), ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE (acute respiratory failure with hypoxia/dyspnea on exertion), RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (restrictive lung disease), CONDITION AGGRAVATED (CT scan 04 Mar 2021 showed bronchiectasis in lower lobes more pronounced) and MUSCLE SPASMS (diffuse cramping/leg cramps).    Patient was seen by physician (MD) (the reporter, a pulmonary specialist) on 27 Jan 2021 with complaint of short of breath with heavy exertion; was chronically breathless going up stairs.  Her pulmonary physiology had been relatively stable over last couple of years.  Impression: Appeared to have worsening restrictive physiology (also reported as slight worsening) in the setting of stable pulmonary fibrosis on imaging.  Then, on 04 Mar 2021, the patient presented with worsened breathlessness of rather acute onset, starting approximately 24 Feb 2021.  Repeat CT scan showed no pulmonary embolism but showed dramatic worsening of her pulmonary parenchyma and then findings suggesting exacerbation of underlying IPF like picture.  The was also a significant change in spirometry.  She was placed on large dose prednisone with transient stabilization but then presented to the emergency room on 21 Mar 2021 very breathless.  No obvious infectious like picture.  She was treated with high-dose corticosteroids.  One more CT scan showed continued abnormalities with again increased ground-glass opacification.  She showed desaturation with limited activity.  The patient was hospitalized for 7 days, then discharged to inpatient rehab for 10 days on prednisone 60 mg.  She improved slightly and was discharged home on 6L of O2 with exertion and 4L at rest.  On 14 Apr 2021, the patient saw MD for follow-up at which time she was breathless with any significant activities and had difficulty getting around.  She was approved for nintedanib therapy for progressive pulmonary fibrosis.  Assessment included acute on chronic respiratory failure with hypoxia.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Very limited information regarding these events has been provided at this time. The events are probably related to the patient&#39;s comorbidities.

                                                3/4, admitted day after covid vaccine with SIRS. Patient presented to ED with fever/chills, weakness, and malaise on the morning of presentation, such that her son who is her caretaker could not get her up off the toilet on several occasions.  Patient had received the second of her Moderna Covid vaccinations the day prior and after workup in the ER and an observation stay, it is most likely that her presentation was a SIRS-type reaction to her vaccine.  She does have a resolving left arm cellulitis that her PCP has been managing and documenting improvement with and she was kept on antibiotics this stay, consistent with her outpatient treatment plan. She&#39;ll discharge home and cont to see her PCP for her left arm and chronic issues.

                                                Pt presented to acute care on 5/21/21 following 2 weeks of SOB, intermittent low grade fever and fatigue.  Labs and chest XR ordered.  Diagnosed with UTI and placed on Omnicef 300 mg BID x 7 days.    Follow up in clinic on 5/24/21 for continuation of symptoms:  SOB, intermittent low grade fever/chills, dry cough.   Pt prescribed albuterol and labs ordered.  Follow up in clinic on 5/26/21 for ongoing SOB, intermittent low grade fever, dry cough, anemia, abnormal liver function.  Ordered ECG 12 lead and sent to emergency department.  Admitted to hospital 5/26/21 :  During hospitalization patient was diuresed with Bumex, she put out a net of approximately 2.4 L and then developed an AKI suggestive of intravascular depletion.  Diuretics were stopped, confirmed that BNP down trended and was within normal range. Patient had negative troponins throughout hospitalization.  Her free T4 and TSH was within normal limits.  She had mild electrolyte disturbances secondary to diuretics which were replaced.  She had a respiratory viral panel completed, did not identify any source.  Patient is Covid negative.  ANA and ANCA screen were sent out unfortunately they will be delayed.  #SVT: Patient went into an SVT rate of 150 required adenosine which showed underlying sinus rhythm.  Started on amiodarone drip briefly which did help maintain sinus rhythm although she had hypotension with that.  Cardiology was consulted during hospitalization.  Despite SVT troponins remain negative.  TSH and free T4 within normal limits.  #Acute on chronic combined systolic and diastolic heart failure #Suspected viral cardiomyopathy #Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Patient remains with good saturation off oxygen.  She is net -2.0 L from diuresis.  Weight is down approximately 4.4 kg.  Started on metoprolol, unfortunately due to hypotension had to decrease the dose to 25 mg daily.  Aspirin 81 mg daily was provided.  Currently holding diuretics but may need to be reassessed for restarting this in the future.  ANA and ANCA pending.  #Leukocytosis #Increase inflammatory markers #Sepsis with organ dysfunction No clear-cut source of infection but she did have pyuria with leukocyte esterase.  She could also have had atypical pneumonia.  The concern is that patient could have an underlying inflammatory process versus autoimmune process contributing to it end organ damage.  At this point I cannot tell so started empiric treatment with ceftriaxone during hospitalization, complete 5 of 7 days course as well as 3 of 3 days of azithromycin.  Despite this leukocyte continues to be elevated and inflammatory markers continue to be elevated.  #Hypertension: Patient was briefly hypotensive in setting of amiodarone, metoprolol continue to 25 mg after discontinuation of amiodarone.  Will need to be retitrate to goal-directed therapy.  #Hypothyroid: TSH and free T4 within normal limits given the tachycardia holding levothyroxine for 5 days  #Suspected UTI Day 5 of 7 of ceftriaxone currently, initially had 50?100 WBCs positive for pyuria, leukocyte esterase positive no bacteria seen.  #Atypical pneumonia suspected: Completed 3 days of azithromycin  #Elevated LFTs #Elevated alk phos: Unclear as to potential source other than congestive hepatopathy LFTs normalized alk phos downtrending  #Anemia of chronic disease: Possible viral syndrome unclear etiology at this point.  There may be some underlying iron deficiency.  No indication for transfusion during this hospitalization. Patient remained on sodium restricted 2 g daily, and 2 L of fluid restriction diet.  She is a full code and enoxaparin was used for DVT prophylaxis. Hospital transfer today, 6/2/2021 to St. Michaels with no clear unifying diagnosis.  Maybe a pericarditis:  Patient continues to have ST changes on EKG, elevated inflammatory markers, significant JVD, evidence of heart failure on echocardiogram, after speaking with cardiology will likely need a right heart cath
