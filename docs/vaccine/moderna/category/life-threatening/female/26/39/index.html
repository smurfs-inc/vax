No appetite. Struggled to read and process things. Could not work. Sharp pains in lymph nodes at various times throughout the day. Chest felt very tight and arm hurt to the point I thought I might be having a heart attack. Had trouble sleeping due to lymph node pain. Ibuprofen did not help. The arm pain at injection site was annoying but I barely noticed it due to my other symptoms.

                                                The Patient has an anaphylactic history to an oral pain medication she didn&#39;t know the name of, food allergies, and to the flu vaccine (with eggs). She has gotten the flu shot without eggs and been fine. The administering RN asked the med led to further assess. We discussed that she is at a higher risk for anaphylaxis than most people given her allergy history. She said that she was not Allergic to any component of the covid 19 vaccine when shown the list, and this was double checked. We discussed that if she gets the vaccine and has a reaction, she will need emergency room treatment and that she may want to consider being vaccinated at a hospital where they have more resources. However, given she did have known anaphylaxis to a component of the vaccine we will give it to her if she so chooses. It was explained that if she gets the vaccine, we will monitor her for 45 minutes, and if she has a reaction, she will be treated and sent to the E.R. She verbalized consenting to getting the vaccine after being thoroughly educated.  She was vaccinated at 1337 with 0.5 ml of Moderna Vaccine in the left deltoid. I was not present upon the administration. I was informed shortly after administration that she had cold sweaty palms and felt a little lightheaded. She was placed in a wheelchair and taken to a private observation tent to be further assessed. Initially in the tent she was not showing alarming signs of anaphylaxis and appeared stable. She had clear lung sounds and her oxygen level was 99% with no respiratory distress or airway compromise. At 1405 she felt her lips and throat get tingly and slightly bigger, although upon assessment they did not appear swollen. She was fasting and refused to swallow water or Benadryl when offered. She was able to swallow her spit with no issues. We explained to her that we are going to keep monitoring her, but if things change at all we are going to have to call 911 and administer epinephrine. She kept saying she is fine and that she did not want it and that her boyfriend would take her home. Currently her VS were BP 94/70, HR 72, O2 99%, RR 22. She was rubbing her back and her lungs were clear.  At 1410 her bp was 90/62, HR 74, o2 98% and RR 24. Again, she was rubbing her back. Her lungs sounded clear. At 1415 her BP was 84/60, HR 80, O2 93%, and RR rate of 30. She had small expiratory wheezes when listening to her breath sounds. She appeared to be in respiratory distress as she was coughing and rubbing her chest. She stated her chest felt back, neck, and chest felt tight. She still stated she was fine, and she did not have insurance. She was informed that this was a life-threatening emergency  At this time 911 was called as it was determined she was having an anaphylactic reaction needing epinephrine. Her Emergency contact was notified as he was on the phone with her. At 1417 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered into the left deltoid, which is where I was informed, she had received the vaccine. At 1420 her VS read 118/74, HR 122, O2 99%. Her respiratory distress appeared to be improving, and her VS improving. She stated she felt better, and she wanted to go home, but per policy she was taken to EMS in a wheelchair. She was handed off to EMS around 225 and verbal report was given. She was transferred to her emergency contact was present for transfer and filled in of the events.

                                                Approx 4AM 6/19/21 is when I noticed I was experiencing vaginal bleeding beyond what I had ever experienced before. I was not due for a menstrual cycle. Between 4AM and 10AM I went through 3 overnight sanitary pads. Over the course of the rest of the day I went through 8 regular pads, soaking them through with blood. I contemplated going to the ER. The blood was excessive and bright red, freely flowing and passing clots larger than a dollar coin. The bleeding finally slowed around 36hr after it began. I used ibuprofen beginning the evening of 6/19/21 to help stop the bleeding. The bleeding finally stopped entirely the evening of 6/21/21. The most unique part is that there was little to no pain, even before I began to take the ibuprofen.

The rash looked like little raised bumps and was itchy.  I applied some Benadryl cream on it and it hasn&#39;t improved.  About a week after my vaccination, I had flu like symptoms- shortness of breath, cough, low grade fever,  body aches and joint pain.  I went to the ER (Hospital) and was given  oxygen, breathing treatments and was diagnosed with pneumonia.  I was given a prescription of Z-pak azithromycin and discharged to follow up with my PCP.

                                                In February I have been having abnormal vaginal bleeding, it was pretty frequent and it would last as long as three weeks of bleeding. Also during this time I had experienced fever, chills and was very fatigue. I sought care from my ob/gyn and she ordered for me to receive a trans vaginal ultra sound to make sure everything was okay, and the results came back everything was fine I was just experiencing abnormal bleeding.

                                                MODERNA COVID-1- VACCINE  June 20, 2021 @ 7:00 PM:  Sudden onset chest/neck/jaw pain; profuse sweating; tachycardia; dizziness.   At the time, I was on a daily regimen of Eliquis 5 mg BID, Amlodipine, Toprol, Lexapro.   Evaluated in the Emergency Department at Hospital   EKG #1:  Abnormal - unsure of the interpretation. Sent for CTA Chest to R/O Aortic dissection.  The study was negative.  Labs done revealed significantly elevated Troponin and D-dimer.  Other lab results are unknown to me.  EKG #2:  STEMI/Acute MI.  Code heart was called in the ER and transferred to the cardiac cath lab where I was diagnosed with 100% blockage of the LAD.  DES placed in the LAD. After cardiac cath, I remained in the ICU for several days and was started on Heparin drip, Brilinta, Aspirin, and others.  Hypercoagulable workup (done during previous hospitalization 5/29/2021) was suggestive of Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.  Decision made to start on Coumadin.  Remained in the hospital for several days until INR therapeutic.  Currently on a daily regimen of Coumadin, Brilinta, Lipitor, Toprol.   Following closely with hematology and cardiology.  Will need to remain on Coumadin indefinitely.

On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                Adverse Events:  I went to the emergency room on 5/18 after experiencing major back pain, sharp pain in ribs, chest pains, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and chronic coughing.   Outcome:  After x-rays, EKG, D-Dimer Test and a CT scan the doctor determined that I have Pulmonary Embolism (blood clots in my lungs).   I&#39;ve never had any symptoms prior to receiving the covid vaccine. Today is 5/24 and I am still experiencing most of the same symptoms despite taking my medications as prescribed. The worst symptoms are difficulty breathing and chronic coughing.   Treatment:  -No longer taking birth control (Azurette) since that can cause blood cots -Xarelto (to treat and prevent blood clots)  -Gabapentin 100MG 3x Day (for pain) -Benzonatate 200MG 3x Day (for cough) -Tizanidine 2MG 1X day (for pain) -Albuterol Inhaler Every 4 hours

                                                Symptoms reported: headache grand mal seizure. Was transferred to ER on 2/10/21. Per staff report ? I was sitting on the couch, and my partner noticed I have having a seizure, he lowered to me to the ground and called the ambulance. My seizure lasted for 1 minute.  When I was in the ER, they gave me 2 bags of fluids, they did an X-ray, CT scan, blood work, and UA, they reported to me that all the result were normal. They did not send me home with any medications. However, they did not clear me to drive. They said that I need to get cleared by a neurologist before I can drive, so that?s why I have not been back to work?

I contacted my provider and I was instructed to take a pregnancy test, which was positive. I went in for an exam on the 12th and they confirmed that I was indeed pregnant. They tested my Beta Hcg twice. I didn&#39;t get my results immediately due to one site being closed due to COVID. I could&#39;ve gone to the hospital and received the results immediately, but my doctor didn&#39;t want to take the chance due to the hospital having a lot of COVID. They confirmed that I was pregnant on the 19th or 20th. I bled for a few days after that. The final Beta Hcg was done and my level was 0.

I went into the ER after 4th day of pain.   ER did a CT scan and found a couple blood clots in my right lung (pulmonary embolisms) along with tissue  on lung. An ultrasound of my heart and legs were done to find the source of these blood clots and neither tests found blood clots or indicators that this is where they originated.   I am currently in blood thinners in order to reduce the clots.

When driving home, client states she felt dizzy. Developed fatigue around 5pm. At 8pm went to have a bowel movement and large amounts of red blood with small clots passed from rectum. Client states she had to flush 3 times d/ t the amount of blood. No stool passed.  No other episodes reported. Client does state that around 2-3 am she was up to use the restroom and noted small amount of dried blood spots in her undergarment. Client states that she does have a h/o hemorrhoids since the birth of her baby but states this &#34;definitely&#34; was not related. Client reported feeling hot during the night with mild abdominal cramping but states she is to start her menstrual cycle soon. PHN questioned if she felt this was her menstrual cycle and client clearly states the blood was coming from her rectum. No further episodes of passing blood reported and states that she is feeling better today. Client states that she does not have a h/o of blood in stool except on occasion scant amounts from hemorrhoids. PHN encouraged client to report this finding to her PCP as well and that the PHN was going to report this to VAERS. No other s/s of bleeding reported to the PHN.

                                                I went to the hospital due to shortness of breath and extreme pressure and pain in my chest, specifically surrounding my heart, diaphram, and radiating up to my collar bones and shoulders. After blood work and EKG, they found that my EKG was irregular and I had an elevated D-DIMER blood result at 1600. I was taken for a CAT scan of my upper abdomen and they found that I had a large (650ml) pericardial effusion causing cardiac tampenade. I underwent a procedure that inserted a needle into my pericardium, sucked out the fluid, and inserted a drain tube for 48 hours to drain excess fluid. Upon additional testing, it was determined that I had none of the usual causes for a pericardial effusion (no heart attack or trauma, no infection either viral or bacterial, no cancer, no autoimmune conditions.) My inflammation markers were extremely elevated and my lymph nodes in CAT scan were swollen. As a result, I now have constrictive pericarditis, scar like tissue surrounding my heart constricting its function.

                                                On the day of vaccine administration, I had severe body aches and my bones were hurting. I was very lethargic and blood pressure was continuing to drop. I drank about 3 bottles of energy drink to bring the blood pressure back up.  I also had severe arm pain; the pain was so intense I could not lay on my left side for 3 nights.  Miscarriage 4 weeks after receiving second dose of Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine.  HcG beta and progesterone blood tests completed 48 hours apart to classify this as a miscarriage. Patient is having heavy vaginal bleeding and is feeling very lethargic.

Here, she is slightly tachycardic, but her oxygen level is good, her lungs are clear.  She has no urticaria, she has no stridor or wheezing.  She does not wish to receive epinephrine because she has had such bad effects from it in the past, and is agreeable to Solu-Medrol and Benadryl.  She took Pepcid prior to having her injection.  Her friend who is with her recommends that she has a history of severe events like this in the past, and she usually does better after breathing treatment.

This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist and describes the occurrence of HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) and ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) in a 30-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 031A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (Medical history was not provided).    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 3 milliliter. In March 2021, the patient experienced SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin). On 17-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml). On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 17-Mar-2021 to 18-Mar-2021 due to ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. In March 2021, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) had resolved. On 17-Mar-2021, ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml) had resolved. At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinations), SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient did not have any psychological history; this was the first time she experienced hallucinations.  Treatment for the severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis included intravenous steroids and hydrocortisone.  Treatment for hallucinations included droperidol and lorazepam.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event (anaphylactic reaction), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding the events (Hallucination, anaphylactic reaction, sleep terror, fear of death, delusion, and formication) has been provided at this time. This report refers to a case of (accidental overdose) for mRNA-1273, lot # 031A21A. Further information has been requested.

                                                About two hours after my second shot, I started feeling tingling in my legs.  Within half an hour, the tingling spread to my arms and face and my lips and tongue started to swell and my throat felt like it was closing.  I called 911, and they gave me an epipen, shot of steroids, and a shot of benadryl and said I went into anaphylaxis shock.  I was released from the hospital Friday night, but on Monday night I had another (milder) allergic reaction and the following day began to have shortness of breath.  I went to my doctor&#39;s on Tuesday, who prescribed me steroids and histamine blockers.  I began taking them but on Wednesday my difficulty breathing increased and it got to the point where I had difficultly swallowing and couldn&#39;t eat so I went to the ER again.  I have had some sort of rash and hives every day since my second shot, which my doctor says is a continuing allergic reaction from the shot.  I am going to see an allergist, but I have no history of allergies or allergic reactions to vaccines.

She had severe joint pain for more than 2 weeks and has ongoing recurrent hives on the injection site that have not completely subsided yet.  She developed additional allergic responses and ultimately ended up in the ER after this and was seen by local allergist who advised DO NOT take next shot/vaccination.

                                                On April 15th, the otherwise healthy 30 year old daughter of my cousin passed away in a hospital from a massive stroke and seizures related to encephalitis of unknown cause.    She recovered easily from Covid19 back in November of 2020, along with several of her close friends and family members with no lingering effects.  On March 30th, she was given a single dose of the Moderna vaccine along with her teaching colleagues at a local high school. She initially complained of mild nausea and vomiting but quickly developed a severe headache prompting her to visit the local ER where she received treatment for a migraine. She returned to the ER at least one more time after no relief from the headache. By April 3rd,Saturday, she no longer recognized her sister nor knew what a mask was for.  Her family rushed her again to the same ER and she was subsequently transferred the following day to a Hospital.   Due to dangerously high intracranial pressure, she suffered a stroke with paralysis of her left side and a seizure.  Multiple lesions were noted on her brain via MRI. A shunt was inserted to relieve the pressure, she was intubated and placed into a deep coma from which she would never awaken.  Despite these medical interventions and pharmacological interventions, the pressure did not subside.  A craniotomy was performed the following Saturday as a last ditch effort to relieve the unrelenting pressure in her brain.  The craniotomy was able to reduce the pressure but it was too late.  There was no longer any brain activity and my cousin&#39;s daughter was removed from life support after they were able to say their goodbyes.     The medical examiner will be examining her brain to attempt to find a cause but that report may take 6 months.

                                                Very early menstruation, occurring a couple of hours after the vaccine. It started as spotting that night, (I never spot) then a gradually heavier flow, working up to an unusually heavy &amp; painful period over the course of the next 2 days. Also some very light clotting, which rarely happens for me. I was not due for my period for 2.5 weeks. My cycle is extremely regular and has never deviated from 28-31 days in the last 6&#43; years. I have a copper IUD (for 6 years), and have never been pregnant.

                                                I had an reaction to the first dose of covid-19 vaccine. Within minutes I thought I was going to pass out. 3 days after the vaccine I noticed a lump with pain in my forearm. I suspected a blood clot in my forearm. I had a confirm ultrasound of a DVT in my right upper extremity brachial veins.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

I took a home pregnancy test the week of 1/3/2021, which came back positive.  On 1/17/2021, I started having some spotting and saw my OBGYN on 1/18/2021.  My OBGYN did a transvaginal ultrasound and estimated I was about 5 weeks pregnant.  I went for bloodwork prescribed by my OBGYN on 1/18 and 1/20 to measure my HcG levels.  By 1/20-1/21 the bleeding became heavy and my HcG levels dropped.  I had a follow up appointment with my OBGYN on 2/3/2021 where they performed another transvaginal ultrasound and more bloodwork to confirm that I had miscarried.

                                                Other side effects; Anaphylaxis; Anaphylaxis; A spontaneous report was received from a nurse, concerning a 32-year-old female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced 2 episodes of anaphylaxis (onset: 28 Jan 2021 and 29 Jan 2021) and other unspecified side effects.  The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.  On an unspecified date patient took her first of two planned doses. On 28 Jan 2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (lot/batch: 028L20A) intramuscularly for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 28 Jan 2021, the patient experienced the event of anaphylaxis (life threatening), within 30minutes after the second dose of vaccine. Hence, she received epinephrine and her condition did not improve so received a second dose of the same, also was treated with diphenhydramine and oxygen and sent home. Next day, on 29 Jan 2021, the patient again went into anaphylaxis, hence, received another epinephrine and was also given with prednisone due to which patient got better and was stable today. But, however, she still having other side effects but not anaphylaxis. The patient&#39;s clinical history says that on Sunday night she continued to be symptomatic with vaccine side effects. The patient was confirmed to be not pregnant. Treatment for event other side effects were unknwon.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the events were not reported.   The outcome of events anaphylaxis (onset: 28 Jan 2021) and anaphylaxis (onset date: 29 Jan 2021) was resolved on 29 Jan 2021. The outcome of event other side effects was considered unknown at the time of this report.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Immediately upon receiving the vaccine I had uterine cramps and heavy bleeding with large clots continued throughout the day and into the next day. Had some dark bleeding/discharge about 4 days after my period ended for 2 days. This also happened during my first dose of Moderna, although my first dose was on the first day of my period so I didn?t quite register it since bleeding is normally heavy at the beginning of my period.  First period was also substantially heavier with clots and had some dark bleeding/discharge 4 days after my period ended

It was on time, however, it was extremely heavy. On the 3rd day, I began to have very large blood clots. I spoke to my gynecologist and she started me on birth control that sane day in order to stop the bleeding.

This was accompanied by night swears and then a migrane that onset the following day along with usual symptoms of fatigue and a sore arm.

About one hour after the vaccination she called the pharmacy stating that she thought she was having an allergic reaction and asked if she should use her Epi pen.  After speaking with her about what her reaction was I told her to use her Epi pen and to call 911/go to the ER for further medical help.  I called her back about 15 minutes later to check on her and she said she was doing better after the Epi pen, but did not go to the ER or call 911 yet.  I reiterated to her that if she was having a reaction that required her to use her Epi pen she should seek medical help right away to be safe.  She said okay.

                                                Outcome: unexpected/unexplained death Had first dose Moderna Vaccine 3/31/21. She described body aches and mild fever ? ?like I had COVID again for a day? ? lasting about 36 hours, and then felt fine.  Had dose # 2 Moderna vaccine about 6:50 PM at Community vaccination site. She was driver, received left deltoid injection from Doctor. During observation period reported no symptoms, was happy and talkative with family and staff.  Family reports later that evening she did not feel well ? ?just not hungry? and wanting to lie down. Slept well, then woke up feeling better except for left arm achiness at injection site. Did not report redness, rash, or any difficulty breathing. Was talkative, walking around, took a shower, and was planning to drive to the grocery store later that day.  Mid morning ? maybe beginning about 11 AM, family said she went in and out of bathroom several times. She told them she had vomited three times and was feeling shaky. Her oral temperature was 101.3.   About 1:30 PM, she was in her room and called out for her mother. When family went into the room, she was shaking ?like she was having a seizure? and then her eyes rolled back and she fell to her side and stopped breathing. Family called 911 and started CPR. CPR was continued by EMT?s once they arrived, but they were not able to resuscitate her.

On April 5, I visited Urgent Care for a suspected muscle strain. They referred me to the Hospital emergency care for an ultrasound.

A month after I got the first vaccine and a week after, I started having light bleeding and cramps. It has been 4 years since I had experienced this. Now on today, May 15 - 2 months after my first dose of Moderna, I am having period symptoms again but with some stabbing pain in my uterus. I am very frustrated because these were NOT listed as side effects in the information given and I would not have gotten this vaccine had I known this would happen.

                                                The morning before my second Moderna vaccine I took a pregnancy test and it was inconclusive so I figured I wasn&#39;t pregnant and got my second vaccine (1/26/21). I missed my period and took another pregnancy test on 1/30/21 and it was positive. I went to my first ultrasound on 3/2/21 when I should have been around 8 or 9 weeks and the baby was measuring small but it had a heart beat that was in a normal range. A week later on 3/9/21 I started spotting and I called my doctor and they told me to let them know if it got worse. I went to work but by the end of my shift the bleeding had got worse and my doctor made me go to the ER so I could have another ultrasound. The ultra sound showed the baby still had a heart rate but it was low. I stayed home from work the next day to take it easy and I ended up having a miscarrage that night 3/10/21. I had a follow up ultrasound on 3/11/21 that proved it. I wasn&#39;t planning on reporting this because really anything could have caused it but I signed up for the vaccine app when I got my vaccines and answered the follow up questions. Someone called me because of how I answered my question and she recommended that I report it.

                                                Patient received the Covid-19 vaccine. She reports symptoms of Anaphylaxis - chest discomfort, palpitations, tachycardia, shortness of breath, feeling of tightness in the throat.  I have observed patient was mildy anxious, with shallow rapid respirations. Patient then disclosed having similar reaction after previous covid vaccination. Per the vaccinator patient had stated having an &#34;issue&#34; with her first vaccination, but that she had spoke with her primary and was told it would be ok to proceed&#34; . No report of allergic reaction was reported at this vaccination. Patient described previous reaction as tightness in the chest &#34;menthol feeling&#34; with some shortness of approximately 40 minutes post initial vaccination lasting 7 hours.   This reaction remained mild initially. Approximately 20 minutes into observation time patient reported having increased s/sx - chest tightness and rapid heart rate, some shortness of breath and throat/tongue swelling.  Patient then reported having hx of anaphylaxis to bee stings.  Patient reported this reaction was consistent with previous allergic reactions.  Patient advised epi would be best choice - patient refused. MED TEAM called.  Patient agreed to PO benadryl, however, as medication was prepped did agree to IM benadryl and 50mg was given to patient in the R deltoid as team arrived on scene.  Patient transferred to ED via wheelchair.

I was sneezing and coughing.  I had a runny nose. on Sun 1/10/21 I had an allergic reaction; I think it was set off by a type of sunblock I&#39;ve never used before.  But I&#39;ve never had a reaction to any type of sunblock before. I went into anaphylactic shock: eyes swollen shut, flushed face, tight throat, rapid heart beat, shortness of breath, severe abdominal cramping.  I had to go to the ER.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

                                                Had seizure symptoms at 2:30 am the following day.  Husband woke to our dog whining.  I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

                                                I have a history of heavy periods which resulted in the need for an ablation in October 2018. Since the ablation my periods have been much more manageable. I got my period 13 days after receiving the shot and it started out much heavier than normal, by the second day I was bleeding extremely heavily, soaking an overnight pad in less than 2 hours with bright red blood and passing clots the size of dimes and pennies. Day 3 has started out the same as day 2. Prior to my period starting my back hurt and I had much worse than normal abdominal cramps. Nothing in my life has changed besides the vaccine, I am certain there is a connection between the two. I am not sure how long this will last, I was instructed to go ahead an report the adverse event.

I went to the ER and they could not identify the reason for the vaginal bleeding. I was discharged the same night. It reoccurred three days after when I had been on a walk.

                                                She got her vaccine, initially she had bruising on her forearm that was blue/yellow with a swollen vein connected running down to her hand.  She had tingling and numbness in her fingers in a select few on the left hand.  She also had drooping of her left eye for a short period and a sensation on her left leg, swelling and pain.  She went to the urgent care on 4/15/21, they told her to go home and monitor it.  She knew that somewhat was not right and called a nurse at Hospital and went to the ER shortly thereafter and confirmed that she had a blood clot in her jugular vein IJ-DVT.  In the ER they gave her a shot of Lovenox in the ER into her stomach and run several tests.  They also gave her an anti-inflammatory in her right arm.   She was sent home with Eliquis for the next 3 months.  She has extreme exhaustion, and in addition to that she has had a lot of swelling on the left side of her leg, and visited the ER again on 4/17/21.  Her left foot became blue, very swollen, so they ran a number of tests which all came back negative.  She thinks these are side effects in relation to the previous.  She is still continuing with stiffness in her neck as well.   She also has a severe headache, fever of about 100, and severe achiness.   She has not been able to work due to these symptoms since 4/15/21.  The ER told her to have a lot of rest, no heavy listing/straining due to the clot.

                                                On 4/30/21, I spoke to a physician I work closely with. I was concerned about the excessive/easy bruising I had been having over the past several weeks. I had a very large, excessive bruise on my R inner thigh from my dog running and jumping on me. The doctor was concerned as well and sent me for blood work on 4/30/21. It was noted that my platelet count was low on 5/2/21 and was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia and recommended to f/u with PCP to continue monitoring. I had blood work taken a week after my first COVID 19 vaccine and it was unremarkable. My platelet count at that time was 212. On 4/30/21, my platelet count was 144, which is lower than the normative value which is likely the cause of excessive/easy bruising.

A chest x-ray was done to rule out a PE.  None was found.  The following day the patient was called back and found to have a blood clot in her left calf muscle.  She was treated and is now ok. I do not know specific test and dates. Hospital was the treatment facility.  Patient did not know the name of the Doctor who treated her. We only found out about this adverse effect when we called her to schedule her 2nd dose.

Received the second dose and the cycle continued daily with heavy bleeding and enormous blood clots. Lasted 10 weeks. Stopped for 3 weeks. Started again and currently on day 16 of continuous menstrual cycle.  Blood clots were as large as my palm with excessive cramping occurring. Using tampons made the clot presence and intensity worse too. Fainted twice in my bathroom after passing blood clots. Sometimes the blood clots fall into the toilet and sound like marbles hitting the water. The largest blood clot had smooth borders, could not be pulled apart, and was the size of my palm.

                                                I believe I was very early on in my pregnancy (as in, implantation or first week after conception) when I received the second dose of the vaccine. EDD was January 9th, 2022. I had brown spotting every day for the duration of my pregnancy, obviously concerning and something I paid attention to (though not altogether unusual in early pregnancy). I ended up miscarrying naturally at 6 weeks. I am strongly in favor and appreciative of this vaccine and would be surprised if there was a direct link, but I do know there is a growing conversation about its impact on women&#39;s menstrual cycles. I wanted to submit my experience just in case it was in fact a trend for other trying-to-conceive or early pregnant females.

Per front end associate the patient called the store a few minutes after leaving and stated that she was calling from her car and couldn&#39;t see (blacking out) and she was shaking.  Associate says she was incoherent and not making sense. She said she was on her way back to the store and her hands were going stiff and she was sweating a lot.   Management came to the pharmacy at approximately 6pm to ask me to come outside to take care of an associate having an anapylactic reaction.  I grabbed the Epipen and closed the pharmacy.  As we were walking to the parking lot I was informed that the patient has just received a vaccine at the pharmacy. When we arrived to the patient, paramedics had already arrived on scene and they were preparing to take her to the hospital. I could see her shaking and her arms sticking rigidly out of the car door.   The patient received her vaccine at 3:16pm on 6/15/2021, this was her second dose of the Moderna vaccine.  She reported some side effects from the first vaccine including muscle aches, feeling &#34;out of it&#34; and having to leave work early.

                                                fluid around my heart again; Moderate swelling all over my body; This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (fluid around my heart again) in a 34-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 007c21a) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure high, Fibromyalgia, Bipolar affective disorder and Allergy to antibiotic.   On 17-Jun-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form(s). On an unknown date, the patient experienced PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (fluid around my heart again) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and OEDEMA PERIPHERAL (Moderate swelling all over my body). The patient was treated with IBUPROFEN at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (fluid around my heart again) and OEDEMA PERIPHERAL (Moderate swelling all over my body) had not resolved.            The action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not applicable.  The patient had right arm, leg back and left leg are all swollen and starting to get fluid around heart again. Treating with ibuprofen right now did the same after first vaccine. No concomitant medication information was provided.

                                                Fluid around heart again; Moderate swelling all over my body; This case was initially received via another Manufacturer (Reference number: PVIUS2021001073) on 19-Jun-2021. The most recent information was received on 13-Jul-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 13-Jul-2021. The license partner had received the report from VAERS (Reference number: 1435708).    This regulatory authority case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (Fluid around heart again) in a 34-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 007c21a) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Blood pressure high, Fibromyalgia, Bipolar affective disorder and Allergy to antibiotic (Ceflosporin).   On 17-Jun-2021, the patient received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (unknown route) 1 dosage form. On an unknown date, the patient experienced PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (Fluid around heart again) (seriousness criterion medically significant) and OEDEMA PERIPHERAL (Moderate swelling all over my body). The patient was treated with IBUPROFEN at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (Fluid around heart again) and OEDEMA PERIPHERAL (Moderate swelling all over my body) had not resolved.        For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Unknown), the reporter considered PERICARDIAL EFFUSION (Fluid around heart again) and OEDEMA PERIPHERAL (Moderate swelling all over my body) to be possibly related.    The patient had right arm, leg back and left leg are all swollen and starting to get fluid around heart again. Treating with ibuprofen right now did the same after first vaccine. No concomitant medication information was provided.

                                                Within a minute, there was a different taste in my mouth. Shortly after, began to feel incredibly hot, flushed, burning, and tingling throughout body. Throat and tongue also became tingly. It was like a wave that moved through my body. After waiting it for a few minutes to see if there was improvement, there was a strong ?wave? that came with all of the above, but my heart started racing with palpitations. HR was 120. The heat feeling became worse. Would describe the feeling as a CT contrast feeling, including the feeling of voiding or heat/burning of the bladder. Tongue and throat more tingly. A few minutes later the feeling all became stronger and this is what became the strongest ?wave? of the feeling with my heart beating incredibly fast. The heat/burning/tingling (including the mouth and tongue) were severe. HR 148. Nauseated and lightheaded/dizzy. Transferred to ED.   In the ER, epi was administered due to the persisting flushing/burning of the skin/and tingling of the throat and tongue with tachycardia. IV fluid bolus, Benadryl, and zofran were also administered. Tryptase was obtained approximately 35 - 45 minutes after injection. Tryptase 10.8. Improvement in all symptoms following epi/benadryl.    Was monitored in the ER and within approximately 1.5 hours, the burning feeling returned, but was centralized in my core (felt internal versus skin). Abdomen/chest area with intermittent burning. At approximately 2-3 hours, the tingling began to return. Slight tingling of the tongue, lip. The burning feeling continued to worsen, now back to the skin as well as the core, and additional benadryl was administered in addition to solu-medrol. Prior to this, the attending physician was concerned that my heart rate remained elevated into the 110/120s 3 hours after the epi administration and she recommended transfer to an adult facility for further evaluation. Due to the burning in my chest, EKG was obtained. Sinus tachycardia. Slight chest tightness, duoneb provided. Had not taken inhalers throughout the day and felt similar to tight chest/difficulty getting deep breath in relation to asthma. Relief after the second dose of benadryl and duoneb.   BP remains elevated from shortly after vaccine administration.   Transferred to MVH at 4-5 hours post vaccine. En route to facility, HR 130s and BP lower (90s/60 and 90s/50s) - Medic did not think was accurate BP. At MVH, cardiac rule out completed with additional EKG due to development of some chest pains and return of core burning sensation as well as ongoing tachycardia. EKG remains sinus tach, troponins normal. Requested anxiety medication to see if that would help with heart rate. Low dose ativan given. Minimal change to resting heart rate, still elevated. Also received 4 baby aspirin and tylenol for extreme headache. Oxygen saturations  were 97-100%. Oxygen saturation at MVH was 90-93%. Attending physician not concerned with going home and saturation still being low 90s as long as there was no shortness of breath. Discharged home with methylprednisone 4 mg 6 day pack and pepcid prescriptions. Resting HR was low 100s at time of discharge. Instructed to continue with antihistamines every 6 hours. DX anaphylactic reaction.    Husband checking on me while sleeping, oxygen saturation in sleep 89-91%. After awakening, saturation improved to 94-95%.   At home, burning skin and core feelings persisted. Tingling of the throat/tongue/lips continued to be intermittent. Antihistamines helped to relieve symptoms. 26-28 hours after vaccine, symptoms were very strong, was suffering from extreme burning and tingling of the mouth/lips. Considered return to ER but oxygen saturation was okay. HR elevated. 125 at rest. MVH attending physician encouraged me to try to not use the prednisone packet unless necessary/return of symptoms. Started prednisone with the return of symptoms.    Continued on routine Benadryl until myoclonic jerking became too pronounced, discontinued on 12/25/2020 and changed to hydroxyzine. Jerking remained but improved and was less bothersome. Continued taking daily dose of Claritin, daily pepcid, daily aspirin. Hives developed 12/25/2020.   Return to ER on 12/29/2020 as the jerking was intense and felt to be in chest along with palpitations. EKG and troponin was good, only notable thing physician reported on labs was an elevated WBC count. Did not discuss jerking.    To PCP on 1/4/2020 - discussed adverse reaction. Continued problems after vaccine include: intermittent tachycardia (low 100s at rest occasionally vs norm of 70s/ low 80s), higher heart rate when active, burning skin (feels similar to bad sunburn feeling), random pains and occasional brief numbness/tingling/tremoring in muscles/extremities, jerking (continues to improve - recommended change off of benadryl/hydroxyzine to zyrtec), increased need for inhaler, bubbling sensation in left lower abdomen. It does feel as if it comes in waves.    Burning sensation, internal tremors of left upper thigh, and intermittent tachycardia continue, 1 month post vax.   Antihistamines do help, but discontinued due to jerking. Continue on daily claritin.

It took about 36 hours for my symptoms to be gone after they started. I was also on my period when I received the vaccine. My period seemed to slow down almost completely while my symptoms were happening, and then my period resumed with abnormal cramping and clotting after my symptoms were gone.

I take aleve a day before my period which helps with my cramps.  My last period started April 9th and I am still on my period today April 15th. I had heavy bleeding and blood clots the size of quarters for the first 5 days. The aleve didn?t seem to help and my pain level was at a 10, I would pass out from the pain. My period usually last 4 days and I am on day 7 and still bleeding, but not experiencing any cramps. I?ve read that Covid effects the blood clotting process and also read other women are experiencing heavier menstrual cycles after their covid shot. I also read that moderna didn?t study any side effects related to the menstrual cycle.  I have an appointment today (April 15th) to get my second shot. I am not sure if I should get the second shot, due to the amount of clots I had.

                                                2 days after the vaccine (on 2 May), I woke with an accelerated heart rate, chest pain, tightness of chest and shortness of breath.  I presented to MD where they took my vitals and an EKG.  The doctor called an ambulance for me as she assessed I was potentially displaying signs of pulmonary embolism.  The ambulance took me to the emergency department.  I ultimately stayed there two nights, and following many tests was diagnosed with acute pericarditis versus myopericarditis.  My admitting doctor and the cardiologist both advised that while they could not be 100% certain, the pericarditis could very well be an adverse reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  The admitting doctor told me she would report it as an adverse reaction. I am now on colchacine anti-inflammatory medication for 3 months and have one follow-up with the cardiologist to come.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS (felt out of it) and ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) in a 35-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 053C27A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below. Concurrent medical conditions included Smoker and Detergent sensitivity (Thirteen years ago, contact allergies with Woolite and Tide laundry detergent) since 2008. Concomitant products included AMFETAMINE ASPARTATE, AMPHETAMINE SULFATE, DEXAMFETAMINE SACCHARATE, DEXAMFETAMINE SULFATE (ADDERALL) for an unknown indication. On 30-Apr-2021 at 11:12 AM, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 30-Apr-2021, the patient experienced ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS (felt out of it) (seriousness criteria medically significant), ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction) (seriousness criterion medically significant), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy), FEEDING DISORDER (unable to eat until 4pm) and DYSPNOEA (hard time breathing). On 30-Apr-2021 at 1:00 PM, the patient experienced OROPHARYNGEAL DISCOMFORT (throat started to clamp up). On 01-May-2021, the patient experienced PHARYNGEAL SWELLING (throat started to get a little swollen), THROAT IRRITATION (throat started to get a little itchy) and OROPHARYNGEAL PAIN (Sore throat). On 30-Apr-2021 at 4:00 PM, FEEDING DISORDER (unable to eat until 4pm) had resolved. At the time of the report, ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS (felt out of it), ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (anaphylactic reaction), DIZZINESS (felt dizzy) and OROPHARYNGEAL DISCOMFORT (throat started to clamp up) was resolving and DYSPNOEA (hard time breathing), PHARYNGEAL SWELLING (throat started to get a little swollen), THROAT IRRITATION (throat started to get a little itchy) and OROPHARYNGEAL PAIN (Sore throat) outcome was unknown. The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown. The patient has never had a reaction to vaccines or latex.  After waiting in the vaccinating provider&#39;s observation area, she felt fine. On the drive home she felt dizzy and a little out of it. Her Epi-Pen had expired. She took Claritin and laid down to see if the reaction would get better or worse. The symptoms got better 2.5-3 hours (3:30-4pm) later. Things were better and she felt fine. She took Claritin for a total of 4 days following the injection. She did contact her healthcare professional, who referred her to an allergist and her appointment with the allergist is pending. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Anaphylactic reaction is consistent with the product safety profile; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of mRNA-1273 and the onset of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Anaphylactic reaction is consistent with the product safety profile.

                                                Can?t say if it?s related or not but I?ve been sick for almost a month now so I?m really starting to wonder. Developed cellulitis on my lower right leg on Thursday, was put on Keflex on Friday, then switched to Bactrum on Saturday. By Sunday, the abscess was large and my leg was swollen double the size, red and hot to the touch. I spiked a fever and felt very ill. I went to the ER Sunday night. Was told I was septic and was admitted. Transferred to another hospital on Tuesday. On Thursday, I had surgery to cut out the abscess (I&amp;D). The following Sunday, my right foot and ankle became so swollen and red, another surgery was considered. Miraculously the swelling and redness went down through the night. I was sent home with a PICC line and IV antibiotics - Vancomycin. My Vanco trough kept showing low levels and I?m now on a dose of 1500mg 2x day. I am fatigued, nauseous, constant headache, spiking fevers 1-2 times a day for the last 7 days, my WBC and RBC is very low, I?m considered anemic now, waking up with night sweats when I do finally fall asleep...feels like no end in sight.

On 4/7/2021, protein was found in my urine which is a indicator for preeclampsia /high blood pressure. I would go in for doctor&#39;s visit weekly to check my bp reading.   My bp readings were 150/90 range and I had to be induced at 37 weeks.  The baby is healthy but had a little jaundice at birth. I was put on bp medication labetatol for 3 weeks.   After the deliver, I had 4 episodes of bleeding and hemorrhage.  I was found to have retained placenta and had surgery on 5/2021 for that and was hospitalized for 3 days (Hospital).

The events, full anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure were considered resolved on 07 Jan 2021. The events, nausea, hives, and dizziness were considered recovered/resolved on 10 Jan 2021.  The outcome of the events, bad headache and stuffy nose, were not reported.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 36-year-old female patient with medical history of latex allergy, who received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot 01122019), and who experienced the serious unlisted event of Anaphylactic shock, the non-serious listed events of Headache and Nausea, and the non-serious unlisted events of Urticaria, Hypotension, Dizziness, and Nasal congestion.  Based on the current available information and temporal associon between the use of the product and the onset of events starting on the day of vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.

                                                6 minutes after receiving vaccine patient reported that her tongue was starting to swell and that her heart was racing.  Staff called 911 immediately.  Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

On 2/9 those symptoms subsided, but I started to get right-sided flank pain with pain on inhalation. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital. I was admitted to a different hospital on 2/12 and continue to antibiotic s and a heparin drip

I also started to have vaginal bleeding when I wasn?t due to have a period. The rash got progressively worse, to spread all over torso back and front.  Vaginal bleeding also continued to worsen. Went to ER to have labs checked, was told it looked like Pityriasis rosea- and that all lab values and clotting factors were normal. Sent home with prescription for Atarax if needed. Was told it would be self limiting but if worsened to come back.

Took OTC Tylenol (2) po and had no signs of relief. Pain , swelling, and skin redness lasted for 3 days. On February 10th, 2021 I had a positive pregnancy test (confirmed by bloodwork and urine) which indicated I was 6-7 weeks pregnant and had a miscarriage on March 2021, after giving live births 3 prior times. The cause of the miscarriage is unknown.  I also developed a blood clot on the arm that was inserted for an IV. I have no family history or personal history of needing blood thinners.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

                                                At the time of my first vaccine on 1/14/21 I was 9 weeks pregnant and on lovenox for DVT and progesterone for pregnancy maintenance. On 2/5/21 I miscarried the baby and ended up hemmoraging thus requiring a blood transfusion. The fetus was sent to pathology and I was informed that at 12 weeks when I miscarried that the baby had termed at 9 weeks which was the time of my first vaccine injection.

I went to the Urgent Care listed above, and I was given a steroid shot. However, I was diagnosed with a double ear infection and pneumonia after complaining of chest pain. I made a Teledoc appointment, and they couldn&#39;t decipher if I had Covid or a reaction from the vaccine.

                                                Initially I had arm soreness at the area of the shot.  Saturday evening following the vaccine I had pain in my left side of the neck.  Sunday the pain went from the left side of my neck down to the base of my ribs and then progressed to include the back and chest almost constantly instead of just on inhalation.  I went to the ER on Sunday evening, assuming very bad costochondritis; however, was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the left lung, areas of possible infarction, and pleurisy.  I had a CT scan at a Medical Center prior to receiving the Moderna vaccine for a suspected PE and it was negative.

I went to the doctor on 4/22/21 where they did a COVID swab (negative), a chest x-ray, and a d-dimer blood test. My d-dimer value was 4520, so the clinic immediately sent me to the ER. At the ER, they did another COVID swab (negative), a chest x-ray, a CT scan with contrast dye, and an EKG. The CT scan found multiple pulmonary emboli in my lungs, including a large one near my heart. I was admitted to the hospital from 4/22/21-4/24/21. They started me on blood thinners (Xarelto) and did an ultrasound of my heart, in which they determined my heart has not sustained damage. The shortness of breath subsided in about a week post-hospitalization. I am still on daily blood thinners.

                                                Patient is a 36 yo female with history of IVDU, Hep C, fibromyalgia who presents with left leg pain and swelling found to have significant left leg DVT now s/p femoropopliteal vein thrombectomy.   HPI:  Patient is a 36 y.o. female with history of IVDU, Hep C, fibromyalgia who presents with left leg pain and swelling.   Patient woke up this morning with her entire left leg being painful, swollen, &#34;tight&#34;, and &#34;achy&#34; throughout. She had been experiencing 1 week of left leg pain, followed by an acute worsening in the last 2 days. She denies any recent travel or leg trauma.   She denied any fevers, chills, SOB, or chest pain. She denies any new tattoos, recent malignancies, or blood clotting disorders. Of note, she is currently undergoing evaluation for lupus due to fatigue and rashes.   Per her IVDU, she injects heroin in her arm (last use 1 month ago after 4 years of sobriety), and is currently on methadone. This pain is different from her fibromyalgia.   Of note, she got her first Moderna COVID vaccine last week.     Highlights of ED course: Pertinent exam findings: tachycardia, marked LLE swelling (mid thigh 70 cm vs 64 cm on RLE) Warm bilateral LE, palpable pulses Important data gathered: LENI: left deep vein thrombosis extending from common femoral vein to distal posterior tibial veins, ESR 47, CRP 58, elevated d-dimer &gt; 4000 Key treatments administered: heparin gtt, oxyodone 5 mg for pain, vascular medicine, cardiology consult   Patient was subsequently evaluated by vascular medicine, who brought her to cath lab for venography and endovenous intervention. She went to the cath lab. U/s guided access to L popliteal vein with micropuncture. J-wire into L CIV, serial dilation and placement of 12F sheath. Multiple passess with Penumbra lightning aspiration catheter. Femoropopliteal vein with restored patency, continued organized clot in iliac vein, infusion of 6mg TPA with 10 min dwell time. Further passages of aspiration catheter. Decision to leave 30 cm infusion cath.    When seen on the floor, patient was hemodynamically stable. Still with pain in lower extremities and back. No chest pain or SOB.     #DVT, s/p vascular surgery thrombectomy 2 days of acute left leg pain and swelling. Initial exam notable for purplish LLE in ED. LENIs notable for left DVT extending from CF vein to distal PT veins. Vascular evaluated and performed femoropopliteal vein thrombectomy with restored patency, continued organized clot in iliac vein, infusion of 6mg TPA with 10 min dwell time. Further passages of aspiration catheter. Decision to leave 30 cm infusion cath. On OCPs but no known other risk factors (quit smoking), suggesting unprovoked DVT. Other potential etiology includes venous congestion. Hypercoaguable w/u pending. Notably, Moderna vaccine 1 week ago, although limited evidence suggesting relation between mRNA vaccine and increased thrombosis risk. Hypercoagulability workup was sent. Patient transitioned from heparin to apixaban for discharge with vascular medicine and vascular surgery followup

Received a positive confirmation on April 14, 2021. At this time I was about 6 weeks along. Due date was estimated for the beginning to mid- December.  On May 7th I had my first appointment with an OB, at that time she was unable to find a heartbeat. HCG quants were checked and I was sent for a more extensive ultrasound on May 11. Miscarriage was confirmed that day. Scheduled a D&amp;C for May 24th, on the 21st I spiked a fever and was exhibiting signs on sepsis. That evening an emergent D&amp;C was performed. Seemed to be on the mend the next morning and was sent home with oral antibiotics. On the 25th I spiked another fever and was advised by my physician to get to the emergency room. Spent the next three nights in the hospital with IV antibiotics. Came home with a couple different oral antibiotics (Flagyl and Clindamycin)  for the next 2 weeks. This seemed to cover the infection.

The delivery occurred on an unknown date. For neonate 1, patient was 25 weeks pregnant during the vaccination. The patient was treated with HEPARIN for DVT, at an unspecified dose and frequency. At the time of the report, PULMONARY EMBOLISM (inferred pulmonary embolism), DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (deep vein thrombosis in right femoral vein), NON-CARDIAC CHEST PAIN (Chest pain (non-cardiac)), DYSPNOEA (Shortness of breath), MALAISE (Feeling unwell), INSOMNIA (Insomnia), ANXIETY (Feeling anxious), MYALGIA (sore upper arm after first vaccine), PYREXIA (Fever), VACCINATION SITE PAIN (Vaccination site pain) and FATIGUE (Fatigue) outcome was unknown and EXPOSURE DURING PREGNANCY (It was the second trimester in her pregnancy /Pregnant) had resolved.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In 2021, Ultrasound scan: abnormal (abnormal) DVT in right femoral vein.     The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.       Treatment medication was not reported.   Concomitant was not reported.  In the emergency room, patient was diagnosed by sonogram for DVT in her right femoral vein. A chest x-ray was taken and due to the patient&#39;s symptoms a pulmonary embolism was inferred to be the cause without further need of investigation by CT scan due to the increased risk for pregnant females. patient was treated with a shot of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and continues to get a LMWH subdermal shot every twelve hours for the duration of her pregnancy.  After one night in the ICU, the patient was discharged with no further complications for pregnant patient or the fetus to date.  The blue-sky scenario is this patient developed a blood clot prior to vaccination, and the body&#39;s response to the vaccine caused enough stress to cause the emergent crisis.

                                                After being given the Moderna vaccine on March 6th I began vaginally bleeding on March 8th. I had 6 days of what seemed like a period of bleeding even though it wasn&#39;t the time I should have had a period. I&#39;m very regular and never had an issue with my period. I began bleed on all the following dates as well April 2nd-8th, April 21st-29th, May 16th-June 13th. I saw my doctor and begin oral birth control on June 13, 2021.   I have since had a rash outbreak all over my legs since July 12th. I stopped taking the birth control June 20th as the doctors have believed now a side effect of possibly the birth control/vaccine is Erythema Nodosum. A biospy was taken on June 21st &amp; the results will take 10-14 days. Additionally, as soon as I stopped taking the oral birth control I began bleeding immediately and hopefully it won&#39;t be never ending again.

                                                Patient described having lightheadedness, the began to experience dyspnea saying her breathing felt strange.  This began approximately 5 minutes after her dose was administered.  We had her sit down in our injection room and began to monitor her symptoms.    I immediately got out our protocol for Treatment of an Allergic Reaction as part of our vaccination program protocol.   the patient remained conscious and responsive throughout the encounter.  A pulse oximeter was placed on her left pointer finger.  Her heart rate fluctuated in the 110s to 130s during the encounter.  Her pulse ox remained 97% throughout the encounter.  Patient reported having a history of hypertension treated with lisinopril.  We placed a blood pressure monitor on her left wrist to take her blood pressure.  Her initial blood pressure was 164/105, which she reported was &#34;just a little bit over normal&#34; for her.  After taking the initial blood pressure, she described that her symptoms were beginning to subside a bit.  We discussed the signs/symptoms that we would be looking for in an anaphylaxis type reaction, some of which were present (i.e. tachycardia, dyspnea) and some of which were not (i.e. hives, swelling of the face/lips, throat, etc.).  We then began to take her blood pressure again.  The second blood pressure measurement was 156/104.  Shortly after taking the second blood pressure, she described having feelings of dyspnea again.  At that time, I notified another staff member to contact EMS/call 911 and let them know we potentially had an allergic reaction to the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.  When the symptoms came back for the second time, I got out the Epipen Two Pack in the case that we would need to administer a dose.  We continued to monitor her symptoms and kept her responsive over the next few minutes, until the first set of EMS arrived from the local fire department.  The EMS staff began taking her vitals and took over care of that patient at that point.  Patient was still responsive and describing only dyspnea and having clinical symptoms of tachycardia and hypertension.  Patient got nauseated around 10 minutes after the first set of EMS arrived, and experienced a bit of vomiting.  About 10-15 minutes after the first set of EMS arrived and took over care of the patient, the ambulance and second set of EMS arrived and took over care.  They began monitoring the patients symptoms and placed an IV line.  The patient was then transported to the local Emergency Department.  At around 5PM, the patient called the pharmacy to report that the physicians at the emergency department had ruled that she had experienced an allergic, non-anaphylactic reaction to the dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) in a 37-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 011M20A and 011J20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) and TOPIRAMATE (TOPAMAX) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, the patient experienced TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird). On 03-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma) and ASTHENIA (Could not get up). On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg) and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg), TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia), DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma), CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg), ASTHENIA (Could not get up), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine), HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Haemoglobin: low gram per litre (Low) LOW. In March 2021, Red blood cell count: low cells per microlitre (Low) LOW.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment informations reported were Levalbuterol tartrate  and Rivaroxaba 20 mg   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059897 (Patient Link).

This past week I had a menstrual cycle, and I discharged a high volume of blood blots.  I am taking an oral contraceptive and my periods are  are normal frequency, length and flow, until this last period.  The clots could fill an entire maxi pad that needed to be changed every 2 hours, for about 48 hours.  After that single clots were discharged every 2 hours for another 2 days (and still occurring as I write this).  I sent my PCP (an OBGYN) a direct message in patient portal also reporting symptoms.

                                                On May 7, 2 Days after receiving the Moderna shot, I started to get breast tenderness, indicating an upcoming menstruel cycle, despite not being due until May 17. It is important for me to note here that my period is always on time (within a day or 2). On May 9, I began to have some cramping. When I got out of the shower on the morning of May 10, I had begun bleeding. At this point, the cramps began to worsen. Often leaving me doubled over in pain (while common for some women, this is completely abnormal for me. I normally don&#39;t have any cramping at all.) The bleeding itself is heavier than usual. I&#39;m also extremely exhausted compared to usual.

                                                My joint pain the first night was debilitatingly severe and I spiked a fever which finally broke overnight that Saturday.  I was drinking lots of fluids, so when I started peeing more than usual on Saturday I didn&#39;t think much of it.  It got worse on Sunday, but there was no pain.  The pain finally started today, along with a little blood.  I went to the doctor and the test confirmed I have a UTI.  There are red and white blood cells in my urine, and the hyaline casts were high enough that it flagged them too.  Normally, I would not have reported this but the timing was very strange and based on the severity of my joint pain the night of, it is not just a weird coincidence.  I was not experiencing any urinary symptoms before the vaccine. I found that there have been others during the study who experienced UTI&#39;s following vaccination with the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and although the study determined no correlation, I thought it important to report it. With me, for reasons no one seems to understand, my kidneys react to my allergens before anything else does. I&#39;m assuming that is why I am having the UTI issue right now, although no bacteria got flagged in my sample.

                                                A few days after the first vaccine I had chest tightness, especially on the left side and middle of my chest that came out of nowhere (no runny nose or anything). It felt like my lungs were irritated and I was short of breath, very tired. Worried it might be covid I went to get tested and it came back negative. Monocytes were high and the doctor suspected early pneumonia. Chest x ray came back without signs of pneumonia (but I continued the antibiotics for 10 days just in case it had been too early to show on the X-ray). Chest discomfort especially on left side, especially with deep inhale and when moving or laying on my side persisted.  Lungs felt better but still left side chest discomfort. Followed up with a chest CT after three weeks and it showed pericardial effusion and splenomegaly in addition to micro nodules in left lung. Pulmonologist cleared me for lung issues, infectious disease tested many things all came back negative. The source of the random chest pain especially on inhaling, shortness of breathe, etc has not been solidly determined and all symptoms started after getting the first moderna shot. After the second shot I felt extremely unwell with high fever for many days. Chest CT was done after the second shot so it is hard to know if the pericardial effusion and splenomegaly came from both shots.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concurrent medical conditions included Multiple sclerosis (treated with Ocrevus has polysorbate as an ingredient.). Concomitant products included OCRELIZUMAB (OCREVUS) for Multiple sclerosis, AMITRIPTYLINE and BACLOFEN for an unknown indication.    On 12-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, the patient experienced the first episode of FLUSHING (Facial flushing), SWELLING FACE (Facial swelling), COUGH (Cough) and NAUSEA (Nausea). On 13-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (Anaphylaxis) (seriousness criterion medically significant), SWELLING FACE (Swelling of the face) and the second episode of FLUSHING (Facial flushing). The patient was treated with DIPHENHYDRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE (BENADRYL [DIPHENHYDRAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) for Facial flushing, Swelling, Cough and Nausea, at a dose of 1 dosage form and EPINEPHRINE for Anaphylaxis, at a dose of 1 dosage form. On 12-Mar-2021, SWELLING FACE (Facial swelling), COUGH (Cough) and NAUSEA (Nausea) had resolved. At the time of the report, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (Anaphylaxis), SWELLING FACE (Swelling of the face) and the last episode of FLUSHING (Facial flushing) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Patient was treated with for Multiple sclerosis that has polysorbate as an ingredient. She had a theory that there was some sort of cross-reactivity between the polysorbate in the Ocreubus and the PEG in the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine that caused this reaction.   Most recent FOLLOW-UP information incorporated above includes: On 06-Jul-2021: Non-Significant Follow-Up Appended; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 37-year-old female with a serious expected event of anaphylactic reaction, and nonserious swelling face, cough, nausea, and flushing. Event onset 2 days after first dose mRNA-1273. Based on current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

                                                24 hrs after my second shot I got a fever that lasted through the night. Two days after receiving my second shot I began getting chest pains (pressure, fluttering, sharp pain that radiated from my heart up my neck). They became more severe and I was worried that I was having a heart attack. Went to my regular doctor. Had an EKG that looked normal, was sent for a chest x-ray, and blood work. As well as prescribed a ZioPatch heart monitor for 2 weeks. Lab work came back normal and ZioPatch recorded one instance of Ventricular Tachycardia so I was referred to a cardiologist. Symptoms continued for about 3 weeks slowly becoming less intense but including lightheadedness and constant feeling of pressure with occasional (daily) pains that felt like a side ache in my heart.  Strong Symptoms reappeared in the beginning of June. Cadiologist ordered a stress echo. This came back normal as well.  I was given a Clinical Diagnosis of Pericarditis and told to take Ibuprofen. Symptoms continued through the second week of July and then diminished again.

                                                38 year old female - healthy with no significant past medical history. Morning of 1/15/21, pt woke up with difficulty speaking  (would be talking and then unable to articulate words which were replaced by grunting sounds) and tingling to her face. No changes to breathing, no numbness/tingling to extremities, equal facial symmetry. Slow onset of symptoms. Pt went to the ED, where she received a CT, MRI (inconclusive reading), lab work reported as normal per pt, EKG and chest x-ray. Symptoms self resolved while in the ED, however MD staff wanted to admit patient for 24 hours of observation and to complete an echocardiogram. Pt left AMA the evening of 1/15/21 due to resolution of symptoms and wanting to follow up with her cardiologist for the echocardiogram. Pt told by MD staff symptoms were likely caused by either TIA, possible reaction to vaccine or migraine presentation (no report of headaches/auras). Plan was to have patient on blood thinners x 30 days then baby Aspirin thereafter. Pt still needing to follow up with PCP and cardiologist for further work up.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

                                                Received second COVID vaccine Moderna on Wednesday evening at 6pm.  Later that night, I was a little light-headed and achey, but went to bed. On thursday, my legs and arms were extremely achy. I took Tylenol and Motrin in the morning. It seemed to help some, but continued to feel very achy in my legs. I left work early (I am a pediatrician) on Thursday and went home and just sat and rested.  I felt terrible, but had talked to other colleagues who felt very bad that first day after the shot. Friday morning, I woke up still achy but feeling better overall. I took motrin and Tylenol again on Friday morning. I worked the whole day seeing patients. Was tired, but got thru the workday. At around 6pm, I noticed petechiae rash on my lower legs. The rash started spreading thru the night- up my legs and to my arms. I went to ER. They did order CBC, CMP. Platelets were undetectable- 1 platelet was seen under microscope. CMP was normal.  I was told to go to bigger hospital. I went, My platelets read as 4. I was admitted for two nights. Two doses of IVIG were given and I was put on Decadron 40mg PO daily for 4 days. I had tylenol, benadryl, zofran before the IVIG and after.  I will see Hematology next week for follow up. Platelets yesterday at discharge were 60.  Will be checked frequently for the next few months. ITP= diagnosis. COVID shot was trigger.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

                                                I was trying for a pregnancy and was likely pregnant but not detectable at vaccine number 1. Found out about pregnancy a week or so before vaccine 2.  (I was likely about 5 weeks pregnant then based on LMP of dec 22 with avg cycles of 35 days. Decided to get vaccine due to general advice that it is okay during pregnancy. (No known adverse effects). After dose 2, had about 10-12 hours of chills without fever and general fatigue. Shortly afterwards experienced mild cramps. This is my 5th pregnancy and I have no history of complications of any sort. Cramps are not usual for my pregnancies but I know it can be normal so I did not think anything of it. Mild spotting occurred but again did not think anything of it as I know it can be normal. I was scheduled for a first OB visit  Mar 3 where I should have been 10 weeks. (Initial positive pregnancy test was Jan 29). Ultrasound showed empty 5.6 week gestational sac with a yolk sac and subchorionic hemorrhage.   OB suspected pregnancy failure. We followed pregnancy with ultrasound of better quality 10 days later which showed a possible fetal pole and yolk sac but no heart beat and gestational sac measured at 6.0 weeks. Today March 18 awaiting repeat ultrasound tomorrow but started bleeding and cramping. Consistent with the start of the miscarriage. With no histories of abnormal pregnancies and with the gestational  sac consistently measure at 6 weeks (matching to about the time of shot#2), I am inclined to believe that the second covid shot stopped the progression of my pregnancy. I am a huge pro vaccine health care provider but would recommend now an investigation into first trimester covid vaccinations and possibly not recommend this during that time period.

COVID- 19 tests were negative 4 times in the last 1 week.  Blood cultures were negative. Urine and strep antigens are negative. HIV-1 also negative.  Rheum consulted for hx of lupus.  They did not feel this was lupus pneumonitis.  Negative anti-dsDNA/SSA/SSB and RF.  Pts resp status continued to decline.  She was intubated on 4/3 and transferred to the ICU.  Bronch washings were also neg for COVID.  Despite neg cultures pt was given multiple rounds of abx including vanc, merrem, azithromycin, cefepime,  without benefit.  IV steroids added for possible reactive pneumonitis.  Pt with shock, likely multifactorial including septic and cardiogenic.  Multiple pressors maximized and BP remained low.  Nephro following for worsening renal function.  CRRT initiated to attempt to correct electrolyte and acidosis.  Pt did not tolerate CRRT after several adjustments by neprho, pts electrolytes continued to drift from normal.  Hgb dropped and CRRT held.  Pt went into cardiac arrest at 1329 on 4/8/21.  After several rounds of epinephrine and optimized ACLS, no pulse was recovered and ROSC was not achieved.  Family notified of death at 1344 on 4/8/21

Cervical spinal cord lesion found now C2-C4. Lost ability to walk and sit up. Admitted to Medical Center for the past 3 weeks receiving treatment for transverse myelitis vs. MOG. Physicians believe trigger was COVID shot. Begging CDC to investigate since I have had both ITP and now transverse myelitis after second covid shot. Now  out of work and will be in rehab for months. Please investigate. I was very healthy, marathon runner. I hope to eventually gain back my ability to run but the neurologists have no idea.

                                                Right after injection, I got really hot and flushed. I thought I am not a fan of needles - so I thought it was anxiety. My throat got really dry. They gave me a Dixie cup of water and I asked for more. After I had finished the one cup, I was clearing my throat and it felt like I couldn&#39;t swallow and my tongue had swollen up and I couldn&#39;t swallow any water from next Dixie cup. I couldn&#39;t swallow - it felt like it would get stuck at the back of my throat. The nurse said she was going to stab me with the epi-pen but had me lay down first and my face started to feel slightly numb and I told her that and she stabbed me in right hip with the epi-pen. They called the ambulance to take me to hospital and after the epi-pen was given they had me sit up and put a mask on my face and I was in a state of panic. I wore an oxygen full face mask and was breathing into it. The paramedics came in and put me on stretcher - monitored for six hours. Because of the adrenaline from the epi- pen - I had high blood pressure and heart rates - everything was really high. After a few hours, she told me that my tongue was looking better and there was better color in my tongue. I was sitting there every six hours - I was monitoring as how to I was doing. They gave me Benadryl and I think they gave me something else but I can&#39;t remember what it was. I came home and it was late at night - 11:00 or 11:30 and from there until February 1st, I was extremely sick. I went back to ER on 23rd; and did telehealth visits  - with my doctor  (right after ER visit from Injection was first one; and then I went to the hospital on the 23rd; Telehealth on 24th or 25th and I - I was running fevers of 104, 103 and went up to 105 almost- on 23rd of January - 3 days after injection - I&#39;m weak, I can&#39;t move - everything hurt. From head to toe. I couldn&#39;t sleep or do anything. I was so weak, I couldn&#39;t even move. It was difficult just to use the bathroom. I had the fevers that was causing my chills and my body aches were bad. I had been trying to alternate Tylenol and Ibuprofen; I was finally prescribed Hydro Codone just to sleep. I was told to take this during the day and the Tylenol and Ibuprofen combo at night. Shoulder surgery was about a month after the vaccine - 18th of February - And on the 22nd of February I went to the hospital again for left side chest pains. - I couldn&#39;t breathe - I was discharged February 25th - I was on blood thinners for three months. - the surgeon said that I developed clots and I developed these shortly after surgery and ended up in the hospital for three days. The clots are unknown - blood clots started in the legs and then developed  the fluid/clot issue in the lungs  - I had a pulmonary embolism in my left lung. Surgeon said it could have been caused by vaccine as he did not work on the lower part of my body.

                                                I am a nurse practitioner, so as a healthcare worker, I received a very early vaccine. I have had little time to report what happened to me but not that it remains an issue I think I need to do so.  I had a very serious initial reaction and am now having chronic problems likely related to my vaccine. I received my first dose of Moderna 12/27/20 at POD lot# 025J20A and my second dose 1/24/21 at POD lot#029L20A.  After the first vaccine within a few hours I had significant injection site and arm pain. By the time I went to bed that night I could barely lift my arm over my head it was so stiff and warm. The arm was very painful, and I required Ibuprofen 800 mg TID for 3 days to control the pain. I did not have systemic symptoms from the first vaccine. After the second vaccine, within hours I had systemic symptoms of fatigue, generalized aches in my muscles and severe arm pain in the injection arm. I received the vaccine in the afternoon. I went to bed that night and woke up suddenly at 3 am, about 14 hours later. I had severe myalgias and rigors. I was barely able to move. I was not able to walk or perform fine or gross motor tasks without difficulty. I was unable to dress myself or get up to go to the bathroom. I required almost fulltime care from my husband for three days. On day 4 I developed severe headaches nausea and vomiting. The muscles still ached but I was able to walk and move again. My fine motor was still impaired for a total of 7 days. I was out of work for 8 days and did not feel 100% well for 12-14 days after the vaccine. As the symptoms started to resolve on day 5, I believe I had a mild case of Rhabdomyolysis as my urine was very dark almost brown and there was sediment in the toilet. There was no blood in my urine and no dysuria. I did a urine dip at work and it had protein and ketones but no bacteria. The specific gravity was very concentrated. I did not check my renal function at that time. My renal function a few weeks later was normal Cr 0.88. GFR 85. The dark urine and sediment lasted for about 2-3 days. I was drinking lots of water through this time-period and during then I was very ill. I was not seen at a hospital and rather I treated myself at home. During the above week was the first time I ever had neck or back pain. It did subside but I still had a dull aching in my neck after all of this. I had two episodes, one in late January and one in mid-February of left neck being very sensitive to touch, felt warm, and my ear was very hypersensitive to touch as well. It felt almost like shingles but there was never a rash and I took Acyclovir 800 mg TID for 3-5 days without relief. It subsided each time after about 7 days. This was on the same side of my body on the left as the vaccine was. In the end of March 2021 I began with left trapezoid pain in the same side of the body. I had some numbness in that arm as well so I saw orthopedics and received an MRI of my left brachial plexus which showed C3-4, C4-5, and C6-7 disc herniations that had not been present before. If the herniations were present in the past they were acutely inflamed by the inflammatory process the vaccine caused in my body. The MRI also showed significant and specifically left cervical and left axillary adenopathy this being the side of my vaccine. The pain spread beyond my trapezoid and become progressively worse into my neck and upper back only on the left side. The entire left side of my spine both cervical and thoracic was painful but the right side unaffected. It was very sharp nerve like pain shooting and running up into my head and anterior neck. Another MRI was done of the full cervical spine this time confirming these same herniations, but the discs appear to be pulling to the left with isolated left inflammatory process. The nerve pain became so severe that last week I began having numbness in that left arm and numbness into the left side of my face. A stat MRI of my brain only shows T2 flare pattern consistent with sequela of an inflammatory process of unknown origin. The foraminal stenosis at these spinal levels are very mild and do not explain my symptoms very well. Spine specialist reports that there can be symptoms of this nature but usually not with this mild of a pathology. The facial numbness has been identified as a trigeminal neuropathy of cervical origin but is rarely documented in medical journals and not seen by these spine specialists. There is a very significant amount of left sided nerve over stimulation, inflammation and adenopathy that is not explained. I have never had any spine or neck pain in my life before this and I have no history of traumatic events to explain this sudden change in my condition. I truly feel that ever since I received the Moderna vaccine and had that very severe reaction, my body has been in a constant inflammatory phase and there has been nerve pain in and around only the left upper side of my body where the vaccine was placed. I am scheduled on Monday for epidural spinal injections as I have been unable to find pain relief with any other therapies including dry needling, physical therapy, traction, tramadol, muscle relaxers, oral steroid bursts, etc. I know this may be a very strange and unique case, but I can say confidently that I believe the vaccine stimulated this entire cascade of events. If someone could please contact me related to this, I would appreciate it.

On 6/15/21, patient&#39;s significant other discovered patient in bed, not breathing, with ashen appearance, uncertain how long it had been since patient was last breathing.  EMS was contacted, CPR was given and patient was transferred to Emergency Department at the hospital.  Diagnosis of Cardiologist is cardiac arrest, NSTEMI (suspects type 2).  Per cardiologist, patient appears to exhibit cardiomyopathy, etiology difficult to ascertain (patient&#39;s family/acquaintances have endorsed periodic use by patient of anabolic steroids in the past, making it more difficult to rule out source of cardiomyopathy. ). Physicians involved are reporting this case in the event that this may be a case of vaccine-induced myocarditis, although no diagnosis as such has been made.

                                                Received at 12:15pm. Other than a slightly sore arm nothing until 6pm.  Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

Due to a combination of pregnancy (delivered 2/2014) and subsequently two Morena IUDs, I have not even had spotting since 2013.  For three days, I had period-like blood and cramping.  I reported this during my routine rheumatologist appointment who told me to report it here. Additionally, I had pain in the arm for three days as expected from the literature about side effects from the trials.  I am scheduled to have my second dose on 2/4/21 and will report any other side effects.

Pt was feeling well this morning before she came to COVID vaccine clinic. Pt had received first Moderna Vaccine shortly before 0918am here. At 0938 Pt noted feeling &#34;heaviness&#34; in head and &#34;lump in throat.&#34; Pt denied itching/swelling to mouth, itching/hives to body, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea. No lightheadedness/dizziness. Pt walked to stretcher. BP at right forearm was 223/151 and then 221/132 on repeat. Heartrate in 90s. Sao2 on RA 100%. RR 18. Pt notes having high BPs at times, but not often as high here. Pt speaking is slightly hoarse voice. No strider. Pt speaking in full sentences. No oropharyngeal edema. No urticaria. No tachypnea or wheeze. HRT RRR. 2&#43; left rad pulse.  A/P: given Pt&#39;s h/o severe allergies and now new Globus sensation and change to voice I discussed with Pt that she was likely having allergic reaction. Given involvement of airway I recommended epi administration to neutralize reaction and transfer to ED for observation. I advised Pt that epi would increase heartrate and blood pressure. I determined benefit of treating anaphylaxis outweighed risk of elevating BP, even though she has hypertensive urgency BP values. Pt has some headache; she could be bordering on hypertensive emergency. I asked pharmacist to call 911 indicating early anaphylaxis and request of paramedic.  ~5 minutes after Epi (given at 0942) Pt notes lump sensation and voice improved. I had RN place IV to left AC and gave verbal order for benadryl 25mg IV. Pt notes some nausea and dizziness. Lump sensation continues to improve. EMS arrived ~0950. I gave report to paramedic.  I discussed with Pt that I would place referral to Allergy and Immunology; they will determine if and when Pt could receive second moderna vaccine.

                                                She had pain in the injection site Tuesday night and then during Tuesday she got worse with nausea and some fever.  By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

                                                Patient began experiencing pain and difficulty walking on Tuesday, March 23. Later that afternoon she was taken to an Urgent care, who sent her to the ER for evaluation. She was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in her leg, spanning from just above the knee to her groin area. They admitted her and began treating her with blood thinners.  While undergoing that treatment, her heart stopped 3 times and she had to be resuscitated. They discovered a pulmonary embolism.  While removing a large clot from her lungs, the doctor found that her lungs were riddled with hundreds of tiny blood clots. They also said that she was bleeding internally, very heavily, from an unknown location. In all, they gave her 20 units of blood, and none of it stayed in her veins. The doctor said it seemed to just disintegrate.  At that point, her brain and organs had begun shutting down and family made the decision to remove her from life support. She passed away Thursday evening, March 25, 2021.

                                                I contacted my primary care office after experiencing a tender knot on my calf for a couple of days that also became reddened on the skin surface.  It was determined by ultrasound that I had a small, superficial blood clot in my lower right calf on June 3rd. We treated the blood clot at home with a compression stocking, elevation and heat, and I had a follow-up ultrasound on June 10th that indicated no change in clot location or size. I continued with home treatment and did not have any further complications. The pain and redness have resolved since that time. Prior to this pregnancy I have had two healthy pregnancies and one miscarriage at 8 weeks between those two. I delivered my third child on June 14, 2021 via C-section without complications. Baby weight was 6 lbs 15.5 oz.

                                                Excessive, heavy menstrual bleeding from March to June without stop (bled daily for the better part of 4 months). Presence of clots discharging from my body when I used toilet or showered. Heavy cramping and pain. Stopped my period mid June and then started around July 4 with heavy cramps, bleeding and clots which then lasted 5 days and stopped.   Prior to this, I did not hardly have a period because I have an IUD with hormones. (Morena)
