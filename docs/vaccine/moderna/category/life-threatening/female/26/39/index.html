                                                I was given Moderna vaccine first dose in right arm. Sat down in observing area, within a few minutes I had a weird feeling, felt queezy. As soon as I felt queezy I passed out. I woke up they said within about 30 seconds and had full body sweats. Stomach ache, dizzy and head was tingly like I would pass out again. My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

At 2:00 pm, I tried to sit up in my bed - I proceeded to throw up and faint. I contacted doctor to see if I should take anything. I took an ibuprofen and drank fluid - but didn&#39;t drink as much as normal because of nausea. I was nauseated all day. It stayed about 102 until about 8:00 pm. At about 10:00 pm that night, I started feeling a bit better. The next day fever was 99.7 and with more ibuprofen it normalized to 98.6. If I didn&#39;t take ibuprofen for awhile it went back up to 99. something so I had to keep taking ibuprofen for the rest of that third day. Fourth day - mild fatigue and muscle aches. Everything was normal other than that. Fatigue and muscle aches were gone about Friday morning.

No appetite. Struggled to read and process things. Could not work. Sharp pains in lymph nodes at various times throughout the day. Chest felt very tight and arm hurt to the point I thought I might be having a heart attack. Had trouble sleeping due to lymph node pain. Ibuprofen did not help. The arm pain at injection site was annoying but I barely noticed it due to my other symptoms.

Staff reported her slumping over in a chair. Prior to the vaccination she informed the vaccinator she has had episodes of fainting with vaccination in the past notably to Gardasil.The vaccinator who was a physician lowered her to the ground in a trendelenburg  position with her legs up in a chair. Patient quickly regained consciousness with a pulse of 65. She appeared pale, diaphoretic, but alert and oriented x4.  She was provided with a cold pack, apple juice and crackers.

                                                Starting about 1 minute after vaccination I became extremely dizzy, blacked out/lost vision, had shortness of breath and a tight chest, lost feeling in my hand and fingers on my left side (the side I got the vaccine), was sweating but felt cold flowing through my body. These feelings lasted for about 30 minutes and my vision and feeling in my fingers and hand came back as the dizziness subsided and my body temp returned to normal.   Around 40 minutes after the vaccine I started experiencing echoing in my left ear (the side I got the vaccine on) and soreness around the vaccination site.   The echoing in my left ear lasted about 30 minutes and then subsided. The arm pain spread to the rest of my arm and I began to get a headache.  About 4 hours after the vaccine I began to experience intense back, hip, foot and hand pain making me unable to do any regular activities. The back pain feels like intensely sharp pain in my spine and hurts to the gentle touch. I previously had no back pain prior to the vaccine. The muscles surrounding my spine up to my shoulders were also painful/sore.  This pain subsided after 6 days. On about the 4th day after the vaccine I began experiencing underarm and breast pain on the side I got the vaccine.  It is now exactly 1 week since my vaccination and I am still experiencing the underarm and breast pain.  I have experienced lethargy since vaccination.

After 30 minutes, we came back to give the pt her vaccination card and as soon as she stood up, she fell slowly onto the floor and started having seizure (pt didn&#39;t hit her head per technician on scene) around 3:50 pm and became unconscious for a few seconds. She was able to answer our questions when she woke up, but was confused of where she at. She continued to call out random names.  We called the ambulance and assisted her while she was on the floor.  She had another seizure 5 minutes after the first seizure and became unconscious again for a few more seconds. After she woke up, we placed her on her side and monitored her pulse rates and her breathing while on the phone with 911 personnel.  The paramedic came 10 mins after the call. Pt had a history of seizure (she wore epileptic tag around her neck). Pt was taken by paramedic to the nearest hospital for further observation.

Around 8:30 pm I experienced extreme chills and had a 100-101 F fever all night. I woke in the morning still feeling weak because I spent the whole night uncomfortable from the fever and flushed  face I had. I walked towards another part of my house and fell down and fainted. I was unconscious for a few seconds before a family member was able to shake me and wake me up. I take no medications and am a generally healthy individual with no prior medical history or underlying Heath conditions. I also do not have a history of falls or issues from taking any past vaccines. I also am not allergic to anything or have experienced any allergic reactions in my life. It?s the second day now and I am still experiencing a 100 Degree fever and face flushing. I am currently self medicating at home with Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not gone to see a health care professional yet.

Not clear what was being asked in previous page for address - of doctor or vaccination site. I had vaccine at 730-740am and by 430pm, I had heavy onset symptoms of body aches, chills, fever etc. I took 1000mg of Tylenol and began feeling better. Still exhausted so I went to bed around 630pm but because I was pushing so much fluid, I kept getting up to pee. I was still freezing. Around 940pm, I woke up to pee and again freezing still. I sat on the toilet and started having full body convulsions and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor. My husband found me passed out, face first on the tile floor with my pants still down. I hit the left side of my face very hard. My husband helped me to bed where I took more ibuprofen and tremored for the next hour before I fell asleep. I woke up completely drenched and sweat and with a headache.

The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen. Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

My arm was immediately hot and tender after administration. The area around the injection site had less feeling than the rest of my arm - it felt almost numb. My arm was very sore and warm the rest of the evening. I began having fatigue, muscle aches, and joint pain last night as well. I woke up around 6 this morning and the room was spinning. I was also nauseous. I tried to roll over in bed but was unable to feel my arms and legs. I was also temporarily unable to see. Right after, I passed out and lost urinary continence. I regained consciousness a minute later and had normal functioning again. I have not had any more dizziness today but am still sore and fatigued.

She was taken by EMS to the  Emergency Department and evaluated, here it was discovered that she has a history of nonepileptic seizure episodes and the Physician Assistant providing care did not think this episode was &#34;measureable allergic reaction to her vaccination however perhaps the stress and worry of having this shot just prior to her symptoms&#34;.  Followed up with the employee today and she is having expected side effects from vaccine administration (body aches, fever up to 102-103, and headache), no further seizure like activity.

Approx 10 am she left the IMZ room and about halfway through the store, she fainted. CSM said the fell outside of patient&#39;s room and did not seem to hit her head or neck. 911 wasn&#39;t called because she came to right away. They got her water and a chair. I was brought over approx 10:10 am. I talked with her and she seemed cognitive, lucid and understands who she is, where she is and what happened. She said she waited the 15 min and felt totally fine but then she got up and fell about halfway through store. Approx 10:20 am we brought her over to pharmacy area for more privacy and RPH checked her BP. reported 130/90. I asked patient if she wanted the paramedics called just in case of a head injury. I asked her before palpating her head and neck. She said she felt no pain, no visible bleeding or lacerations, no inflammation or redness and she has full mobility in her neck with no pain. Patient said she did not want paramedics called and instead called her mother in law who lives nearby to see if they can come get her. She is worried about  40 min drive home. Pt overall physically seemed fine. She was just shaken, nervous and embarrassed as she&#39;s never had something like this happen before. She waited for about 20 mins until her father in law came and picked her up. I updated him of the situation and they left together.

My partner was with me and said that after I got up I began shaking and he helped me to the ground where I continued to &#34;shiver&#34;, as he called it, for another few seconds before going limp. Once I came to (a few seconds later) I felt very confused at where I was and had a pounding headache and my ears were ringing loudly. It was all I could focus on. After that my partner helped me to bed where he continued to check on me and I slept for 5 hours.

This writer instructed her to sit down.  This writer then requested assistance from RN.  As RN approached where patient was sitting, patient stated &#34;yeah I&#39;m going to faint&#34; she then fell forward from her chair onto the floor, with the top of her head hitting the floor first.  RN instructed staff to call the Rapid Response Team who was unavailable.  This writer gathered the anaphylaxis/reaction supplies that were on hand.  Patient&#39;s body postured and at that time RN rolled her onto her side.  Patient quickly regained consciousness.  Vitals were taken and stable. Patient was given the opportunity to be seen in the ED multiple times but she declined.   She stated that her lips felt &#34;tingly&#34; and was given 50mg/20mL Diphenhydramine oral solution.  She remained in the COVID vaccination clinic at Medical Center for observation for 40 minutes, at which time her husband retrieved her and escorted her home.

I was not having stomach issue nor did I have a fever. I had eaten and drank enough fluids before and after the vaccine. I could feel that I was going to faint and started to sit down, luckily I did not fit my head only had a bruise on my forearm and hip. I woke up quickly and family members were nearby to help me slowly sit up. I did not faint anymore after this. I was very fatigued for the next 2 days. I contacted my health care provider, but did not need to be seen or treated. Medical History with fainting: I have fainted before, once in my teens when I had a very high fever and once after my first pap smear (vagal response).

I was sitting on the couch, and my partner noticed I have having a seizure, he lowered to me to the ground and called the ambulance. My seizure lasted for 1 minute.  When I was in the ER, they gave me 2 bags of fluids, they did an X-ray, CT scan, blood work, and UA, they reported to me that all the result were normal. They did not send me home with any medications. However, they did not clear me to drive. They said that I need to get cleared by a neurologist before I can drive, so that?s why I have not been back to work?

I contacted my provider and I was instructed to take a pregnancy test, which was positive. I went in for an exam on the 12th and they confirmed that I was indeed pregnant. They tested my Beta Hcg twice. I didn&#39;t get my results immediately due to one site being closed due to COVID. I could&#39;ve gone to the hospital and received the results immediately, but my doctor didn&#39;t want to take the chance due to the hospital having a lot of COVID. They confirmed that I was pregnant on the 19th or 20th. I bled for a few days after that. The final Beta Hcg was done and my level was 0.

                                                On the day following my second dose, I woke up with a headache around 6am (expected this may happen and took Tylenol). A little before noon my partner and I got in the car to run an errand. In the car I started to feel worse and I fainted. I was out for about 30 seconds according to my partner. I came to and had my vitals checked at an urgent care center (all vitals WNL). During this episode in the car I think I also had chills. The onslaught of symptoms in the car lasted only about an hour before resolving. I continued to have a off and on headache for the rest of the day but other symptoms resolved. By Sunday I was pretty much back to normal; any headache symptoms were pretty much resolved. I am not sure if the fainting episode was related to vaccine or not. I have had fainting episodes in the past (2-3x at dentist office and 1x at optometrist when having eye pressure checked).

                                                I was having intense chest pain, weakness/faintness feeling a few days after second dose of Moderna vaccine. I went into the ER after 4th day of pain.   ER did a CT scan and found a couple blood clots in my right lung (pulmonary embolisms) along with tissue  on lung. An ultrasound of my heart and legs were done to find the source of these blood clots and neither tests found blood clots or indicators that this is where they originated.   I am currently in blood thinners in order to reduce the clots.

I was instructed to wait in my car for 15 minutes to monitor myself. At about 3:02PM while waiting in my vehicle, I became dizzy and lightheaded and blacked out for approximately 30 seconds. I walked myself back into the clinic and notified the registration desk and a physician assistant came to assist me. They took my blood pressure and O2 levels, which were all were in normal ranges.

Broke out in a cold sweat. Started to loose consciousness. Arms (middle-upper) to my hands began to tingle and went numb. I lost muscle control in both of my hands and my fingers were very stiff, I could not move them. My feet and lower legs were also tingly. I felt nauseous and in need of the toilet. I was able to crawl to the bathroom at which point I had diarrhea. I regained feeling and motor control of my hands shortly after but continued to experience extreme light headed ness for the next hour.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

Pt states felt almost like an &#34;out of body&#34; experience, but she did feel pressure to the left side of her head as she fell off of her chair and her head hit the floor. This fall was witnessed by another patient, who flagged the medical staff for help. A medical assistant notified me of the incident and I went to examine the patient, who was sitting on the floor, alert and conscious. I asked the staff to get the patient an ice pack, which was placed to patient&#39;s forehead and back of neck, and glass of water. Patient is able to swallow.

No tenderness upon palpation to patient&#39;s head, face and neck/c-spine. No visible contusions, abrasions noted. Normal ROM of all extremities and normal sensation.

My husband heard and ran to the bathroom. He held me and I fainted again in his arms. He called 911, while the medics were on the way I threw up very dry and hard throw up. I started to feel a little better after that. Medics said everything looked ok and did not take me to the hospital. The following morning we went to the hospital, got a cat scan and everything luckily came up fine. Currently, I have a terrible ear ringing and muffledness from the concussion.

                                                Patient presents to the clinic at about 2:20pm for her 2nd dose of COVID vaccination. She was greeted and asked to fill out another consent form for the 2nd dose and was told it will be reviewed after she completes it. She states she has a history of seizure. State had one small seizure episode yesterday. States her doctor is aware and is running more tests and changing her medications around. States her doctor is aware about her COVID vaccination and made no mention that she should not get the vaccine. She states she is comfortable getting it. She states she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and did ok. The only symptoms she had was fever for about a week. Again she states her doctor is aware and has not told her not to get the second dose of the COVID vaccine.  Consent and history were reviewed and COVID vaccination was given at about 14:27 with LVN. She was told because of her medical history, she will need to be monitored for 30minutes instead of the 15 minutes; she agreed.  After vaccination was given, patient sat with another co-worker talking and appeared in no distress. Co-worker left shortly after while she was still there for monitoring.  At about 2:30ish pm notice that patient was starting to slide down her chair appearing to have a seizure. Immediately rushed over to her, guided her down to the carpet, supported her head, she was lying to her side. She was not conscious, eyes closed, teeth clenched, no foaming of the mouth were noted. &#43;strong radial pulse. Can hear her loudly breathing through her nose. Pulse oxygen on room air, 92% and heart rate was 67. She was not turning blue. Arms and legs were mild jerking. Called out to have staff called 911 simultaneously while supporting and monitoring patient. About 5 minutes into this, patient started to slowing open her eyes, still altered, teeth still clenching and extremities stopped jerking. Slowly, she started to relax, asked her name and where she is at and why she was there, which she was able to answer slowly. Asked her if she wanted us to call her daughter, she said he because she is a minor. Asked her who she is with and she said her husband is outside.  Paramedic arrived and took over care and she was told she will be transported to the ER.  Her husband, came into the room. After patient&#39;s husband spoke to paramedic, I also introduced myself to him. Per her husband, patient has a history of seizure that has not been controlled. Per husband, he states she had 5 episodes on Sunday, 3/21/2021. Her doctor is aware and is doing more testing and changing her medications around. Per patient&#39;s husband, he states she was doing an MRA yesterday to further evaluate the seizure and they were not able to complete it because she had 2 episodes. When asked if her doctor mention anything about getting the COVID vaccine, per patient&#39;s husband he states they did not say anything. Per husband, she did ok with the 1st dose of the COVID vaccine and only had fevers. Per patient&#39;s husband, there was no change in her underlying medical condition with the seizure with getting the vaccine.

                                                severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis; hallucinations; accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml; nightly terrors; fear of dying; intermittent delusions that children were taken away; intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin; This case was received via an unknown source (no reference has been entered for a health authority or license partner) on 17-Mar-2021 and was forwarded to Moderna on 17-Mar-2021.    This spontaneous case was reported by a pharmacist and describes the occurrence of HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) and ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) in a 30-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch no. 031A21A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     The patient&#39;s past medical history included No adverse event (Medical history was not provided).    On 17-Mar-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 3 milliliter. In March 2021, the patient experienced SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin). On 17-Mar-2021, the patient experienced ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) (seriousness criterion hospitalization) and ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml). On 24-Mar-2021, the patient experienced HALLUCINATION (hallucinations) (seriousness criterion medically significant). The patient was hospitalized from 17-Mar-2021 to 18-Mar-2021 due to ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. In March 2021, ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION (severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis) had resolved. On 17-Mar-2021, ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE (accidentally given a 3 ml dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine instead of 0.5 ml) had resolved. At the time of the report, HALLUCINATION (hallucinations), SLEEP TERROR (nightly terrors), FEAR OF DEATH (fear of dying), DELUSION (intermittent delusions that children were taken away) and FORMICATION (intermittent delusions that the vaccine was inside her and crawling through her skin) outcome was unknown.        The action taken with mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) was unknown.   For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   The patient did not have any psychological history; this was the first time she experienced hallucinations.  Treatment for the severe allergic reaction/anaphylaxis included intravenous steroids and hydrocortisone.  Treatment for hallucinations included droperidol and lorazepam.  Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event (anaphylactic reaction), a causal relationship cannot be excluded. Very limited information regarding the events (Hallucination, anaphylactic reaction, sleep terror, fear of death, delusion, and formication) has been provided at this time. This report refers to a case of (accidental overdose) for mRNA-1273, lot # 031A21A. Further information has been requested.

This lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes. For the next several hours the patient was light headed/ dizzy. The patient also felt short of breath, more so with activity.  At around 9PM, the patient took diphenhydramine 50mg x 1 and acetaminophen 1000mg x1. The patient then laid down for the evening and awoke around 10 AM feeling much better.

                                                Just over 24 hours after I received the COVID-19 vaccine I had a syncope episode while standing talking to others at work. I began feeling hot, started feeling like I was sweating, started seeing black and white lines, and then fainted. The symptoms came on very quickly. I did not remember falling and we believe I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell, and I had to get 3 staples in my head. I have no other medical concerns at this time, and all of the test run at the ER showed no concerns. At the ER they ran labs, took a CT scan, and did an EKG. I was released from the ER after about 4 hours. I have had a 3 other episode previously when I felt like I was going to pass out, most recent March 2020, but they were linked to the flu and strep. This event has not been linked to either of those conditions at this time, and my doctor encouraged me to report it.

                                                Developed dizziness and nausea within 90minutes of vaccine; then developed tingling, and flushing of my skin. Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

Pharmacist attended to her, and after some questioning she exhibited signs of Anaphylaxis. At 1:56 an Epipen 0.3 mg/0.3 ml dose was administered and 911 called. At 2:00 we checked her BP and it was 132/78 and pulse 95. A few minutes later, before a second check of BP was done, the EMT took over.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

We kept the patient on the floor as she was light headeed and not very responsive. At that time, 911 was called.  She was taken tp the ER and discardged the same evening.

It started as spotting that night, (I never spot) then a gradually heavier flow, working up to an unusually heavy &amp; painful period over the course of the next 2 days. Also some very light clotting, which rarely happens for me. I was not due for my period for 2.5 weeks. My cycle is extremely regular and has never deviated from 28-31 days in the last 6&#43; years. I have a copper IUD (for 6 years), and have never been pregnant.

We called 911 and I talked with her after she came to and until paramedics arrived. She was sweating and just felt out of it right away. Pulse and blood pressure were low when paramedics took her vitals. Within 10 minutes of assessment vitals were back normal and they told her she could go home. I called and followed up today and she stated she woke up this morning feeling &#34;normal&#34; and she thinks the episode was related to her hormones and not the vaccine.

                                                Patient reported in chart notes a history of fainting after vaccinations. Pharmacist asked patient about this before administering vaccine, and patient said she often faints in regards to blood draws or vaccines. Patient was prepared to sit in waiting area for at least 15 minutes. Patient was given vaccine and pharmacist confirmed patient was feeling okay. Patient returned to waiting area to sit, then allegedly decided to stand up and go to the in-window when beginning to feel faint. She fainted in this process. RPh and store manager immediately rushed to patient, who returned to consciousness right away. Patient stated to RPh that she did not hit her head nor did she have any pain in her legs or trouble breathing. She felt  mostly embarrassed. Store manager called paramedics, who arrived, examined patient, and the patient let them leave and proceeded to shop in the store aisles until her husband arrived.

At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

However, light bleeding/spotting started that night/next day but thought still normal.  Heavier bleeding started 2/6/21 (Saturday) and continued through the weekend. Made appointment at hospital lab for Monday 2/8 to check HcG levels in blood.  See below for details, but Dr. suggested repeat blood work on 2/10 as Hcg levels showed positive pregnancy, but very low.  2/10 Hcg levels slightly lower, which confirmed early miscarriage occurring.

I took a home pregnancy test the week of 1/3/2021, which came back positive.  On 1/17/2021, I started having some spotting and saw my OBGYN on 1/18/2021.  My OBGYN did a transvaginal ultrasound and estimated I was about 5 weeks pregnant.  I went for bloodwork prescribed by my OBGYN on 1/18 and 1/20 to measure my HcG levels.  By 1/20-1/21 the bleeding became heavy and my HcG levels dropped.  I had a follow up appointment with my OBGYN on 2/3/2021 where they performed another transvaginal ultrasound and more bloodwork to confirm that I had miscarried.

                                                At 1:17 PM, I received the vaccine. Around 1:30 PM I started itching and breaking out in hives. I did not say anything because I thought it was my eczema reacting to my nerves. I went home and felt fine for a while. Around 5:30 PM I told my husband my stomach hurt and I had a slight headache, and I was going to lie down. Around 8:30 PM I woke up. Around 11 PM I was feeling kind of light-headed but did not say anything to my husband because I just thought it was my thoughts. I went to bed. Around 3:45 AM I woke up feeling sick, went to bathroom in master bedroom and dry heaved. I returned to the bed from our bathroom, and told my husband I thought I was going to pass out. I have no recollection of the following events, this is information my husband (Brian) shared with me. He said I then stayed standing on the floor, laid my head over on my pillow, and started breathing heavily, and it became progressively heavier to where he stated I sounded like a &#34;wart hog.&#34; He said he jokingly said to me, &#34;Are you mutating,&#34; then I collapsed onto our bedroom floor. He said he got up immediately, was saying my name as he was walking to me, and I was not responding. He then got on the floor by me, and was rubbing me and trying to wake me, and it took about a minute before I came to. When I came to I was laying on our floor, keep in mind I feel approximately 5 feet as our bed sits 4 to 4.5 feet in the air, and I am 5&#39;8&#34;. I hit my hit on our floor, and when I came to I could barely hear him calling my name as there was a loud rushing noise like water in my head. It took about 2-3 minutes before the ringing was completely gone. I then had cold chills off and on for the next 24 hours with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. On Tuesday following the initial encounter, I went to the ER due to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe headache on right side of head. The ER doctor diagnosed me after a CT with a closed head injury that occurred at initial encounter, so Thursday around 4 AM.

I informed patients that if they wanted to, they can both enter room together. Both patients were counseled on side effects/ what to expect. Patient was administered the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine first in left arm. Upon vaccination, patient&#39;s arm began to bleed from injection site. I informed patient I would clean her arm, and attempted to hold gauze in place myself. Patient stated she would hold the gauze instead. After applying bandaid and cleaning area, I began process to vaccinate her husband. While vaccinating husband, patient stated she felt dizzy/faint. Patient sat in chair. Husband stated she is prone to fainting spells. I offered EMS services.Husband refused. I elevated patient&#39;s legs with other chair. Patient started to become non-responsive.

The patient&#39;s medical history included depression. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) since 2014.  The patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039K20A) on 12 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 028L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine the patient, had experienced cardiac issues.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient started experiencing chills and passed out for 40 seconds (secs). The patient had visited the emergency room (ER) and EKG (electrocardiogram) showed slight abnormality. She was given heart monitor for 14 days. She was scheduled for Stress test and Echo. She was on antipsychotic medications for seven years. She was curious whether the antipsychotic drugs caused the cardiac abnormalities in response to Covid-19 vaccine. Treatment information was not provided. The adverse event of passed out for 40 secs was assessed as medically significant.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events chills and cardiac issues was unknown. Outcome of the event passed out for 40 secs was recovered on 11 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Adverse event (not reported previously): Anemia symptoms became so severe that my physician recommended that I avoid driving and either seek emergency treatment or schedule iron infusion within 3 days. I became extremely dizzy and short of breath with visual disturbances. My doctor hypothesized that my reaction to the vaccine had caused this rapid deterioration in my health.

When I sat down, my blood pressure dropped and the room started spinning and I could feel that I was going to lose consciousness. My husband came to help and watched as I passed out cold on the toilet for over a minute. 15 hours after receiving the shot, I passed out again on the toilet with the same symptoms before losing consciousness. I was unable to get up without passing out for over 16 hours after receiving the shot. I had continued dizziness and muscle weakness for over 24 hours, along with flu-like symptoms as expected.

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

She then reported feeling lightheaded and tingling in her lips. I assisted her to the floor and had her lay down. She reported feeling feverish and she was warm to the touch, but her temperature was 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Her O2 was at 99%. She briefly lost consciousness around 6:55pm as evidenced by her not responding to my questions or to me roughly shaking her arm. She regained consciousness within a couple seconds. Patient then reported a sudden headache at 6:57pm. EMS arrived at 7:01pm. The patient left with EMS.

                                                Within five minutes of my vaccination  I started to feel very dizzy and my eyesight became blurry. I told my husband who had also been vaccinated that I thought something was wrong and within a seconds I then passed out and he caught me. I vomited twice in the span of the next ten minutes and I was not alert for any of that time-no recollection of being able to see or hear. My husband stated my eyes were open and pupils very  dilated. He was able to get me to the ground with the help of the pharmacist who had administered the vaccine. 911 was called and by the time they arrived I became coherent enough to talk and interact. I declined a hospital visit because I had no interest in a ambulance ride but did follow up with my primary. No history of ever fainting or medical anxiety.

                                                I received the moderna covid vaccine at approx 0930 and waited in waiting room of facility per policy after injection.  I felt ok once wait time was up so I left.  I was driving approx 15 min later and (which was approx 30) after administration and pulled over to side of road due to getting chills and shaking and feeling faint.  Also, the left side of my face went numb and tingling.   I called for an ambulance and once they arrived I had started feeling normal again.  Facial tingling still persists at this time hours later.  I also had another sync opal episode once I got a ride home that resolved.  Left side of face feels like after being numb from a dentist.

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

                                                Patient has a previous history of seizure disorder. She received the vaccination and proceeded to the waiting area. While there she reported to staff embers that she could feel a seizure coming on. She was moved to the floor in a safe location and monitored. She was able to contact her spouse to bring her medication. She began to seize and at one point she did lose consciousness. She regained consciousness and improved rapidly afterwards. EMS was called, but she declined the service. She said that these seizures aren&#39;t uncommon and she wanted to go home to recover.

                                                Initially tasted metal, numb mouth, flushing, later resulting in all flu like symptoms (severe chilling, fever, body aches, headaches and GI issues.) GI issues persisted for the next 3 weeks and on Thursday evening, 2/25/2021 at about 6:30 pm. I was sitting on floor with children and almost passed out. I felt very faint, dizzy, and instantly started chilling. I had a fever of 102.8 and could not get warm. My husband was going to call paramedics, but I encouraged him not to. Discovered my right breast was red and inflamed/ swollen as well as all of my lymph nodes in my right arm pit. I could not reach my right arm forward. I noticed around 12:06 AM after not being able to get warm or break fever. I messaged my primary care clinic when I noticed the breast swelling, redness, pain, and lymph node swelling. I continually felt like I was going to faint/pass out and was very dizzy all night long. I was also extremely fatigued. The did a telemedicine appointment the next morning and diagnosed me with mastitis and prescribed me antibiotics. I am a breastfeeding mother and all of these symptoms came on suddenly and severely on the same side that I got the vaccine shot. I have been breastfeeding for over 7 months and my supply has been dwindling to nothing so I have no problems with engorgement or blocked milk ducts. Before this baby I had just got done breastfeeding a baby for 11 months with no issues of the like.

My period seemed to slow down almost completely while my symptoms were happening, and then my period resumed with abnormal cramping and clotting after my symptoms were gone.

When I got out of bed, and went to the bathroom, everything went white and I fell. I was able to get up on my own but had to lay back down. I thought I would be unable to go to work but after resting for about 15 minutes, I was able to get up, finish getting ready for work but continued to get lightheaded if I stood in one spot for too long. I was very tired and out of it the rest of the day, and having chills throughout the day. All of this in addition to my arm being very sore and my back hurt from my fall. I also had a very bad headache, and later in the day, around 430pm, my temp was 100.2.  I took tylenol and went to bed around 630.

Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

                                                At the time of my first vaccine on 1/14/21 I was 9 weeks pregnant and on lovenox for DVT and progesterone for pregnancy maintenance. On 2/5/21 I miscarried the baby and ended up hemmoraging thus requiring a blood transfusion. The fetus was sent to pathology and I was informed that at 12 weeks when I miscarried that the baby had termed at 9 weeks which was the time of my first vaccine injection.

Sunday the pain went from the left side of my neck down to the base of my ribs and then progressed to include the back and chest almost constantly instead of just on inhalation.  I went to the ER on Sunday evening, assuming very bad costochondritis; however, was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the left lung, areas of possible infarction, and pleurisy.  I had a CT scan at a Medical Center prior to receiving the Moderna vaccine for a suspected PE and it was negative.

                                                Patient had first dose of Moderna COVID vaccination on 1/5/21 and experienced a syncopal episode approximately 10 minutes post administration. She was found to have a low blood sugar (approx. 70) at the time of the syncope. She had her second dose of Moderna COVID vaccination on 2/2/21. Her starting blood sugar displayed on her pump (type 1 diabetic with insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor) was 172 after approximately 20 minutes her blood sugar had dropped to 92, she ate approximately 100 grams of carbs starting at 10 minutes after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Her blood sugar stabilized and remained in the mid nineties after 45 minutes. Her vital signs were stable and she left stating she didn&#39;t feel any signs of low blood glucose. Her pump also indicated that her blood sugar was no longer dropping.

I have had vasovagal events in the past and this was exactly like them, only normally they are triggered by an event, and there was no event so I assume it was the vaccine. After sleeping it off under multiple blankets for a couple hours I seem to be recovered and just have a headache.

She was placed in wheelchair with book in the living room.  caregivers noted she was not turning pages of the book as she usually would.  She was tracking, so they don&#39;t think she had a seizure.  Caregiver moved her back to bed with blanket and noted that her lips were blue and at that point called 911.  She was found with agonal breathing, CPR started, intubated by EMS,  taken to the ER and diagnosed with cardiac arrest upon arrival.  CPR was continued until family could be reached and decision was made to stop resuscitation.

                                                Shortly after my vaccine, I experienced a copper taste in my mouth, felt dizzy and I indicated to a paramedic that I was not feeling well. I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

                                                I had only pain at the injection site after the first dose on February 12. I got my second dose on Friday, March 12 at 1pm and woke up at 2am Saturday  with debilitating headache and severe nausea . I took tylenol and fell back asleep. I woke up again around 6am with the same severe headache and excruciating  pain in my left arm at the injection site and tried to get up to get some ibuprofen. I felt extremely dizzy and could barely walk which ended up in me fainting in the kitchen. I somehow got back to bed, took ibuprofen and went back to sleep. I started feeling better after that, severe headache went away but I had low grade fever, chills, slight nausea and painful arm the whole Saturday up until Sunday morning. I had dizziness on Sunday, was very tired on Monday and still felt weak on Tuesday but after that I recovered and experienced no more symptoms.

At 7:30am (about 19 hours post-injection), I experienced slight numbness and tingling in my hands and feet. I used the restroom and lost consciousness before I could stand up. My husband witnessed my loss of consciousness and reports that I was unconscious for 1-2 minutes. I returned to bed, rested, took a nap, and when I awoke about 1pm (almost 24 hours post-injection), all of my symptoms except fatigue had ceased.

                                                This spontaneous case was reported by a nurse (subsequently medically confirmed) and describes the occurrence of DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) in a 37-year-old female patient who received mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (batch nos. 011M20A and 011J20A) for COVID-19 vaccination. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) and TOPIRAMATE (TOPAMAX) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, the patient experienced TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird). On 03-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma) and ASTHENIA (Could not get up). On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg) and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg), TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia), DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma), CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg), ASTHENIA (Could not get up), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine), HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Haemoglobin: low gram per litre (Low) LOW. In March 2021, Red blood cell count: low cells per microlitre (Low) LOW.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment informations reported were Levalbuterol tartrate  and Rivaroxaba 20 mg   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059897 (Patient Link).

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

Morning of 1/15/21, pt woke up with difficulty speaking  (would be talking and then unable to articulate words which were replaced by grunting sounds) and tingling to her face. No changes to breathing, no numbness/tingling to extremities, equal facial symmetry. Slow onset of symptoms. Pt went to the ED, where she received a CT, MRI (inconclusive reading), lab work reported as normal per pt, EKG and chest x-ray. Symptoms self resolved while in the ED, however MD staff wanted to admit patient for 24 hours of observation and to complete an echocardiogram. Pt left AMA the evening of 1/15/21 due to resolution of symptoms and wanting to follow up with her cardiologist for the echocardiogram. Pt told by MD staff symptoms were likely caused by either TIA, possible reaction to vaccine or migraine presentation (no report of headaches/auras). Plan was to have patient on blood thinners x 30 days then baby Aspirin thereafter. Pt still needing to follow up with PCP and cardiologist for further work up.

                                                Right after I received the vaccine I went into to 15 minute observation area. Once I sat down I  felt a tingling sensation go from my head to my feet. At that point it started radiating in different areas. The lady next me was also having the same sensation. The nurses brought us both back behind the desk. They got my bp which was 158/88.  It was on the higher side. Then a third lady complained of the same sensation and also was taken back behind the desk. The tingling would not stop and was I was advised to walk around at that point. When I did that the tingling became much worse again. I was given an Allegra and started to feel pressure in my chest. Not pain just a weird sensation. They called a Code Blue on me. Which is what they do when you?re in the outpatient part of the hospital. I was placed on a simple oxygen mask and taken to the ER. When I arrived to the ER I was taken off the oxygen and placed on HR monitor lead and a pulse ox. Both the doctor that arrived first to my code and the ER doctor did a neuro assessment. They did an ekg on me which was normal, but was not done right away. The doctor came in to assess me again. At that time I was having more feeling on my left side. He sent me for a head CT which was read as normal.  I was observed and discharged at around 930pm. I do also have anxiety but what I was feeling was not right. I can?t describe but just a weird tingling all over. It would always get worse when ai would get up and walk. That did not stop until around 9pm. I was also concerned with the fact that two other people were having the same symptoms as me. I have not been to work for two days. I had awful pain in my arm,  I?ve had a horrible headache, nauseous, dry mouth, and I?m extremely fatigued.

Spent a couple hours on a gurney being monitored. My blood pressure (normally low/normal) went up to 170/101. And my heart rate was in the 140s. My oxygen saturation at one point was 82% but I was not having any trouble breathing and was breathing normally. I had a terrible headache and was shaking uncontrollably for about 20 min. Eventually I felt well enough to go to work. About five hours after my shot, I passed out again. I was taken to emergency room. My blood pressure was high and my heart rate was still elevated. They ruled out anything being wrong and eventually sent me home. I had a migraine and fatigue for two days. I felt tired for two weeks. And everything that usually  hurts, hurt extra bad.

                                                Received second COVID vaccine Moderna on Wednesday evening at 6pm.  Later that night, I was a little light-headed and achey, but went to bed. On thursday, my legs and arms were extremely achy. I took Tylenol and Motrin in the morning. It seemed to help some, but continued to feel very achy in my legs. I left work early (I am a pediatrician) on Thursday and went home and just sat and rested.  I felt terrible, but had talked to other colleagues who felt very bad that first day after the shot. Friday morning, I woke up still achy but feeling better overall. I took motrin and Tylenol again on Friday morning. I worked the whole day seeing patients. Was tired, but got thru the workday. At around 6pm, I noticed petechiae rash on my lower legs. The rash started spreading thru the night- up my legs and to my arms. I went to ER. They did order CBC, CMP. Platelets were undetectable- 1 platelet was seen under microscope. CMP was normal.  I was told to go to bigger hospital. I went, My platelets read as 4. I was admitted for two nights. Two doses of IVIG were given and I was put on Decadron 40mg PO daily for 4 days. I had tylenol, benadryl, zofran before the IVIG and after.  I will see Hematology next week for follow up. Platelets yesterday at discharge were 60.  Will be checked frequently for the next few months. ITP= diagnosis. COVID shot was trigger.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

                                                Started abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding at the night of the first vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. That day was my 5th day of my period and there were very few brown spot during the day time as normal.  After dinner, I started feel abdominal cramp and suddenly a lot of blood came out. The bleeding lasted about 1 hour and soaked 5-6 pads.  The next few days had small amount of blood. This situation never happened in my past 20 years period experience before. I had very normal period always lasted about 5-6 days.

I had a syncopal event and my partner found me unconscious on the bathroom floor.  When I fainted I hit my forehead causing a large hematoma.  I also got a laceration on my chin about 2 inches across.   I hit my right cheek as well but no skin was broken just a big bruise.  The chin laceration required stitches.  I have never fainted in my life.  All the medications I am currently taking I have been on for years.

                                                I was trying for a pregnancy and was likely pregnant but not detectable at vaccine number 1. Found out about pregnancy a week or so before vaccine 2.  (I was likely about 5 weeks pregnant then based on LMP of dec 22 with avg cycles of 35 days. Decided to get vaccine due to general advice that it is okay during pregnancy. (No known adverse effects). After dose 2, had about 10-12 hours of chills without fever and general fatigue. Shortly afterwards experienced mild cramps. This is my 5th pregnancy and I have no history of complications of any sort. Cramps are not usual for my pregnancies but I know it can be normal so I did not think anything of it. Mild spotting occurred but again did not think anything of it as I know it can be normal. I was scheduled for a first OB visit  Mar 3 where I should have been 10 weeks. (Initial positive pregnancy test was Jan 29). Ultrasound showed empty 5.6 week gestational sac with a yolk sac and subchorionic hemorrhage.   OB suspected pregnancy failure. We followed pregnancy with ultrasound of better quality 10 days later which showed a possible fetal pole and yolk sac but no heart beat and gestational sac measured at 6.0 weeks. Today March 18 awaiting repeat ultrasound tomorrow but started bleeding and cramping. Consistent with the start of the miscarriage. With no histories of abnormal pregnancies and with the gestational  sac consistently measure at 6 weeks (matching to about the time of shot#2), I am inclined to believe that the second covid shot stopped the progression of my pregnancy. I am a huge pro vaccine health care provider but would recommend now an investigation into first trimester covid vaccinations and possibly not recommend this during that time period.

Started at 6pm with the injection site being very warm and the whole right arm began to heat and swell all joints from knuckles to my neck began aching at a 7 on a 1-10 pain scale. At 6pm the rest of the joints in my body began aching but not as bad as the injection arm. By 10pm I was extremely nauseous and had a steady throbbing headache and was only able to sit as any movement was painful and nauseating. I vomited twice that night. By 6am the next day I was unable to grip or lift anything with the injection arm as moving it all caused intense pressure and pain in that arm a 8.5-9 on the 1-10 scale. By this time my entire body was a steady and constant 8 pain wise. Especially my lower back and hips my joints felt like they were being crushed and pulled apart.  I was unable to get out of bed except 3 times to pee for the entire second day. The pain in the lower back, hips and injection arm increased to the point where I would just cry and yell as it was the worst joint and back pain I have ever had in my life. I tried sleeping most of the day and would wake from the pain.  I have not had a period in about 4 years and had vaginal bleeding like a period that night with abdominal cramping as well. There was nothing that relieved the pain but time. By 10pm the pain finally subsided some and today 1/24 two days post injection the pain is now a constant dull joint ache like a normal flu ache. I am still very sore in the injection arm but can move it today, still causes too much pain and pressure to lift or pull with it. If I sit or stand up for more than 30 minutes my arm begins to throb and the headache and nausea come back.

                                                Approximately five days after the injection, I had my first period since 2013.  Due to a combination of pregnancy (delivered 2/2014) and subsequently two Morena IUDs, I have not even had spotting since 2013.  For three days, I had period-like blood and cramping.  I reported this during my routine rheumatologist appointment who told me to report it here. Additionally, I had pain in the arm for three days as expected from the literature about side effects from the trials.  I am scheduled to have my second dose on 2/4/21 and will report any other side effects.

                                                Pt has h/o HTN (not on medication) and occasional asthma(no hospitalizations), and allergies to Penicillin (tongue swelling), tree nuts (throat swelling), and Bees (local swelling); Pt notes she only takes benadryl for these reactions; she has never been prescribed or used epinephrine. Pt denies heart disease, strokes, diabetes, increased bleeding tendency. No early heart disease in family. LMP in the last week. Pt notes she was supposed to see allergist in past, but has not. Pt was feeling well this morning before she came to COVID vaccine clinic. Pt had received first Moderna Vaccine shortly before 0918am here. At 0938 Pt noted feeling &#34;heaviness&#34; in head and &#34;lump in throat.&#34; Pt denied itching/swelling to mouth, itching/hives to body, dyspnea, chest pain, nausea. No lightheadedness/dizziness. Pt walked to stretcher. BP at right forearm was 223/151 and then 221/132 on repeat. Heartrate in 90s. Sao2 on RA 100%. RR 18. Pt notes having high BPs at times, but not often as high here. Pt speaking is slightly hoarse voice. No strider. Pt speaking in full sentences. No oropharyngeal edema. No urticaria. No tachypnea or wheeze. HRT RRR. 2&#43; left rad pulse.  A/P: given Pt&#39;s h/o severe allergies and now new Globus sensation and change to voice I discussed with Pt that she was likely having allergic reaction. Given involvement of airway I recommended epi administration to neutralize reaction and transfer to ED for observation. I advised Pt that epi would increase heartrate and blood pressure. I determined benefit of treating anaphylaxis outweighed risk of elevating BP, even though she has hypertensive urgency BP values. Pt has some headache; she could be bordering on hypertensive emergency. I asked pharmacist to call 911 indicating early anaphylaxis and request of paramedic.  ~5 minutes after Epi (given at 0942) Pt notes lump sensation and voice improved. I had RN place IV to left AC and gave verbal order for benadryl 25mg IV. Pt notes some nausea and dizziness. Lump sensation continues to improve. EMS arrived ~0950. I gave report to paramedic.  I discussed with Pt that I would place referral to Allergy and Immunology; they will determine if and when Pt could receive second moderna vaccine.

                                                She had pain in the injection site Tuesday night and then during Tuesday she got worse with nausea and some fever.  By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.

                                                Evening of 2nd approximately 6pm diarrhea began with increasing frequency throughout the night. Lasted through the night several times an hour into the next morning.  Around midnight dizziness,, faint and muscle weakness set in with feeling of extreme pressure on neck, especially right side where shot administered. Arms became tingly, tongue became tingly, hard to keep awake.  After 12 hrs of extreme diarrhea, passed out for 12hrs straight. Awoke dehydrated, extreme muscle weakness unable to walk or stand, light headed, nauseous, dizzy, unable to grip or exert force. Felt like head was detached from body due to extreme pressure on neck. Rapid resting heart rate in 90s (usual testing HR in 50s).   Constant rolling waves of abdominal cramps brought dizziness with each cramp, acid reflux, bloating and gas.  These symptoms lasted through the evening of the 3rd into the 4th. Considered going to ER for help, as extreme dizziness and muscle weakness prevented walking. Fell asleep.  6am March 4th developed fever of 101. Continued extreme dizziness, pressure on neck, muscle weakness and feeling faint and extreme lethargy throughout day.  Fever subsided to 99 by evening of 4th.  Ate plain rice evening of 4th, 1st time eating in over 48hrs. Immediately passed out.  Match 5th still feeling weak, hard to stand, limited walking. Diarrhea has subsided, less pressure on neck and less dizziness. Feeling exhausted overall. Fall asleep easily and randomly.

Around 5PM I started having chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting. My arm was so sore i could not lift it al all. At some point around 9PM I passed out on my bathroom floor. My 6 year old found me and thought I had died and called her father crying hysterically. I think I was passed out for a few hours before I came too, as my child had the phone on speaker and her and my husband were both yelling at me to wake up. I crawled back to bed and went to sleep.  The next morning 2/4/21, I could hardly move to get my daughter ready for school, I had to call out of work. I was still having  chills, cold sweats, muscle soreness, nausea, and vomiting, headache, and I could hardly move my left arm.  on 2/5/21 I was still very tired, still had nausea, and a headache. 2/6/21 - 2/7/21 I still had a slight headache.  on 2/8/21 I felt better and went to work.

I felt like crap afterwards and stayed the full 30 minutes too. I had thought maybe it was anxiety, but I&#39;ve broken out all over in hives and I can barely talk now due to how hoarse my throat is. I felt off very quickly post vax and like I was drunk or something after my injection. I have had a high pulse, palpitations, bad headache, jitters, lightheaded/ dizziness, nausea, vomiting, feeling like I have to constantly swallow (and do), and other post vax issues. I have felt very out of it and overall very cruddy.    I hope you&#39;ll respond to this email so that I know it gets reported.  I have taken a lot benadryl and have an EpiPen handy if I ended up needing it. My mouth has been fine, but not my throat.. but it isn&#39;t closing up so I think it&#39;s okay for it to just be swollen. I have had so much going on post vax that I&#39;ve literally just been laying in bed hoping I&#39;ll feel better.   03/12/2021 The hives have come back and the itching hasn&#39;t ever stopped, my tongue is still super swollen and sore from me constantly accidentally biting it, my throat is still red, swollen, and sore, and I generally feel like crap. I&#39;m taking a ton of antihistamines to combat this and they&#39;re not touching it. I am probably going to need more steroids and a visit to urgent care tomorrow.  :(  03/13/2021  The email is too large with the new pics and it got kicked back...trying again minus the body hive pics.   The hives just keep spreading  :( . I know you can&#39;t see them all because the lighting isn&#39;t great, but you can make out the outlines of the welts like on my forehead. I have hives all over my face, throat, neck, chest, arms, and more every day. My whole body is very itchy even in areas without hives.    I am still dealing with: hives/ itchiness, stomach issues, tongue, throat, headache, etc.   I am taking zyrtec twice a day, 50 mg benadryl every 8 hours, a prednisone pack, and a pepcid twice a day. I have my h1, h2, and h3 categories covered along with steroids onboard which is my allergic reaction regimen protocol from my allergist.  I also have my asthma meds which helps with allergies. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t working to keep it from spreading/ continuing or to even keep it at bay. I am trying to hang out until Monday morning for my allergist&#39;s office to open and see if I can get an appt or help via meds called in.   I&#39;ve never had this before in my life! One big bad reaction and then it goes away, not this long dragged out big reaction.  This is crazy!   I figure you probably need this info for the CDC VAERS report, I&#39;m sorry if you didn&#39;t!  Show quoted text 03/14/2021 The hives are even on my feet now ( my whole body either has hives or is itchy). I feel like absolute hell and I am completely regretting this.????  Here I thought the moderna would of been safe for allergic people. I have all of these allergy meds too and nothing is helping, but I&#39;m going to call my doctors first thing when they open and try to get seen tomorrow or at least Tuesday with my allergist.    This is all just so crazy to me! I have had all of my vaccines with no problems too, last one was my tetanus shot and that was within the last 2 years... not one single problem with the exception of injection site soreness for a day.  03/15/2021 I am still going strong with the hives and now I have pneumonia, which I have never had before in my life. :(  The doctor gave me a Z pack, but I can&#39;t take it until after I see the allergist tomorrow and that&#39;s if he says it is safe for me to do so. She is worried it would cause another anaphylactic reaction. We are also worried about the 1 week delayed allergic reaction that people are having now and what that will mean for me when I&#39;m already bad off.    Allergist appt is tomorrow at 245pm.  03/17/2021 I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t update.  I&#39;m still dealing with hives, but they&#39;re getting better. I am still dealing with the heart arrhythmias pretty hard. They are not pleasant to say the least and I am still feeling really wiped out. I am dealing with PVCs for the most part today and some others that I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called (like I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a PAC, PVT, but I do know I&#39;ve had V-tach and PVCs going on).    Hopefully it will get better soon, I&#39;m so over all of this and have things I need to get done LOL!  03/20/21 I am on a 2 week heart monitor now due to the heart issues I&#39;ve been having post vax. I just saw a fb post from a friend and she&#39;s having the same problems after hers. I never posted about the heart issues with mine either and correlation doesnt equal causation of course, but this is interesting and may be of concern so I&#39;m passing it along. The hives are finally gone minus the &#34;moderna arm.&#34;  03/21/20 Dude... this rash started up a tiny bit friday, a little more then went away Saturday, and now it&#39;s coming back in full force! I&#39;m still taking allergy meds too! This is just crazy!

                                                Patient began experiencing pain and difficulty walking on Tuesday, March 23. Later that afternoon she was taken to an Urgent care, who sent her to the ER for evaluation. She was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in her leg, spanning from just above the knee to her groin area. They admitted her and began treating her with blood thinners.  While undergoing that treatment, her heart stopped 3 times and she had to be resuscitated. They discovered a pulmonary embolism.  While removing a large clot from her lungs, the doctor found that her lungs were riddled with hundreds of tiny blood clots. They also said that she was bleeding internally, very heavily, from an unknown location. In all, they gave her 20 units of blood, and none of it stayed in her veins. The doctor said it seemed to just disintegrate.  At that point, her brain and organs had begun shutting down and family made the decision to remove her from life support. She passed away Thursday evening, March 25, 2021.
