As soon as I felt queezy I passed out. I woke up they said within about 30 seconds and had full body sweats. Stomach ache, dizzy and head was tingly like I would pass out again. My calfs hurt like they had previously had muscle cramps. I went to ER, blood and urine tests were fine, heart and blood pressure was fine. Dr said he did not believe it was an allergic reaction, and that it was a stress response. I am not sure if it is because I had COVID in December.

                                                About 7:00 am - fatigue and chills, muscle aches. Starting around noon, my fever was getting higher and higher - to 103. At 2:00 pm, I tried to sit up in my bed - I proceeded to throw up and faint. I contacted doctor to see if I should take anything. I took an ibuprofen and drank fluid - but didn&#39;t drink as much as normal because of nausea. I was nauseated all day. It stayed about 102 until about 8:00 pm. At about 10:00 pm that night, I started feeling a bit better. The next day fever was 99.7 and with more ibuprofen it normalized to 98.6. If I didn&#39;t take ibuprofen for awhile it went back up to 99. something so I had to keep taking ibuprofen for the rest of that third day. Fourth day - mild fatigue and muscle aches. Everything was normal other than that. Fatigue and muscle aches were gone about Friday morning.

I take no medications and am a generally healthy individual with no prior medical history or underlying Heath conditions. I also do not have a history of falls or issues from taking any past vaccines. I also am not allergic to anything or have experienced any allergic reactions in my life. It?s the second day now and I am still experiencing a 100 Degree fever and face flushing. I am currently self medicating at home with Tylenol every 4-6 hours. I have not gone to see a health care professional yet.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not provided. No relevant concomitant medications were reported.   On 23 Dec 2020, prior to the onset of the event, the patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 23 Dec 2020, within five minutes of vaccine administration, the patient experienced anaphylaxis reaction. The patient had symptoms of throat tightness, dizziness, nausea, weakness, and increased heart rate. Treatment for the event included an epinephrine pen  On 29 Dec 2020, the nurse reported that the patient was still having some of the symptoms, including dizziness, nausea, and weakness.  Action taken with mRNA-1273 in response to the event was not reported.  The outcome of the event, anaphylaxis reaction, was considered not resolved.  The reporter assessed the event, anaphylaxis reaction, as related to Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: This case concerns a 28 year old female patient, who experienced a serious unexpected event of anaphylactic reaction. The event occurred apparently 5 min after first dose of mRNA-1273 (Lot# unknown) vaccine administration. She was treated with epinephrine pen.

She was taken by EMS to the  Emergency Department and evaluated, here it was discovered that she has a history of nonepileptic seizure episodes and the Physician Assistant providing care did not think this episode was &#34;measureable allergic reaction to her vaccination however perhaps the stress and worry of having this shot just prior to her symptoms&#34;.  Followed up with the employee today and she is having expected side effects from vaccine administration (body aches, fever up to 102-103, and headache), no further seizure like activity.

Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the onset of the events on the day after vaccination, a causal relationship cannot be excluded and the events are considered possibly related to the vaccine.  The events may be explained by an undiagnosed viral illness based on the constellation of symptoms and elevated monocyte count.

This writer instructed her to sit down.  This writer then requested assistance from RN.  As RN approached where patient was sitting, patient stated &#34;yeah I&#39;m going to faint&#34; she then fell forward from her chair onto the floor, with the top of her head hitting the floor first.  RN instructed staff to call the Rapid Response Team who was unavailable.  This writer gathered the anaphylaxis/reaction supplies that were on hand.  Patient&#39;s body postured and at that time RN rolled her onto her side.  Patient quickly regained consciousness.  Vitals were taken and stable. Patient was given the opportunity to be seen in the ED multiple times but she declined.   She stated that her lips felt &#34;tingly&#34; and was given 50mg/20mL Diphenhydramine oral solution.  She remained in the COVID vaccination clinic at Medical Center for observation for 40 minutes, at which time her husband retrieved her and escorted her home.

                                                I was having intense chest pain, weakness/faintness feeling a few days after second dose of Moderna vaccine. I went into the ER after 4th day of pain.   ER did a CT scan and found a couple blood clots in my right lung (pulmonary embolisms) along with tissue  on lung. An ultrasound of my heart and legs were done to find the source of these blood clots and neither tests found blood clots or indicators that this is where they originated.   I am currently in blood thinners in order to reduce the clots.

I experienced headache and fatigue yesterday afternoon and developed back aches at 2030At 2330, I developed fever (100.5) with chills, nausea, diarrhea and faint feeling. I started blacking out while walking to get water and had to kneel down to the floor to prevent myself from passing out. I had tingling in my hands and feet for an hour after. I took ibuprofen at 0145, and fell asleep around 0230. As of now, I feel back to normal, other than sore arm and lingering fatigue. My fever is gone and temp back down to 98.3. I had COVID back in early December, so I expected this type of immune response with the first vaccine dose.

This lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes. For the next several hours the patient was light headed/ dizzy. The patient also felt short of breath, more so with activity.  At around 9PM, the patient took diphenhydramine 50mg x 1 and acetaminophen 1000mg x1. The patient then laid down for the evening and awoke around 10 AM feeling much better.

                                                Just over 24 hours after I received the COVID-19 vaccine I had a syncope episode while standing talking to others at work. I began feeling hot, started feeling like I was sweating, started seeing black and white lines, and then fainted. The symptoms came on very quickly. I did not remember falling and we believe I hit my head on the corner of a table when I fell, and I had to get 3 staples in my head. I have no other medical concerns at this time, and all of the test run at the ER showed no concerns. At the ER they ran labs, took a CT scan, and did an EKG. I was released from the ER after about 4 hours. I have had a 3 other episode previously when I felt like I was going to pass out, most recent March 2020, but they were linked to the flu and strep. This event has not been linked to either of those conditions at this time, and my doctor encouraged me to report it.

                                                Developed dizziness and nausea within 90minutes of vaccine; then developed tingling, and flushing of my skin. Then rapid heart rate and chest tightness by 2.5hrs post vaccine. I went to urgent Care and they thought it was an allergic reaction (BP 182/90, HR 82) and gave me 125mg solumedrol and Benadryl intramuscularly which caused worsened dizziness and a racing heart which caused me to collapse and they gave me a epi pen and called 911. I was transferred to ER and they completed EKG which was normal and monitored vitals for a few hours and I was released. I continue to remain extremely dizzy and nauseated 2days after the vaccine.

Pharmacist attended to her, and after some questioning she exhibited signs of Anaphylaxis. At 1:56 an Epipen 0.3 mg/0.3 ml dose was administered and 911 called. At 2:00 we checked her BP and it was 132/78 and pulse 95. A few minutes later, before a second check of BP was done, the EMT took over.

                                                Was fine immediately post vaccine. Drove home and proceeded with a normal rest of the day at home. Went to sleep around 10 pm. Woke up at 4 am with my arm very sore. Got up to take meds for my arm pain and once I got to the bathroom felt pale, sweaty, nauseous and had chills, very weak - an overwhelming sense of not feeling right and strong fatigue. I sat on the toilet and went to the bathroom (urination and defecation) but did not have the energy to wipe properly. I stood up and turned on the sink faucet, took my meds  with a few sips of water and next thing I remember is me laying on the bathroom floor confused and with my ears ringing. I figured I had laid down but then I realized the toilet was running and the sink faucet water was still running and I looked in the mirror and had a cut bleeding on my chin that I had no idea was there. Then I realized that I must have passed out while standing at the sink. I put a bandaid on the cut and went back to bed. In the morning when I was able to assess my self better, I realized during my fall/ fainting episode I had bitten my lip, cut my chin, had abrasions on my right thigh and left shoulder and bruised my right knee and some poop in my underwear I hadn&#39;t wiped properlyat the time, that&#39;s how out of it I was. I have never fainted or passed out ever before in my 31 years of life. I live alone and it was a very scary incident for me. Luckily my injuries were minor and I have recovered but I felt like I might die during the episode. My body had a very strong adverse reaction 12 hours post vaccine.

At 5:15 AM the following morning (1/14/21) I experienced lightheadedness and fainted off the toilet hitting my face on the wall/radiator in front of me.  My husband (who witnessed the fainting episode) stated I began convulsing and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head for 5-10 seconds. Upon regaining consciousness I was covered in sweat. After being assisted back to bed, I had nausea and headache with continued severe pain at injection site. I went to the ER around 6:45 AM since my severe headache, dizziness and nausea continued and to examine if I broke my nose in the fall. While in triage at the ER I experienced severe nausea and a second episode of fainting.

I fainted after trying to sit up, for maybe a few seconds, before coming to. Then proceeded with shaking and cold sweats through the night. Next day is better, but still body aches, fatigue and very small fever of 99.5

                                                At 1:17 PM, I received the vaccine. Around 1:30 PM I started itching and breaking out in hives. I did not say anything because I thought it was my eczema reacting to my nerves. I went home and felt fine for a while. Around 5:30 PM I told my husband my stomach hurt and I had a slight headache, and I was going to lie down. Around 8:30 PM I woke up. Around 11 PM I was feeling kind of light-headed but did not say anything to my husband because I just thought it was my thoughts. I went to bed. Around 3:45 AM I woke up feeling sick, went to bathroom in master bedroom and dry heaved. I returned to the bed from our bathroom, and told my husband I thought I was going to pass out. I have no recollection of the following events, this is information my husband (Brian) shared with me. He said I then stayed standing on the floor, laid my head over on my pillow, and started breathing heavily, and it became progressively heavier to where he stated I sounded like a &#34;wart hog.&#34; He said he jokingly said to me, &#34;Are you mutating,&#34; then I collapsed onto our bedroom floor. He said he got up immediately, was saying my name as he was walking to me, and I was not responding. He then got on the floor by me, and was rubbing me and trying to wake me, and it took about a minute before I came to. When I came to I was laying on our floor, keep in mind I feel approximately 5 feet as our bed sits 4 to 4.5 feet in the air, and I am 5&#39;8&#34;. I hit my hit on our floor, and when I came to I could barely hear him calling my name as there was a loud rushing noise like water in my head. It took about 2-3 minutes before the ringing was completely gone. I then had cold chills off and on for the next 24 hours with nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. On Tuesday following the initial encounter, I went to the ER due to nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and severe headache on right side of head. The ER doctor diagnosed me after a CT with a closed head injury that occurred at initial encounter, so Thursday around 4 AM.

FURTHERMORE I was administered DiphenhydrAMINE, Famotidine, solu-MEDROL at the Emergency Department. Those are just a few of what I received.

I rested all day then around 1 PM I got up and fainted. I woke up a moment later and had an intense ringing in my ears for several minutes. I felt fatigued the rest of the day.

The patient&#39;s medical history included depression. Products known to have been used by the patient, within two weeks prior to the event, included quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel) since 2014.  The patient received the first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 039K20A) on 12 Jan 2021. On 10 Feb 2021, approximately one day prior to the onset of the symptoms, the patient received the second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Batch number: 028L20A) for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.  On 10 Feb 2021, after receiving the second dose of the vaccine the patient, had experienced cardiac issues.  On 11 Feb 2021, the patient started experiencing chills and passed out for 40 seconds (secs). The patient had visited the emergency room (ER) and EKG (electrocardiogram) showed slight abnormality. She was given heart monitor for 14 days. She was scheduled for Stress test and Echo. She was on antipsychotic medications for seven years. She was curious whether the antipsychotic drugs caused the cardiac abnormalities in response to Covid-19 vaccine. Treatment information was not provided. The adverse event of passed out for 40 secs was assessed as medically significant.  The patient received both scheduled doses of mRNA-1273 prior to the events; therefore, action taken with the drug in response to the events was not applicable.  The outcome of the events chills and cardiac issues was unknown. Outcome of the event passed out for 40 secs was recovered on 11 Feb 2021.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the events, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I was very disoriented before it happened, I was freezing cold, aching, shooting pains, could hardly move or speak but got out the words, ?im not ok, I?m having a sever reaction? My husband said I then went into what he saw as a seizure.  Head throat, neck, back tensed- unconscious, unable to arrouse.  Lasted about a minute.  Where I lied unconscious and he didn?t think I was breathing.  30 seconds later I opened my eyes, but then had a similar but shorter episode 30 seconds and then was able to get me to come to.  He called 911, and they took me to hospital.  All vitals came back normal.  Blood pressure was on the low side.  I have no history of seizures.

I felt ok once wait time was up so I left.  I was driving approx 15 min later and (which was approx 30) after administration and pulled over to side of road due to getting chills and shaking and feeling faint.  Also, the left side of my face went numb and tingling.   I called for an ambulance and once they arrived I had started feeling normal again.  Facial tingling still persists at this time hours later.  I also had another sync opal episode once I got a ride home that resolved.  Left side of face feels like after being numb from a dentist.

                                                I started having minor body aches about six hours post vaccine. I woke up that night nauseous and dizzy. I passed out on the way to the kitchen to get water. My husband somehow heard me and helped me back to the bedroom where I passed out again. I was eventually able to get back in bed without passing out, though I couldn&#39;t get warm and had severe body aches for most of the night. It was like having a very high fever, only there was no fever. I was clammy, but no fever. Around 4:30 a.m. the &#39;non-fever&#39; broke and the chills and body aches stopped. I was extremely fatigued for the next two days and felt myself again by the third. The arm in which I received the shot hurt pretty bad Friday too but that was the least of my concerns.   I did not seek medical treatment for these symptoms.

                                                6 minutes after receiving vaccine patient reported that her tongue was starting to swell and that her heart was racing.  Staff called 911 immediately.  Pulse was 166-169, BP 125/88, O2 sat 97%.  No wheezing, and the patient was moving air and talking.  I had an epi-pen on hand but waited since patient was moving air and had such a high HR.  After a few minutes patient reported she felt better and that her tongue was still swollen but not any more so; HR 120s, O2 sat 97%.  EMTs arrived 10:39 a.m., got the same VS, and they decided not to give epinephrine.  Patient was initially reluctant to be transported by ambulance and intended to have sister drive her to ED.  However she reported her tongue was overlapping her teeth all the way around, and was persuaded to go by ambulance.  She walked out of public health clinic into ambulance.  She was treated with IV Benadryl and steroids.  The ED doctor diagnosed anaphylactic reaction but also did not give epinephrine due to tachycardia.  She felt better, but 4 hours afterward she did have a rebound reaction and was treated with more Benadryl and again felt better.  She was discharged from the ED with 2 epi-pens.  She currently feels well.  States that they are having her take PO Benadryl q 4 hours x 48 hours.  She was treated in the emergency department.

On 2/9 those symptoms subsided, but I started to get right-sided flank pain with pain on inhalation. I took acetaminophen and ibuprofen around the clock, used a heating pad on 2/9 and 2/10, but pain progressed.  Mid-day on 2/10 the pain was so severe, I went to urgent care. They said it was gastritis and released me. I went back 2 hours later and saw a different doctor. He diagnosed me with a pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and pleural effusion. I was sent by ambulance to the hospital and admitted. I was treated for pain and started on Eliquis. I was discharged the evening of 2/12. The morning of 2/13, I woke up with 100.6 F Temp and 85% O2 at. I went to urgent care again, they thought I had pneumonia and referred me to the hospital. I was admitted to a different hospital on 2/12 and continue to antibiotic s and a heparin drip

                                                Working full time during this post injecting time but 2days later sarted with nausea and vomiting and then itching and then next day asthma started to flare up and by the next day it developed into full blown exacerbation. As everything worsened and couldn&#39;t control anymore with inhaler and even tried nebulizer, I went to hospital. I went to ER that day on 2/17.  They did breathing treatments, several Blood tests,  chest xrays, Epi injection,  IV steroids and several other meds, oxygen,  and was admitted.  As it worsened I had to be intubated 3 different times, where I would get to point they thought could be weaned off and for a day or two and would be a little better and then would worsen again requiring me to be reintubated for a total of about 10 days on the ventilator.  During this time on vent second time I developed pneumonia, staph/MRSA, UTI.  After being put on vent 3rd time I had to be life flighted to bigger hospital ICU.  Then after a few days they were able to wean of ventilator but during which time I developed  laryngospasms.  I continued to improve with breathing but mentioned I had leg pain and the said probably due to low sodium and lack of mobility.  I was finally released on 3/5 and discharged home with home health but sent home in supplemental oxygen due to says dropping and poore tolerance without sitting O2 stay at hospital prior to DC home.   After getting home the next day or two right leg pain worsened along with breathing worsenining and HH sent me to PCP who discovered blood clots and sent me to local er, that day which was 3/8.  That hospital evaluated breathing issues and took blood work and chest xrays, started me on heparin drip and sepsis protocol and then called in life flight to send me to bigger ICU hospital within a few hours after arrival which they debated on ventilator or bipap but ended up on bipap and flown to hospital. There I was treated for breathing issues, infection, clot, vocal cord dysfunction from the multiple intubations then sent home when stable again with home health RN, PT, PT and ST. Also during all this hospital stay I was treated 4x for covid and all negative.  Then after coming home this last time on 3/13 i had 15-20lb with gain in a little over a week and in 3 of those last days almost 9lbs with abdominal distension and chest pain/ nausea/ dizziness/low BP but fluctuating high at times / high Hr, so referred back to PCP 3/23 who sent me to ER that day concerned of abd blessed,  kidney and or liver issues/sepsis/etc.  PCP sent to ER.  They did blood work and Abd CT and xray not showing anything and blood levels of liver slightly elevated, with blood in urine and so they said nothing of concern even though I went from looking normal to 6/7 months pregnant in less than a week.   Followed up with pulmonologist who said bases of lungs hypoventilated,  PFT very poor, wheezing and tight and WBC still up and gave me more steroids and asthma meds.  Went to urologist due to blood in urine and also having urinary retention. They advised me to self cath and I will follow up in 1 month to determine if they need to do more tests to look into it more.  PCP still concerned about these new abd. And other symptoms, and referring to specialists (cardiologist,  Gastrointerologist,  and Nephrologist) along with others already seeing too find the root of what are causing these new problems and if other organs are being affected with this whole immune response.   I work full time,  had 3 kids and works out with no limitations in my daily activities or ability to function, however since all this and being the hospital for pretty much most of laar month, the ongoing breathing issues (which I&#39;m still requiring O2 at home) and all the other medical issues and the physical weakness/ lack of cardiopulmonary endurance I am unable to work (on short term disability/FMLA) and limited to home with ability to do much at all.  Now I&#39;m left with decreased income and tons of medical bills to come which is very concerning in itself how I will even pay since i can&#39;t work right now,  but the most concerning is I&#39;m still in this waiting game to figure out why things are not improving that much and why these other symptoms are arising.  I have worked my whole life and love my work and my life and was trying to protect from this horrible virus by doing my part and getting vaccinated. But it seems that my life went from nothing wrong to one crazy medical reaction to another after this 2nd covid-19 19 moderna injection.

Sunday the pain went from the left side of my neck down to the base of my ribs and then progressed to include the back and chest almost constantly instead of just on inhalation.  I went to the ER on Sunday evening, assuming very bad costochondritis; however, was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in the left lung, areas of possible infarction, and pleurisy.  I had a CT scan at a Medical Center prior to receiving the Moderna vaccine for a suspected PE and it was negative.

All symptoms resolved in about 15 minutes with the exception of  numbness/tingling to tongue and lips which lasted 3 hours. Symptoms resolved on their own without treatment/medication other than lying flat with feet up and drinking a bottle of water. I was assessed by medical professionals at the vaccine clinic which was located inside of the hospital. I consulted with an ED physician but did not require any additional treatment.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; Sweating; Slow hands movement; nausea; Body aches; A spontaneous report was received from a consumer who was a 37-year-old, female patient, who received Moderna&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) and experienced nausea, sweating, body aches and anaphylactic reaction.   The patient&#39;s medical history included a previous anaphylactic reaction to her first Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.  .Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 30-DEC-2020,  the patient received their first of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 026L20A) and on 27-JAN-2021, prior to the onset of the events, the patient received their second of two planned doses of mRNA-1273 (Lot number: 012M20A) intramuscularly  for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection.   On 27-JAN-2021, after receiving the second dose of mRNA-1273, the patient reported that she experienced nausea, sweating, body aches, and an anaphylactic reaction that was characterized by slow hand movements and facial swelling.  The patient reported that she would see her doctor on 18-Feb-2021.   Treatment for the events were not reported.  The patient received both doses of mRNA-1273, therefore, action taken with the drug was not applicable.    The outcomes of the events, nausea, sweating, body aches and anaphylactic reaction, were unknown.; Reporter&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and temporal association between the use of the product and the start date of the event, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.

I continued to feel dizzy and my throat started to swell  up and had convulsions and had loss of consciousness. I also began to get hives on my chest, my throat was still swelling up which these symptoms continued over the next few hours. I went to the ER where they gave me an epi shot. I was admitted to the ICU where a kidney panel was performed and  Ialso had another event and they gave me another epi shot which my symptoms step down in intensity and was discharged home. I stayed one night in the hospital. For the next two weeks, I was still  having throat swell up, felt disoriented, was having mental fogginess and twitching.  Today I still experience some twitching, involuntary spasms but are in mild in intense.

The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below.     Concomitant products included LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM (SYNTHROID) and TOPIRAMATE (TOPAMAX) for an unknown indication.   On 04-Jan-2021, the patient received first dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, received second dose of mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular) dosage was changed to 1 dosage form. On 02-Feb-2021, the patient experienced TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia) and FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird). On 03-Feb-2021, the patient experienced DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma) and ASTHENIA (Could not get up). On 04-Feb-2021, the patient experienced CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg) and VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine). On 01-Mar-2021, the patient experienced DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg) (seriousness criterion medically significant). On an unknown date, the patient experienced HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low). At the time of the report, DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS (Venous thrombosis in her left leg/clot was in left leg), TACHYCARDIA (Severe Tachycardia/ Still very tachycardia), DYSPNOEA (Difficulty breathing), FEELING ABNORMAL (Felt a little weird), FATIGUE (Could not get up), ASTHMA (Asthma), CONTUSION (Bruise on her right and left leg), ASTHENIA (Could not get up), VACCINATION COMPLICATION (Had a reaction to the vaccine), HAEMOGLOBIN DECREASED (Hemoglobin decreased) and RED BLOOD CELL COUNT DECREASED (Red blood cells are low) outcome was unknown.      DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS (normal ranges are provided in parenthesis if available): In March 2021, Haemoglobin: low gram per litre (Low) LOW. In March 2021, Red blood cell count: low cells per microlitre (Low) LOW.     For mRNA-1273 (Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine) (Intramuscular), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Treatment informations reported were Levalbuterol tartrate  and Rivaroxaba 20 mg   This case was linked to MOD-2021-059897 (Patient Link).

                                                Today morning one of the employee at nursing home had a reaction to Covid vaccine. I or technician gave the shot to her around 9 am to 9:15 am this morning initially she had no reaction to shot but around 10:30 am ( by this timewe were at the another clinic ) She called the nurse who was with us and informed us that she is having dizziness and feeling weird (we asked her to measure the blood pressure the reading was 122/99) then she mentioned she Is feeling good butin next 2 minutes she fainted and fell and hit her head on countertop then they called 911. My last conversation related to this incident was she is diagnosed with low blood pressure and they will do other test to make sure she is fine.

When I came to -- &gt; my sight was blurry, I felt very nauseous, dizzy, light-headed and felt like I was going to pass out.  I ran to the kitchen and drank some water to try and calm it down, the sensation of passing out was still there with palpitations.  I called out to my roommate who called an ambulance.  My bp/hr were a  bit on the lower side initially when the EMTs got to my apt.  I was still feeling like I was going to pass out.  My labs, vs, and tests all came back WNL when I got to the ED and by that time, I had a severe migraine and nothing else.  From that night (Tuesday night 12/29) until the following Tuesday (1/5/21), I had a migraine, severe lethargy, body aches, and a swollen left armpit lymph node.

Spent a couple hours on a gurney being monitored. My blood pressure (normally low/normal) went up to 170/101. And my heart rate was in the 140s. My oxygen saturation at one point was 82% but I was not having any trouble breathing and was breathing normally. I had a terrible headache and was shaking uncontrollably for about 20 min. Eventually I felt well enough to go to work. About five hours after my shot, I passed out again. I was taken to emergency room. My blood pressure was high and my heart rate was still elevated. They ruled out anything being wrong and eventually sent me home. I had a migraine and fatigue for two days. I felt tired for two weeks. And everything that usually  hurts, hurt extra bad.

                                                I am 38 years old with no history of medical problems. I do NOT have a history of miscarriages and have one healthy child who is 22 months old.   On 1/13/21, I took a home pregnancy test which came back positive. At that time, I had a missed period but also had several common pregnancy symptoms such as bloating, acne, fatigue and tender breast. later that week, I called OB/Gyn and spoke to an RN to schedule my 8/9 week ultrasound and to inquiry about the vaccine during pregnancy since I had no clue whether it was recommended/safe or not. the RN, very confident and without any disclaimer, stated that hospital is recommending all of their pregnant patients to receive the vaccine. Obviously, I decided to trust this medical professional who was so confident in her response.  My normal pregnancy symptoms continued. On 1/19/21, I was 5 weeks pregnant and received my first dosage of the vaccine. felt fine other than a sore left arm. on 1/20/21, I woke up with a lot of abdominal cramping and pain. It was new to me but assumed it was normal. My cramping and pain continued until 1/21/21. On 1/21/21, I woke up without the cramping and pain. But, I also noticed that my breast were no longer tender and my skin had completely cleared up. I became concerned but prayed everything was fine since my home pregnancy test was still positive. On 1/22/21, by cramps continued once again but more mild. My pregnancy symptoms seemed as if they were no longer present but remained hopeful. On 1/23/21, I woke up with light spotting that only lasted through the morning. Soon after, I started having extreme abdominal pains. I prayed everything was fine. The pain continued and became worse. That night, the pain was so bad that I just went to bed. Right before going to bed, I noticed I had started spotting again. A little heavier than in the morning. I made sure to lay on my left side, hoping it was normal in pregnancy. On 1/24/21, I woke up with heavy bleeding and clotting. I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and blood test. I was told by the doctor at Hospital that I had a miscarriage.

By Wednesday she was complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year old little girl.

                                                Patient began experiencing pain and difficulty walking on Tuesday, March 23. Later that afternoon she was taken to an Urgent care, who sent her to the ER for evaluation. She was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in her leg, spanning from just above the knee to her groin area. They admitted her and began treating her with blood thinners.  While undergoing that treatment, her heart stopped 3 times and she had to be resuscitated. They discovered a pulmonary embolism.  While removing a large clot from her lungs, the doctor found that her lungs were riddled with hundreds of tiny blood clots. They also said that she was bleeding internally, very heavily, from an unknown location. In all, they gave her 20 units of blood, and none of it stayed in her veins. The doctor said it seemed to just disintegrate.  At that point, her brain and organs had begun shutting down and family made the decision to remove her from life support. She passed away Thursday evening, March 25, 2021.
